Last year I showed these slides to show that the artica calculus , which is almost three million years had the size of 48 , the United States continental 48 United States continental , it &apos;s retroying 40 percent .
But this underground the gravity of the problem because it &apos;s not exextension of the ice .
The artica ice ice ice is , in a way , the heart of global climate system .
It &apos;s expanded and retreat the summer .
The next slide is going to be a remarkable rapid reveness about the last 25 years .
The glaciers have been signed in red .
As you see , they go down to the blue dark blue .
That &apos;s the invern ice , which is the summer ice .
You can see that the costs of ice , five years or more , is like the blood , that &apos;s like the blood , that &apos;s like the blood , which is that there from the body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s spent from that , so .
This is a problem because the rewardness interests around the artic ocean where there are huge amounts of coal coal and , they &apos;re transformed into metaphor , they &apos;re transformed into meters .
And I &apos;m going to the total-warming of atmospheric pollution to global warming , that amount could doubling , overeign this point of not around .
In some of them , a little deep-founding in Alaska metane is already reboling from the water .
The professor Katey Walter at the University of Alaska was taken at the bottom of Alaska team , last winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You &apos;re good . The question is if we &apos;re also going to be it .
And this is that exchange termal exchange the Grow from the north .
This is a river at the regimes .
And the carried had never reached you .
This is the Kangerlussuaims , in the southwest of Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level for the shoulder on the shoulder on the ground , here is where it &apos;s reaching the sea .
These currents are increasing rapidly .
On the other side of the planet : Antarctica , the biggest block of the planet .
Last month , the scientists have told that the balance of ice is in negative , and the Western Antarctica , which pogy on some submarine , which is particularly related with the sun , is particularly reiquire in the soulder .
It &apos;s about six feet of the sea level , like in Grodia .
Himalaya , the third largest block of ice , you see new lakes , which a few years ago , a few years ago they were glaciers .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population revenue of the water from that .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the power of this city .
The brought it is increased .
It &apos;s even when it decreates , the same same happens to the water .
In California , the snow on the Sierra Nevada is declined of 40 percent .
The hyriries are in crisis .
The predictions , like you read , they &apos;re grasses .
The growing safety of safety in the world leads to a remarkable increase .
The disaster environmental disaster are increasing out of the normal and previous .
Four times more numerous in the last 30 years than 75 .
This is a unsustainable and all of the unsustainable .
If you look at it in the historian context that you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the world , the area of the Eastern Pacific , the Americans , and on both of the subcontinent , where there is a root root of oxygen in the ocean .
The greatest causes of global warming , with deforestation , which is the use of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two more emissions , with China .
And he was going to build a lot of other central coal .
But we &apos;re seeing a change of direction .
These are the projects annullated projects in the last years and some alternative proposes .
So , in the way , there &apos;s a fighting politics in our country .
The industrial and coal oil has spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote coal coal , which is a bone .
That picture me would remember something --
Verice , in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion litri wasters of coal fourers .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen it on the news .
This is the second big flusband of the flow of flow in America .
It &apos;s happened around Natale .
The advertising advertising one of the coal industrial .
Video : See , you know , ♫ ♫ Frosty the carbon .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it &apos;s growing our economy .
It &apos;s a lot more cleaner is more cleaner .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and workers keep the workers keep the faspend .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest society is Massey Coal . This is the Massey Coal . This is its administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I &apos;m going to be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Peloses , Harry Reid -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Protection of Clima has launched two campaigning .
This is one of them , a part .
Video : Attore : ALergy we see climate change as a threat at our business .
So , our priority is to invest a big amount of money in a public effort to make public and confused the coal truth on coal .
Actually , coal is not spork .
We think it &apos;s cleaned -- it &apos;s also a good profumo .
So you don &apos;t prefer about climate change .
Let me go .
Video : Attore : Carbone -- you heard it very much .
So let &apos;s do a turn around a structure at the avanguard of the wiring of the coal coal .
Straordinarily ! The machines are a little noise , but this is the sound of the pulit technology of the pulit coal technology .
The coal consumer is between the major causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology that you see changed everything .
You have to look at this : this is the odien technology of clean .
Al Gore : Well , the positive alternative is connected to economics and the national security .
Video : America is in crisis , the national security , climate crisis .
The filter that connects them , our dependence from fossil fuels , like coal and oil and oil .
Now , though , there &apos;s a new , audacy solution for them .
Really , 100 percent cleaning energy , in 10 years .
A plan to remit America to make us more safe , and help stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that drinks to solve our problems .
Really America . Scoprite more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It &apos;s about reating energy to America .
One of the faster ways of getting to dependence from the fuel that kills our planet .
Comparsa : The future is here . Vent , a new energy network .
Compone-two : New investments for jobs very well retributed .
Complplplan : Really , it &apos;s time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old lunch Africans say , &quot; If you want to go fast , go from the way .
If you want to go away , you go along , you know . &quot;
We have to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED I did a introduction on LHC .
And promising to go back to the back you how the machine works .
So I started here . And the ones that the other time there were , the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever attempt -- 27 kilometers of circence .
His task is to reach the conditions that were less than a billion more than a billion second from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
That &apos;s all this is just ambitious .
This is the machine under Ginevra .
And I &apos;d like these mini-Big Bang in the refer .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- it &apos;s largely 44 feet and has a diameter diameter of 22 feet .
This is an ATLATLAS in construction so you can see the proportions .
The 10 of the September last year we have accesus the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLATLAS .
It was because of immense fespan in the room .
It &apos;s a picture of particle that had done all the around of the LHC , and going into the collision , deliberately , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles inside the releving releving .
In other words , when we saw that the 10 industry , we realized that the machine worked , which is a great victory .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to make us exulating more or this , when somebody went on Google and saw that the initial page was this .
That means we have had a cultural impact beyond that scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , we had to these filters here -- these dories .
These files 13,000 ampes when the machine works at the very much of the power .
Now , the technicians between you will look at the filters and they will say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . I &apos;m too much wiring . &quot;
And they can do it because when they &apos;re very cold of become the costs of substantial superconducucucucucucucucuck .
So , at less 271 degrees , at less temperature at that space between the stars , these files can bring that current .
In one of the giguntures between the most new magnetic magnetworks in the LHC , there was a defect of factory .
So the films surrounded up , and the 13,000 ampampers had a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magnees weight more than these are moving over 20 tons , and they moved about 30 centimetmeters .
They &apos;re damaged about 50 magnetworks .
We had to take them , what we did .
We &apos;ve reinted them and wandstands .
They &apos;re now going back to all the underground .
I &apos;m going to go back the LHC will be new integrated .
We &apos;re going to go , and we expect to judggggglue , and continuing our adventure to find out what the universe is .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents , these crashes the value of science and the engineering of frontier .
I think that &apos;s so difficult , the fact to go beyond the limits , I think this is the value of things like LHC .
I &apos;d like to conclude with the words of a Inglese Inglad , Humphrey , which , I imagine , in defense of inutilize and his cleaned , his clean was Michael Faday , he said , &quot; No is a dangerous dangerous for human mind as the progress of the human mind as the mind as the ideas of science as the ideas of science , which is the complete , which is complete in the triumbling of our , and that we don &apos;t have to have to have to have to be able . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start asking for rethink about when you , you &apos;re playing with children , playing with the morning .
As you could get them and get them , and get them and get them , and you learn them , and you learn how to think and solve problems and resolling relationships .
The space argument is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , by the useful inspired by the useful of our interaction with physical objects , with my consultant Pact , and the collaborator Kalithi , and I started asking , &quot; And if we &apos;re using a computer , instead of having the only one computer , instead of having the only cursor of mouse as a digital cursongs that we can move through a desknee , we could have defairly deflying with both hands with both hands ,
and fix it ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a big interactive computer as a biscan .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a big interactive computer as a biscan .
You can see them , you can see them , &quot; they can see &quot; between them , feel the motion and have a screen and radio wireless .
But mostly , they &apos;re physical objects , like the brand the morning , you can move them just sweet them .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physicists , aware of the motion , of the other , and as they become more physicists , aware of the motion , of the other , how we can to do it , we can explore new and fun styles of interaction .
I &apos;ll start with some simple example .
This Siftargument is to show video : if you start it in a direction , the video will rotate it so , if you &apos;re going to rotate on the other side back .
These interactive portraits are confident .
If you can do it , they &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re around .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they &apos;ll agree , they can act a little bit .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they &apos;ll agree , they can act a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was that we could use common on data , to use it in the data , to just put a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configured like you to make a sweet , and I can use them to use them to the central color , where they &apos;re going to get them .
and I can use them to use them to the central color , where they &apos;re going to get them .
We can get too , we can put a little bit of it .
I &apos;m also a beautiful chance of learning , like the languages , the mathematand games of logic where people can try things fast , and see the results of things fast , and see the results of things fast .
Now I &apos;m --
This is a sequence of Fibonacks that I do with a equations .
Here we have a game of words that is in half of Scarabeer and Boggle .
Basically , at every turn-time letter , you had a letter to every Turn , you had a letter to every turn Siftable on every time on Siftable , and while you &apos;re trying to understand him .
And then , after about 30 seconds remelt , and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
So here &apos;s the kids coming in in the Media Lab , I did so that I tried them and I went around a video .
They were very much pleasant .
And one of the interesting things that kind of applied is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
You just have to say , &quot; How words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s other people who try it .
This is our beta young tester , there on the right .
It was actually wanted to implpilars them .
They were only only the morning morning , for him .
Now , this is an applied of a interactive cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool for learning . He &apos;s Felix . He &apos;s Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , lifest-associated with them .
It can put new characters in the scene , lifest-associated with them .
So , it &apos;s doing it &apos;s going to go out .
Video : The sun is surprising .
David Merrill : Now it took a treatment in the scene .
Video : The aranchor treatment .
Books ! Yeah !
So you get the Siftable and put them close them can make the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing your story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide him how you get them .
DM : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide him how you get them .
Vola : Vola , throws , cat .
DM : The last example that I have time to show you is a tool , made of recent , to do music .
It &apos;s a tool , I made of recent , to sampling music .
The Siftable here are these sounds like the bottom and the battery .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can use it .
You can also put these sounds on a sequence of your pleasure .
And it just by doing it just touch a sound , &quot; and a sequence . &quot;
These are actually you can control from the vivivive , like the reverse and the filter .
It &apos;s acks that particularly a sound and then incline for a bunch .
And then there are general , as time and volume , that you &apos;re appapplied to the whole sequence .
We &apos;re going to look like it works .
Video : We &apos;re going to start with a base in two Siftolling &quot; sequence , &quot; we go into a series , we extended up , we extended up , we add base .
Now , I &apos;m going to put a low-line .
Video : I &apos;m going to add percussions --
Video : And I &apos;m going to put the video video video , so I can control the effect from the vial effect .
Video : I can revelocize the whole sequence of inclining over time from one side or the other side .
Video : I &apos;m going to add the bottom to the bottom to give more expression .
Video : I can reduce the sequence of the flying flight .
I didn &apos;t have to plan this first , but I can improvise , making it a long faller or more corta .
And now , I can smoking the whole sequence of inclining the Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new human human interfaces and more more more more more more more like how our brain work .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some possibilities that we &apos;re trying to get out of the lab .
The concept that I want to transmit is that we &apos;re coming this new generation of objects to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;m not going to talk to all of you .
I &apos;m a writer .
I &apos;m books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the fascoin my life .
And I &apos;m not what it can change .
But , I said this , something particular happened recently in my life and my career , which led me to re-up the entire relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called &quot; Mangia , &quot; Prega , &quot; which , diversously , from my previous books , for some reason , in the world and became a big senses , and then interacted .
And the result is that everywhere now , people treatment .
It &apos;s true -- conducted , conducted .
They &apos;re all me now , and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t fear to do it ?
You don &apos;t fear to write all the life without being able to write all life without being able to create a book that can matter somebody ? &quot;
that can matter somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s reassuring , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a scritual -- I was a written -- I was a written .
I &apos;m going to go on the same reaction .
And people say , &quot; Don &apos;t I fear to do it ?
You don &apos;t fear that the umiliation of refident you ?
You have no fear to do this mestimates all the life without anything that it &apos;s ever out and daming on a cumb of dreams with the mouth of failure ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer is , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
Yeah , I fear of all those things .
I &apos;ve always had fear .
And I also fear of many other things that people can &apos;t even even even .
How the algagagae and other things .
But , as I write what I thought and I was asking myself , and I ask ask me , why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logic that anyone who &apos;s weak to expect to be frightened by a job that it &apos;s sent to do .
But what is there is so particularly in the creative companies that they can make us nervous about the mental health health as as other carefully do they don &apos;t do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don &apos;t remember one only once in his 40 years of activity when he was asked if it fear to be engineer ?
It was not -- that block of the engineer John , how do it ?
It didn &apos;t work that , you know ?
Onestly , chemicals are not certainly , in the toys , the reputation of being allowed maniacated by being allowed maniacated by depressional depressed .
We have this reputation , we have enough this reputation , and not just a writer , but creative instables , we have this reputation of being enormous instables .
And it &apos;s not the other that you &apos;re looking at the sad of the people of the creative minds that , only in the twentieth century , they &apos;re going to die and often .
And the ones that don &apos;t have suicked to be really disfacts from them .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , &quot; Every little bit more . A fascinating , &quot; A extraordinary affermation about their life .
But we don &apos;t throw it when we feel that , because we &apos;ve heard these things so long that we have completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are somehow connected and the suffering are somehow connected and that art , at the end , and that art , at the end , and then , it will always conduration to corosect it .
And the question I want to ask you all over here is : Would you agree with this idea ?
It &apos;s all good for you -- because it &apos;s also looking at it from a centimeter to me doesn &apos;t work for anything that support me .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I also think it &apos;s dangerous , and I don &apos;t want to see it in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our big creative minds to live .
And I know that , in my case -- in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to the feeling of a stumping story , overeign of a lot of circumstances where I &apos;m in my career .
That &apos;s true -- you know , I &apos;m quite young , I &apos;m a couple of a 40 years .
I have even about four work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything I &apos;m going to write about it right now , and then it &apos;s going to be right from the world as he came out after the spectacked success of my last book .
I &apos;m going to be slavor , because we &apos;re all more or less friends here -- is likely that my greatest success is in my own own .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to blow nine in morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would keep going to keep doing this work that we do this work that we do .
So , the question is , how do it , how do it ?
And so it seems to me , after many thinking , after many thinking about to work to continue to write is that to create a real psychological construct , right ?
I &apos;m going to find a safety distance between me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxiety of which reaction that I wrote , and I was trying to do this for this last year , looking for all last year , trying to find other societies to see if they could have better ideas and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and healthy ideas and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and how much more and other societies and the way
how to help people manage to manage the emotions of creativity .
And that research has taken me to ancient Grecia and ancient Rome .
You can do it because it comes back to circle and then it goes back .
In the ancient Grecia and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
It was thinking that creativity was this spirit looks like the spirit and that sell men from a few distant and unknown , for distant and unknown , for distant and unknown .
The Greeks called these spirits of the deployment of creativity .
Socrate , wonderful , he believed that they had to have a demon that elargive sent wisdom away .
Romans were the same idea , but they called that kind of spirit without a genius .
which is great , because the Romans didn &apos;t think that a genius was somebody who were particularly intelligent .
They believed that a genius was this kind of devin that had lived in literally in the walls of a artist , a little like the electric phal , and it came out of the work and the way out of that work and the respect the outcome of that work .
Here &apos;s an extra -- that &apos;s the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological constructed that you protect from your job of your work .
And everybody knew it was so that it worked , right ?
So , antic artists were protected by certain things , like , the too narcism , right ?
If your job was exceptional , you couldn &apos;t take it and all the deserved , everybody knew that you were helped by this genius .
If your job fails , it wasn &apos;t all your job , you know ?
They all knew that was your genius to be a unable .
And so people have a creativity of time .
And then the Rince came and everything came and changed , and it changed this big idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe over all of the universe over the center of the universe over the mysters and so much .
This was the principle of the rational principle and people started thinking that creativity came out of idivide .
And for the first time in history , you start to get this or that artist , as a rather than a genius that artist , a person with the genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big error .
I think it &apos;s going to allow somebody , a simple person to believe that they &apos;re like a recient recient , the essence and the source of all the divine mysters , creative , unknown and ununknown and a responsibility for a pypppping , ununseen and a lot of the pyppppitch that human .
It &apos;s how to ask somebody of ingod the sun .
It &apos;s detax and it completely details and it makes all these expectations on performance .
And I think it was that that I &apos;m destroying the artists in the passed 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think that is , the question is , and now ?
Can we do it differently ?
Maybe you go back to a more ancient understanding of human relationship and mystery .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can &apos;t excelling 500 years of rational thinking about 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience who would only read them scientific suspects on the notion of , they do , they do people follow them , they do people do fit on their projects .
It probably won &apos;t really convinced you all about this .
But the question I want to ask is , why do it ?
Why don &apos;t you think about this way ?
Because it has more sense of everything that has ever heard to explain the exasperating imprevedibility of the creative process .
A process that , as anyone ever attempted to do something -- so , basically , all of here -- you know , you don &apos;t related .
And , in fact , it can sometimes look completely paranormess .
I &apos;ve done this recently , with the extraordinary poetry of Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but it was a poetry for all life and said that during the Virginia , working out in the Virginia , working out in the rural Virginia , when a poem came from the landscape .
He said he was like a fragorous frageous .
And that was rotating towards her .
It was going to be , because it was a tremendous one of the Earth under his feet .
He knew that point and he knew that point and he was , words , &quot; to run like a match . &quot;
And he was going to house and it was followed by this poem , and it wouldn &apos;t have to make another piece of paper and a math hit , and a match , and it was going to pick it up and get it up on the page .
Other time he couldn &apos;t get fast enough , so correcal and correcrect and correcrect without getting it to go home and her lost and she was going to continued to rotate through the landscape , trying to rotate through the landscape , trying to , as she said , &quot; An her , &quot; another few few . &quot;
And then there were those times -- this is not the size , I &apos;m going to never forget it -- there were almost losing , right ?
So , he was running home and he was trying to card and poem the passed through , and he said , that he was going , and then he said , that it was going , and then he said , that it was like you &apos;d put up with the other hand and the career .
It was going to be a poem from the tail and refit in his body and transmitter on the page .
And in these cases , poem would be presented on the perfect page , but the contrary , from the last word to the first word .
So when I felt it -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly the same same as a creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conducucucucucucucture .
I &apos;m a mulo , and my way to work is , and I can see it the same orary every day and work and go over and go over the goffly .
But even I , in my tungarily , I &apos;m strike against that thing , sometimes .
And I guess a lot of you have the han done .
You know , even if the work and ideas came to me from a certain source of them , I could not be able to know it .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it it , how can &apos;t do you lose your head , but , rather , that &apos;s what do you do to do ?
And I think , the best example of contemporary , which I have is the musician Tom Waits , which I interviewed in a journal .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the major part of life was the incarnation of the same tory artist , trying to control , management , to ask , to ask these species of impulses creativity .
But then he invecked , he hot , he hot , and he was driving on a highway in Los Angeles , he changed all for him .
He was going to be fast and it all of a little bit of a sat this little framework , which comes in in his head as inspiration , and it &apos;s a lot of it , and the desider , and the desidera , but it doesn &apos;t know how to take it .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , it has no match , it has no recorder .
So it starts to feel this kind of old anxiety , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to get down , and I &apos;m going to lose ,
I &apos;m not enough , I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to the panic , he stopped .
He put the whole whole whole whole whole whole new process .
He just looked at the sky and said , &quot; Speaking , don &apos;t see what am I going to drive ? &quot;
&quot; Do you think it can write a song now ?
If you really want to exist , it &apos;s a bit more , when I can take care of you .
Altrain , you &apos;re going to care about someone else today .
You can disturbing Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his work process changed after this .
Not the job , the job was still dark as always as .
But the process , and the fish that was removed that was left when the genius , the genius that was , the genius that came out of him was , and they went back to the nurture where it was , doing that it didn &apos;t have to be a thing thing interorized and forgotten .
But it &apos;s a lot of this peculiar , a conversation between Tom and this thing that straight and outside that but it was not Tom .
So how I felt that story that story started to change a little bit , the way I worked and already and saved me once .
This idea , I &apos;d save me when I was writing , &quot; Prega , &quot; and fall in one of those cave dispersation where we &apos;re all working on something and we &apos;re all working on something and we can &apos;t do , and we can start thinking that it &apos;s a disaster , which is the worst book .
Not just bad , the worst book wrote .
And I started thinking about to throw this project .
But then I remember from Tom that he was talking to the air and I tried .
So I got my face on on the manoscriticized and I becoming my comments to a vacuum angle of the room .
And I said to high , &quot; Sit , what , both of these know , if this book is not going to be brilliant , I &apos;m not going to be a little bit ?
Because I &apos;m going to see , I &apos;m putting all that I have , I have no more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to introduce you and do your side .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , I don &apos;t do it .
I &apos;ll just talk to write the same because it &apos;s my job .
And I &apos;d like to be recorded that I was presented to me to do my part , &quot; because -- eventually , that &apos;s like , OK -- centuries , people were going to be unknown for the dances of moon , dances and the sacred people going on hours and just went on hours and hours .
And they were always magnifigures , because the ballerers were great professionals .
But every time , he was a little , something happened , and one of these artists became reality .
And I know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know you have seen , at some point , a certain point , a performance .
It was like the time , it was like the time , and the drinkle walked through a kind of portal and it was not something else that &apos;s all that was going to be able to do anything that .
And all of a sudden , it &apos;s just like a human .
But it &apos;s going to go from the divinity fire .
And when this was , the time , people knew what it was , people knew what they called it .
They were told the hands and started to sing , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , God , God , God , God , &quot; God , &quot; God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
I mean , I &apos;m notice that -- when Morders invasing the south of the Souseholds , preserved with them and the ready and the ready to be , and the ready to be &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , &quot; Ole , &quot; you can still hear in the corries or flamenco .
In Spagna , when a artist has made something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , and the wonderful , and I &apos;m a great , brave , &quot; uncomfortable , &quot; uncompreable , this is a fairly unlike .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes next day , for the dancer , when you wake up and find that are the 11 in the morning of Martedesday and the last last of God there is no more .
It &apos;s just a dead , with a lot of sevil , and maybe it can &apos;t be able to each other than each one .
And maybe no one will do the name of God , while it &apos;s going to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most sweapons to do in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so cordant if you can &apos;t believe , advanced , that the most extraordinary aspects of your being being .
But it just makes you get data that you &apos;re in the prestired by a unimaginable source of this team of your life that team you have to go to someone else when you &apos;re finished .
And , you know , if we think that &apos;s all about it changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s certainly like that I thought for different months in the working of the book that public public book . I &apos;m going to soon soon , the dangerous , and I &apos;m going to do presence , and we &apos;ve been doing it .
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel electrized by this is , I don &apos;t fear .
Not fit down . It &apos;s just your job .
It &apos;s going to tell you for your side , any can be .
If your job is dance , you know , you know , you know ,
If the divine , they get genius to let me just take some kind of wonderful , for a time , for a single time , just through your efforts , then , &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Otherwise , you do the same dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot; to you the same .
I think and I think it &apos;s to teach it .
&quot; Wle ! &quot; &quot; It &apos;s just for having a human love and testablishine tals to make you introduce you to a continually presently .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can mean and the discovery of new set .
Now we &apos;re starting a new perspective : we &apos;ve started to digitize biology and now we &apos;re going to start with that digital code , we &apos;re going into a new phase of biology , designing and synthesizing .
We &apos;ve always tried to take big questions .
&quot; What &apos;s life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists , I think they have tried to understand various levels .
We &apos;ve tried different approaches , reducing it to the minimum .
We &apos;re going to be digitizing by 20 years ever .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the analogy of the biology world .
Now , we can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome between those that can self-oreplicate in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome to create a little bit more .
We &apos;re able to eliminate a hundred genes of the about 500 that are here .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our .
It &apos;s simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one one at the time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this can bring into a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to design is synthesizing this chromosome that chromosome is to change the components to take some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of &quot; Can we do a cromosome ? &quot;
Can the chemistry constained these big molecules that we &apos;ve never had to create before ?
And , in case , we can make a cromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemical material inhert .
The speed with which we &apos;re able to digitize life is growing at exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , of designs , but it &apos;s going to be better .
And our most recent results the results on a curve .
We started more than we started 15 years ago .
And the process has required a lot of passages , starting with a bioethical review before .
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that producing little segments , the long of 30 to 50 letters and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the most mistaff are long , more errors .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments and correct the errors .
And this was our first attempting , to start with digital information genome of Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , we &apos;ve designed the correction of the errors and get a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this chemistry of chemical material inhert and we put it into bacteria , they started reading this genetic code and produce viral particles .
The viral particles are then rereleased by cells , they come back and they &apos;re destroy .
I talked about recently with the time of the oil industry and say they were , they going to have to understand this model .
They have more than you .
We think this is a situation where the software can actually build its hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things bigger .
We wanted to build the entire chromosome .
I &apos;m more than 580 thousand genetic code .
So we thought we &apos;re building it in casses of the virus , so that we can change the cassette to understand what the components are the living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard was of a mistake for every 10 mixing .
We found it , resequenced it , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence never would do it work .
A part of the process is to design segments 50 letters that overwhelming sovers with all the other segments of 50 letters to build smaller little little bit of 50 to build smaller little little bit of 50 to build smaller underneath the work together .
We &apos;re going to take a unic elements here .
You &apos;ve probably read that we put the fighting fighting .
Think it this : we have a genetic code based on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters together , they put up about 20 amminds , and there &apos;s a specific order to letters for every amminds of them .
So we can use the genetic code to write , frasy , a thoughts .
What we did at the beginning was self-reating it .
Some have been deluser that was not poem .
We designed these segments to make them just join with enzymes .
There are me that they repair them and put them together .
And we started assembling of parts , starting with the sibles from five to seven mix them , unendles so to form that we have a segments of 24 mile to 72 , letters to 72 to the letters .
And we &apos;re going to take these segments in ababundance , so that we could sequencing them , because we &apos;re trying to create a very robust -- like you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems the tables of a basket player .
When we get these very long segments , more than 100 bases , more than 100 , they &apos;re not going to grow more directly than the Ecles .
It &apos;s coming to the modern biology molecular biology .
So we &apos;ve looked at other mechanisms .
We knew another mechanism called the reomologist called the &quot; omologist , which is useful to repair DNA to refer the DNA that can join the segments .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinoccurred , it can absorb three million radiation .
You can see in high fairly fit as his chromosome is destroome .
In 12 -- 24 hours it &apos;s reassembly as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be completely dying .
They can live under empty .
It &apos;s absolutely sure that life in space , and it &apos;s all about the way to find new environments .
And it &apos;s the NASA showed that this is happening .
This is a picture of molecule that we built using these processes , just using the lieventually design of segments to put it .
The hell them automatically assemble .
This picture was not taken with a electronic microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It &apos;s a very big molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that they cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the publisher that we &apos;ve done a long time ago .
I &apos;m more than 580,000 letters .
It &apos;s the biggest molecule structure ever created by the man .
It has a higher weight molecular weight .
If we &apos;re going to do it with a carat 10 without spaces , you &apos;d like 142 pages only to transtransform this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ? How can we do it ?
Of course , you know , a virus is a game from kids .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s simpler even when it comes from eucarily cells as our : you can just get the nuclear and put another , which is basically the process of cloning .
In battery , the chromosome is instead of integrated inside the cell , but we recently demonstrated that we &apos;re able to do a complete trapial trapished by a cell trapished and accomplished it .
We can have a chromosome parting from a microbial cromosome .
The two are different than men from mice .
We &apos;ve added some gene more , so we can decide which to choose this chromosome .
He has then skiing with the enzymes so that you can kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was raped -- and you &apos;re appreciate our graph , the new chromosome is gone inside the cell .
And we were started that we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to get ourselves more than we have to get more in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that tantissir have added a second or a third chromosome from some part , and I &apos;m going to one second thousands of new traits to that species .
So those people think about evolution as a gene once you change , it doesn &apos;t understand much much part of the biology .
There &apos;s a enzymes called &quot; restrition of restrition that they even digest DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell , you know , it &apos;s not a one .
The cell phone a--- the chromosome that we have put it up .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other chromosome as a material extraneum , and we found with only the cell and the new chromosome .
It &apos;s got blue because of the genes we put it .
And in a short lash of time , all the characteristics of a species , they went lost all over a new species , based on the new software that we put in the cell .
All the proteins have changed , members have changed , and when we read the genetic code exactly what we &apos;ve got you .
Now , this may seem to be genetic alchemy , but by by going to look at the stuff quite substantial .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that this is not about genesis -- but progress from three million years and a half years of evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion Cambrian explosion this process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty obvious when we think about our need .
We &apos;re going to go from six and a half billion in the next 40 years .
It &apos;s just for example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one in 1946 ; in 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medicine and wealth for six and a half billion people .
It &apos;s going to be even more to do it for nine billion .
We &apos;re going to use more than five billion coal-coal , more than 30 billion barrels .
That means 100 million barrels a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replace them , it &apos;s a huge challenge .
We have to understand all of the CO2 emission from these materials that end up in the atmosphere .
In today , thank you to the scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the design future .
The electronic industry has only only a dozen about components , and think about how many different things have come out .
Our limitations are here are data that we have principle data and our imagination .
We now have some techniques , because of these methods of these synthesization , and able to create what we call genomics , and we have this .
We can build a big robot robot that can produce a big chromosomes a day .
Think of the 20 million different genes or trying to optimize the processes to produce optimize the processes , new vaccines , we can change , we can change , change , we can change , and create more molecular biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , production or fuel production or fuels , production of vaccines .
This is a few software instant ant : A few software programmed that we &apos;re working to be able to seat and design species to do this .
Well , we don &apos;t necessarily know how they &apos;ll be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
We &apos;re focusing on fourth generation coal .
You also saw himself that extract hit from the grain was an experiment .
We have depending on the third generation and third generation that will use enough to be soon soon at the higher than they &apos;re going to get more high coal as a doctor or different butanol .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increasing the cost of food and limestone that we have to turn the CO2 in matter before , so we &apos;re working to design cells that can achieve this purpose , and we &apos;re working to design cells that can achieve the first coal coal , in about 18 months .
The solar combined with CO2 is a metodog -- but in our discoveries all over the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It &apos;s going to the deep ocean , about 2,500 feet deeply deeply on the ocean temperature .
It creates metane by using molecular hydrogen as a molecular hydrogen as source .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can incanaling CO2 , which can easily transported by toubbbes , convert that CO2 in coal , to drive this process .
So , we might think that we could be able to increase what the question is what life is , &quot; what &apos;s life is , we , versus -- we have the modest goal to replace the entire oil industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can you do it ?
It would be a major source source of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working for using the same methods to create instantaneously vaccines .
You saw this year with flu , we &apos;re always forth of a year and with a dollar in less when it comes to the vaccine .
I think it can change this combinable vaccines in anticipe .
So , this is how the future may start looking , now , the tree of evolution , accelling the evolution with synthetic bacteria , arches , archatheists , and then then eucarily cells .
We &apos;re so much of improving people .
Our purpose is to do a way to live enough long to try to make it it . Thank you very much .
So , first I &apos;ll just show you , the faster , some fundamental work , the new technology that we took Microsoft in follow a child . This is Seadragon . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s a environment where you can interact is local level that remode with a huge amount of visual data .
So we &apos;re seeing a lot of digital pictures of digital pictures with a kind of digital photos with a kind of fastly , and continuous , for a quick panoramic fastly , despite images like .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these crops are these data or images .
Most of them are the digital photographs , but this is a provenient that &apos;s a provenient scanning of Congress , and reentry in the gamma gamma .
It doesn &apos;t make a difference because the only thing that limits the prestations of a system like this is the number of plying on your screen anywhere . It &apos;s also a very flessible architecture .
This is a book all the whole , example of data doesn &apos;t have images .
This is the Dickens of Dickens . Every colonna represents a chapter .
To show you that it &apos;s just about text and not about pictures , we can do something like that , to do really do that , to do really do that it &apos;s about a real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a electronic book .
I don &apos;t advisly .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s a number of The Guardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading the real carrone-to-to-to-to-to-a-half tepler .
We also have something with the corner of this number in particular number of the Guardian .
We &apos;ve created a high-resolution adolder ads -- much higher than what you use in a normal publishers -- and we put you in the content of the content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the space limits of space on the screen .
We hope that means that we put people up and then the people and the other porcheries , not have to be a little bit more to do .
Of course , mapping is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this field I don &apos;t want to lose time , if I don &apos;t mean that we have to give you even in this field .
These are all the streets in the Sovrappy above a geospace of NASA .
So now we &apos;re going to go to something else .
This is now , you live on the web ; you can go and see it .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which fighting two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research that was very interesting on the Noah Snavely , a student of Washington , with the help of Steve Seitz . Seitz of Rick Szeliki Rick Szelch . A great collaboration .
And it &apos;s from the well-management , the management of Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from one image to the other kind of experience of experience that we have this kind of experience to multiple resolution .
But the space space spacectively pictures here has actually a meaning .
The algorithms of the computer had been recorded these pictures together , so that they correspond to the real places where the imagining -- all close to the lakes -- all close to the lakes the Grasands of the Montagne Roccies -- they &apos;re taken .
I &apos;m not sure if I have time I &apos;ll show you some other environment .
There are a lot more space .
I want to go directly to one of the Noah-data set of Noah--- and this is coming from a previously prototosynth that we &apos;ve done for the first time the summer -- to show you what I think is really the key behind this technology , Photosynth -- and it &apos;s not necessarily evidence that we have in the website . And it &apos;s not necessarily evidence that we have put in the website .
We had to worry about the legal aspects and so forth .
This is a reconstruction of Nothree Damond &apos;s reconstruction of Nothree Damond Flickr . Bauct you Nobody Din Flickr and you get images of these campus and so on . Oach of these campus and so forth . So you get a picture that &apos;s discovery of this model .
So they &apos;re all pictures taken from Flickr and they were all connected to space .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this very simple way .
You know , I &apos;d never thought to end up working for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifying to get this kind of accounts here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of phones that are a lot of different types of phones that SLR , a significant number , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to try and those more strange .
Many are blocks by faces , etc .
Somewhere you have a series of photographs -- it &apos;s a series of photographs -- it .
This is a Nothree Dame recorded correctly .
We can go from the poster physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with the social environment . This is taking data from the whole whole collective memory of how you appear the Earth appearing , from visual point of view -- and connects all that data together .
All those pictures become connected together , more than the sum of the parts .
You have a model of the entire land that emerges .
Think about this as the prolder Stephen Lawawler &apos;s work .
It &apos;s something that grows in complex complex as as people use it , and the whose advantages for who are using it , and use it .
Their pictures are marced with metaphors with other people .
If someone is the idea of contrast , you know , my picture of the name , my picture of Nobody cattedge , my picture of Nobody .
Of course , a consequence of all that are virtual models of all interesting , the things that are very interesting virtual models and satellite images and similar , but from the collective memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I have realized that ? What your software will be able to do is that at some point , in the next years , all the photographs of the world , all the photographs that we &apos;re all all the time ?
BAA : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is doing is basically to find .
It &apos;s about hyperlink , if you want , you &apos;re going to get , between pictures .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the pictures .
What &apos;s it becomes very interesting if you think about wealth of seant information that many of these pictures have .
As you do a research research of the web , you get a sentence and the text on the web is that &apos;s where it &apos;s the web has a lot of information to the pictures of the pictures .
Now , what happens if that picture is connecting all your picture ?
So the amount of seant interconnection and the amount of wealth that it is really enormous . It &apos;s a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the pleasant pleasant pleasant , when you travel and one of the ethnic research is the way to live between who has no forgotten the old traditions , among the well-hads , it hits the hits the well-wide , the guessed in the willing , the guice , it &apos;s in the well-wide , the guesses of the pleasant pleasant pleasant , and one of the well-wide and one of the re-rests .
Basti Jaguar , Jaguar travel beyond the Via Lattea , or that the old old old old old , or the Inuit &apos;s still colorful of meaning , or in Himalayas , the distinct budget , and the idea that the central respect of the central anthropology of anthrology , and the idea that the world we live in which we live in .
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stirpful sty has done , well or bad , generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential trails .
We all are procrease .
We &apos;re subjects to start with the initiation .
We have to defit up the inexorability of death , so we don &apos;t surprising us ,
We all have an art .
What it &apos;s the particular rhythm of song , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that they &apos;re the Penan of Borneo , or the following of the Voodoo &apos;s desert , or the desert guguerriers of the Kaizen Kenya , the Curandery , or a cammelliers in Ande , or a cammellier .
He was my company company company in the desert a month ago , or a month ago , or a yak in Qomolangle , Everest , the mother &apos;s dea mother of the world .
All of these populations are teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And , if you think , you &apos;re a moment , it &apos;s a concept that it can give you hope .
Insides , the miriades of cultures the world create a spiritual and cultural life that has a spiritual life that has the planet and it &apos;s important for the wealth of the planet as a roughly notes .
And you can think about this cultural rates as a ethnosphere and you can define the total nosphere and you can call the total nosphere , substantial , ideas , inspirations , with the ideas , inspirations , the inspirations , the inspirations .
etnosphere is the great patriage of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be as as as a kind of initiitive .
And because the biosphere was very much consumed by the way , it happened to the ethnic sphere and unfortunately much faster .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all the species has been or is on the horric is just because it &apos;s flighter , or -- in the most apocalitty -- in the field of biological diversity -- and you don &apos;t even get a little bit more optional hythesis -- that of cultural diversity .
The surflies of all of that is , of course , the language loss .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just a language of a vocabulary or a series of rules ,
One language is the spraking of human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle of every culture comes in in the material world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a kick , a thought , a spiritual ecosystem .
And of those 6,000 languages , while we &apos;re sitting here in Monterey , at least half no longer is subsurrated in the ears of children .
They &apos;re not more teacher to children , which means , less than the camps something that &apos;s already died .
What &apos;s more sad than the most sad of the silence , of being the last last to talk about a language , the last one of the last talking about a language , the promising of children or anticipate the promise of children ?
This is a little bit of the state of somebody in the world in some of the world every two weeks , every two weeks , every two weeks , a old language .
And I know somebody who will say , &quot; Is it better like that ?
The world would not be a better place if we were going to let all of the same language ? WBenisately , we &apos;re all yoruba .
We talk about kogi .
You &apos;ll find a sudden that means you can &apos;t talk to your language .
I &apos;d like to make you a journey through the etnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a little bit of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , &quot; different ways of exist . &quot; I mean , different ways of exist .
Let &apos;s take for example this Barasana bimbo Barasana , in Amazon the walls , the people of the anaconda , which creates the myth of the West in the west &apos;s breast breast of the west in the panish panish of the grand .
It &apos;s a people that can &apos;t distinguish the color blue blue from the green green , because the time it &apos;s identified in the forest , which you know the people are going to think it &apos;s identified in the time , which you think the people are going to be able to distinguish the people .
They have a strange language and a matristation , called &quot; exogamy language , &quot; exogamy language , you have to get a person who talk a different language .
It &apos;s all of that has roots in the mid-households is that in these families that are in these families that they &apos;re talking six or seven , because of the marriage of mystery , there &apos;s a language .
They &apos;re just listen to and then they start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribe tritribe that I lived , the Waorani of Ecuador , a incredible people that had the first contact in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionaries have been attempted a touch error .
They &apos;ve done by the top photographs that they were going to reduce them to people who were lovely reed that this people in the forest plug that this people in the forest plug .
They &apos;ve taken the pictures from the Earth , they turned around the research of a shape or a figure and , not going to find anything , they have been concluse that it was the five missionar-missionar-missionar-missionar-missionar-missionar-missionar-missionary .
But the Waorani didn &apos;t kill only the foreigers .
They killed between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by their same .
We &apos;ve been saving eight generations and we found two natural death , and when we went to know , they admitted that one of them was invecked , and then they killed it . And then they killed it itself .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine that &apos;s 40 steps and recognize that species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned a very interesting task , if I wanted to Haiti me if I wanted to go to Haiti in Haiti , I wanted to Haiti in the basis of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes , and impossessing my poison , and impossessing the poison .
And I had to make sense of the miraculous , I should understand Voodoo culture and the Voodoo is not magic .
It &apos;s quite a complex metaphor metaphor of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the big religions of the world , what do you say ?
Cristianity , Islam , Ebraism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no faith religious . And that &apos;s not religious . And that Voodoo is not the other distilled that the distilled of these religious concepts of nated religious concepts .
What makes a interesting thing that voodoo is the intense relationship between life and death .
So the vivives are going to be the spirits .
The spirits can be invocated by the Great Acqua , they respond to the ritmo of the dance of the dance of the vivive so that for a short active active active active time .
So , this voodooists say , &quot; You &apos;re white who go to talk about God .
We &apos;re dancing in the temple and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re posing , is the spirit that you , how can you get the bad ?
So you see these incredible events : following the voodoo in state of trance that touch impunes are unfuel , a pretty strong demonstration of the body &apos;s mind on the body when it &apos;s catalyzed in a state of extremely excitation .
And I &apos;m all the people with which I lived the most extraordinary people are Kogi Santa Marta Santa Marta . It &apos;s the Santa Marta , in the Colombia secret .
They have to be a tyrange of the tiranged that once lived on the charge of the Colombia in the willing , the people would retreat on the volcanic masses , the people would be on the volcanic masses that you could take on the volcanic masses .
In a continent continent of blood , this people had never been conquised by the spags .
It &apos;s been government now , they &apos;re government , but their formation is so extraordinary .
The young people are taken away from families to three or four years , and they live secret in a dark world and shadow in a dark world and shadow for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years , they have the nine months of gestation that they transfer into the user of mother , now are metaphor metaphor in the GGMather .
For this time , they &apos;re accultured to their society , values that are the prayers that they see their prayers and just their prayers to keep the cosmic balance -- or to say the cosmic balance .
And the term of this incredible initiation , they &apos;re all all that they get out and for the first time , and then , 18 years , see an algrade . And in that activities of the first balls , when the sun kiss , when the sun kiss the beautiful valuable valuable , all that they have learned in the idea all of his splendor . The prevent preventing it does a step back and say ,
&quot; Vist ? Proprint as I said .
It &apos;s wonderful . It &apos;s now now to you protect it . &quot;
They call them greatest brothers and say that we , brothers , are the colpping colpping , we &apos;re the destruction of the world .
This is extremely important .
When we think about the Indigene and the environment we invode R-hanging , and the old history of the selevable notice , which is a race of his own simplicity or maybe invode Thoreau and we say that these people are closer to the Earth of us .
The Indies are not nor feels weakers are weakers from the nor uncy .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the Asmat the Asmat Asmat the frozes of the Tibet , but because of the time and rituals , they have created a mystical of the Earth &apos;s face not about that , the concept that the Earth can live only because it &apos;s infected by the concept that the Earth can live only because it &apos;s infuse from human knowledge .
What does that mean ?
It means that a little bit of Ande Ande who is going to grow that the mountain is a spirit different than a lot of the Apu that will lead his destiny to be a deeper , and it &apos;s going to have a lot different relationship with Montana who &apos;s grows up with Montana who grows up with a mountain is a rock of rocks that a rocks is a ament rocks that you &apos;re going to be shown .
which is the dimora of a spirit or a mineral cy is irrelevant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that report between the individuals and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia Britannica believing that the forests they were going to be cut .
And that has made me a different being from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the dimora of Hukukukukuk and the btails of paradise and the dog of the world , the cannials that are going to extreme world , spirits that we &apos;re going to extrack of the Hamatsa .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create reality , different , you can start to understand some of them feeling that .
I took this picture to open up the picture of the SAmazon norder .
Maybe some of you have heard about the ayahuasks , the most powerful submitter of the sciamanic repertoire .
What makes it fascinating with the ayahuasks is not the potential of the substance , but its elaboration . It &apos;s what makes two elements .
On one side , this liana legning that contains a bunch of charcoal , harmoline and harmoline , little slightly hallucinogene .
And by trying to take the only plant , you have a smoke blueast , but it &apos;s mixed with the family of a coffee ar-to-wise , and it &apos;s a caffection of the coffee Psychotry and .
This plant contains powerful , very similar to the seriotonin , dimethyltryptamine , dimethyptamine .
If you &apos;ve ever see Yanami pull them up for the nose the substance that they do from a different set of species , it &apos;s methyptamine .
It &apos;s a little bit like to nose is a little bit like to be shown by a career of a bunch of painting barely and land on a sea of electricity . &#91; Risate &#93; &#91; Risch &#93; &#91; Risch &#93; &#91; &#91; Risch &#93; &#91; Risch &#93; . It &apos;s a distortion of reality .
I often have to do my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who wrote the man who wrote the Psychedelic was , with his discovery of the hallucinogens in Mexico .
And I &apos;m going to tell my thesis can &apos;t be hit , because if you &apos;re made of them out of being hallucinated . It &apos;s a bunch of being hallucined .
It &apos;s possible to assumerely if you abunt with other chemicals that are denaturated MAO .
Now it &apos;s the nice : the Tier , the Tier AO that are injors of MAO , the same kind of need to be able to get the triptamine . The question is a smills . The question is extended in a flora of 80,000 species , how do these people are two defologically not similar , but that if you have a chemical version that are going to be extra chemical version of the parts ?
We use the great eufemalism of evidence and error , which can be infruted .
But if we ask Indians , they &apos;ll tell us , &quot; The plants talk about it . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuasks , who can tell the forest , and that we can tell them in the same species .
If we ask them how to make their tasonomy they &apos;ll say , &quot; I thought it was a lot of it ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take 17 variety in a night of the moon and each night , and each one will will be a different tone .
So , this is not graduate at Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than stami .
Now , &#91; applausers &#93; the problem is that even those of us who have to heart people who have to be painted to the husers of margins , and they &apos;re going to be in the real world , and it &apos;s going to go beyond .
In fact , the 20th century , in 300 years , it &apos;s not going to remember his wars or and technological innovations , but rather like the one was where we stopped and we abbraced and we used acted and adabbraced it , and we used acted and passionally the planet . Now , the problem is not the change .
All the cultures have been involved in a dance for new possibilities .
And the problem is not technology .
Indians Sioux have no smells that they &apos;re Sioux when they put it out of arco and frecovered as Americans have no stop being American when they put away from the horse and hot .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that threateness of the etnosphere . It &apos;s the power .
The hard hard hard to domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you &apos;ll find that these are not destined to disappear .
They &apos;re living creatures and dynamics extra extra extra forces that go beyond their adaptation .
It &apos;s about the Penan --
a nomads of Sarawak , in the Asian East , a people who lived in the forest place to a generation of a generation ago , and now reduced to a generation , and now reduction on the rivers of the ries of the rivers of the rivers of the liar that you can see the river inquinted from the lim , where the nine of the horiental , where the nine of the horientlements , where the horients are zon , where the horian ,
It &apos;s ready to fill the fashion the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that have come with the discovery of gold .
If we &apos;re going to move on on the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the hard hard hard hard hard .
As you know the genocide , the extinction of a people , is convicted to a people , but the ethnocid , the destruction of the style of a people , not only is announcement , but even even celebrated in certain environments , because it &apos;s part of the development strategies .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of Tibet until you go from the beginning .
I &apos;ve lost 6,000 miles from Chengdu in the Western China through the Western China through the Western , coming to Lhasa with a young connection , but only came to Lhasa young connection , but only came to Lhasa lot of it .
6,000 sacred monuments in dust and centers .
1.2 million people killed from the military during the Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascriteria in the Panchen Lama .
The one means that it &apos;s killed to the time of the Chinese invasion .
Her &apos;s a guy who was in Sainity during the diaspora that led led led the people in Nepal .
His mother was imprisoned and her her cold was rich .
It was taken of hidden cost to the age of two hidden , and he was born in his gonna live without him .
The sister , who did the same , has been put in reeducated .
A day he had a hot hot blocked a fascil fasfascinating Mao and , for this transgression , was a mess of the forced work for seven years .
The pain of Tibet can be insopposable , but the spirit of the people is from tener tener .
And it was all , it reduces to a choice .
We want to live in the world world-bold world , or do we want to get the policy world ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before we die , before he died that our greatest time was that , in our love to go to this amory view of the world , we &apos;re going to see the whole gamma of human imagination , but one day we &apos;ll see us a sleeping of thinking , but one day we &apos;ll go up from a sleeping way that there were other possibilities .
And it &apos;s a humiliant to remember that our species is exist for 60,000 years .
The Revolution of Neoliica , who gave us farming the seed of the seed , which has done us to take the seed of the seed , replace the poetry of the saman of the prosa , creating the gerarcharchy of specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has to be 300 years .
That sharing story doesn &apos;t suggests me that we have the answers to all the challenges we &apos;re going to have to deal with the millennia come to come .
When these miriades of the world is asked what they want to say to be humans , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all refairing the possibility of being what we are : a kind of appreciate , which has to make all the gardens can fit . And there are big moments of optimism .
I took this picture on the north extremity of Baffin , when I went to cackle whales with Inuit , and this man , Olayaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olayers , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olayers , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olayers , and this this man , Olaya , and this man , Olayers , and this man , Olayers , and this man , and this man , and this man , and
The government has not always been gentile with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to stabiliens and in the &apos; 50s to stabilize our spremate , we have them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refused to go .
His , theme for his life , he took them all the weapons , and all of his equal .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t feel cold , they do it .
The patters of the sliters were made of fish fish flying in the skin .
The grandfather of this man didn &apos;t intimidnight or the bylizard , or the bylizard that was .
It &apos;s a disgaps , it &apos;s hot the pantalons in focused and defecated in their hand . When I did you have them are frozen , and worked a moon .
It &apos;s got salive on the puncccaccounts of this caccounts and when it became solid killed a dog .
He has been shaking the dog and created a bridly box , and he had a slict , has ununcomfortable with another dog is disappeared on the banchisa , hit of the bbbbband created a bunch of hanging .
Do we want to talk about horse with nothing ? &#91; Risate &#93; And this , in different ways , &#91; Applausers &#93; is the symbol of the resilience of the people in the world .
In the aprile 1999 , the government reduced the total control of a larger area of the size of California and Texas .
It &apos;s their new paint . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s an independent territory . They &apos;re all the minerary resources .
One of the spleny example of how a nation-state can reconciliate with his people .
And , to end , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious to the people who have been in these remote areas of the planet , and they &apos;re not remote .
For someone is home .
They also represented with the human imagination that they go at the time . And for us all of these kids , the dreams of these kids , like the dreams , they become part of the geography of hope .
And then , we have National Geographic we are convinced that political will never come to anything .
We think polemics --
&#91; Applausers &#93; are not persuasisides , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the best institution to tell stories about the world . Every month our website has 35 million visits .
156 countries transmitted our television canal .
Our magazines are willing with millions .
Our work is traveling in the etnosphere to bring our public places in the etnosphere to bring our public places that they &apos;re going to be abbracing for the central reveal , the world of exist anthropology : the world of exist anthroughout the way the central reveal reveal of life in a place of a pluralist and multiculticultural wisdom , and multicultics of a world , and we have to find a life in a place in a world .
where the wisdom of all the people can contribute to our collective well-being .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope you &apos;ve heard and try to evidence some links , and I &apos;m going to tell you some links , in case you don &apos;t notice .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the &quot; dogma official dogma .
The dogma official what ?
The dogma official of all the Western industrial society . The dogma official dogma : &quot; If we want to male the well-being of our citizens . &quot; The way to do it is massize the individual liberty . &quot;
The reason , on one side , in fact that the freedom is itself a value , it &apos;s precious , useful , essential for humans .
On the other one is that if we are free , each of us can act for all of us that we have to do everything that we have to have to do everything that we have to have to do all of our well-being , no one that decision in our own .
The way to massively freedom is to massively the choice .
More choices , more choices , more they &apos;re free , and more , their greater freedom , the greater freedom , they &apos;re their well-being .
This is , I think , is so deeply rown in the society that nobody would have to be able to put it in doubt .
And it &apos;s also deeply rown in our lives .
And I &apos;ll show you some examples of what progress is possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m going to allow me a simple note about conditions to injump .
In my supermarket is 175 conditions , without contact the 10 variety of olive olive , and the 12 whalales you can buy for a huge number of conditions that you can buy for a huge number of conditions in the fix-to-five people are already ready to be your degree .
That &apos;s what the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic store : cast , the cow , the CD , radio , rain , radio , faller , light , light bull .
And in this single single store , there &apos;s a big number of audio .
We can do six and a half million different combinations using the components that there are in one store .
You have to admit that there &apos;s a lot of choice .
Altri fields : the world of communications .
Once I was a child , they could get all the phone services , at all the phone services that they were supposed to be proven by mom Bell .
They were nolegy , they didn &apos;t buy it .
A consequence of that , in the other , was that the phone never made .
These times are gone .
We have now a variety of phones , especially between phones , especially among phones .
So , these are cell phones .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , cut the nose of the nose , and forth for the brulwhelming chrice .
If you don &apos;t have that you saw in the store , you &apos;re very certain that I &apos;ll soon get you .
And what happens is that people are going to get people to get into the store and ask this question . And the answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t make too much .
So , in other ways of life that are much more important than the acquiring of the same explosion choices .
It &apos;s not healthcare : : it &apos;s not happening in the United States that you &apos;re going to go from the doctor and doctor you know what you have to do .
Instead , you &apos;re the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; Okay , we could do it , or B , &quot; A has these benefits of these benefits , and these risks , &quot; B has these benefits of these benefits . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Dr. , &quot; Dr. , what should I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A has these benefits , and these risks and B has these benefits these benefits . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; Dr. if you were me , &quot; What if you were me , what do you do ? &quot;
And the doctor : &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
We call it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; malated &quot; , expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But it &apos;s not that you can move the weight and responsibility to make decisions from someone knows something , which is the doctor , to someone knows something , and almost certainly , malated with someone else that -- and almost certainly is sick -- and so almost certainly it &apos;s not the patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing marketing marketing marketing , direct to people like me and you , if you think it &apos;s not a sense , because we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why can &apos;t they buy them ?
The answer is that they want you to ask them to ask them to ask them to change the recipe .
Something that is the orderly , as our identity is a question of choice , how you see in this vignity . We don &apos;t want to forces the kids . They &apos;re not going to forces . It &apos;s not going to get to invent it .
And we can reinventing how many times you aggrade us .
which means that every morning , in the morning , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I &apos;m going to the family and matrimonium , a time , the common perspective , almost for anyone , it was that we had to get the most preserved possible , and it started to make the most preserved possible .
The only real choice was a big choice , not when , and even what do after .
It &apos;s really , it &apos;s really to play .
I teach a lot of smart students , and I &apos;m going to do it for 20 percent of work than a time .
And because they &apos;re not very brilliant , because they &apos;re less diligent .
But why are they imthoughts , you know , &quot; should do it get me or not ? I should do it now ? I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; Do I have to get away later ? I have to think before children or career ? &quot;
They &apos;re logoring .
And they &apos;re trying to answer these questions , even if this implement not complete the companies that assigns and not get a nice voice to my exame .
And they have to do that . They &apos;re important questions .
Now , the job : we &apos;re lucky , as Carl under-, because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from every day , from all of the planet , except that from Hotel Randolph .
And it &apos;s a coroline , there &apos;s a coroline , and I won &apos;t tell anybody which , where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t say that , because I want to use it .
What does this incredible freedom of choice we have about this work ? Is it all we have to continually decide , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing hot , with cell phone in a pocket , the Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , and the notebook , tily , on the ginknees .
And even if they &apos;re all spending , every minute that we see our son to refinding the partner , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; Do you have to answer this ? &quot;
&quot; Do I have to answer this email ? I have to email this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is &quot; no , &quot; all this makes the experience of your son very different son than that it would have been in other conditions .
So , any of the we look , small things and big , things , materials and lifestyle , life is a choose issue of choices .
Once the world was this : That &apos;s the one , you know , there were some possibilities , but it wasn &apos;t a question of choice .
The world today is what &apos;s the world today is , &quot; The dilemma is , &quot; Is it a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is . It &apos;s a lot of time .
We &apos;re all dealing on these , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative .
All this choice is two negative two negative effects of people .
The first , paradoxally , is that produced paradoxide .
With a lot of options between which choose , it &apos;s very difficult to do it .
You give you a significant example : a study of the volunteer of the voluntary depension .
A connected to had access to the data of Vanguard data , the giant society &apos;s funding about a million customers in 2000 different companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of adhhhhouses two percent .
With 50 to offer you , there &apos;s 10 percent of adhhhouses than when they &apos;re available to only five .
Because with 50 funds of which choose , is malededeflied to decide , and the choice is reduced to indomans .
And tomorrow , and even tomorrow , tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , of course , tomorrow .
You know that doesn &apos;t only mean that these old workers are going to be food for dogs because they &apos;re not going to have enough money , it also , it &apos;s so undator that lose the funds of the dator of work .
Not participating , they &apos;re losing to five dollars for year from the work dator , which would be well disposed to be there .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think that makes the world that .
&quot; And to end , for ethernity : ketchup , or maionese ? &quot;
You &apos;d like to make the right decision , if it &apos;s for the ethernity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to pick the wrong wrong , and even the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that if we can avoid the paralyssis and make a choice , at the end of how we would be a little bit of the result of how we would have been with less options .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions of which choose , if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine you could have a different choice that would be better . And what &apos;s happening is that the alternative imagined us to hmarrow with the choice , and the refairly imagined us to the hamong the decision , and the refairly decrease , refairly , refairly , and the refairly decrease ,
even when it was a good decision .
And more choices there are , more , it &apos;s easy to displeasure any detail that is unexextension of option .
Also , there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has clearly very well stamapin the value that we &apos;re depends on what we &apos;re going to do .
On the rest , when there are many opoptions , it &apos;s easy to represented the alternative features of alternative shown and less less sation-me-made of option that you have to have a choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m sorry with all the ones that are not New York .
But that &apos;s what you &apos;re probably going to think .
There &apos;s this couple of Hamptons .
A place of lusband .
It &apos;s all about splendida . Otma day . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not going to be . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , maledian , it &apos;s Agust . &quot;
&quot; All my neighbors in Manhattan is away . &quot;
&quot; I could parking right in front of the house . &quot;
And it &apos;s passing two weeks from the idea that &apos;s perdying -- every day -- the ability to parking where it wants .
costs costo-opportunity decrease the soddisfation for what we have , even when the choice was excellent .
And the more are the options that we have to consider , the more the actual characteristics that are going to be going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to think .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a little bit of things .
It &apos;s about life the time , and maybe of the living slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you choose , you choose to not do the other .
The things that we don &apos;t choose to attractive attractive that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : spiral of expectations .
I tried to my skin bought a new pair of jeans .
I &apos;m almost always jeans .
Once jeans were just a guy , bought them and wasting them out of the besty , they were sweet , just after they took them a lot of time , they were starting to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple new time when those old were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
And the bet said , &quot; Li wants to be a fit , relaxed , and fit ? &quot;
I want to do it with cernic , or with the buttons ? &quot; Stonejjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjobs ?
&quot; Would you like them ? &quot;
&quot; Do you want them to big them ? Bla bla , &quot; Continupright them .
I was sballoon , and after a little bit I did , &quot; I want the kind of , that was the only guy , &quot; it was the only guy that , so I &apos;m going to do all of the maleans , and then I came out of the jeans , and then out of the jeans , and I had ever had .
It was the very much . I had a better better better .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice my own expectations were altissime , jeans had to be perfect .
I was minimum expectations . I didn &apos;t expect to me when there was a kind of time there , and when you saw 100 different , you know , at least one kind of , at least one kind of be perfect .
What I did I buy was good , but not perfect .
After I was going to chose that I was insodly trying to disappeared to the expectations .
The adds of options in the life of people don &apos;t do that increasing the eccellence of the options of the options of the options .
And this will produce less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
No one in the world of marketing if it &apos;s made it .
Because if they knew it , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more to that .
&quot; It was better when it was worse , &quot; The reason why he was better when you were worse is that when you were worse was even possible to meet the surprise .
So , in the world we live in -- opults , industrialized citizens with the expectancy -- the most of the perfection , we can hope is that things are the things that are the althetic .
You &apos;ve never surprised to pleasant you have to have pleasant , my waiting , and my wait , they &apos;re ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; You &apos;re going to do it . &quot;
I mean , small autographic moment -- which I &apos;m really married and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t have me .
But it &apos;s not always a good thing .
And then , a consequence of the bought a couple of jeans is that kind of jeans is that when you &apos;re not sation-facts , and ask you , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot;
The world is responsible . What would I do you do ?
When there are hundreds of types of jeans , and buy a unununfacing , and you ask who is the responsible , it &apos;s the responsible , it &apos;s a clear clear that responsible you &apos;re .
You could have better .
With hundreds of variety available , there are no excuse for the insuccessful .
So when people make decisions , even if the result is valido , they feel insatisfident and give the cold cold .
In the last years , depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only , but important -- of this honest honest depression that people have deludent experiences because they &apos;re too high .
And when they have to explain this that the cold is their own .
So the end result is that we &apos;re better , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely filled . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little choice of choice is better than having it all have that it &apos;s not going to have a lot of choice .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic value .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve overcome from a piece of the level where the choices improving our life .
Now , from political point of view -- I &apos;ve got almost finished -- from political point of view , the nocy is the following .
What it allows all this choice in the industrial society is the wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know that they &apos;re talking about it , where the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too paid .
So the faccenters I &apos;m talking about is a malleaving of modern , reaunt society .
And what it does depressed and angry is this : Steve Levitt has talked about yesterday about how those expensive expensive seats for bimes are useful . It &apos;s a lot of money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and dispendion , it &apos;s not that they &apos;re just useful .
I &apos;m even a deleteries .
They do it worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows us to have a lot of choice , it &apos;s not just their life to improve , it &apos;s not just their life to improve but our .
This is what economists call a lot of improvement .
A redistribution of income redistribution of the income , not only to poor -- because of this choice in the exact of this extra .
To conclude , &quot; Filla , you can become all you want . &quot;
You , people of culture , you think , &quot; What does that make that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t make anything in a glass . &quot;
&quot; A gentlemon , a limited vision of the world -- &quot;
and I &apos;m going to do it , at the beginning .
But then , I realized that that the long time , I realized that that the long knows the long knows .
Because the reality is that if you &apos;re missing the boccia , so that you can &apos;t get the freedom , you can &apos;t get the freedom . You can &apos;t get the freedom .
If you break the boccia in the way that all of the possible way you decrease the satisfaction .
You get the paralysis , and you &apos;ll reduce the well-being .
They all need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too strange , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of some symbolic sphere is a recipe for the inhappiness and , I &apos;m going to the rovine .
Thank you very much .
