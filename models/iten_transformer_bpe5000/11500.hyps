The last year I showed these slides to show that the glacial calculus , which for almost three million years had the size of 48 , the size of the United States continents , it &apos;s restrip of 40 percent .
But that &apos;s the gravity of the problem because it &apos;s not going to show the ice of the ice .
The artica glacial glacial is , in a sense , the heart of global system .
It expanded up and you &apos;re ritioned in summer .
The next slide is going to be a remarkable remarkable to sell the last 25 years .
The payed in red .
You see , you &apos;re going to go down to the blue box .
That &apos;s the ice in inverter , that you have a summer ice .
You can see that the costs of ice , five years or more , is like the blood , which here was like the blood , that here was going to be exce from the body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been so .
This is a problem because the rewarming wning on the ground that is the land around the ocean , where there are enormous amount of coal coal , which is going to be transformed in metan , they are transformed in metan .
I &apos;m going to be a whole of the atmosphphic atmosphic of global warming , that could be doubling , that amount of return ,
In some sounds like a little proper in Alaska metan is already going on on the water .
The professored Katey Walter of the University of Alaska team , a team a team on a little bit of the last invern .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Well , I &apos;m going to be right .
This is a reason that this is that this thermal scary scary scary scary ,
This is a bunch of ruin the glacial .
The ported that it never had to levels like that .
This is the Kangerlussuadefed , in the southern ovest .
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea for the shelter , here is where it &apos;s going to be the sea .
These currents are increasingly rapidly .
On the other side of the planet : Antarctica , the greatest block of the planet .
The last month scientists have dized that the ice of ice is in negative , and that Antarccccy , and that Antarctttle , is participate about the sun .
Equival at six feet of the actual level , like Genland .
Sull Himalaya , the third largest block of ice , you see new laghi , which few years ago were .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population of the world &apos;s potential from that sell .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the water of the potential of this city .
The ported it &apos;s increased .
But when it demining , the same happens to the water .
In California , the nnow on the Sierra Nevada is deminuity of 40 percent .
The hydrogen kidropes are .
The previous previsions , like you know , they &apos;re grasses .
The growing certainly certainly in the world leads to a remarkable remarkable .
The environmental disaster are increasing to a rhythm out of the normal and without the previous .
Four times more more than in the last 30 years I was going to be before 75 .
This is a sustainable to the whole insustainable .
If you look at the historic context , you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we put 70 million CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million CO2 -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the Pacific area of the Pacific , the Americans , to the Southern parts of the subcontinent , where there &apos;s a radical royyal , where there &apos;s a polyssal lower in the oceans .
The greatest cause of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossil fuels .
The oil is a problem , and the coal is even worse .
The United States are one of the two more emissions , together to China .
And it was proponant to build a lot of other central central .
But we &apos;re seeing a change of direction .
These are the annullayers in the last years and some of the versus of the green .
And so , there &apos;s a political lengage in our country .
The industrial coal and oil have speso 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the fuel , which is a symptomorrow , which is a symsymboy .
That picture me would remember something --
I mean , I &apos;m Natal Tennessee , where I saw , there &apos;s been a 3.8 billion liers of the coal four-foot path .
You may have seen it on the news .
This is the second big flusband in America .
It &apos;s happened around Natal .
The public advertising of the industrial and coal was this .
Video : His the carbon , is a guy , and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it &apos;s growing our economy .
First of the carbon is always fleaked .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and the work of the workers .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest minerary society on the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : The Blankenship : I &apos;m going to be clear -- Al Gore , Harry Reid , Harry Reid -- don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Allema for the Clima Prottion of Clima has been launched two campaign .
This is a part .
Video : Attore : Attore we see the climate change as a serious serious mines to our business .
And so that we have to invest a big amount of money in a whole whole money in a confused to make public and confused the truth on the coal truth .
In fact , coal is not a spork .
We think it &apos;s pulist -- it &apos;s also a good profumo .
So , not predict of climate change .
Let me do .
Video : Attore : Call pulit -- you &apos;ve heard a lot of a lot .
So , you &apos;re going to do a structure at the avanese coal for how the coal coal fuel .
Sordinarily ! Sordinordinarily . But this is the sound of the coal technology .
The coal consumption is between the major causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology , but the remarkable technology that you see everything .
You go a look at this , this is the odierna technology .
Al Gore : Inally , the alternative of positive is connected to economics and that security .
Video : The America is in cripes ; the national security , the climate crisis .
The filter that the links of all of our dependence from fossil fuels , like the coal fuel and oil oil .
Now , there &apos;s a new , audace solution for used to use it .
Rey , 100 percent of the pulled , in 10 years .
A plan to remate America , to make us more safe , and help to stop the global warming .
And finally , a solution that basts to solve our problems .
Repower . Scoprite than .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : You know , it &apos;s about to re-energy .
One of the faster ways of the faster than they killed our planet .
Comparsa : The future is here . I feel , a new network .
Commad two : Neggs invent for places of work well well well , we have been retributed .
Please : Rey America . It &apos;s time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old proverbio African says , &quot; If you want to go fast , you go to the ,
If you want to go away , you go together . &quot;
We need to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
The last year at TED , I did a introduction on LHC .
And promises to return to to get you on how the car works .
So , they started . And for the other time , there were not , the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment that we &apos;ve ever tried -- 27 miles of circles .
His task is to reach the conditions that were presents less than a billionon-year year .
This is just environmental .
This is the car in Ginevra .
I &apos;m going to take these little little Big Bang in the rilevators .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- is a 44 feet and he has a diameter diameter diameter .
This is a show of ATLATLAS in construction , so you can see the proportions .
The 10 secember of last year we &apos;ve got to put the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was because of immense festhate in control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first fascinating of particles that had been done around the LHC , entring in collision , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles in the relevator .
In other words , when we &apos;ve been a picture of the 10 , we realized that the car work , which is a great vitty .
I don &apos;t know if it was going to be able to be more opposed or this , when somebody went on on Google and I saw that the page was this .
And what means we have had a cultural impact beyond that scientific impact beyond that .
It &apos;s about a week later , it was a problem with the car , we had just to these files here -- these files .
These files bring 13,000 ampwhen the car works at the very very ,
Now , the technical techniques and they &apos;ll tell , &quot; It &apos;s not true . They &apos;re too good . &quot;
And instead can do it because when they are very cold to become the costs of the rhythththrows .
So , at less 271 degrees , at a nurture temperature in the stars , these files can bring that the right .
In one of the giunture between the most of the magneti in LHC , there was a defect of factoration .
So the files are going to be slightly , and 13,000 ampsuddenly met a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is still more impressive if you think these magnees are more than 20 tons , and they moved about 30 feet .
They &apos;re damaged about 50 magnetworks .
We had to tall , what we did .
We have to repristinted and refed .
They &apos;re now going back to their place .
And the end of the LHC is going to be new integrate .
We &apos;re going to go , and we expect to get the data or the right right , and continue so our adventure to find out what the universe is going to find out what the universe is .
Now , of course , in a way , these crash accidents , these crossing crossing on the value of science and engineering of the engineering and engineering .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s so hard , I think that &apos;s the value of things like LHC .
I want to conclude with words of a scientist Inglese , Humphrey , which , I guess , in defense of inutilize , and he was Michael Farch it was Michael Faray , he said , &quot; No , &quot; No , &quot; No , &quot; No , &quot; No , &quot; No , it &apos;s so dangerous for the progress of the mind of the ideas of the mind that are definitive , and that there are not new monstrate , and that there are not in the exist . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start asking to rethink about when , you know , you &apos;re playing with kids , you play up in the morning .
As you understand how to reach them and say , they &apos;re going to take them and move , learn about and to be able to think and solve problems and resulting and resulting the space .
The space reasoning is deply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , by the usual computer computer , which is that we &apos;re going to have a physical objects , together to my consultant , and the collaborator , and the collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking me , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of the mouse as a computer pass like a computer , but we have the only rhypers of the mouse of the mouse , we could have the same same depth of the hands of the hands of the hands ,
and try to be to be pleased ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the Siftable .
In poorders , a Siftable is a computer interactive computer like a biscan .
In poorders , a Siftable is a computer interactive computer like a biscan .
You can move with the hand , you can see , &quot; they can see &quot; between them , hear the movement and they have a screen and a radio wireless .
But mostly , they are physicists , like the morning , you can just move them .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physicists , conscious of the movement , of the other , and as they become more physicists , and as they become more physicists , of the movement , of the other , of how we can move , we can explore new and fun of interaction .
I &apos;m going to try with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show the video : if you &apos;re going to show the video : if you &apos;re going to be able to see that , if you &apos;re going to be going to be able to show the video : if you &apos;re going to be able to show the video : if you &apos;re going to be able to show the video : if you &apos;re going to be able to show the video of the video .
These reacactives are aware of of the other .
If I do them , they &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re around .
If they are surrounded , and they can be agited .
If they are surrounded , and they can be agited .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We &apos;ve realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was that we could use the data , for example , &quot; as if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable as a little bit of a kind of nice , and I can use them to be used to use it for color in that central , where they &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to .
and I can use them for the color in that central , where they &apos;re going to be able .
If we can get too , we can put a little bit of place .
And I &apos;m also becoming up , like the ingue of the ingue , the mathematics and games of logic , where people can try to try things , and see the same results .
Now , I &apos;m --
This is a Fibonacks us that I do with a equations .
Here we have a game of words that is at half in Scarabeo and Boggle .
It &apos;s basically , at every turning to the letter , in the Sifty , by every Turns , basically , at every turning you &apos;ve got a letter on every Sifty , and as you &apos;re trying to understand it .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new set of letters and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the kids came to the Media Lab , I did it . I &apos;ve been trying to do it and I turned a video .
They are like to them .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot .
You just say , &quot; You know , &quot; You know what to do .
Here &apos;s other people that they try it .
This is our Tiester &apos;s a little younger , there on the right .
It actually wanted to impleased them .
They were only morning , for him .
Now , this is an application of a interactive charge .
We wanted to build a tool for the apeating . He &apos;s Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , solving the Sifty table .
It can put new characters in the scene , solving the Sifty table .
So , it &apos;s doing out the sun .
Video : The sun is sister .
David Merrill : Now he brought a treatment in the scene .
Video : The arange treatment .
Bel work !
So , you shake the Sifttle and put them close to the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing their story .
Video : Hey !
DM : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide him like .
DM : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide him like .
Video : Vola , gat .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , and I made music .
It &apos;s a tool , I made of recent , to sample and to do music .
The Siftable here are on the ground , and the battery .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose which use .
You can also put these sounds on a sequence of a compores .
And it just just by doing it just by doing a &quot; and a sequence . &quot;
These are actually you can control from the alive , like the revers and the filter .
The acks on a particular sound and then cline for readed .
And then there are general effects like time and volume , that are applied to the whole sequence .
We look like it works .
Video : DM : We &apos;re going to try and put a base in two Sifttle , we put it into a series , we add to a series , we add to the other basic basic basic .
Now , I put a bottom line .
Video : DM : Now I &apos;m going to add some of the percussions .
Video : DM : And now I &apos;m going to put the battery of the battery to be control the effect of the effect of the effect of the way .
Video : DM : I can reach the entire sequence of the entire sequence of time .
Video : DM : And now I &apos;m going to add the bottom to give more expression .
Video : DM : I can reach the sequence . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to plan before , but I can suddenly , and more strike .
And now , I can smoke the entire sequence of the entire sequence of the Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new interface of the human human interface .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some possibilities that we try to get out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that we &apos;re going to be doing with the digital media , which will will be information in our world .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the right now of you .
I &apos;m a scritual .
I &apos;m going to be a little bit of this , but it &apos;s more than that .
It &apos;s also love and the beat of my life .
And I don &apos;t know that it can change .
But , he said this , something particular happened in my life and in my career , which has brought me to report the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I &apos;ve been written this book , this biography called &quot; Many , Prega , &quot; which , diversously , from my previous books , for some reason that they went out to the world and become a great sensational , bestseller .
And the result is that everywhere you &apos;re going to happen now , people are treated like if I was going to .
It &apos;s true -- he &apos;s going to be .
They &apos;re all going to be right , and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t have a little bit more to do ?
You don &apos;t have afraid to be able to write for all life without able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can importate somebody ? &quot;
which can matter somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s rupon , you know .
But it may go , at my hand , I remember that I &apos;m going to tell you that I was going to say to people -- I was a shadolescent -- I wanted to be a scritual .
I would go up to the same reaction of the same reaction .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you have to have succeed ?
You don &apos;t painting that the ulilights ?
You don &apos;t have painting to do this to all life without anything that &apos;s going to be out and to die on a cumps of any of the bocking with the byle of the pyle of the page of failure ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
I &apos;m afraid of all those things .
I &apos;ve always had painting .
And I also have a lot of other things that people can &apos;t have to be ununable .
And as the algae and other things .
But , for how to write what I thought and I would ask me , why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logic that anyone who should be spitted by a job that you &apos;ve been born to do .
But what there is so particular in the implant implant to make us nervous about the mental health as a way that other caring reers don &apos;t they ?
As my father , for example , he was a chemistry and not one only time in his 40 years of activity in his 40 years of activity when he was asked if he would be engineer ?
It &apos;s never -- that block of engineering John , how do it ?
It didn &apos;t work so , you know ?
Onestly , engineers engineers like group don &apos;t have certainly , in the centuries , they make the reputation of being alolized .
We have enough of this reputation , and not just creativity and not only creativity , but we &apos;re creativity , we have this reputation of being enormous memory .
And it &apos;s not going to look at the trad and conteteams of the magniflies that , only in the 20th century , they die and often .
And the ones that don &apos;t have suicked to be really disappeared by their dones .
Norman Mailer , before we die , in the last interview , he said , &quot; Every little bit of the book , &quot; A fashion on on the work of their life .
But we don &apos;t blow up when we hear it to say why we &apos;ve heard these things so much about that we &apos;ve completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and the suffering are in some of the way of the art , at the end , and that art , at the end , and then then then it &apos;s going to be in the angosososes .
And the question I want to ask to all here here is : you agree with this idea ?
It &apos;s good for you this thing -- because it &apos;s also looking at a little bit of distance to me not well for anything that &apos;s good for me .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous , and I don &apos;t want to see the perpepeuated in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better encourage to live .
And I know that , in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start to be able to start to be able to start to be able to start with the surrich , especially you go in my career .
That &apos;s true -- I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;ve got about 40 years .
I still have about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything that I &apos;m going to write about the world as the work that was going to be right after it was going to be right after it .
I &apos;m going to be slaved , because we are all more or friends here -- is likely that my greatest success is to my own .
Oh , Gesus , thinking !
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start blow in the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I &apos;m going to continue to do this job .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it seems to me , after a lot of thinking , that the way to work to continue to write is what to create a protective psychological psychological , OK ?
I have to find a bit of security between me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural natural analyze on which I would say that it &apos;s going to be written . And , I was trying to look through time , trying to look through time , trying to find other societies and look through the time , trying to find other things , and I &apos;m going to see if they could have better ideas and look at the time , trying to find other societies .
on how to help people are creative people to manage the emotional of creativity .
And that research me to give me to the ancient Great and ancient Rome .
I do do it because I gift in circle and then back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity sely of creativity that creativity came from the men , OK ?
It was thinking that the creativity was this spirit look at the spirit of the people who came to the men from a few more surprising and known , for instant reasons and known .
The great-called these spirits of the creativity of creativity . &quot;
Socrrice , he believed to have a demand that elargive from a long time .
The Roman were the same idea , but they called the spirit of the spirit .
The most great , because the Roman didn &apos;t really think that a genius were just smart .
They believe a genius was this kind of divin that was living in literally in the murs of a little bit of the study , a little bit like the element of the work of the work of the work is and to get out of the work of the artist of the work .
Here &apos;s the way -- here , that &apos;s the distance of which I &apos;m talking about -- that psychological construct that protection you from your work .
And everybody knew that was so that it was going to work , right ?
So the artists were protected by certain things , like , for example , the too narcism , right ?
If your job was not able to take it and everything that deserve , all of the merge , everybody knew that they were helped by this genius .
If your job failed , it &apos;s not all your mind , it &apos;s not all your right , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a incapable .
And so people , they &apos;ve got to have creativity in the West for a long time .
And then the Raissance came and everything , and they &apos;re going to be changing , and we put the human to the center of the universe , and without the more to leave space to the creatures of the universe , and no longer leave space to the creatures that they write from the divinity .
This was the principle of humanity and people started thinking that creativity came to think that creativity came from from the hythththththirkon .
And for the first time in history , you start to reference this artist or that artist as a very much as a person with the genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big error .
I think I allow somebody , a simple person to believe that they &apos;re like a recipient , and the smile , and the sistence of all the divine , creaties , unknown , and of all the divine , and of a good phagile to give you the peaks of human .
It &apos;s like to ask somebody to enjoy the sun .
It seems to details and details all these ingestures expectations on the performance .
And I think it was this pressure to destroyed artists in the passed 500 years .
And if that &apos;s true , and I think that &apos;s , and I think that &apos;s the question , and now ?
Can we do it diversately ?
Now , you know , you know , more ancient of the relationship between humans and mystery .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can &apos;t have to dog 500 years of thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience that would be legitimate scientific remarkable to the notion of , initially , you do that people are following to the people who are filled to their projects .
It probably didn &apos;t convince you all about this .
But the question I want to ask is -- why don &apos;t you ?
Why don &apos;t you think about this way ?
Because it has more sense of anything else that I &apos;ve ever heard to explain the explanting of the process .
A process that , as anyone who has ever tried to do something -- so , basically , all here -- you don &apos;t understand rationally .
And , in fact , it can sometimes seem completely paranororful .
I did this inate against the extraordinary poeest Ruth Stone , who has right 90 years , but it was a poeer for all life and said that during his childhood in the rural Virginia , working in the Samples , and he felt it &apos;s going out in the field , and they felt it &apos;s going to be on the landscape .
He said that it was like a chair of the air .
And that was roling to her from the landscape .
And it was going to be , because he was going to do the land in its feet .
He knew that you had one thing to do to do at that point and it was , words , &quot; &quot; &quot; Should you like a match . &quot;
And so , it &apos;s going to be followed by this poetry , and it didn &apos;t have to take another piece of paper and a math enough enough , as the trapart , and it &apos;s going to take it up and say it on the page .
Althree times , I couldn &apos;t be enough , so correal and correcent and correcent without able to get into home and the poetry and the poetry and keep it going to roled through the landscrefed , trying to be roled through the landscrevenues . &quot;
And then there were those times -- this piece that I don &apos;t dimensional moments that the was almost lost , right ?
So , he was going to be looking at the paper and the poetry and the poetry through , and he was going to be a marked in the way that she was going to hill , and he was like the halling , and the offer .
And it was the poetry from the code and the page and transcated on the page .
And in these cases , the poetry is presented on the perfect page and intintings , but at the contrary , from the last word to the first .
So when I felt that -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly the ugual process .
Not my creative process -- not a lot of the crease .
I &apos;m a mulo , and my way to work is ; I &apos;m going to wake up with the same orarian every day and go up and go up up up .
But even I , in my testestyard , I &apos;ve strised against that thing , sometimes .
And I guess that many of you the han did .
You know , even if the work and ideas that they came to me from a certain source of them , I couldn &apos;t be honestly .
And what &apos;s this thing ?
And how can we relate to it to be able to be able to be able to be able to be sationally ?
And as I think about , the best example of the same time , I have the musician , which I &apos;ve interviewed that I &apos;ve interviewed several years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life was the incarpet of the artist of the same time , trying to control , to try to control , and invite these species of impulsed .
But then invecked , he &apos;s hot , and a day as he was driving on a self-construction , and he changed everything for him .
He was going to be a quick and everything about this little frame of melodia , who comes in his head as inspiration , and it wants to be inspiration , and the wants , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the desider , but it &apos;s not just like to take it .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , it &apos;s not a math , it &apos;s not a recorder .
So , it starts to hear this kind of old ange is growing in him , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose it .
I &apos;m not good , and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to go into the panic , they stop .
It &apos;s going to mate the whole mental process and made something completely new .
He just just look at the sky and he said , &quot; I don &apos;t see what I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; You know , what it looks like ?
If you really want to be , torn in a more time when I can take care of you .
Altrain , you &apos;re going to importantly , you know .
You know , I &apos;m going to disturbing Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his process is going to change after this .
Not the job , the job was still hoscy like always .
But the process , and the fish of anxial that was reduced when the genius , the genius that outside he was going to be a very much of the problems and freeed it back to where they were doing it back to where they came back and go back to where they were doing it , and it was going to be a interyzed , and the horized thing .
but it &apos;s not this peculiar , wonderful bizarre , a collaboration between Tom and this strange , and that &apos;s not Tom .
So , as I felt that story I was going to change a little bit , even the way I was working and already saved me once .
This idea , I was going to write when I was writing , Prega , &quot; and fallen in a bunch of those cave of the disperation that we &apos;re going to think about something and we can start thinking about that , and we &apos;re going to think that &apos;s the worst book .
Not just good , the worst book .
And I started thinking about this project .
But then I remember that I was talking to the air and I tried to get it .
So I got my face on the manoscritical and diress my face on a vacuum of the room .
And I said to high vices , &quot; Sent , what we think about , if this book is not going to be very good .
Because as I &apos;m seeing it . I don &apos;t have more than I have , I don &apos;t have this .
So if you want you to be better , you have to introduce you and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t know what , you don &apos;t have to do it .
I &apos;m going to try to write the same because it &apos;s my job .
And I want to please that it was recorded that I &apos;ve been presented to do my hand , &quot; Because that &apos;s so -- OK -- , let &apos;s do in the deserts of the North Africa of the North of people were going to the dance of the dance of the dance , and the lawn and the lawwwwings and the lawalls .
And they were always magniflies , because the ballerin professionals and they were fantastic .
But every single , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became actually transcending .
And I know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know that you &apos;ve all seen , at a point , a performance .
It was like the time , it was like the time , and the ballerin a kind of portal and it was not different from from the usual , and it was not different from from the usually , but it &apos;s all going to be in .
And suddenly , you know , you know , a human .
But it &apos;s accounts from the divinity of divinity .
And when this happened , they were knew what it was , people know that was , they called him with her name .
They were going to be dying the hands and started to dog , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curious notes , when the Moretry of Spagna , I was the southern Spagna , I was this abdine with them and the ready to change in the centuries , Allah , Allah , &quot; Ole , &quot; , &quot; and you can still hear in the corride or flamenk .
In Spages , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , I , Allah , magnifically , &quot; , &quot; unlike , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; understanding , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
And it &apos;s great because we need .
But the problem comes the day after , for the sweet , when you &apos;re wake up and I found that are 11 in the morning of Martedday and the right right right .
It &apos;s just a dead dead , and maybe it &apos;s a very bad , and maybe it &apos;s not going to each other to that althetic .
And maybe nobody will dog the name of God &apos;s God still while , and what &apos;s going to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most re-porose to do in a creative life .
But maybe not have to be so corosciant if you can &apos;t believe , advancy , that the most extraordinary aspects of your being being from you .
But just believe that you are data in the prestired of a source of this team of a source of this team of your life that you have to go to somebody else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think about this way .
And so I started thinking about , and it &apos;s certainly like I thought about it for different months in the working of the book that I &apos;m going to be able , the dangerous , and I &apos;m going to do this .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel electrized from this is , I don &apos;t have painting .
Not forforget . It &apos;s just your job .
Continua present-up , whatever it can be .
If your job is balling , you go .
If the divine , I &apos;m going to be a little bit of a little bit of a wonderful time , for a moment through your forforced , for a moment through your forced , so &quot;
Altrain , you do it .
And &quot; &quot; Oh , &quot; to you the same .
I think we have to teach it .
&quot; Oh , &quot; to you the same , even for having a human love and testyard and testestyard to be able to show you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
And as you know , I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects on the human genome , on what can mean and discovery of new genes .
We are now starting a new path : we started digitize biology and now start from that digital code , we &apos;re going to start with a new fase of biology , designing and synthesize life .
We &apos;ve always tried to be big questions .
&quot; What &apos;s life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists , I think they have tried to understand the levels .
We &apos;ve tried to be different approximes , and we &apos;ve tried to minimi terms .
We &apos;re digitioning by nearly 20 years .
When we &apos;ve sequenced the human genome was that we went to go from the digital world of biology in the digital world .
Now , we ask us : we can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma , which is the species from the little little bit of the little bit of those that can self-oreplicate in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome for crearch , a little little bit .
We can actually get to eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 that are here .
But when we look at its map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our .
Credees , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes we can get out , one at the time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this can bring to a living cell .
So we decided that the only one on to design was synthesize this cromosome in a way that we could actually change the components for the components to take some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of &quot; Can we synthesize a cromosome ? &quot;
Can we have the chemistry consend these big molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create before ?
And , in case , we can make a cromosome ?
A cromosome is just a piece of chemical material .
The speed with which we are able to digitize life is growing to be growing up .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , designing , but it &apos;s improving , but it &apos;s improving .
And our most recent results the bring on a curve .
We have been initized 15 years ago .
The process has required a lot of passing , starting with a review before we started to the first experiments .
But we &apos;ve found that synthesize DNA is very difficult .
There are thousands of cars in the world that make little segment of DNA , the long DNA , of the long path of 30 to 50 to 50 letters and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the most errors are .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments and correct the errors .
And this was our first attempt , to start from digital information of the genome of Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills .
We designed the framments , actually , we &apos;ve got the courage of errors and get a molecule of DNA of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material , and we put it into bacteria , the bacteria , the bacteria have started reading this genetic code and produced them out of viral particles .
The viral particles are then left by cells , they &apos;re back and they &apos;re going back and they &apos;re going back and they &apos;re going to be .
I &apos;ve talked about the oil industry , say that they have certainly started to tell them that they have certainly started this model .
They have to be more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build his own hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in the big things .
We wanted to build the whole cromosome .
They are more than 580 mile lets .
So we thought we &apos;ve thought that in casses of the viruses , so that we can change the cassets of the viruses of a cell .
The design is critical , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these are going to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard of the standard was a mixy for every 10 midle .
We &apos;ve found , resequenced , 30 errors . If we had been used that sequence we &apos;ve had never been able to work .
A part of the process is designed to design segments that you &apos;re going to be sovers with all the other seged of 50 to make a little little bit of the little bit of them to make a little little bit of them .
We try to do it .
You &apos;ve probably read that we put us in the fighting .
Think of it , we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Those of those letters together codified about 20 amminoacids , and there &apos;s a specific order to letter for every amminoacids .
So we can use the genetic code to write , frash , thoughts .
What we did in the beginning is self-state to do it .
Some of them were dolphuses from the fact that it was not .
We designed these segments to be able to just just empty them .
There are a lot of them and put them together .
And we started to assembling parts , starting with the seged by five to seven thousand , unendles in order to form seged seged by 24 mila , to make them down to 72 , and they &apos;ll get it to 72 .
So , we &apos;ve produced these segments in abundance , so that we &apos;re trying to create a very bunch of , rowows , you &apos;re trying to create a very good rowoke -- like you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems the tabellon a baskin .
When we get these little little bit more than 100 myths , more than 100 thousand basis , they &apos;re going to be directly in E.
You get to the limit of the molecular biology .
So we &apos;ve looked at other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called the homologist called the homologist , which in biology , we use to reject the DNA to be able to unire the DNA to be able to unting the seasks .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinocate , it can be absorsorsorts of radiation .
You can see in the upper rightly as his chromosome is destroyed .
In 12 , hours , it &apos;s reassembled exactly like it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be completely completely .
They can live under the empty .
They are absolutely certain life in space , and you &apos;re sounds in space , and you &apos;re sounds to find new environments .
In fact , NASA showed that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule we built using these processes , just using the lievished design appropriate to put it .
The lievil absemble them .
This picture was not taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that coherent a period of about six seconds .
This is the publishing that we &apos;ve done a little time ago .
They are more than 580,000 letters .
It &apos;s the greatest molecule that has ever created by the man .
It has a high weight molecular weight .
If we &apos;re going to be a little bit with a little bit of spaces , we &apos;d like 142 pages only to transform this genetic code .
Now , how do we work it ? How can we attractive it ?
Of course , tramite a virus is a game .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria .
It &apos;s easier to be a little bit of cells like our : you can just take the nuclear nuclear and put another , which is basically the process of clonation .
In the battery , the chromosome is actually integrated within the cell , but we &apos;ve been able to do a little bit of a cromes from a cell to another and you can do a cell to another and you can do it .
We can clean a cromosome from a micbial species .
The two are different than the men from the tops .
We have a few gene in a way that we can decide what choose for this cromosome .
The then sad sounds with the analyze in a way to kill all the protein .
And when we put it in the cell was studied -- and you &apos;re appreciate , and you &apos;ll open our graphic sophisticatically -- the new cromosome is inside the cell .
And we were thinking that we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to get more in there .
This is one of the greatest mechanisms of evolution .
We found that tantissix-ssim species have added a second or a third cromosome from some of new traits to that species .
So , who think about evolution like a only gene to change what it does not have a lot of biology .
There are the analyzed dealed to be remarkable to say that they say the DNA .
The cromosome was in the cell , it &apos;s not possible .
The cell phone phone -- the chromosome we have put it up .
It &apos;s expressed , and recognized the other cromosome , and he recognized the other cromosome , and we found us with only the cell and the new cromosome .
It has become blue because of the genes we have put .
And in a short short of time , all the characteristics of a species are gone , and it turned into a new species , based on the new software that we put in the cell .
All the protein are changing , members are changing , and when we read the genetic code is going to what we &apos;ve transfered .
Now , this may seem like , but it &apos;s going to be a genetic alchemical way .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that here is -- but of progress from three million years and a half million years and a half million years of evolution , and I &apos;ve already said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of Cambrian process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s very obvious , when we think about our need .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion and a half billion people to nose in the next 40 years .
Right for an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each other in 1946 , 40 years , there are going to be four .
We &apos;re going to have problems now to find food , water and pulled , medical medical medical and wellin for six billion and a half billion people .
It &apos;s going to be more dying to do it for nine .
We use more than five billion fuel , more than 30 billion bars , more than 30 billion bars .
That means 100 million barlian a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replace them , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
We need to realize that all of the CO2 emission from these materials that finds in the atmosphere .
And in today , thank you to the scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the components of the future .
The electronic industry has only a dozen about components , and think about some different things are solved out .
Our limits here are data here , principles from the biological reality and the imagination .
Now we have now now , because of these methods of synthesization , able to create what we call a combinatory genomic .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million cromes a day .
Think of processing these 20 million different genes or trying to optimize the processes to produce optimize their own vaccines , we can change , and create more biology molecular biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemical production or fuel , production of vaccines .
This is an instant instant of some software programming that we &apos;re working to be able to be able to sex and design species at the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t necessarily know how they &apos;re going to be .
We know exactly what they &apos;re like their genetic code .
We are now focusing on the fuel coal generation .
You also have seen you that extract ethanol from the grain was an experiment .
We have a lot of second and third generation that they &apos;re using enough to be able to be on the covering or different kinds of butanle as they or different types of butanle .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increase the cost of food and limlimaries that we have to turn the CO2 in matter , so we &apos;re working for for the system , and we &apos;re working for designing cells that can achieve this purpose , and we think we can achieve this purpose , and we think we can achieve this purpose , and we think we can achieve this purpose , and we think we &apos;re working for the first generation in about 18 months .
The solar light with the CO2 is a metode -- but in our discoveries in the world , we found different metods .
This is a organism that we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
It &apos;s going to be in the ocean , about 2,500 feet of the webollition of the water .
It &apos;s making a methane by using hydrogen molecular as a source of energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can ing the CO2 , which can easily be transported by your own way , converted that CO2 in the fuel , to drive this process .
So we can think we might be able to be able to increase what the question of what the question is , &quot; and we have the destruction of the food industry .
ExExchange . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can ?
It would be a major source of energy .
And we &apos;re working on to use the same methods to create vaccines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with influence , we &apos;ve always come back to a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s about the vaccine .
I think what you can change building combinable vaccines in anticipate .
Here &apos;s the future may start looking at the future may start looking at , now , the tree of evolution , accellyating evolution with the synthetic bacteria , and finally cells .
We are so so that we have to improve people .
Our purpose is to do in a way to live enough to try to make it . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the most quickly possible , some fundamental work , in the new technology that we brought to the Microsoft in the following . This is exactly Seadragon .
This is a environment that you can interact is to be at local level that remoon with a huge amount of visual data .
We are seeing a lot of different gigabyte of digital pictures with a kind of digital pictures with a kind of breakthrough , and continue , for a little panoramic , , we want to .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these data are these pictures of data or images .
Most of the digital photographs , but this for example , but this for example , it &apos;s a provenient scanning of Congress , and it &apos;s going to the gamma .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that limited the presents of a system like this is the number of plxel on your screen in any time . It &apos;s also a very flessible architecture .
This is a whole book , not images .
This is the Casa desolate of Dickens . Every colonna represent a capture .
And so to show you that it &apos;s just about and not images , we can do something like that , to see that it &apos;s about a real representation of the real representation of the text , not a picture .
It may be a little artificial way to read a electronic book .
I don &apos;t tell you .
This is a most realistic example . This is about a number of The Guardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a seat .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the good experience of reading the real caracy version of a metheme or a daily kind of a half .
We also did something with the corner of this number of the Guardian .
We &apos;ve created a high resolution -- much more high-resolution than that you use in a normal publishing -- and we put you in a normal content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this car , you can see here .
Or other models , or even specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to get the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that this means to be able to put up to people , and to other porcheries , I don &apos;t have to be need to be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say we have to give you in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States Sovrappy picture .
So we go to something else .
This is actually on the Web ; you can go to see it .
This is a project called Photosynth , who fight two different technologies .
One is Seadron and the other is a visual research at the computer that we &apos;ve been done by Noah Seadrupon , with the help of Steve Seitz and Rick SSSSS, and Rick Szeliski &apos;s a very interesting game .
And it &apos;s from the website , management from Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from a picture to the other and have this kind of experience of resolution .
But the space of the images here here has actually a meaningful .
The algorithms of the computer have recorded these pictures together , so that I &apos;m going to be able to imagine -- all the time you see the real places that the you see -- all the next to the Montagne Rocciose besks -- they &apos;re taken . So you see the elements of a re-re-stable , or try try and these things are all connected .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data of Noaham -- and this is that there &apos;s a very much of Photosynth that we &apos;ve done work for the first time the summer time the first time , the technology , the key , the technology , the technology , the technology , the Photosynth of the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology ,
We had to worry about the legal aspects and they &apos;re going to be going to be worried about .
This is a reconstruction of the Cacacactic tic Cacacactual images from Flickr . Bae Bae . And you get images of the campaiged , other campets and you get images in the magliet , and so on .
So , they &apos;re all images from Flickr and they &apos;re all linked to this way .
And it &apos;s possible to be a very simple way .
You know , I &apos;d never thought to end up to work for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifically , you have this kind of accounts here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of different types of photocaming : from those cell cell phone to those professional .
And if I can , try to try to look at those more strike .
Many of you are blocks from , etc .
And it &apos;s a number of photographs -- eccold .
This is a Nobody poster .
We can go from the physics of this environment .
The point is that we can do things with the social environment . This is taking data from the entire memory . This is taking data from the entire memory of the world , from the visual point -- and connects all those data together .
All those pictures are getting connected together , greater than the sum of the parts .
You have a model of the earth .
Think about this as a prolungation of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complex complex as people are using it , and the whose are going to be able to be who are going to be on with the use .
Their pictures are married with meadmit from other people .
If you &apos;re going to have the idea of contrast all these sant things that they said , my picture of the Those of Nobody three Dame suddenly , you can use them to be a lot of ingress , and I can use it for immerse me in that space , and I can use the photos of the universe , using the pictures of anyone else , and have an experience of the kind of &quot; cross-to-cross-to-.
Of course , a consequence of this is virtual models , very extremely elaborate of every interesting land , collective not only from the planks and satellite images and satellite images and that &apos;s a memory .
Thank you very much .
CA : I think it ? What your software is going to be doing is that at a certain point , in the next few years , all the photographs , all the photographs that you &apos;re all all all the pictures of the world will be basically connected with ?
BAA : Yes . What &apos;s doing is practices .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , you know , in images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the remarkable information that many of these images can be .
As you do a research research on the Web , you digit a frase and the page of the Web has a lot about the Web has a lot of information about the pictures .
Now , what happens if that picture is connecting to all your pictures ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of remarkable interconnecting that it &apos;s really huge . It &apos;s a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the pleasure of the most of the dolpheric research is that we can live between who don &apos;t forget the people who have no forged the antic .
Well , you think that the sciaman Jaguar , and the idea that the world &apos;s Lattea , or that the old old Inuit &apos;s still cold of meaning , or that in Himalaya , the distant of the Dharma , the most of the Dharma , to remember the central anthropology of anthropology , and the idea that the world we have no solute solute solute solute model of the anthroughout , but it &apos;s just a model of the model of the model of the SSSSSSSSSSSSSSharmites ,
The consequence of a particular set of choices that our stirpe has done , well or bad , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the extra action .
We all all of the hidden .
We are subjects to reach of the beginning .
We need to deal with the inesorability of death , so we don &apos;t surprisingly surprisingly , and we &apos;re looking at --
We all have a art .
What it &apos;s the particular rhythm , the rhythm of the dance of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that are the Penan of the Borneo , or the follow of the Voodoo , or the guerriers of the Saiti , or the guerriers of the Sahara , or a campaign in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my company company in desert a month ago , or a month ago , or an evator of yak in Qomolangle , on the Middle , the mother of the world .
All these populations are teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And , if you think a moment , it &apos;s a concept that it can give you hope .
Insides , the miriades of cultures are creating a race of the world are created a spiritual life and cultural that wanted the planet and it &apos;s important for the planet , like the biological race .
And you can think about this cultural race as a very ethnosphere and you can call the ethnosphere , and you can call the whole whole whole whole concepts , inspiration , ideas , inspiration , ideas , inspiration , intuition with the analyze of the consciousness .
The ethnosphere is the great patriage of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be as a kind of inquisitive .
And because of course , the biosphere was just just just just just successful to be able to be able to be very quickly .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the orlo of the cloyst of the sumintion because it &apos;s filled , or -- in the most apprecise of biological diversity . And you don &apos;t even get a little bit of biological diversity .
The one of that is , obviously , the language .
When you &apos;re born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not composted only from a bunch of rules or a series of rules .
A language is the Singenhy of human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle of the way that the animate of every culture comes in the world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a bunch , a thought , a spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we are here sitting in Monterey , at least half the people are not subsurrated in the ears of the kids .
They don &apos;t get teacher to kids , which means , less that you know , not a camband something that they &apos;re already died .
What is more trad of the most trad of being being the silence , of being the last talking a language , of the last to talk about a language , of the kids or anticipate the promises of the kids ?
This orring is the state of somebody in some of the world every two weeks : every two weeks , every two weeks , a few weeks , and it leaders with the last last last little bit of a language .
And I know somebody of you will tell you , &quot; Is it better ?
The world would not be a better place if we just leave all the same language ? &quot; All right , we &apos;re talking about yoruba .
We talk about kogs .
You &apos;re going to have a trait of what it means to be able to talk about their language .
I &apos;d like to do a journey through the ethnosh --
a little journey in the ethnosphere to give you a bit of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , &quot; different ways of existing . &quot; I mean , &quot; I mean , very different ways of existing .
We take for example this bimbo Barasana , in Amazon , the people of anaconda , which crees to create the midance of the walls of the river in the panish pants of the grade of the pockets .
It &apos;s a people that &apos;s not able to distinguish the color of the blue blue from the green because the time is identified in the time of the forest , which depends on the people .
They have a language and a bunch of shriage , deaf , deaf , &quot; and you have to be a different language .
This is all this roots in the past mitological , but the particolarity is that in these families that they &apos;re talking about six or seven ing-the-up , no language .
They &apos;re just just listening and then they start talking to .
We take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived , the Waorani of Ecuador EEEEEast , a incredible populations that had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missioned , they tried a little bit of a copyright .
They &apos;ve done down on the top photographs that they return them to the race that this people who were removed , forest that this people who have never seen anything of bi-dimensional forest .
They collected the pictures from the earth , they &apos;ve been taken to the form or a figure and , not by by the way , and they &apos;re not going to be a diavy , and killed the five missionaries with the lance .
But the Waorani don &apos;t kill only the foreign .
They killed between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by their own .
We &apos;re saved at eight generations and we found two natural death and when we have been born for know , they put them that one of them was inveced , and then they killed it , and then they killed it .
The caudiences were able to recognize the animal urine that we &apos;re recognize the species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I &apos;ve been assigned a really interesting job when my Harvard professor , he asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to Haiti in the basic secret of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the guned hurt .
For a sense of a miracolous , I should understand the culture Vodoun and that Voodoo is not magic .
It &apos;s quite a complex view view of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the big religion of the world , what would you say ?
Cristian , Islam , Buddsm , Ebraism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has no faith . And instead , and the Voodoo is not the other than the distilled to these religious concepts of these religious concepts in the tragic tragic .
What &apos;s interesting is that it &apos;s interesting is the relationship between life and death .
So , the alive you &apos;re going to be .
The spirits can be invocated by the Grands Actually , they respond to the dance of the dance and replace to replace that for a short short , and they replace the following the following .
And so that &apos;s the dooists like to say , &quot; You go to go to talk about God .
We go into the temple and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re going to have , is the spirit that you can do it ?
So you see these incredible events : following the voodoo in state of trance that touch are going to be able to be able to be a very strong strong , very strong , very strong the power of the mind in the body , when it &apos;s catalyzed .
And in all the people with the most extraordinary people who have been in the most extraordinary are the Kogi Santa Marta , in Colombia .
I &apos;m going to be a little bit of the franna who were living on the carrying plant on the Purch of the Colombia , the people who are going to be on the volcanic , that you can get on the plant plant , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , they &apos;re going to be on the plant plant ,
In a bunch of blood , this people who never had been conquisted by the spacacting spage-to-spags .
And in fact , we have been by a clero , but they &apos;re actually really extraordinary .
The young people are following their families to three or four years , and live secrets in a world , and they live secret in the world of the fold .
Two years of the nine years choices to reproduce the nine months of gestation that transform in the user of mother , now are metaphor in the user of the Grands of Mather .
For this time , they are acculturated to the values of their society , values that they &apos;re going to see that their prayers and only their prayers and only their prefent balance -- or to say the exist -- or to say the ecological balance .
And the term of this incredible initiation , they &apos;re suddenly brought out and for the first time in life , at the age of 18 years , they see an alba . And in that moment of the first bulb , when the sun the sun of the beautiful landscape , and they &apos;re going to be been talking about the right right right .
&quot; Do you know , I &apos;m saying .
It &apos;s amazing . Now it &apos;s right to you . &quot;
They call them the most people , and they say that we , fratings , we are the destruction of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the indeed populations and the environment we invoon the environment , and the old story of the selselling history , which is a conceiver in its simplicity or invoon . And we say that these people are closer to the Earth of us .
The Indies are not , they &apos;re not , they &apos;re not , they weather , they have been dancy .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the paludes of Asmat the Asmat the Tibet , but because of the time and we have created a mystic mystic of the Earth is not about the conceiver of the idea of the idea of the idea of the things that the conception can be able to be because it &apos;s just infected by the knowledge of human knowledge .
What does it mean ?
It means that a little bit of Ande who &apos;s grown up with the mountain is a spirit of the mountain is a human spirit , and it &apos;s going to be a depty different with the mountain or that place with the mountain or that place that you can create a very different race with the mountain or that you &apos;re going to be scaves .
That &apos;s the dimate of a spirit or a mineral is irrippping .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individuals and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia Britannica believe that forests were going to be cut .
And that has been a different human from my friends Kwaucucucl who believe that the forests are the dimora of Hukukukukukukukukle , and the downnnninal bal downnninal , the SSinitiation , the spirites that are in the Hamsa , the SSinitiation , the Southern of the beetic friends who are in the beginning of the world ,
If you start to look at these cultures can create different , you can start to understand some of them discoveries .
I took this picture to open this picture of aprile in Amazon .
Maybe some of you have heard about the ayahuh , the most powerful substance psychoactive .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuask is not the potential for the potential , but its elected . It &apos;s composite . It &apos;s composite by two elements .
On one side , this lian leag that contains a bunch of birth , hardly , hardly , and dogene , slightly houses .
And when you go to the only plant smoke that allows a little bit of the consciousness , but it &apos;s mixed with the leaving of a family of the caffection is called Psyrrrhyththful .
This plant contains , very similar to the seriotonin , dimethypppyppppyppppypppppyppppyppppppyppppppppamine .
If you &apos;ve ever seen the Yanami pulling up for the hidden , you know , you &apos;re going to be a different set of species , anchy is a methypppypppamine .
You know that dust that dust about the hike is a little bit like being shown from a shek of dipints and land on a sea and land on a sea of electricity .
I &apos;m going to be often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has taken the man who wrote the hallugly , with her discovery of the hallucinogens in the &apos; 30s in Mexico .
And I &apos;m going to be a classified of these tripamine as although you &apos;ve done , because if you &apos;re done , you can &apos;t tell anybody to be hallucinated .
It &apos;s possible to be assusumerely if you have some of chemicals that denian MAO .
Now , it &apos;s the good , the Tioline that are in this lian inbitors of MAO , the same kind of need to be able to be able to be able to be able to try to be able to be able to be about about about a different species of plants , like these people who are going to be two morfologically , but that if you combined in this way , but that if you combined in this way of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts ? ?
We use the great eufemale and the error of the error , which can revevealing .
But if we ask the Indians , they &apos;ll tell us &quot; The plants are talking about . &quot;
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of the ayaaf , which distinguished neckicely in the forest , and that we would come in in the same species .
If you ask them how they &apos;re going to be able to say , &quot; I thought that they &apos;re going to be able to be plants , of the rest of the plants , you don &apos;t know everything ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is , you take 17 variety in a night of a lar , and each other .
And you don &apos;t have graduate at Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting that contare going to contate the stami .
Now , &#91; applausers &#93; the problem is that even those of us who have heart of our own people who are in the Indies , and it &apos;s over to the world , and it &apos;s beyond .
In fact , the 20th century , in 300 years , it &apos;s not going to remember for his guerre or its technology , but rather like the one was where we stop and we abbraced and we used to abbraced , or passionate , or so , the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All the cultures , the centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibility of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux , they don &apos;t stop to be Sioux when they put it from the arco and ffreceived as Americans have no stopped to be American when they put it from the horse and hot .
It &apos;s not change or technology that threaten the integrity of ethnosphere . It &apos;s the power .
The hard hard to the domination .
And if you go to the world , you see that these are not destined to disappear .
They &apos;re living creatures and the dynamics out of the existence from forces that go beyond their ability to their own adaptment .
And it &apos;s disbust that you &apos;ve got to be in the Penan .
a nomade of Sarawak , in the southern , a people who lived in the forest to a generation , and now reduced to a generation ago , and now reduced to the servity-band , where you can see the river , where you can see the river of the rights , where you can see the river of the willilluminating that you can see the river , where the wisdom , where the nine were born , and now ,
You &apos;re ready to repair the peat the forest .
Or , in the case of the Yanomami , are the diseases that have come with the discovery of the people .
If we go on the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the hard hard hard for the policy .
As you know the genocide , the extinction of a people , is going to universal , but the ethnighttle , the destruction of the style of life , not only is to be bounding , but not just conducted , but it &apos;s going to celebrate in certain environments , because it &apos;s part of the strategy of the development of the strategy of the straty of development .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of Tibet until you &apos;re not part of the beginning .
I lost 6,000 miles from Chengdu in China , through Tibet through Tibet , coming to Lhasa young Tibet with a young young Tibet , but only came to Lhasa . I understand what the statistics we &apos;re talking about .
6,000 monuments sacrice reduced in the dust and centers .
1.2 million people killed from the military in the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical at the Panchen Lama .
The which means that it was killed to the time of the invasion .
Suo &apos;s fted with Sua Santity during the diaspora people who brought the people in Nepal .
His mother was imprisoned and her her cold was to be rich .
It was brought to hidden at the age of two years . He was born in his gonna be living without him .
The sister , who has been put it in education .
A day has inavious hot a bunch of Mao and , for this transgrsion , was put on the forced for seven years .
The pain of Tibet can be insopportable , but the spirit of the people is from the people .
And it &apos;s going to be a choice .
We want to live in the world monocromatic world or we want to take the policy of diversity ?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he died , he said that his biggest landscape was that , in our going to this vision of the world , we don &apos;t just see the whole gamma of the imagination of human imagination .
And it &apos;s a billion-year-old is exist for 600,000 years .
The Rivolution Neolitica , which has given us us us to agriculture , which has been socking to the cult of the seed , and replace to replace the poetry of the socking with the next clar , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The industrialized world has to be 300 years .
That sat story , I don &apos;t suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to deal in millencades to come .
When to these myriades of cultures are asked what they want to say to be human , they respond with 10,000 different vices .
And that &apos;s in these answers that we all discover the possibility of being what we are : a kind of aware , that has to be what we are in the people and all the gies can fix .
I took this picture on the very northern island of Baffin , when I went to cover with the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man , and this man , and the Olaya .
The dog government is not always gentile with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to stabilize our spremate , we have to have them to be in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refused to go .
The family , I &apos;m going to tempting all me , and all of his attrephones .
You have to know that the Inuit don &apos;t have the cold , they do it .
The packs in origin were made of weight in the origin in skin skin skin .
The grandfather &apos;s not a man didn &apos;t have intimidded by the night or bull that suffering .
It &apos;s gacked the pantales , it &apos;s hot , you &apos;ve hot pushed and defectly in their own hand . When I I did .
It has salive on the dog of this collist of this collifting , and when it &apos;s solid , he killed a dog .
He shake the dog and created a brillighter , with the knighttle , has been made a slice , and it &apos;s been been on the bang , and it &apos;s been on on the bang , hit .
We want to talk about horse with nothing ? &#91; Ris&#93; And this , in different ways , &#91; Applausers &#93; is the symbol of the people in the world .
In the aprile 1999 , the canadese government has reduced to the total control of a larger area of California and Texas mall of California and Texas mall .
It &apos;s their new paint . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a independent territory . Controlder all the mineral resources .
One of the splendive , as a nation-state can rere-re-re-state can rere-re-state can rere-re-state can rerere-re-state can rererere-re-re-state can rerererererererecilize with his people .
And , for finish , I think it &apos;s quite obvious to the ones of us have been in these remote areas of the planet , they realize that they &apos;re not remote .
For somebody is home .
They open seat the human imagination that they &apos;re going to be on the alyze of the time . And for us all of these kids , as the dreams of our kids , they become part of the nuda .
And we have , we have to convince , we have to convince that politicians will never be anything .
We believe that polemics --
&#91; Applausers &#93; are not lost , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the best institution to tell stories about the world . Every month our re-up .
156 countries transmitted our television dog .
Our rights are lets from millions of people .
Our work is traveling in the ethnosphere to bring our public places in the world of wonderful cultural places from which they are going to be on how they &apos;re going to be able to be able to the central anthropology , the world will be revealing for the central anthropology , and we need to find a lifetime to be a lighting world , and we need to find a lifestyle of life in a world and multiculticipate world , and they have to find a lot of the style of life in a life in a life in a life in a life of life in a
where the saggeisdom of all the people can contributing to our well-being .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some of the things I wrote in this book that I hope you &apos;ve heard and try to try to try some links , in case , you don &apos;t notice .
I want to start what I call &quot; the official dogma . &quot;
The dogma official thing ?
The dogma official society of all the West industrial society . The dogma official society , &quot; The dogma official society . &quot;
The reason , from a side side , in fact that freedom is in itself , useful , is useful , is useful , for human beings .
And the other is in fact that if we are free , each of us can act to do everything that we have our well-being , no one that we have to do everything that we have to name .
The way of massive the freedom is massive choice .
The more choices of people are , more liblow , and the greater , and the greater freedom , is their well-being .
This , I think , it &apos;s so depth in the society that nobody would dream to put it in doubt .
And it &apos;s also deped in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has been possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly great .
I lost a simple note about the conditions for inted .
In my supermarket there are 175 conditions , without contacting the 10 variety of olium , and the 12 pets you can buy for you a huge number of people who can buy for you a huge number of conditions in the inccient of the world &apos;s going to be saying that nobody of the 175 .
Here &apos;s what the supermarket .
And then you go to the electronic store , the CD store , radio , pputs , the CD , radio , plifer .
And in this single store store , there &apos;s a big number of audio .
We can make six million different combinations using the components that there are in a only store .
You have to put that there &apos;s a very much choice .
Alright fields : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all the phone services , at that they were proven by mamma that were proven from mamma Bell .
They were born the phone , you didn &apos;t buy it .
One consequence of that , in the other , it was that the phone didn &apos;t have to be .
These days are gone .
We now have a variety of phones , especially between cell phone .
Here &apos;s the phones of the future .
My favorite is in the middle , launched MP3 , cut down the nose of the hidden , and forth for the crossing me .
If you don &apos;t have seen in the store store , you &apos;re going to be able to be able to be .
And what the end is that people get in the store and ago , you know what &apos;s the answer ? The answer is ? The answer is &quot; No .
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t have too too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the bull , you know , the same explosion of choices .
It &apos;s healthcare : : not going to happen in the United States that you &apos;re going to be on the doctor and the doctor you know what you have to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , &quot; Well , we could do it , or B , &quot; A has these benefits and these risks . &quot;
You say , &quot; Dr. , &quot; What should I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; You know , &quot; A has these risks , and B has these benefits and these risks . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebat , &quot; You know , what would do you do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result of the result of the malate , &quot; and expression that it looks like a beautiful thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not that one to move the fish and responsibility to take decisions from somebody knows that , and the doctor , to somebody who knows that -- and almost certainly not know -- and it &apos;s not going to be in the ideal condition to take the patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing marketing products , direct direct to people like me and you , that if you think about it &apos;s not a sense , because we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why they public them ?
The answer is that they want to ask us to ask the doctor to ask us to ask ourselves .
And so , a little bit of how we have identity is a question of choice , as you see in this way , &quot; You don &apos;t want to forced kids .
And we can reinvented us .
The thing is that every morning , at the risis , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I got to the family and a matriage , a time the perspective , a common perspective , which is almost us to be able to be able , and it started to start the most preserved .
The only one of the real choice was with , not when and not when it &apos;s doing after .
Offee , everything is really to play .
I &apos;m going to teach students , and I &apos;m going to be a lot of time .
And not because they &apos;re not because they &apos;re not because they &apos;re less diliggent .
but why are they imthoughtful , I mean , &quot; I should be going to be ? I should do it right now ? &quot;
&quot; I should be going to go back ? I &apos;ve got to think before the kids or to the career ? &quot;
They &apos;re the logorant interrogative .
And they &apos;re trying to answer these questions , even if this implica not complcomplete the companies that assigns and not get a beautiful voice to my exame .
And they have to do it .
Now , the job : we &apos;re lucky , as Carl underlying , because technology allows us to work every single day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from from the Hotel Randolph .
And I &apos;m talking about , there &apos;s a coroline , and I &apos;m not going to say that , where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t tell you , why I want to use me .
What means , this incredible freedom of choice we have about the work of this ? Is we have to continuously decide , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son &apos;s son &apos;s going to play , with cell cell phone in a pocket , and the notebsite , and the notebsite .
And even if they &apos;re all spending , every minute we see that we see our son , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; I &apos;ve got to answer this ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve got to answer this email ? I &apos;ve got to use this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is &quot; no , &quot; No , &quot; that makes the experience of the game of your son .
So , from any of the little things , things and big , objects and lifestyle , life is a question of choices .
One time the world was this : That , there were some possibility , but it &apos;s not a question of choice .
The world of today is what the world is , &quot; What &apos;s a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Supon .
The positive layers we know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative .
All this is a choice , two negative effects on people .
The first , paradoxically , is that produced instead of liberation .
And so many options between which choices , becomes very difficult to do it .
I give you an example , a significant study of the flight of flying .
A connected to the data of Vanguard , the giant society of the foundation of funds , with about a million clients , with about a million clients in 2,000 different companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offering in more , the percentage of adesion the two percent .
With 50 sources , there &apos;s 10 percent in less than when they are available to the way that they are just five . Why ?
Because with 50 sources of which choices , it &apos;s sick to decide , and choice is reduced to the intomorrow .
And in tomorrow , and still tomorrow , and of course , tomorrow , and of course , they &apos;ve never got .
You know , you know , it &apos;s not just that these old people who are going to be enough money , because they &apos;re not enough money , they want to say that the decision is so so that they lose the complex sources of the dator of work .
Not participating , they &apos;re going to be able to be able to be a lot of work , which would be very displace to be .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too choices .
And I think that &apos;s a world .
&quot; And to finish , for the ethernity : ketchup , or a maionese ? &quot;
You would like to take the right decision , if it &apos;s for the ethernity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and yet the condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that if we can avoid the paralysis and doing a choice , at the end we were less satisfacts from the result of how we would have been with less options of the way we choices .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many of the people who choose , you buy a little bit of them , and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that would be better . And what &apos;s going on . And what &apos;s going on to be better . And what &apos;s the imagined . And what &apos;s going to be better . And the remarkable to the demination of the decreation , and the foundation , and the repty refation of the deaths that we &apos;ve got to imagine that would be better .
even when it was a good decision .
The more choices there are , easier to be ununsatisfacts of any detail .
And there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has been very well , how the value we &apos;re going to think about things that we &apos;re going to think about things that we &apos;re going to do .
And the rest , when there are many options possible , it &apos;s easy to represent the characteristics of the alternative , and be less sation-dedepth of the option that you have choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m going to be with all of the ones that are not in New York .
But that &apos;s what you probably think you &apos;re probably going to think .
There &apos;s this copy to Hamptons .
A place of lusse .
Spipa splendida . It &apos;s all for them . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not going to be . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , &quot; Well , it &apos;s Agust . &quot;
&quot; Everybody my neighbors to Manhattan are on . &quot;
&quot; I could parking right in front of home . &quot;
And it &apos;s going to move on the idea that &apos;s lost -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The costo-opportunity diminures the soddisfation for what we have , even when choice was excellent .
And the more are the options that we have to think , more the characteristics of attracts , we &apos;re going to be looking for opportunities .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
We &apos;re talking about life , and maybe maybe of living in the way .
But the most important point is that anything you choose , you choose to do .
The things that we don &apos;t choose to attractive that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point , the growing spiral of waiting for .
I tried to my skin bought a new couple of jeans .
I &apos;m almost always jeans .
And once the jeans were just a guy , bought them and bought to best , they were sat , just after they brought them a lot of times , just after they brought them a lot of times , they were going to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple of new when those old were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Li wants to do it , you know , I &apos;m going to be a falled ,
You want to do it with the cernier or with the bottons ? &quot;
&quot; Li wants to be straight ? &quot;
&quot; Seight , &quot; See them wants to be a strike ? Bla &quot; &quot; Continua --
I was sent , and after a little bit I could say , &quot; I want the guy that -- that was the only guy , that was the only guy who had no idea that it was , so for a moment I was going to tell you all the people who had .
It was the very very . With all that choice .
But I was worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse , the reason I was that with all of that choice , the jans had to be perfectly .
I had no disappeared . I didn &apos;t wait for me , but when there was only a kind of , but when there was just a kind of thing , but when you saw 100 different , dents , at least like it was perfect .
What I had had been bug , but not perfect .
After I started to have that chose with what I was trying to be insoded in expectations .
The added options in life of people don &apos;t increase the waiting for those of these are respect to the excellence of the same .
And this will be less satisfation , even when the results are good .
No , no in the world of marketing is making it .
Because if they knew it , you don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is going to look like this .
&quot; It was better when it was worse , &quot; The reason you &apos;ve got better when it was worst that when you were worst that when you were worst to meet the surprise .
In the world we live in the world that we live -- opulent , industrialized addiction -- we can hope is that the most we can hope is that things are at the althetic .
You &apos;ve never surprised to be a pleasant for you , my waiting waiting , you &apos;re ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Beswawaiting . &quot;
I mean , little auty moment , I &apos;m really really really really sposed and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t have to do it .
But it &apos;s not a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of the block a couple of jeans , when there &apos;s just that kind of jeans is that when you &apos;re not satisfacts , and you ask , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who &apos;s responsible ? &quot;
The world is the responsible . What could I do you ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a disdisappear , and you &apos;re asking who is the responsible , and you ask you who is the responsible , you &apos;re like you .
You could have better .
And with hundreds of variety of variety , there are not score for success .
So when people are making decisions , even if the result is alido , they feel inssatisssssatissssatissssssed .
In the last depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only , but important -- of this honest depression is just that people have experiences for the standard are too altitude .
And when they have to explain this situation that the cold is their own .
So the final result is that we &apos;re better , but we &apos;re just going to be worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely filled .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little choice is better than that it &apos;s not going to have any of choice .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic . I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s .
But I &apos;m sure we have overed from a piece of level where the choices choices are going to be .
Now , from the politician -- I &apos;ve almost finished -- from politician , the nocy is the following .
What allows all this choice in industrial society is the wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have too choice .
The problem is that they have too paid .
So the factory I &apos;m talking about is a bad to be a bad than the modern society , remarkable society .
And what it does depressing and angry is this : Steve Levitt : Steve Levitt , and I comode seat for bimes are .
I mean , these choices , complicated and dispendiose , it &apos;s not just useful .
I &apos;m adopt deleteries .
