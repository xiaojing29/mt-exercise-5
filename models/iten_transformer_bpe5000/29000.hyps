Last year I showed these slide slide to demonstrate that the glacial calcalf , which for almost three million years , has the size of 48 , the size of 48 , the size of 48 , the ental continents , it &apos;s retrofit of 40 percent .
However this underlying gravity of the problem because it &apos;s not showing the ice of the ice .
The arctic calf is , in a sense , the clean heart of global climate system .
It expanded up and you &apos;re going to be summer .
The next slide is going to be a carlying revenement about the last 25 years .
The glaces are signed in red .
As you see , they &apos;re going to be exposed to the blue .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter , that summer ice summer .
You can see that the Soldest ice , five years or more , is like blood , that &apos;s like blood , that there was a fighting here .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been from this , in 25 years , so .
This is a problem because the interests that are interlit , the land around the arctic ocean where there are huge amount of fuels that , swarps are , transformed into meters .
I &apos;m going to be a total-warming , that amount could doubling , that amount could doubling , that amount could be doubling , super-up , that way , the amount of unring , that &apos;s going to be doubling , that it could be doubling , that it could be doubling , that it could be doubling , overe
In some deeper lagues in Alaska metan is already already relief from the water .
The Katey professor Katey Walter of University of Alaska has been recently to a team , a team , a very low low lago .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Wow ! Al Gore : You &apos;re going to be .
A reason is that this thermal exchange the Greenland from the Greenland .
This is a regime river .
The ported never reached that .
This is the Kangerlussuawarm , in the southwest of Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level to the shelf the shells on land , it &apos;s where the sea .
These currents are rapidly going up very quickly .
On the other side of the planet : Antarctica , the largest block of the planet .
Last month , the scientists have been depth that the ice is in negative , and that the West Antarctica , which pogy on some submarine islands , is particularly rapid with some submarine islands , is particularly rapid in the skiest .
It &apos;s about six feet of the ocean , like in Groenland .
Sulla Himalaya , the third largest block of ice , you see new lakes , which a few years ago .
40 percent of the world population is going to get half of the water from the swarming .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the power of this city .
The ported is increased .
But when it decreates , the same is going on to the water .
In California , snow on the Sierra Nevada is 40 percent .
The hyries are in crisis .
Sprevious , as you &apos;ve read , they &apos;re grave .
The safety growing in the world leads to a remarkable increase .
The environmental disaster disaster is increasing to a rhythm and without previous .
Four times more of the last 30 years I &apos;m not going to be the last 30 years I &apos;m going to be the last 30 years I &apos;m like to do that .
This is a whole in-sustainable .
If you look in the historical context , you can see the consequences .
In the last five years we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day .
Look at the world Pacific Pacific , the Americans , to the Americans , to the Americans , to the Indian and both parts of the Indian subcontinent , where there &apos;s a radical impoveract of oxygen in the ocean .
The largest cause of global warming , and it &apos;s a lot of it , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with more emissions , together to China .
And he prophands to build lots of other central centers .
But we &apos;re seeing a change of direction .
These are the announced projects in the last few years and some alternative proposes .
Every way , there &apos;s a policy on our country .
The oil industries have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the puzzles , which is a bone .
That image was reminds me to something --
Verice Natal , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion liers of coal waste .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen it on the news .
This is the second larger flow of the largest flat in America .
It &apos;s happened around Natale .
Sinalize advertising one of the coal industrial .
Video : Sweet the carbon is a kind of allegro and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and we grow our economy .
Frosty the carbon dioxygen is more pulied .
It &apos;s at good price , adorable and the workers keep the workers .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The largest society is Massey Coal . This is his administrator . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I &apos;m going to be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Peloses -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima Protection of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is one of them , a part .
Video : At the next to the ALergy we see climate change like a serious threat our business .
So , for our prioritize is to invest a lot of money in a publishing efforts to make public and confused the truth on the coal truth .
It &apos;s actually not sports .
We think it &apos;s pulied -- it &apos;s also a good profumo .
So you don &apos;t prefer of climate change .
Let me do .
Video : Carbon pulit -- you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
So we &apos;re doing a turn into a structure to the avanguard of the pulit .
Strorous ! Metan machines are a little noise , but this is the sound of the puzzle technology .
The coal consumption is between the major causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology that you see change everything .
You look at it : this is the puzzle odien technology .
Al Gore : I finally , the alternative positive is connected to economic question and the national security .
Video : America is in clearly ; national security economy , national security crisis .
The filter that the links is : our dependence from fossil fuels , like coal and oil .
Now , though , there &apos;s a new , audgmented solution to use .
Repower : 100 percent clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to put America to the work , make us more secure , and help stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that I drinking solution that our problems .
Repower America . Scoprite than Repower .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It &apos;s about re-energy to America .
One of the faster ways of bringing to the dependence from fuels that are killing our planet .
Comparsa : The future is here . Very , sun , a new network .
Comparsa : Noves : New York aging for jobs .
Complplease America . It &apos;s time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old lunch . A lunch of African says , &quot; If you want to go speed , go from solers .
If you want to go far , you go together . &quot;
We have to go far quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I did a LHC introduction .
And you promise to return you to get back to you about how the car works .
So , there &apos;s . And for the ones that the other time there was no , LHC is the largest scientific experiment that I &apos;ve been trying to -- 27 miles of circles .
His task is to rear the conditions that were at least least least than a billion-second from the beginning of the universe , until 600 million times a second .
This is just ambitious .
This is the car under Ginevra .
We &apos;re going to go through the magic Big Bang in the relevant .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLATLAS -- it &apos;s largo 44 meters and it has a diameter diameter of 22 meters .
This is a spectacular image of ATLATLAS in building so you can see the proportions .
Ten September 10 , we have a car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLAS .
It was caused to immense in control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first fascion of particles that he had done all the LHC , deliberately , with a part of LHC , and spread particles in the LHC , and spread particles inside the resulator .
In other words , when we saw that 10 September , we realized that the car worked , which was a great vitty .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to make us exultesting , when somebody went on on on Google and saw that the initial page was this .
That means we had a cultural impact beyond that scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the car , had to just these filters here -- these dored files .
These files 13,000 ampampampes when the car works at the very most power .
Now , the technical between you will look at the filters and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . They &apos;re too much too much subtle . &quot;
And they can do that because when they &apos;re very cold to become the depencil .
So , at least 271 degrees , at a lower temperature at the space between the stars , these files can bring that current .
In one of the giunture between the most magneets in the LHC , there was a defect of factory .
So the files are climbing a little bit , and the 13,000 ampampbits .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive , if you think these magnees fish are more than 20 tons , and that they &apos;ve moved about about 30 centimeters .
They &apos;re dumped about 50 magnees .
We had to take them , what we did .
We have them repair and wearing .
They &apos;re now going back to them to the ground .
From the end of the LHC will be a new integrate or .
We &apos;re going to accept it , and we expect data or July , and we &apos;re going to keep our data , and we &apos;re going to see what the universe is .
Now , of course , in a way , these accidents , these crashing the value of science and science and the frontier of science and the frontier .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that I can go beyond the limit , I think that &apos;s the value of things like LHC .
I &apos;d like to conclude with the words of an Inglad Davy , Humphy Davy , which , I guess , in the defense of injectations of his clean , his pupllo was Michael Farwage , he said , &quot; Not that is so dangerous for the progress of human mind as the mind as the expendent of human mind as the mind as we have conquent to the end of the finding of conquent . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start asking about rethink about when , you &apos;re playing with kids , playing with the morning .
While you &apos;re able to achieve them and grab them , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , and you &apos;re doing space relating and by doing space relationships .
Sweweweweapons is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , by the informat-inspired by the useful of our interaction with physical objects , together to my Paton , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of having the only curses of the mouse as a digital path as a digest path of mouse , we could actually have a de-bound , we could actually actually defly deaths , we can actually have information with the hands ,
and fix it to our pleasure ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building Siftool .
In a few words , a Siftool is a big interactive computer as a biscrape .
In a few words , a Siftool is a big interactive computer as a biscrape .
You can move with your hand , they can see , &quot; you can see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
But mostly , they &apos;re physical objects , like the morning , you can just move them to shoot them .
The Siftool is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physics , conscious of the movement , the other , and as they &apos;re more physics , and as they &apos;re more physics , confidence of the movement , of the other , of how we can , explore new and interaction .
I &apos;m going to start with a few examples .
This Siftool is to show video : if you start to show video : if you include it in a direction , the video will rotate so , if you start to go back .
These interactive portrait is aware of the other .
If you &apos;re releasing them , they &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re around .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can agit a little bit .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can agit a little bit .
They also have their movement and clination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was that we could use common gestures on data , for example , &quot; you put a color on the data , for example , &quot; you put a color like if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configured as a verb , and I can use them to pour green color in that central , where they misfit .
and I can use them to pour color in that central , where they measure .
We can put it too much , we can put it a bit .
You &apos;re also beautiful possibilities for learning , like languages , the mathematics and logic games where people can try things quickly , and see the results of the things quickly , and see the results right now .
I &apos;m --
This is a Fibonacci that I do with a equations program .
Here we have a words that is in half of Scarabeers and Boggle .
Basically , at every time you had a letter on every Siftapping , basically , at every time you had a letter to return a letter on every Siftapping , and while you &apos;re trying to compose words the devices of a dictionary .
And then , after about 30 seconds , you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
There &apos;s you have kids come up to the Media Lab , I did it in a way that I tried them and I turned them a video .
They &apos;ve been very much liked .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot .
You just have to say , &quot; Compons of words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s other people who try it .
This is our beta youngsters in the right there on the right .
It actually wanted to be a lot of time .
They were only morning morning , for him .
Now , this is an applying of a interactive cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool for learning . He &apos;s Felix . He &apos;s Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , lifting the Siftool with .
It can put new characters in the scene , lifting the Siftool with .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : The sun is sun .
David Merrill : Now he took a treatment in the scene .
Video : The arange treatment .
Bobs ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah .
So you shake the Siftons and put close them up can make the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing your story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a very open story , and it can decide him how you get it as a sat .
DM : It &apos;s a very open story , and it can decide him how you get it as a sat .
Video : Vake away , cat .
DM : The last example that I have time to show you is a tool , that I made to take a recent , to sample and performing music .
it &apos;s a tool , made of recently , to sample and performing music .
The Siftable here are on sounds like the base , low and the battery .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose what you can use .
You can also put these sounds on a compose of your pleases .
And it just by making it a sound and a sequence .
These are actually you can control from alive , like the reverse and the filter .
The acks to a particular sound and then incline for the way .
And then there are the general effects as time and volume , that you apply to the entire sequence .
Let &apos;s look at how it works .
Video : DM : We &apos;re going to start a very much in two Siftool &quot; sequence , we put it in a series , we &apos;re going to extend , we add another base .
Now , I &apos;m going to put a line .
Video : DM : I &apos;m going to adding percussions --
Video : And I &apos;m going to put the battery on the battery , so I can control the effect of alive .
Video : DM : I can reveal the whole sequence of time from one side or the other .
Video : And now I &apos;m going to add the bottom to the bottom to give more expression .
Video : DM : I can reach the sequence &quot; to the sequence . &quot;
So I didn &apos;t have to plan it first , but I can suddenly make it a long or more correct .
And now , finally , I can smoking the whole sequence of inclining the entire sequence of the volume .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new human human human human interfaces and more resembling like our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some possibilities that we &apos;re trying to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to transmit is that we &apos;re going to take this new generation of the design objects to interact with digital media , that we want to bring information in our world .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time to talk to you .
I &apos;m a writer .
Sort books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the fascinating of my life .
And I don &apos;t expect to change .
But , he said , something particular , has been successful in my life and my career , who brought me to get the entire relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called &quot; Mangia , &quot; Prega , &quot; Am , &quot; which , diversously , from my previous books , for some reason , in some reason , in the world , and it became a great feeling , interventions .
And the result is that everywhere , now , people treat me as if I was conviction .
It &apos;s true -- conducted , conducted !
They &apos;re going to be now worried , and they say , &quot; Do you have no fear to do better ?
You don &apos;t fear to go and write all of life without being able to create a book that can matter to someone ? &quot;
that can matter someone ? &quot;
It &apos;s reassuring , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a writer .
I would go to the same reaction based on the fear .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you feel the track of you couldn &apos;t have successful ?
You don &apos;t fear that the humiliation of refigured ?
You don &apos;t fear to do this mresults for all of life without anything that you ever come out and to die on a cumb of dream with the mouth of the cumpty ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : &quot; Yeah . &quot;
Yes , I fear of all that .
I &apos;ve always had fear .
And I also have fear of lots of other things that people can &apos;t inform .
How the algagae and other things .
But , as I think about writing what I thought and I &apos;m wondering about , why is it ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logical that anyone should be expected to be very friendly with a work that you feel sent to do .
But what is there &apos;s a particular particular , in the creative impression of the mental health as elsewhere in a way that other careers do they don &apos;t do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don &apos;t remember one time in his 40 years of activity in which he asked if he was afraid to be engineer ?
There was never -- that that block of engineer John , how does it go ?
It didn &apos;t work that , you know ?
Onestly , chemicals are not certainly , in centuries , in centuries , earn the reputation of being alcohhhhhhit .
We have a writers of this reputation , and not just just creative writers but creative of all kinds of , we have this reputation of being huge instable to be huge instables .
And it &apos;s not something else you look at the sad , the magnifies of creative people that only in the 20th century , they &apos;re going young and often die for them .
And the ones that are not suicked to be really disdisted by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , &quot; Every book book has been killed a little bit more &quot; A remarkable to the work of your life .
But we don &apos;t track when we feel it because we &apos;ve heard these things so long that in a way we have completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and the suffering are in some way of the relevant that the notion , at the end , it will always constraints to the angosk .
And the question I want to ask everybody to ask to ask to ask everybody here today is : are you with this idea ?
It &apos;s OK , because it also looks at a centimeter to me , it &apos;s not good for me .
I think it &apos;s hdious .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous , and I don &apos;t want to see it in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our big creative minds .
And certainly I know that , in my case -- in my situation -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to the support of the support of support support , where I &apos;m in my career .
That &apos;s true -- you look , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m a lot of time .
I &apos;ve got about four work work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything I &apos;m going to write about the world , as the work that he came out after the world , as I was going to be judged by my last book .
I &apos;m going to be a little bit of friends here -- it &apos;s likely that my greatest success is in my own shoulder .
Oh , Gesu , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start drink of the nine in the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would keep on doing this work that we work that we love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it seems to me , after a lot of reflective reflective , that the way to work to continue writing is to create a protective psychological , OK ?
I have to find a sense of security between me , that I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxiety that &apos;s going to be writing , and I was trying to do for all last year models of how to do this , I started looking through through time , trying to find other societies , more healthy ideas and more healthy ideas more more healthy ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthy ideas .
how to help people manage the creative creative creative inherent risks .
And that research has taken me to the ancient and ancient Rome .
Slow me because it comes back in circle and then it comes back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity selling creativity selling creativity selling creativity selling creativity from men , OK ?
It was thinking about creativity was this spirit looks divine and that it &apos;s the spirit looks at the men from a few distant and unknown , for distant and unknown .
The Green calls us these spirits dians are looking at creativity .
Socrate , wonderful , he believed to have a demon that elargive wisdom from far .
Romans were the same idea , but they called that kind of spirit without a genius .
which is great , because the Romans didn &apos;t really think a genius was a genius of them were very intelligent .
They believed that a genius was this kind of divine that he lived in literally living in the walls of a little bit of the artist , a little bit like the artment of the artist , and it came out of the work of that artist &apos;s work and modeling the result of that work .
Exctional -- that &apos;s , that &apos;s the distance of which I &apos;m talking about -- that that psychological construct that you protect from your work .
And everybody knew it was , so it worked , right ?
So the antiks were protected by certain things , as the way , for example , too narcism , right ?
If your job was exceptional you couldn &apos;t take it all the deserves , everyone knew that you were helped by this genius .
If your failure job , it was not all your own , it was not all your mind , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a unable .
And so people have a creativity in the West for a long time .
And then the Rinissance came and everything , and it changed this big idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe above all the mysties and without more to let space at the mitize creatures and they &apos;re desk by divinity .
This was the principle of the rational principle and people started to think that creativity came out of idivided .
And for the first time in history , you start this to reference this artist or that artist as a genius that artist , rather than a person with the genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think that allows someone , a simple person to believe to be as a recient as a source , as a source , and the source of all the divine mysteries , creative , unknown and unknown , unknown and unknown and a lot of human pocket to give at the fragile pon , human page .
It &apos;s how to ask someone to enjoy the sun .
I &apos;m distorce and completely distorce and creates all these kinds of ingespan performance .
And I think it was a pressure to destroy artists .
And , if this is true , and I think it &apos;s , the question is , and now ?
Can we do it diversously ?
Maybe you go back to a more understanding of human relationship and mystery .
Or not .
Maybe we can &apos;t take 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience who would be reading scientific suspects on the notion of scientific suspects on the notion of , you do that follow people are willing to do the flow on their projects .
I &apos;m not going to convince you all about this thing .
But the question I &apos;d like to ask is -- why isn &apos;t it ?
Why wouldn &apos;t you think about this way ?
Because it has more sense of anything else that I &apos;ve ever heard to explain the explanation of the creative process .
A process that , as anyone who has ever tried to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- you don &apos;t understand rational .
And , in fact , it can look completely paranormate .
I &apos;ve done this recently recently , with the extraordinary Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years old , but it was a poet for all life and he said to me in the rural of the Virginia , working in the field , and he felt it , in the camps , and he felt it , inside the Virgy , and he felt it in the landscape .
He said it was like a frageous wherever .
And that was going to be rotating to her landscape .
He felt it , because he could make the land under his feet .
He knew that I had one thing to do at that point and it was of , he said , &quot; run as a match . &quot;
And he was going to home and he was followed by this poem , and he wouldn &apos;t have to get any of paper and a match , it would not have to get it to take a piece of paper and a match , it would collect it it to the page .
Other time he couldn &apos;t be fast , so corrective , so corrective and correcreceive without getting to the house and she would continue to the roled through the landscape , trying , and he kept the path and she would continue to rotate through the landscape , trying , he said , &quot; another poet . &quot;
And then there were those times -- this piece I never forget -- there were moments when there were a moments when there were almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was trying to paper and poetry , and the poem through , and he said , he was going to go through , and he said , he was like he leaving with the other hand and the hand .
And he was the poem from the tail and he would put it in his body and transmitted it on the page .
And in these cases , poem would be presented on the perfect page , but counter-contrary , from the last word to the first .
So when I was thinking -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly the same as a big process .
Not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conduction !
I &apos;m a mulo , and my way of working is ; wake up to the same orary every day and go and go through it and get it over the himself and get it over the goodness .
But even I , in my testardaggin , I striscied against that thing , sometimes .
And I guess a lot of you have the han done .
You know , even if the work and ideas came to me from a certain source of the source , I could not be honestly aware .
What is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it in a way we don &apos;t do the mind , but rather , what do you do with , but rather , what do you do we &apos;re going to stay healthy , but rather , what do we can &apos;t have the way to get the head , but rather , what do we &apos;re going to be healthy ,
As I am as a best example of the same time I have the Tom Waits , which I interviewed several years ago .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of the life was the incarnation of the artist that was a tormented by the art of the scary , trying to control , and to domininitized species .
But then he invecked , he hat , and he was driving on a highway in Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
It was going fast and it all of a very much , a framition of this little melody , coming in his head as inspiration , elusive and hallecking , and the desiddle , and the desider , but it doesn &apos;t know how to get it .
It doesn &apos;t have a match , it doesn &apos;t have a match , it has no matched recorder .
So it starts to feel this kind of old anxiety , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to go up with this way from even .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to be in the panic , he stopped .
And he got the whole mental process and he did something completely new .
He just looked at the sky and he said , &quot; I &apos;m not going to see what I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Do you look like to write a song now ?
If you really want to be , it &apos;s going to be a more hurt when I can take care of you .
Every , you &apos;re going to importing somebody else today .
You &apos;re going to disturbing Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his work process changed after this .
Not the job , the work was still dark as always .
But the process , and the fish that was repair that was released to the genius , the genius outside he causes it . The genius that was going to get out of the problems and liberated it back to the place where it was doing , that it wasn &apos;t going to be a interorized thing , and torure .
but it &apos;s not Tom .
So , how I felt that story started to change a while I was working on and already saved me , and I &apos;d save me once .
This idea , he saved me when I was writing , &quot; Prega , &quot; and fall in a of the cave of the disppppage that we &apos;re all working on , and you start to think that it &apos;s going to be a disaster , that it &apos;s going to be a disaster , that &apos;s worst book .
Not just good , the worst book writing .
And I started thinking about to get this project .
But then I remember Tom talked about the air and I tried .
So I got up on my face on on the manoscriticize and I was getting my comments to a vacuum corner .
And I said , &quot; Well , what we know , both , we know that if this book will not be very brilliant , it &apos;s not going to be very hillie , no ?
Because as you see , I &apos;m putting all , I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to introduce you and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know , you don &apos;t know anything .
I &apos;m going to write the same , because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to be recorded that I was presented to do my part , &quot; Because it &apos;s the end , OK -- centuries do it in the deserts of North Africa people were rown up with a , dance and brings that went on for hours , and to sacred that they went on on on on to the dance .
And they were always magnifies , because the dancers were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every time , it was a lot of these artists was going on , and one of these artists became actually transmitter .
And I know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know that you &apos;ve all seen , at a point , a performance .
It was like the time stopped , and the dancer walks through a kind of portal , and it was not going to do anything else else , but it was all in the way , but it was all the way it was in .
And suddenly it &apos;s just like a human .
But he turned out to the divinity of divinity .
And when this was going on , at the time , people knew what was , they called him .
He was , they started to sing , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , God , &quot; God , &quot; God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curious notes -- when the Mori invaser the south of Spagna , preserve this habits with them and the ready to change in the centuries of the Allah , Allah , &quot; which you can &apos;t hear in the corride or flamenc .
In Spen , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , the ones , Allah , magnificent , he is a bringing , he &apos;s a shelf of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes next day , for the dancer itself , when you wake up and you see it , and you find out that are the 11 in the morning of Martedday and the God &apos;s not there .
It &apos;s simply a lot of hurt to the ginocnees , and maybe it can &apos;t be able to each of that altitude .
And maybe nobody will sing the name of God &apos;s God still while it comes , and what is to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most pain of reconciliations to do in a creative life .
But it &apos;s not to be so anges if you can &apos;t believe , you &apos;re not going to believe , advanced , the most extraordinary aspects of your being from you .
But it just creates you &apos;re in a very quickly piece of a very unimaginable source of this team of your life that you have to go to someone else when you finish it .
And , you know , if we think it &apos;s all about it changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s certainly as I thought about it for several months in the book , I &apos;m going to do this , dangerous , dangerous , attempted , and we follow it on my great success .
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel electrized by this is , I don &apos;t fear .
Not just foot you . It &apos;s just your job .
Continugly presented for your side , any can be .
If your job is dancing , dance .
If the divine , absurd genius assigned decides to leave some kind of wonderful , for one by the time through your wild , then , then &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Otherwise , you do the same dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot; to you the same .
I think , and I think you have to teach it .
&quot; Ole ! &quot; to you the same , even for having the human love and testarage and testardaggin , you know , you know ,
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
You know , I &apos;ve talked about some of these human plans on what can mean and discovery of new genes .
We &apos;re starting a new path : we start digitize biology and now we start to digital biology and now we &apos;re going to a new phase of biology , designing and synthesizing life .
We &apos;ve always tried to ask big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; is something that many biologists do believe that many biologists attempted to understanding various levels .
We tried different approaches , reduce it to the minimum .
We &apos;re looking for for about 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the analogy world to the digital world .
Now , we can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome that can authoretic genome in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little smaller .
We can actually eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 that are here .
But when we take a look at his metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our .
I think , that &apos;s simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it &apos;s very improbable that this can bring to a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to move to the design was synthesize this chromosome that we could change the components to take some of these basic questions .
And so we started the adventure of &quot; &quot; Can we synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Can you have a chemistry consentence to produce these big molecules that we never have been able to create the first of time ?
And , in case , can we make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is simply a piece of chemical material .
The speed with which we can digitize life is growing up exponential ,
Our ability to write the gene code , instead , design , rather slowly , but it &apos;s improving .
And our most recent results take it to a exponential curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process has required , starting with a biotic reviews before we started with a biotic reviews before we started .
But we found out that we &apos;re synthesize of DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that producing little DNA , the long DNA , the long length of 30 to 50 letters , and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the most mixture is long , more mistakes there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments and correct the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , starting by digital information from the genome of Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a small virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the framments , we &apos;ve designed the correction of the mistakes and got a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material that &apos;s inherent and we put it in the bacteria , they have started reading this genetic code and make viral particles .
The viral particles , then you &apos;ve got back from cells , they &apos;re going back and they &apos;re destroying the Eccoli .
I talked about recently with the blast , and I talked about it , and they certainly realized that they have certainly understood .
They have been slow more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build its same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things larger .
We wanted to build the entire chromosome of bacteria .
They &apos;re more than 580 thousand genetic code .
So we thought to build it in the cassette of the virus , so that we can change the cassette to understand what the components of a living cell .
Sation is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these are to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard accuracy was a mistake for every 10 mies .
We found out , resequencing it , 30 errors . If we had that original sequence we never would be able to do it .
A part of the process is designed segments for long as 50 letters that overwhelming with all the other segments of 50 to put a 50 letter to build smaller substitutes to build smaller that work together .
We &apos;re trying to give a unic elements here .
You &apos;ve probably read that we put a fire in the side .
Think about it , we have a gene code on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters together about 20 amminds , and there &apos;s a specific order to letters for each among acid .
So we can use the genetic code to write , frash , thoughts .
What we did at the beginning was self-reating .
Some people have been delused by the fact that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
We designed these segments to get them to unquire them with enzyme .
There are enzymes that they &apos;re releasing them , and they put them together .
And we started assembly of parts , starting with five to seven mix segments , and we started with a half a letter , to make them a way to form segments of 24 mies the letters to them to get to 72 mila letters .
At each step , we &apos;ve made these segments in abundance , so that we could sequence it sequence it , because we &apos;re trying to create a very well process process process process that we &apos;re trying to create a little robust .
We &apos;re trying to automatically do this .
So , this seems the toxes of a basket .
When we get these very long segments , more than 100 thousand basis , it doesn &apos;t grow more directly than the E.
You get to the modern molecular biology .
So we &apos;ve been considered .
We knew another mechanism called the &quot; romological Romological repair to repair the DNA that can undo the DNA segment to unire the DNA that we can unquire segment .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , can absorpy three million rad rad of radiation .
You can see in the upper riquid as his chromosome is destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours it &apos;s reassembled exactly as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely completely .
They can live under empty .
I &apos;m absolutely sure life exist in space , and you can find new environments of water .
Actually , NASA has shown that this is going .
This is a molecule image that we have built using these processes , simply using these processes , simply using these processes of segments to put .
The hell them automatically .
This image was not taken with a electric microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It &apos;s a molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the publishers that we did a long time ago .
They &apos;re more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the largest molecule molecule that &apos;s ever created by man .
It has a molecular weight weight .
If we &apos;re going to be with a carpet of 10 without spaces , we &apos;d just like 142 pages to only transform this genetic code .
Now , how do we do it work ? How can we activate it ?
Obviously , you know a virus is a kids .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s easier to be even when it comes from eucarily cells as our : you can simply get the nuclear or put another , which is basically the process of cloning .
In the archaea of chromosome is integrated in the cell , but we recently demonstrated that we can make a complete trapizing of a chromosome from one cell to another and to activer it .
We can relieve a chromosome parent .
The two are different than men from tops .
We &apos;ve added a few gene more in a way that we can decide what to choose for chromosome .
He then swarm with the enzymes so that it &apos;s going to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was rapped -- and you &apos;re apprecisely our graphic graphic graphic graph -- the new chromosome is gone into the cell .
And we were thinking that we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried anyway .
This is one of the biggest mechanisms of evolution .
We found that a lot of these species have added a second or a third chromosome somewhere , add a third chromosome , and you add in a second thousands of new traits .
So who thinks about evolution as a gene once you change has no longer understand much of the biology .
There are enzymes called a restriction enzymes that even digit &apos;s the DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell , it doesn &apos;t have one .
The cell phone -- the chromosome that we have a path it .
He &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other chromosome as a material , it has been extreo , and we found out with only the cell and the new chromosome .
It became blue because of the genes that we have put .
And in a short time , all the characteristics of a species are lost , and it &apos;s transformed in a new species , based on the new software that we put in a new species , based on the software that we put in the cell .
All the proteins have changed , members have changed , and when we read the genetic code exactly what we have to do is .
Now , this may seem to be genetics , but by by by by making the software we can change the things in a pretty substanti-substantial .
Now , I &apos;ve been explained that you don &apos;t talk about genesus -- but progress from three million years and a half years of evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the Cambriana in which you &apos;re going to create new species based on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s obvious when we think about our need .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now , there are three people on the planet for each one in 1946 ; in 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medical , gas and gas for six billion and gas .
It &apos;s going to be more harder to do it for nine billion .
We &apos;re using five billion coal-billions of oil coal , more than 30 billion lights .
That means a hundred million barreles a day .
When I call to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replace them , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to realize the CO2 emission from these materials that ends up in the atmosphere .
First of the day , thank you to the scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that the designs for the future .
The electronics industry , only has a dozen about components , and think about how many different things are come out .
Our limits here are data , principle , and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , thank you very , thank these methods of synthesization , and we call the combinatory genomics .
We can build a big robot that can produce a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think about processing these 20 million genes or try to optimize the processes to produce it or drugs , new , vaccines , we can change , thank you a small team , and create more molecular biology that in the last 20 years .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can pick for survival , chemical production or chemical production , or fuel production ,
This is a few software instantanezes that we &apos;re working to be able to seat and design species at us .
Well , we don &apos;t know how they &apos;re going to be .
We know exactly how their gene code .
We &apos;re now focusing on the fourth generation .
You also saw you that extract ethanol from the grain was a finished experiment .
We have depending on the third generation and third generation that will be used enough to be very soon from the zuckin , or different kinds of butanle , like they &apos;re or different kinds of butanle .
But the only way biology can have a big impact without increasing the cost of food and limestone of food and limestone that we &apos;re working to design cells that are so far to design cells that can achieve this purpose , and we think we can have the first charge of the first fourth generation in about 18 months .
Spanish with CO2 is a metodo--- but in our discoveries around the world , we found a different metods .
This is a organism that we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , about 2,500 feet depth to the webulllizes of water .
It creates from CO2 using molecular using molecular as a molecular source .
We &apos;re trying to figure out if we can start the CO2 , which can easily be transported by the path , convert that CO2 in fuel , to drive this process .
So , we could think that we could be able to increase what the basic question of what life is &quot; is we can , versus the most of the chemical goal .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do this from TED , where can you do it from TED ?
It would be a major source source of energy .
And , we &apos;re working to use the same metods to create instantly vaccines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with the flu , we &apos;re always forth of a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s about to find the right .
I think it can change this can change building combinable vaccines in a lot .
And that &apos;s how the future could start to change , now , the tree of evolution , accelling evolution with synthetic bacteria , arches , arches , and finally cells .
We &apos;re so much to improve people .
Our purpose is to make it a way to live enough to try to do it . Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
First of all , I &apos;m going to show you , the faster , some fundamental work , the new technology that we brought to the Microsoft in the following a year ago . This is Seadragon . This is Seads .
It &apos;s a environment where you can interact is at the local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data .
Here we &apos;re seeing a lot of digital photos with a kind of digital photos with a kind of good , and continuous , for a fast fast fast , we want to do it .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much the amount of information that we see , how big these collections of data or images .
Most of them are common photographs , but this for example is a scan that is a provened scan from the Library of Congress , and it comes into the gamma of 300 megapes .
It doesn &apos;t make a difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen in any moment . It &apos;s also a very flexible architecture .
This is a whole , example of course , not data .
This is the Dickens &apos;s desolate . Every column is a capture .
So to demonstrate that it &apos;s really about text and not of images , we can do something like that , to see really it &apos;s a real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a electronic book .
I don &apos;t tell you .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s a number of The Guardian .
Every image is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading the real version of a magazine or a everyday , which is for a half a thousand plot plot .
We also did something with the corner of this number in particular number of The Guardian .
We &apos;ve created a high-resolution advertising -- much higher than what you use in a normal publishing , and we have a path of the extra content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see it .
Or other models , or even the specific fires .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the space limits of space on the screen .
And I hope that this is to put the people to the same as you put that up to the people and make similar , not to be able to do that .
Of course , the maps is one of the poorest applications for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say that we have a contribution to give you in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States , overwhelming geospatial image of NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually from the wellow ; you can go to see it .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynththrow Photosynthrow , which is a fighting two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual computer very interesting that you can do by Noah Snavely , a student of Washington of Steve Seadly Seads of Microsoft Rick Szeliski Rick Szeliski Rick . A great collaboration .
And it &apos;s from the websis , I managed by Seadround .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from one image to the other and have this kind of experience of resolution .
But the space spacectively images here has actually a meaning .
The algorithms of computer computer algorithms have these images together , so that correspond to the real places that the real place that imagined -- all close to the Rocciose channels -- they &apos;re taken close to the Rocciose channels -- they &apos;re taken . So you see the elements of a de-show show . So you see the elements of a de-show show , and these things are connected to the space level .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more space space .
I want to go directly to one of the Noah original data set up with a previous prototype of Photosynth that we have done for the first time , the summer -- to show you what I think is the key behind this technology , Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily evidence that we have in the website . And it &apos;s not necessarily evidence that we have in the website .
We had to worry about the legal aspects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of Nothing . Dame is a picture of Flickr . Bauction Nothing three Dame Bauction , and you get images of these kinds of magliets and so on . Oach of these pis and said . Oach of these ards , and he said . You have a picture that it was discovered to appearing to this .
So , they &apos;re all images made by Flickr and they &apos;ve been all connected to the space level in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to igate this very simpler .
You know , I never thought to end up working for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratificent to get this kind of accounts here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different kinds of phones of phones that SLR to a professional number of those cell phone to SLR , a significant , which is a significant number , put together in this environment .
And if I can try and try and try and try the more strange .
Many block by faces , etc .
somewhere you have a series of photographs -- it &apos;s a bunch of photographs --
This is a correctly Nothan recorded .
We can go from the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is taking data from a whole whole collective memory of how the entire collective memory is of how the earth is , from visual point -- and connected all that data together .
All those pictures become connected together , larger than the sum of the parts .
You have a model of the entire that emerge is .
Think about this as a prolungment of Stephen Lawler &apos;s work on virtual Earth .
It &apos;s something that increases in complexity as people are using it , and the whose advantages for the useful people are using it .
Their photos are married with metadmit by other people .
If someone is is the idea of contrast all these sets , you know , my picture of the cattle of Nothing . Demail suddenly enries of all that data , and I can use it as ingress of all that data , and I can use it as a picture of ingress , using anyone else , and having a social experience of a kind of cross-mood experience cross-user .
Of course , a consequence of all this is virtual models of all the interesting things that we have been , because of course , you can &apos;t just pick up with airplanes and search , but from the collective memory .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I realized what your software software will be doing is that at some point to do is that at a certain point in the next few years , all the photographs that you have been shared by anyone in the entire world will be very , very much connected with ?
BAA : Yes . What is doing is actually about .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , you want , you know , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the richness of seant information that many of these images have .
As you do a picture of the web , you have a phrase and the heads on the Web page has a lot of information about the images .
Now , what happens if that picture is relates to all your picture ?
So , you know , you &apos;re sexic interconnection and the amount of wealth that comes in is really a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible . Compliments .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the main pleases when you travels and one of the etnographic research is the way to live in the room , you &apos;re in the way , you &apos;re going to have the old traditions , between the hadn , it touch in the wind , it touch , it is in the stone of the rain in the room of plants .
Basts to think that the shamani Jague still beyond the Via Lattea , or that the Inuit &apos;s still hit of significed , or that in Himalaya , the budget of the Dharm , or in Himalaya , to remember the central importance of the Dharm , and that the idea that the world we have no solved in sense , but it &apos;s just a model of reality , but it &apos;s actually a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stirpful stirpful has done , well or bad , lots of generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential traits .
We all procreates . We all procrease .
We are subjects .
We have to deal with the death of death , so we don &apos;t surround and we &apos;re seeing --
We all have an art .
What it hits is the particular rhythm of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that the Borneo &apos;s Pforests , or the following follow of the Voodoo &apos;s warriers , or the desert guerriers of the Kaithful Kaithful in Kenyan entrional camp , or a camp in the heart of Sahara .
He was my journey of the trip in the desert a month , or a yak hallelder in Qomolangma , on Everest , on Mer-Ms , Everest , the mother &apos;s dea mother of the world .
All these populations teaches us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And , if you think a moment , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
Togs , the mirihades of the world are creating a spiritual , cultural life that has the planet and it &apos;s important for the planet , and it &apos;s important for the planet , as a biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural spills as a ethnosh , and you can define the etnosphere , the total of all the concepts , substitems , a ideas , inspirations , intuitions , taken out of being from the human imagination of the alba .
Eetnosphere is the great patrimonium .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be as as a kind of inquisitional .
And because biosphere is gravely consumed as well as it was very successful as it was very quickly as well .
No biologist , for example , would say that 50 percent of all species is or is on the ord of the extinction simply because it &apos;s filled , or -- in the most optitic field -- in the most optitic field of biological diversity -- and you can &apos;t even get closer to the most optimistic -- that that cultural diversity of cultural diversity .
The survey of this is , of course , the language loss .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not a language of a vocabulary or a series of grammaticks .
A language is the spraking of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle of which animes of every culture comes in the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a water water , a thought , a ecosystem of spiritual .
And of the 6,000 languages , while we &apos;re sitting in Monterey , at least half not is subsurrounded in the ears of the children .
They &apos;re not teaching the kids , which means , unless I have a lot of course that I have been dead .
What is more sad is more sad than the silence , of being the last to talk about a language , you don &apos;t have a language , you don &apos;t have to transmit the wisdom of the kids ?
This is a piece of horrying is a few of the world every two weeks : every two elderly old mud and brings with her toms the toms sillabor of a ancient language .
And I know somebody who you can say , &quot; Is it not better ?
The world wouldn &apos;t be a better place if we &apos;re going to let all talk about this . &quot; Watch , we all talk about yoruba .
Let &apos;s talk about kogi .
You &apos;re going to get a sudden what it means you can &apos;t talk about their own language .
I &apos;d like to give you a journey through the etnosphere --
a small journey in the etnosphere to give you a assage of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , &quot; different ways of exist , &quot; I mean , really different ways of existing .
Let &apos;s take for example , Barasana bimmad , in the Amazon sector , the people of the anaconda , who creds in the Amazon the latest pants of the latest path of the west pocket &apos;s paying .
It &apos;s a people who can &apos;t be able to distinguished color from green because the time you have a time in the forest , where you depend the people .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rule , called &quot; exogamia language , you have to marry a person who talks a different language .
Everything has roots in the mitological past , though the particularly the same is that in these houts are in these summage , where you &apos;re talking about or seven languages because of a marriages of a language .
They &apos;re just listening and then start to talk .
We take one of the most interesting tribe with which I have lived , the Waorans of Ecuador , a incredible people that had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionar-missionar-in-in-mate .
They &apos;ve been going down from the top photographs that they react them in a posite , forest that this people who would love that this rainforest people , forest that this is a vast that people in the forest .
They collected the photograph , they &apos;ve been turned to research on a form or a form or a figure and , not found anything , they have been concluse that they were the diavily treated to the five missionaries with the lance .
But the Waorani didn &apos;t kill only the foreign &apos;t just kill the foreign &apos;t kill the Waorans .
They killed them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We &apos;ve been saving eight generations and we found two of natural death , and when we &apos;ve been born to know , they admit that one of them was invecking , and then they &apos;ve been invecking , and then they killed it . &#91; Risch &#93; Awidth , they had a incredible knowledge of forest .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine for 40 pass and recognize it species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was a really interesting job when my Harvard professor , he asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti a , he asked me to go to intruly intruly the base of Duvalier and Tonton Mazard , and Tonton Mison , and Tonton Mison , and Tonton Mison , and I &apos;m impossessor .
To give sense of the miraculous , I should have understand Vodoun culture and the Voodoo is not magic .
It &apos;s pretty much about a metaphphysics of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to tell me about the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christian , Islam , Buddhism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always leaving out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no religious faith . And instead , and the Voodoo is not else that the distilled of these religious concepts of religious concepts .
What makes interesting is that voodoo is the relationship between life and death .
So , you live the spirits .
Sperites can be invocated by the Great Acqua , they respond to the rhythm of the dance and they replace time to the soul of live in a very quickly , to the follow end of the following is the god .
So , for this voodooists to say , &quot; You know , you know , you know , who are the way to talk about God .
We &apos;re going to be in the theme and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re posing , is the spirit that you are , how can you do you get your bad ?
So you &apos;re seeing these incredible events : following voodoo sance , the woodog in the state of trance that touches impunishment , which is a pretty strong demonstration of the body when it &apos;s catalyzed in a state of extremely excitement .
I &apos;m going to be the most extraordinary people who I have lived the most extraordinary is Kogi Santa Marta RROOs , in the Santa Marta Colombia .
They have to be on the ancient civilization that once they lived on the charge of Colombia on the charge of the Plets , the people would retreat on the volcanic that you could be on the volcanic plant that you could be on the charge plan .
In a macaries of blood , this people have never been conquered by the spagnes .
But I &apos;m now governments from a clero , but their formation is very extraordinary .
The young people are taken away from families to three or four years , and they live secrets in a dark world , and they live secrets in a dark and shading the base of the gles for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years , by the way , the nine months of gestation that transmate in the mother of the user , now , metaphors in the UUpppets of Mother .
For this time , they &apos;re acculultured to the values of their society , values that predicts that their prayers and only their prayers to keep the cosmic balance -- or to say the cosmic balance .
And the term of this incredible initiation , suddenly they &apos;re taken out of the first time in life , at 18 years , they see an alba . And in that moment of the first bank , when the sun comes out of the first blow , when the sun is . The first first balls of the beautiful landscape , everything that has been learned in theory . The referred a step back and says : : : : Relling a step back and says :
&quot; Wisto how I said to you .
It &apos;s amazing . Now it &apos;s now to you . &quot;
They call them larger brothers and say that we , brothers , we are the colpful of the destruction of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the indigenous populations and the investment of Rousseau and the old history of selver , which is a race concept of its own selvestimate Thoreau and we say these people are closer to the Earth of us .
The Indies people are not homes nor feelings from nostaly .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the Asmat Asmat Halalth , or in the Tibet , but thank you very long and the rhythththththended , they created a mystical of the idea of being consciously close , but to a much more intuition , but it &apos;s a very , very , very , the concept that the Earth can live only because it &apos;s infected by human consciousness .
What does it mean ?
It means that a kid of Ande that Ande that you can create a mountain of the mountain is a spirit that will be a very different human being deeply different , and it will have a very different ratio with the mountain or that place a lot of Montana that increase that you can create a mountain of rock that you &apos;re going to grow .
which is the dimora of a spirit or a mineral cat is irrelevant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that define the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia Britannics creating the forest forests that they were to be cut .
And that &apos;s what I have a different different different from my Kwakiutl that people are the forests of Hukukukukukukukukukukukukuk-seveline , which we &apos;re in the world , spirits that live in the Hamatsa .
If you start to look at that these cultures can actually start to understand some of them , you can start to understand some of them feeling feeling feeling .
I &apos;ve taken this picture to open the ninrow in the nine Amazon .
Maybe some of you &apos;ve heard about the ayahuased , the most powerful psychoactive submit .
What makes the elevation of the ayahuascinating is not the drug of substance , but its processing . It &apos;s composed by two elements .
On one hand , this lian lightful of beta series of beta-coal , little little , harmoline , slightly hallucinographic .
And by by by trying to the only plant is a smoke that allows the confidence , but it &apos;s mixed with the leaves of a caffecting family caffected Psychotry is .
This plant contains powerful powerful , very similar to the serotonin , dithylypppylypppylyppppylyptamine .
If you ever see the Yanomami thypppyllets . And if you ever see the substances of species , it is methypppylyptamine .
Tiring that dust on the nose is a little bit like being disappeared by a pinch of a bunch of beat and land on a sea of electricity . It &apos;s not a distortion of reality .
I &apos;ve got a professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who had been scatened the Psychchchchecks , with his discovery of fungi hallucinogens in the &apos; 30s in Mexico .
Second my thesis cannot classify these tripps as hallucinogens , because if you &apos;re made of a hallucined . And you can &apos;t tell anybody to be hallucined . They can &apos;t be abunte to be halluced by a enzyme , because they &apos;re in the intestine , of course , the monoin-in-oxydass .
It &apos;s possible to be the ortly possible , if you &apos;re all a lot of chemicals that are going to be MAO .
Now it &apos;s the beautiful : the Tier , the Tier that you find in this lian injewers of MAO , the same guy needs to potence . The question is is a smilk . The question is is a flasher . The question is spontaneously about a lot of plants , like these people have a biochemical version that are not similar , but that if you combine in this way , they create a biochemical version that ?
We use the great euuply of the evidence , which can be infruttifer .
But if we ask Indians , they &apos;ll tell us , &quot; The plants talk about . &quot;
What does it mean ?
This tribe , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayhuased , that distinguished nicely in the forest , and that we would reentry in the same species .
If we ask them how they &apos;re going to say , &quot; I thought , &quot; I thought , &quot; I thought , &quot; I thought , &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take 17 varieties in a night of moon , and each other will be with a different tone .
With this is not graduate Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than counting the stami .
Now , &#91; applausers &#93; the problem is that even the ones of us that have to heart people have painting them , but somehow reduced to the margins of the world &apos;s history of the real world , and it passes beyond .
In fact , the 20th century , in 300 years , it will not remember for his wars or its technological innovations , but rather like the era where we &apos;ve stopped and we abbracing , and we used active active , the mass destruction of mass diversity and cultural diversity of the planet . Now the problem . Now the problem is not the change .
All the culcultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibilities .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux don &apos;t stop being Sioux when they put it from the arms and frecovered as American they have no stop being American when they put on the horse and calf .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that mines the integrity of etnosphere . It &apos;s the power .
The hard hard hard to domination .
And if you look at the world , you &apos;ll discover that these are not destined to disappear .
They &apos;re living creatures and dynamics out of extra strong identificable to the existence from the forces of their adaptment .
It &apos;s about the Penan disbosypppped in the Penan --
a peel nomad , a peak peak , in the Asian , a people who lived in the forest , and he &apos;s now reduced to a generation , and now reduced to the reduction , and the next titution on the rights of the lim that it is to take a half of the lim , where you can see the river of the wisdom , where the napse are wellar , where the naph , where the nomes are woning
It &apos;s ready to fill the wooden wooden .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that have come with the discovery of the gold .
If we move on on the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the hard hard hard to see the political domination .
As you know the genocide , the extinction of a people , is convicted at universal level , but the ethnocium , the destruction of the style of a people , not only is to be constyle , but I also have a celebrated , but I also have a celebrated part of development strategy .
And you can &apos;t figure out the Tibet suffering of Tibet until you start .
I &apos;ve got the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in the West through the SEast , coming to Lhasa with a young link , but only came to Lhasa with a young connection , but only came to the statistics that we &apos;re hearing about .
6,000 sacries sacries in dust and centered .
1.2 million people killed by the military Rivolution in Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascriteria in Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed at the time of Chinese invasion .
His is a flew on Sainity during the diaspora that led the people in Nepal .
His mother was imprisoned and his hildlife was rich .
It &apos;s been brought to hide in caring at the age of two hidden birth , because he could not have any of him .
The sister , that he did the same , was mitted in reduc.
A day he was inwarm caled a fashion Mao and , for this transgression , was mitted to the forced for seven years .
The Tibet pain of the Tibet can be insopposable , but the spirit of the people is from tener .
And it &apos;s all going to reduce a choice .
We want to live in the world &apos;s world &apos;s a monocromatic or we want to get the policements of diversity ?
The great anthropologa Margaret Mead , before he died he said that his largest fear was that in our world , we &apos;re going to see the whole world , we don &apos;t just see the whole gamma of human imagination , but we &apos;re seeing us a whole gamma of thinking , but we &apos;re going to see the whole nicking of thinking , but one day we &apos;re going to see the whole thing that there was other possibility .
And it &apos;s about a lets to remember that our species is there for 600,000 years .
The Neolitica Revolution , which has given us agriculture , that has been done with the seed to the cult cult , by replacing poem of the samp of the sample , creating the hierarchy of specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has a 300 years .
That sharp history doesn &apos;t suggests me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we &apos;re going to deal with in the millennia .
When to these mirihades of the world is asked what human , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all refer the possibility of being what we are : a conscious species , that has to make all the people and the gardens can be confidres . And there are great moments of optimism .
I &apos;ve taken this on the north of Baffin the end of Baffin , when I went to the hunting of the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , Olayer , and this guy , Olayer , and this guy , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya ,
The Canadian government has been kindness with the Inuit and the &apos; 50s to stabilize our spremistaking our suprematia , we have them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refused to go .
His , theme for his life , he took it all the weapons , and all his attractive .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t feel the cold , they can do it .
The pieces of the origins of the origins were made of fish fish fish .
The grandfather of this man didn &apos;t have a reptimidnight or the bard or the bard that sufficient .
It &apos;s been disgacked , he hot the pantalones in the skin in , and defeced in his hand . When the I did it frozen , he worked a sweet . When the time I did it was creating a sama .
It &apos;s got a salive on the punch of this clothing , and when it became solid , he killed a dog .
He shsheled the dog and created a bright , with the torch , he ended a slict , he &apos;s imbrired another dog and is disappeared on the banking , the chisa , he &apos;s got a bank , the clothing .
Do we want to talk about horrible with nothing ? &#91; Risate &#93; And this , in different ways , &#91; Applausers &#93; is the symbol of the Inuit &apos;s the symbol of the Inuit of the world .
In the beat 1999 , the Canadian government reduced to the total control of a larger area of the size of California and Texmes together .
It &apos;s their new pathria . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s an independent land . They &apos;re all minerary resources .
A beautiful example of how a nation-state can reconcilied with his people .
And , to finish , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious to the people of us have been in these remote areas of the planet , to realize that they &apos;re not remote at all .
For someone is home .
They &apos;re presenting sections of human imagination that go up at the time . And for us all , the dreams of these kids , as the dreams of these kids , are part of our kids , are part of our children , they become part of the geography of hope .
So , we &apos;re about National Geographic we are convinced that the politicians will never be at anything .
We believe that polemics --
&#91; Applausers &#93; are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month our website has to 35 million visits .
156 countries transmit our television channel .
Our magazines are lets from millions .
Our work is traveling in the ethnosh to bring our public places in a cultural places that are going to go away from how they &apos;re going to go away from how they saw and , hopefully , abbracing the central reveal of the central of anthropology : the world of existence in a world of diversity , and we have to find a life in a world of life in a world , and we have to find a life in a world of life in a world , and we have to find a life in a life in a life in a life in a life in a life in a life in a life in a life in
where the wisdom of all the people can contribute to our wisdom wisdom .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope you &apos;ve heard and try to point out some connection , in case you don &apos;t notice them .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the official dogma . &quot;
The dogma official what ?
The dogma official of all the West industrial society , the west official officals , &quot; If we want to maximize the well-being of our citizens . &quot; The way to do it is massive the individual liberty . &quot;
The reason is , on the one hand , in fact that the freedom is itself a value , it &apos;s precious , for human beings .
On the other one of us can do that if we are free , each of us can act to just understand what maximize our well-being , no one that decision-one of our well-being , no one that decide in our way .
The way to massively freedom is massively .
More choices choices , more choices , and the more is their freedom , the larger is their well-being .
This , I think , it &apos;s so profoundly radicated in society that nobody would be dreamed to put it in doubt .
And it &apos;s also deeply roadiced in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress is possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m going to allow me a simple note about conditions .
In my supermarket is 175 conditions , without counting the 10 variety of oil extrant oil oil , and the 12 acets that you can buy to the number a huge conditions that you can buy to you a huge number of conditions in the circles that no 175 of the degree of the remarkable oil that no one of 175 .
Here &apos;s what the supermarket .
And then you go to the electronics store , if , CD letter , radio , plastra , radio , plastra , light , light bulbs .
And in this single electronics store , there &apos;s a big audiences .
We can make six million different combinations using the components that there are in one store .
You have to put that there is a lot of choice .
Other fields : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the telephones that were wired by moking Bell .
He was nolegg the phone , you didn &apos;t buy it .
A consequence of that , one , was that the phone never turned .
These days are gone .
Now we have a very much illimited variety of phones , especially between the cell phones .
Here &apos;s the cell phone .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , MP3 , cut off the nose , and forth to the bin the middle , and forth for the chromantic chroll .
If you haven &apos;t seen it still saw in the store under home , you &apos;re very much certain that I &apos;ll soon get to .
And what happens is that people come into the store , and they &apos;re doing this question , you know what the answer ? The answer ? The answer is &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t make too much .
So , in other ways of life that are much more important aquicians , it &apos;s the same explosion choices .
Ssistence : don &apos;t happen to be in the United States that you &apos;re going to be from the doctor and the doctor you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do A , or B , &quot; Well , we could do or B . &quot; has these benefits , and these risks . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Doctor , what should I do I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A benefits , and these risks , and B has these benefits , and B has these benefits , and B . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you &apos;re going to do , &quot; Doctor if you were , what do you do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result we call it &quot; autonomy of the malate &quot; , expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not that you can move the weight and responsibility to make a decision that someone knows something , which is the doctor , to someone else that knows nothing -- and almost sick is a bad point -- and it &apos;s not in the ideal condition to make the power of decisions to make the patient decisions that you can make the patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing of pharmaceutical products , directly people like me and you , who if you think about it doesn &apos;t make any sense , because we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why do we advertising them ?
The answer is that it takes the doctor to ask them to ask them to change the recipe .
Something about this is how we have identity identity , is a question of choice , how we see in this vignet . &quot; We don &apos;t want to forze the kids . They &apos;re not going to get the sex right now . &quot; We don &apos;t think we &apos;re going to invent .
And we can reinvent us how many times you do it .
which means that every morning , at the wake , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
I &apos;m going to the family and the marriage , a long time the perspective , almost for anyone , was that was that we had the most soon possible , and you start to get kids the most early possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not even what to do after .
So , it &apos;s really going to play .
I teach a very smart students , and I &apos;m going to be 20 percent of work than a time .
And it &apos;s not because they &apos;re not very brilliant , not because they &apos;re not very much diligent .
but why are they imthoughts , you know , &quot; Should I sent or not ? I should be doing it now ? I &apos;m going to do it now ? &quot;
&quot; Should I marry later ? I have to think before children or the career ? &quot;
They &apos;re interrogatives .
And they &apos;re trying to answer these questions , even though this implica doesn &apos;t complete the tasks that I assembly , and not get a beautiful voice to my exam .
And they really have to do that . They &apos;re important .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , as Carl underlying , because the technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from every day , from the Hotel Randolph .
Fi parentesthin , there &apos;s a corner , and I won &apos;t say to anyone where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use me .
What does this incredible liberty of choice that we have to work ? Is it , it &apos;s that we have to continuously decide , if we have to work or not .
We can go and see our child playing hot , with the cell phone in a pocket , Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , typically , on the knees .
And even if they &apos;re all spending , every minute that we see our child rovards , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; I have to answer this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? I have to email this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is &quot; no , &quot; all this makes the experience of your child very different than what it would be in other conditions .
So , anywhere we look , small things , small and big objects and large , materials and lifestyle , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : that there were a few possibilities , but it wasn &apos;t all about a question of choice .
The world today is looking like this : The world is , dilemma is , &quot; Is it a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Simple .
The positive lets we know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative .
And this is a lot of choice is two negative effects .
The first , paradoxally , is that produced paralysis that produced paralysis ,
With a lot of options that you can get it very difficult to do it .
I give you a significant example : a study of the volunteer plans .
A colleagues has been a link to the data of the VVanguard data , with about a million customers in about 2,000 different companies .
What she found out is that for every 10 solutions that are offering in more , the percentage of adhesian scenes of two percent .
With 50 sources , there &apos;s 10 percent less than we have been able to be able to be just five . Why are they only five . Why ?
Because with 50 sources of which you choose , is a hard hard decide , and the choice is represented to indomans .
And tomorrow , and they &apos;re tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course it never gets .
You know , you know , it doesn &apos;t just mean that these guys are lgering food for the decision , because they &apos;re not going to say that decision is so that it lets also is so that it lose the funds of the texture of work .
Not participating , they &apos;re losing up to five thousand dollars for year from the work dator , which would be well disposed to be there .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think that makes the world .
&quot; And to end , for eternity : ketchup , ketchup , or maionese ? &quot;
Would you like to make the right decision , if it &apos;s for the eternity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to pick the wrong , and yet the condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that if we can avoid the parallel and make a choice , at the end , we &apos;re less satisfacts of how we would we &apos;re going to be with less options that they choose .
And that for several reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of people between which you choose , if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could make a different choice that would be better . And what what happens is that the alternative imagined us to branches of choice , and the repushes the decision , and the repair demining the decision ,
even when it was a great decision .
More choices are , easier than any details that is unsatisfaction of any detailing choice .
Also , there &apos;s what economists call the opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has been very well , like the value that we give things depends on the things we &apos;re council .
From rest , when there are a lot of possible options , it &apos;s easy to represent the characteristics of alternative , that you have been able to be less satisfied .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m going to use with everyone that are not New York .
But it &apos;s what you &apos;d probably think .
There &apos;s this couple in Hamptons .
A place of luxury .
It &apos;s falls . Ottttttapes . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not going to be . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , maledition , it &apos;s Agust . &quot;
&quot; Everybody my neighbors to Manhattan is away . &quot;
&quot; I could park right in front of the home . &quot;
And it goes to two weeks , the idea that &apos;s losing -- every day -- the ability to park where it wants .
The costo-opportunities decreatures that we have , even as well as choice was excellent .
And the options that we have to look at , the more activenues are going to be going to be going to be , to be the costo-opportunities .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
It &apos;s about the moment , and maybe of living slowly .
But the most important point is that whatever you choose you choose to not do other .
The things that we don &apos;t pick them have a lot of attractive attractive what we do .
Third point : the growing spiral of expectations .
I tried it on my skin bought a new jeans .
I &apos;m almost always about jeans .
Once jeans were just a guy , buys and dress from the bestivan , they were scomcomfortable , just after they took them a life and they were all going to do well .
So , I went to buy a couple of time when the old people were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
The committed me , &quot; You want to slim slim fit , relaxed fit ? &quot;
You want them to be with the cernificent , or with the buttons ? &quot; Stonewashhed , &quot; or &quot; aciddle &quot; ?
&quot; Would you like to be a stripped ? &quot;
&quot; Wow them want to be a windmed or bla ... &quot; Continupright .
I was swhale , and after a while I was able to say , &quot; I want the guy that was the only guy , &quot; he had no idea what it was , so for a moment , I tried all came out of the people who had been so daten , and with the best couple of jeans that I had ever had .
It was the most of that choice . I got the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice , my jeans had to be perfect .
I was really , I was not expectation . I didn &apos;t expect anything that &apos;s just a kind of , but when I saw 100 different , steps , at least a kind of a perfect thing .
What I was buying , but not perfect .
After I was paragoned with what I was trying to do , I was very insatisfacts .
The adds of options in life of people don &apos;t do that increasing the eccellence of the excellence of the same .
And this will make less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
No one in the world of marketing if it &apos;s made it .
Because if they knew , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more than that .
&quot; He was better when you was worse . &quot; The reason why he was better when you were worse is that when you were worse , you could meet the pleasant surprises .
So , in the world where we live -- opulent , industrialized citizens with the expectancy -- the most we can hope is that things are at the altitude of expectations .
You never surprising the pleased because your expectations , my expectations , are sweet .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Baxllets . &quot; Yes , you want it . &quot;
I mean , small authographic moment -- that I &apos;m actually married and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t have a contented .
But it &apos;s not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of the bought a couple of jeans when there is only that you have that when you &apos;re not satisfied , and you ask you , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot; The answer is clear .
The world is the responsible . What would I do I do ?
When you have hundreds of jeans , and you buy a satisfaction , and you ask you who is the responsible , it &apos;s just clear that responsible , it &apos;s a clear clear clear you are .
You could have done better .
With hundreds of varieties , there are no excuse for insuccessful .
So when people make decisions , even if the result is valid , you feel unsatisfigured and give the cold .
For the last few years , depression is explexploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only , but important -- of this wave of depression is just that people have deludent experience because the standard are too high .
And when they have to explain this that the cold is .
So the end result is that we &apos;re better , in fact , but we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the official dogma , what we all all get good , and it &apos;s completely fake . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little choice better than having any of it , but it doesn &apos;t have a lot better than that .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic value . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure that we &apos;ve been overed by a piece of level where the choices improving our life .
Now , from the political point of view -- I &apos;ve got almost finished -- from the political point of view , the nocy is the following .
What allows all this in industrial society is the wealth .
There are a lot of places in the world , and you know about it , where the problem is not too much choice .
The problem is that they have too paid .
So the faccenters that I &apos;m talking about is a bad exclusive of modern , re-rich West .
And what it does depressing and angry is this : Steve Levitt spoke yesterday about how the expensive , and the car seat for bimes are useless . It &apos;s a money .
I mean , these choices , complicated and depensive , it &apos;s not just useless .
I &apos;m really going to deleterie .
They &apos;re getting worse .
If a while what we do in our society allows choice to be poured in those where people are too too much possibilities , it wouldn &apos;t just be the life to improve , but our .
This is what economists call a lot of improvement .
A redistribution of income redistribution of income redistribution , not only to the poor -- because of this choice in excess .
So , to conclude , you can become all you want . &quot;
You , people of culture , you think , &quot; What does it believe that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious you can &apos;t do anything in a glass of glass . &quot;
&quot; A covered imagination , a limited vision of the world -- &quot;
and I &apos;m interpreted to this , at the beginning .
But then , thinking about it , instead , I realized that that the fish knows the long time .
Because the reality of the facts is that if you &apos;re missing the blow , so that you can &apos;t . &quot; You can &apos;t have the freedom . You can &apos;t get freedom . It gets the paralyssis .
If you break the blow the blow so that it &apos;s possible to decrease satisfaction .
You &apos;re excited about it , and you reduce the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too strange , maybe even for the fish , and certainly certainly for us .
But the absence of a few symbolic symbolic , is a recipe for injury , for the rovine .
Thank you very much .
