Last year I showed these slide to demonstrate that the glacial calculus , which for almost three million years had the size of the 48 United States continents , the United States continents , you retrofed 40 percent .
But this sub-up the gravity of the problem because it &apos;s not about the ice of the ice .
The artica ice ice ice is , in a sense , the clean of global climate system .
It &apos;s expanded up and retreat the summer .
The next slide is going to be a carrying re-related remarkable revenue of the last 25 years .
The glaces are reached .
As you see , they go to the blue blue black .
That &apos;s the winter ice in the winter , which is that you have summer .
You can see that the cosmic ice costs , five years or more , is like a blood , which is that there was a blood , which is that there &apos;s a blood , which is that there was a blood .
In 25 years , it &apos;s gone from that , so .
This is a problem because the warming warming core around the arctic ocean where there are huge amount of coal ocean where there are huge amount of fuzzy that , the skills , are turn into metane .
I &apos;m going to the totalities of the atmospheric pollution to global warming , that amount of it could doubling , overeign this point of not around .
In some some deeper in Alaska metan , the metan is already already already rebuling from water .
The Katey Walter of the University of Alaska was a team pressed a team pressed lake , last winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You &apos;re good . The question is if we &apos;re also .
A reason is that this exchange termal exchange the Groenland .
This is a regime river .
And the brought never to look like this .
This is the Kangerlussuademic river , in the Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level to be shelf of the sea level of the land on the ground , here is where it &apos;s where it &apos;s going to be .
These currents are increasing .
On the other side of the planet : Antarctica , the biggest ice block of the planet .
Last month , the scientists have told that the balance of ice is in negative , and that the Western Antarcccccclearing on some islands , is particularly quick in the sun .
It &apos;s about six feet of the water at the 1,0000-foot .
Suli Himalayas , the third largest block of ice , you see new lakes , which a few years ago , they see new lakes .
40 percent of the world population was going to get half of the welling water from that .
Sulle Ande : this glacier &apos;s the source of the power of this city .
The brought is increased .
But when it demines , the same happens to the same .
In California , the snow on Sierra Nevada is deminuity of 40 percent .
The hypermmmurs are in the crisis .
The predictions , as you read , they &apos;re grave .
The growing certainly in the world leads to a remarkable increasing incencies .
The disasters are increasing to a rhythm outside and unprecedent .
Four times more numerous in the last 30 years I was related to the previous 75 .
This is a unsustainable aid .
If you look at it in the historical context , you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the highly Pacific area of the Eastern Pacific , from the Americans , to the west , and there &apos;s a radical dump-in the ocean .
The greatest cause of global warming , together to deforestation , which is the 20 percent , is the use of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and the coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the most emissions , together to China .
And he proponated to build a lot of other coal central .
But we &apos;re seeing a shift of direction .
These are the projects annullated projects in the last years and some alternative green proposes .
At any way , there &apos;s a political struggle in our country .
The industrial and the coal and the oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote coal , which is a bone .
And that picture would remind me something --
Verice Natal , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a loss of 3.8 billion litri waste .
Maybe you have seen it on the news .
This is the second largest flow of the greatest flow in America .
It &apos;s success around Natal .
Number advertising one of the coal industrial .
Video : Hem the carbon is a kind of allegro and it &apos;s a happy and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it &apos;s growing our economy .
Frosty the carbon is always frosive .
It &apos;s good at the price , adorable and the workers keep the workers .
Al Gore : From here &apos;s a lot of the West Virginia .
The greatest society is Massey Coal . This is his administrator . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I &apos;m going to be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelososy , Harry Reid -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So Alleance for the Clima &apos;s Protection of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is a one of them , a part .
Video : Attore : At the same same thing as a severe mining climate change as a serious threat our business .
For this our prioritize is to invest a lot of money in a public effort to make public and confused and confused the coal truth .
Actually , the coal is not spork .
We think it &apos;s pulit -- it &apos;s also a good profumo .
So not prehocupon climate change .
Let me do .
Video : Attore : Carbon -- you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
So let &apos;s go around to a look at the avanid structure for how the coal coal coal .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little noise , but this is the sound of the sound of the fuel technology .
The fuel consumption is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology that you see changes everything .
You look at a look at this : this is the puzzle odial odial odial technology .
Al Gore : So , the positive alternative is connected to economic question and the national security .
Video : The America is in the crisis , the national security , the national security crisis .
The filter that the connects all : our dependence from fossil fuels , like the coal coal and oil .
Now , though , there &apos;s a new , audace solution for using circumtry .
Reway , America : 100 percent clean energy in the 10 years .
A plan to reach America to make us more secure , and to help us to stop the global warming .
And finally , a solution that drink to solve our problems .
Repower America . You get more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It &apos;s about re-energy to America .
One of the fastest ways to get to the dependence from the fuel fuel that are killing our planet .
Comparsa : The future is here . Vent , sun , a new energy network .
So , you know , two : New 2 : New York investiment for good work .
Complplplan : Real . It &apos;s time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old lung African says , &quot; If you want to go to the fair .
If you want to go away , you go together . &quot;
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED I made a introduction on the LHC .
And I promise to return you to get back to you how the car works .
So here I get there . And for those that the other time there were not , the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever attemed -- 27 kilometers of circumstances .
His task the conditions that were at least than a billionly than a billiondesylim of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
All that &apos;s just environmental .
This is the car under Ginevra .
And we go to the rhy-Big Bang in the refer .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- it &apos;s largo to 12-foot diameter diameter diameter diameter .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLATLAS in construction so you can see the proportions .
The 10 September 10 years , we have been on the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken from ATLATLAS .
It was because of immense flew in the control of .
It &apos;s a picture of the first kind of particles that had done all the LHHC , and it &apos;s going into the collision , deliberately , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles inside the heat .
In other words , when we see that the picture of the 10 September , we know that the machine worked , which is a great vinory .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to do that , when somebody went on Google and saw that , when somebody went on Google and saw that the front page was this .
That means we &apos;ve had a cultural impact beyond that scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the car , had to have a problem with the car , and we &apos;ve been a problem with the car ,
These files bring 13,000 ampes when the car works at the very much of the power .
Now , the technical of you will look at the filters and they say , &quot; I &apos;m not . They &apos;re too subtle . &quot;
And they can do that because when they &apos;re very cold of become the deaths .
So , at least 271 degrees , at a lower temperature at the space between stars , these filters can bring that current .
In one of the giounts between the most of the magnees in the LHHC , there was a defect of factoration .
So the files are going to climb , and the 13,000 ampargued , and the 13,000 ampargued .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magnees are more than 20 tons , and that they &apos;ve moved from about 30 centimeters .
They have been damaged about 50 magnees .
We had to take them , what we did .
We &apos;ve reined them and wanders .
They are now coming back to their sub-old .
By the end of the march the LHC will be again integrated .
We &apos;re going to happen , and we expect to get data to judge or dd , and we continue so our adventure to find out what the universe is .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents are accounts of science and the engineering of frontier and the engineering of frontier .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so difficult , the fact that we can go beyond the limits , I think is the value of things like LHC .
I want to conclude with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , I guess , in defense , in defense , and his clean was Michael Faday , he said , &quot; No dangerous for the progress of the human mind .
Thank you .
I want to start asking the rethink of rethinking about when you , you play with children .
And as you get to get them and say , and you know , you know , you know , you know , and you know , actually , and to learn about problems and solve problems .
The spatial argument is connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , from the useful information that we &apos;ve been using the physical objects , together to my consultant , with my consultant , and my collaborator , and my collaborator Kalanii , I started asking , &quot; And if , when we use a computer , instead of having the only mouse , like a computer , instead of having the only digital cursor a digital cursed by by a desktop , we could have recomcommodity with both hands , hands ,
and I fix it ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , we building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a great interactive computer like a biscanning .
In a few words , a Siftable is a great interactive computer like a biscanning .
You can see them , you can see them , &quot; they can see , &quot; their movement and they have a wireless radio .
But overaded , they &apos;re physical objects , like the morning , like the morning , you can just move them .
The Sifmonly , the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physical , conscious of their movement , the other , and as they become more physical , and as they become more physical , and the other , as we can explore new and so that we can explore new and fun styles .
I &apos;m going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show video : if you start to show video : if you start on a direction , the video is going to rough , if you get back from the other side back .
These retrators are aware of the other .
If I do it , you know , they &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re around .
If they are surrounded , and they can act a little bit .
If they are surrounded , and they can act a little bit .
They also have their own and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was that we could use communities on data , to example , &quot; to try &quot; to put a liquid in the data , and if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Sifmonks configured like green sweet and I can use it to the poulect of the centers , where they &apos;re missing .
And I can use it to use it to the central color in that central , where they miss .
There &apos;s too much about it , we can get a little bit .
There are also beautiful possibilities , like languages , like languages , the mathematics and joames of logic where people can try things , and see the results that you can try things very quickly .
Now I &apos;m --
This is a sequence of Fibonacci that I do with a equations program .
Here we have a words that &apos;s half between Scarabeo and Boggle .
Basically , to every turn a letter in Siftunt , at every Siftable , you get a letter to each other Siftable on any Siftable , and while you try to understand him on a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds remiss , and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the kids came in in the Media Lab , I &apos;ve made a way that I tried them and I &apos;ve been made a video .
They have very liked .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of applying is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
You just have to say , &quot; You know , &quot; You know what to do .
There &apos;s other people who are trying to do it .
This is our winder tester , there on the right .
It actually wanted to be empilaries .
They were only only in the morning , for him .
Now , this is an applying applied of a interactive cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool for learning . He &apos;s Felix . He &apos;s Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , lifted the Sifmonks , they associated with .
It can put new characters in the scene , lifted the Sifmonks , they associated with .
So , it &apos;s going to get out .
Video : The sun is surprising .
David Merrill : Now he led a treatment in the scene .
Video : The arange treatment .
Beobs ! Yes !
So , you shshelting Sifmons and put them out of the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing their story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a very open story , and it can decide him how you get to do it .
DM : It &apos;s a very open story , and it can decide him how you get to do it .
Video : Voo , cat .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , to show you is a tool , to sample and do music .
It &apos;s a tool that we &apos;ve been doing a recent , to sample and performing music .
The Siftable here ags from sounds like the bottom and the bacteria .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also put these sounds in a sequence that you can compores your pleasure .
And it just to change a sound and touch a sound and a sequence .
These are actually you can control from alive , like the reverse and the filter .
The acks to a particular sound and then incline to wander it .
And then there are general effects as time and volume , that you &apos;re applied to the whole sequence .
Let &apos;s look at how it works .
Video : We &apos;re going to start at the very very very very much in two Siftless , &quot; we put them in a series , we add it into a series , we add it to a bunch , we add the very very much .
Now I &apos;m going to put a low line .
Video : DM : Now I added percussions --
Video : DM : And I &apos;m going to put the bacteria on the battery , so I can control the living effect .
Video : DM : I can reveil the whole sequence , when you know , or the other .
Video : DM : I &apos;m going to add the bottom to the bottom to give more expression .
Video : I can get to rewards the sequence of the flying .
So I don &apos;t have to plan before , but I can improvised , making it over a long or the court .
And now , finally , I can smoking the whole sequence of inclining the entire Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new human interfaces and more resembles like our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmate you is that &apos;s coming this new generation of objects to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time to talk to all of you .
I &apos;m a writer .
I &apos;m going to be a profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the fascinated love and the fascinating of my life .
And I don &apos;t look like to change .
But , this is something that I &apos;ve been recently in my life and in my career , which led me to report the whole relationship to this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called &quot; Mangia , Prega , Am , &quot; which , diversously , in my previous books , for some reason there was a great senational , and I got a great sensational , the interational , and it became a great senational senational sensational , interational .
And the result is that everywhere it &apos;s now , people treated me as if I was convicted .
It &apos;s true -- convicted , conducted !
They come from me to me and they say , &quot; Do you don &apos;t have no fear to do better than than do ?
You don &apos;t have fear to write all the life without able to write the whole life without able to create a book that can only only do people ? &quot;
what can you can only do ? &quot;
It &apos;s reassuring , you know .
But it could go worse , to the part of that I remember the more than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a writter .
I went to the same reaction with the fear .
And people say , &quot; I don &apos;t think I couldn &apos;t succeed ?
You don &apos;t have fear that the ulililifted you kills ?
You don &apos;t have to do this mesh for all life without anything that it &apos;s never out and to die on a cumb of dream with the mouth pack of failure with the mouth pastern of failure ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I &apos;m afraid of all that things .
I always had fear .
And I also have fear of many other things that people would not have to ininitiate .
As the algae and other things very frightening .
But , as I write what I thought and I was asking for the ultimally , why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logic that anyone who should expect to be frightened by a work that you &apos;ve been born to do .
But what is there &apos;s so particular in the creative companies to make us nervous about the mental health health of the mental health of the other caring ?
How my father , for example , he was an engineer and I don &apos;t remember one time in his 40 years of activities that he was asked if he had fear to be engineer ?
There was never -- that block of the engineer , as it goes ?
It wasn &apos;t working like that , you know ?
Onestly , the chemicals like group don &apos;t have certainly , in centuries , in the centuries ,
We have a writers , we have enough to this reputation , and not just creative writers but creative writers , but we have this reputation to be enormous unununbelievable .
And it &apos;s not to look at the sad of the magnifies of the magnifts of creative creative minds that , only in the 20th century , they die and often as their their own .
And the ones that don &apos;t seem to be really seemed by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before he die , in the last interview said , &quot; Every book has killed me a little more &quot; A remarkable , &quot; A remarkable recommend of their life .
But we don &apos;t throw when we feel like this because we heard these things so long that we &apos;ve heard of these things so long that we have completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and the suffering are in some way with and the argues , will always confer to the angosce .
And the question I want to ask all of the one here is : you agree with this idea ?
It &apos;s good for this -- because it &apos;s also about a centimeter to me not that &apos;s good for nothing .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous , and I don &apos;t want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our big creative minds to live .
And certainly I know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start to get that I felt dark support of the support support of the beliefs , overall the circumstances where I &apos;m in my career .
That &apos;s true -- I &apos;m very young , I &apos;m very young , I &apos;ve got about 40 years .
I still have about four work decades in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything writing about now , it &apos;s going to be judicted from the world as the work that came out after the very very successful of my last book .
I &apos;m going to be skyl , because we &apos;re all more or less friends here -- it &apos;s likely that my greatest success is to my own own own own .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start dying in the nine morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I &apos;m going to keep doing this work that we do this work that we do this work that we do this work .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it seems to me , after many reflective reflective , that the way to work to go and write is that to create a protective psychological construct , OK ?
I have to find a safety distance of me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural advanced about what I think is going to be going to be looking through . And , as I was trying to look through the time , trying to find other societies that they could see if they could have better ideas and more and more sub-bedying to find other societies and more sub-sane ideas and more sub-sane .
how to help creative people to deal with the unherent risks of creativity .
And that research me to the ancient Great and ancient Rome .
Splplease because I come back and then back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity was creativity from the men , OK ?
And it was the creativity was this spirit looks like this . And that &apos;s the spirit looks like , and that came to men from some distant and unknown , for distant reasons and unknown .
The Greeks were called these spirits of the demons of creativity .
Socrrrrationally , believed that I had a deelarged dealing away .
Romans were the same idea , but they called the spirit of the same idea , but they called the spirit .
That &apos;s great , because the Romans were not really thought that a genius were just a kind of intelligent .
They thought a genius was this kind of divine that had lived in literally in the walls of a little bit , a little like the elevent of a little bit like the elected . And that was a very much like the artist of the artist , and models the output of that work .
There &apos;s eastly -- that &apos;s the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological construct that you protect from your work .
And everybody was working , like this that it worked , right ?
So the antic artists were protected from certain things , like the too narcisism , not ?
If your work was exceptional you could not take it all the mermercied , all of the people who were helped from this genius .
If your failure work , it was not your own fault , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a hometown .
And so people have the han conceived creativity in Western for a long time .
And then the Rinhather came and everything changed , and it &apos;s all about this great idea ; we put the human being to the center of the universe over all of the universe and the mysters and without having more to let space into the creatures of the divinity .
This was the principle of the rational principle and people started to think that creativity came from from the idivided .
And for the first time in history , you start to get this , and that artist as a rather than a genius that artist as a person with the genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think that allow somebody to be a simple person to believe that they &apos;re like a recient recient , and unknown and the source of all the mysters , creative , unknown and ununknown and ethernical and there is a responsibility for a very very large page to give to the fragile psian .
It &apos;s how to ask somebody to enjoy the sun .
Deform and distorce and it &apos;s completely and it makes all these expectations of the performance .
And I think it was the pressure to destroy the artists in the past 500 years .
And if that &apos;s true , and I think that &apos;s , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do it differently ?
You can get to a more ancient understanding of humans and mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t get 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience who would be reading scientific suspended in the notion of , insusuitous , they do do that people follow sfed their own projects .
It probably probably doesn &apos;t really convince you all about this thing .
But the question I want to ask is -- why not ?
Why not do you think about this way ?
Because it &apos;s more sense of everything that I &apos;ve ever heard to explain the exasperative exasperative of the process .
A process that as anyone ever tried to do something -- so , basically , all of the way , all of the way , all of the way .
And in fact , it can sometimes seem completely paranormess .
I &apos;ve done this recently with the remarkable poeet Ruth Stone , who has been 90 years , but that was a poem for all life and said , during his childhood , and he felt that inside the Virginia , working in the Virginia , and I felt that inside the poem .
He said he was like a wheel-air .
And that was going to roling her from the landscape .
He was getting it , because he was going to do the ground under his feet .
He had one thing to do at that point and was , words , &quot; run like a mattert . &quot;
And so he goes back to the house and he was following this poem , and it wouldn &apos;t have to take a piece of paper and a match , and it would have to get it out of the page , and he got to get it up on the page .
And sometimes he couldn &apos;t be fast , so correct and correct and correct and correct and the poem , and he had to go home and the lost and she would continued to rolling through the landscape , trying , and he was going to roll through the landscape , trying to like she said , &quot; another poet . &quot;
And then there were those times -- this piece I never forget -- there were moments when there were almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was trying to paper and poem the passing through , and he said , &quot; He was going , and then he said , &quot; He was going , like you hallungated with the other hand and the office .
And the poem from and he would put in his body and card it into his body and transcovered it on the page .
And in these cases , poem would be presented on the perfect page , but over the last word at the first word .
So when I was thinking -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly the same as it is exactly the same as it .
Not my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conduction !
I &apos;m a moving , and my way to work is ; I get up to the same orary every day and go and work and go and go and go and go and getting it .
But even , in my summit , I &apos;ve got strange against that thing , sometimes .
And I guess a lot of you have the han .
You know , even if the work and ideas came to me from a certain source , I couldn &apos;t get a source .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it , but rather than do it , but , rather , that makes us remains us ?
As I think , the best example of the same time I have the Tom Waits , which I have been interviewed years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the major part of life was the incarnation of the artist tored , trying to control , manager , to address , to address , and to address these species impulses creative impulses .
But then I went up , he hot , and he was driving on a hair in Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
It was going to be very fast and all this little melody , and it comes in his head , and it comes in his head , as inspiration , and it wants , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the wants , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the desidera , but it doesn &apos;t know how to take it .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a match , it doesn &apos;t have a record .
So it starts to feel this kind of old anxiety , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to get obsessed from this song even .
I &apos;m not quite good enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to go to the panic , they stopped .
So he was going to put the whole mental process and made something completely new .
He just looked at the sky and said , &quot; Sorry , don &apos;t you see what I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Do you think that can write a song right now ?
If you really want to be able to be more than one when I can take care of you .
Altherefore you go to importantly somebody else today .
You can disturbing Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his work , he changed after that .
Not the work , the work was still hoscure .
But the process , and the fish anxiety that was that they had been left when the genius , the genius that outside him , the genius that came out of him . And it reaching it back to where they came , and freezing it back from where they came , and the hurged .
But it &apos;s not a kind of well-of-free , wonderful , a conversation between Tom and this thing straight , but it wasn &apos;t Tom .
So , as the story I started to change a little bit the way I was working and already saved me once .
This idea , I &apos;d save when I was writing , &quot; Man , Prega , and fell in a of those cave of the disperation that we &apos;re all working on something and we &apos;re all working on something and we can start thinking that will be a disaster , that &apos;s going to be a disaster , which is going to be a disaster book .
Not just bad , the worst book wrote .
And I started thinking about to get this project .
But then I remember Tom I was talking to the air and tried .
So I got up to my face on the manoscritical and I had my comments to a vacuum of the room .
And I said to high voices , &quot; Sent , what both of these know , if this book is not going to be good , is it &apos;s not going to be any of my , no ?
Because as I see I &apos;m putting all all I have , I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to introduce you and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do that , you know what I don &apos;t do .
I &apos;m going to go to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I would like to be recorded that I &apos;ve been presented to do my part . &quot; Because the end is so , OK -- centuries ago in the deserts of North people were dance , the people were rown up on the clear dances of moon , dance and the sacred that went on to the high school .
And they were always magnifts because the dallerini were professional and were fantastic .
But every time , it was something happened , and one of these artists became actually transcendent .
And I know you know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know you &apos;ve all seen , at some point , a performance .
It was like the time , it was like the time , and the dancing walks through a kind of lapal and it was not doing anything else from the usually , like 1,000 notes , but it &apos;s all going to come up .
And suddenly it &apos;s just like a human .
But he came from the divinity and the fire of divinity .
And when this happened , the people knew what was , the people knew what was , they called it .
And they were to sing the hands and started to sing , &quot; Allah , Allah , God , God , God , God , God , God , God , God , God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
I was historical notes -- when the Mororic , I was preserve this habdine with them and the ready to them and the ready unts , and the ready unts , and the ready uncaught in the damage of the corride or famenco .
In Spaign , when a artist has done something that magic and &quot; Allah , the skull , the magnifts , &quot; ununcomcomprehensible , and then it &apos;s a scum -- a foot of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes up the day , for the dancing same , when you see daughter and then you see that are the 11 in the morning and the dramb of God there is no more .
It &apos;s just a very bad mortal to the ginocaque , and maybe it &apos;s never going to get to that height .
And maybe nobody will sing the name of God as a gira , and what is going to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most painful re-conciliations to do in a creative life .
But maybe it &apos;s not going to be so corosciating if you can not believe , advanced , that the most extraordinary aspects of your being being .
But just believes that you have been data in the early age of a kind of inimaginable to the piece of your life that you have to go to somebody else when you finish it .
And , you know , if we think that &apos;s all changing .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s certainly like I thought it for different months in the book that I &apos;ve been thinking about for different months in the book that I &apos;m going to have been doing , the dangerous , and I was following my very successful .
And what I have to tell me when I feel electrized from this is , I &apos;m not going to have fear .
Not at the way . It &apos;s just your work .
You &apos;re going to present you for your hand , any can be .
If your work is dancing , you know , you know .
If the divine , I enjoy you get a decide to let some kind of wonderful , for a only time through your effort , for just a moment through your efforts , then , &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Other ddance , you do the same dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot; to you the same .
I think I think it &apos;s to teach it .
&quot; Ole ! &quot; to you the same , even for having a human love and testables to make a tal tals to make you continuously present .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can mean and to find new set of gengenes .
Now we &apos;re starting a new way , we started to digitize biology and now we started to digitize the biology and now we &apos;re going to a new phase of biology , designing and synthesizing and synthesizing life .
We &apos;ve always tried to ask big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists , I think they have attempted to figure out out out of levels .
We &apos;ve tried different approaches , reducing it to the minimi terms .
We &apos;re digitizing over 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the analogical world to the digital world .
Now , we ask , can we regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma , which is the species from the smallest genome that is the species from the smallest genome of those that can authoretic genome .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little more .
We can get a hundred genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of 500 that are here .
But when we look at its map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our .
It &apos;s simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can get out , one at the time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this can bring to a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to design was synthesize this chromosome that was able to change the components to bring some components to get some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of &quot; Can we synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Can we have the chemistry consending these big molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create before ?
And , in case , we can make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of inert chemical material .
The speed with which we &apos;re able to digitize life is growing at exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , design , rather slowly , but it &apos;s getting better .
And our most recent results the bring on a exponential curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process required a lot of passages , starting with a bioethical review before we first experiments .
But we &apos;ve discovered that synthesize DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that produce small segments of DNA , the long length of 30 to 50 letters and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the most mistakes there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assembly these fragments and court the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , starting to start with digital information about the genome of Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , we &apos;ve designed the mistake and get a DNA molecule . And we got a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material inherent , and we put it into bacteria , they started reading this this genetic code and to make the viral particles .
The viral particles were then reduced by the cells , are come back and they were destroyed .
I talked about recently with members of the oil industry , say that they have to have to understand this model .
They have more than you .
We think this is a situation where the software can actually build his same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things larger .
We wanted to build the whole chromosome of the bacteria .
They are more than 580 thousand letter of genetic code .
So we thought we &apos;ve been thinking to build it in cassette of the viruses , so that we can change the cassette of the living .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard accuracy was a mistake for every 10 thousand basis .
We &apos;ve discovered it , resequencing it , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence we never would be able to do it .
A part of the process is to design segments that are over-in-to-50 letters to make the other segments of the other segments of the other segments .
We try to take together together .
You &apos;ve probably read that we &apos;ve seen that we put in the fighting .
So , think about it &apos;s like this : We have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , Gs and T.
Three of those letters , put up about 20 amminoacids , and there &apos;s a specific order to letters for every ammits .
So we can use the genetic code to write , frankly , thoughts .
What we did at the beginning was authograin it .
Some have been delused to do that it was not poem .
We designed these segments to get them to just join with the enzyme .
There are some of them remained and put them together .
And we started to assembling parts , starting with the segments from five to seven thousand to seven thousand and letter them , and they &apos;re going to form segments of 24 mila letters to them to 72 mies .
So , we have made these segments in abundance so that we can sequence them because we &apos;re trying to create a very robust process -- like you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this looks like the tellon a basket player .
When we get these little segments that are very long , more than 100 thousand basis , they &apos;re not going to grow more directly in E.
You get to the modern molecular biology .
So we &apos;ve been considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called the homological rumban , which in biology to use to repair the DNA to get together the DNA to join the segments .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism called Deinococcus radiodurans , can absorb three million rad .
You can see in the high riquitous as his chromosome is destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours it &apos;s just like it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely dry .
They can live under empty .
I &apos;m sure that life exist in space , and you can find new environments of water .
Actually , NASA showed that this is going .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built using these processes , just using the lievated with design appropriate segments to put .
The lievated it .
This picture was not taken with a regular microscope , but with a regular microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It &apos;s a so big molecule that we can see it with a little little microscope .
These are pictures that they cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the publishing publishing that we &apos;ve done a little time .
They are more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the largest molecule structure ever created by the man .
It has a high weight height to 300 million .
If we &apos;re going to be a 10 without spaces , we want to take a 142 pages only to transform this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ? How can we activer it ?
Of course , you know , you know , you know , a game .
It &apos;s a little more complicated when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s easier to be even when it &apos;s eucarial cells like our : you just get the nuclear and put together , which is basically the process of cloning .
In the bacterium that is rather integrated inside the cell , but we &apos;ve recently demonstrated that we &apos;re able to do a complete trapial trapion a complete trapial trapot from one cell to another and to activer it .
We clean a chromosome parent from a kind of microbial species .
The two are different than the men from mice .
We &apos;ve added some genes in a way that we could decide what to choose for this chromosome .
And then the skip with the enzyme so that they were killing all proteins .
And when we put it in the cell is been rappdowntown -- and you &apos;re going to open up our sophisticatoic -- the new chromosome is went inside the cell .
And we thought we were in the way , but we tried it anyway , but we tried it anyway there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We &apos;ve found that tantissim has added a second or a third chromosome from some part , add in a second thousands of new traits to that species .
So , who think about evolution as a gene once once it &apos;s actually really really understood much much of the biology .
There &apos;s a enzyme called the restriction enzyme that they can make DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell not possible one .
The mobile phone -- the chromosome we have put it in the --
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other chromosome as a material , the masticked it , and we found out with only the cell and the new chromosome .
It &apos;s become blue because of the genes that we put .
And in a short lash of time , all the characteristics of a species , they have gone lost , and it &apos;s transformed around a new species , based on the new software that we put in the cell .
All the proteins have changed , members have changed , and when we read the genetic code exactly what we &apos;ve moved to the genetic code exactly what we &apos;ve moved to do .
Now , this might seem like genetic alchemy , but by by going to look at things in a very subway .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that it &apos;s not about genesis -- but progress from three million years and a half years of evolution , and I &apos;ve already told that maybe we &apos;re to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty obvious when we think about our necessities .
We &apos;re going to go from six and a half billion people at nine in the next 40 years .
Right to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each other in 1946 ; 40 years , there &apos;s four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find food , fresh and clean , medicine and wellin for six billion and a half a thousand people .
It &apos;s going to be even more to do it for nine .
We use more than five billion fuel fuel barrels , more than 30 billion of olium .
That means 100 million barrelates a day .
When I try to find biological processes , or or any kind of process to repet them , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
And we have to keep all the CO2 emission from these materials that &apos;s going to end up in the atmosphere .
At the day of today , because of the scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the components for the future .
The electronic industry , only only only one dozen about components , and think about how many different things came out .
Our limits here are data from the biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have some techniques , because of these synthesization , that we have some techniquomic methods , and able to create what we call genomic combinatory .
We can build a big robot that can produce a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think of how to processing these 20 million genes or to try to optimize the processes to produce dock or drugs , new vaccines , we can change , because of a small team , and create more molecular biology that over the last 20 years .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemical production or chemical , or of vaccines .
This is a few software instantanem of some software that we &apos;re working to be able to seat and design species at the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how they &apos;re going to be .
We know exactly how their genetic code .
Now we &apos;re focusing on the fourth generation .
You also saw you who extract hanch hax from the grain was a wasting experiment .
We have depending on the third generation that will use enough to be very soon soon to the sugar of the higher value like the doctor or different butanx .
But the only way that biology can have a great impact without increasing the cost of food and limestone the cost of the cost of food and limbs the available available , and we &apos;re working out of designing cells that can achieve this purpose , and we think that we can achieve the first coal , and we think that we can achieve the first coal .
The solar light combined with CO2 is a metodo--- but in our discoveries all over the world , we found different metods .
This is a organism that we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
It &apos;s in the deep ocean , at about 2,500 feet of deep-foundation temperature temperature .
It creates metane from the CO2 using hydrogen using a source of energy .
We &apos;re trying to figure out if we can incanal CO2 , which can easily be brought through your bbbbes , convert that CO2 in coal , to drive this process .
So , we think we might be able to increase what the question of the question , what the question is , &quot; What is life is we have the further goal to repeat the whole chemistry industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working to use the same methods to create instantanei .
You &apos;ve seen this year with the flu , we &apos;re always back of a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s about find the right vaccine .
I think what you can change building combinable in anticip .
And that &apos;s how the future might start to look at the time , the tree of evolution , accelling evolution with synthetheists , and finally cells , archatheists , and finally cells .
We &apos;re so so much from improving people .
Our purpose is to make a long enough way to try and do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the faster possible , some fundamental work , the new technology that we brought to the Microsoft , and we &apos;ve been doing that . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s a environment where you can interact is local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data .
Here we &apos;re seeing a lot of digital giabyte photograph with a kind of digital photos with a kind of weighted and continue , for a fast panoramic , and we have the images like .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much the amount of information that we see , how big these data are , or images .
Most of them are common digital photographs , but this for example is a provening from the Library of Congress , and reentra 300 megamma .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that limits the prestations of a system like this is the number of package on your screen at any time . It &apos;s also a very flexible architecture .
This is a book whole , all of example of the data doesn &apos;t have images .
This is the Dickens of Dickens . Every column . Every column is a hapter .
To show you that it &apos;s just about text and not the images , we can do something like that , to do really see what it &apos;s about a real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a little electronic book .
I don &apos;t recommend it .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s about a number of The Guardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a section .
And I really gives you the pleasure and the good experience of reading the real carpet of a magazine , which is for nature of a thousand daily kind of a half a kind of a half .
We also did something with the corner of this number in particular Guardian .
We &apos;ve created a fashion that -- much more than what you use in a normal publishing -- and you have a normal content . And we put in the extra content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see the characteristics of this automobile .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the space limits of space on the screen .
And we hope that this means to put people to the people and sun and other similar , not to be able to do that , not have to be able to do .
Of course , the mapapappropriate is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say that we have to do this in the field .
These are all the streets in the United States overhead the soveroverhead geospatial image .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually alive on the web ; you can go to the web .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , who are fighting two different technologies .
A is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting visual computer that we &apos;ve made from Noah Snavely , a student of the University of Washington , with the help of Steve Seadrrron the Microsoft Research . It &apos;s a great collaboration .
And it &apos;s from the living on the web , I was in Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from one image to the other and have this kind of experience to multipla .
But spacecraft of the images here has actually a meaning .
The visualization of the computer algorithms have these images together , so that they correspond to the real places that they &apos;re all connected to the lakes -- all the blags near the lakes in the Rocciose channels -- they &apos;ve taken . So you see , you see the elements of a slides of a slightly stable or a imaging .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more spacecraft .
I want to spend directly to one of the original data set of Noah. And this is from a very early prototynth of the first time we &apos;ve done the first time the summer -- to show you what I think is really about the key behind this technology , the Photosynth technology , Photososynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily evidence that we have in the website .
We had to worry about the legal aspects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of the Nothree Dame &apos;s received by Flickr . Bauction . You get Nobody Din Flickr and you get images of types in the shirts and so on . So one of these boundaries is a picture that &apos;s discovering to appear to this model .
So they &apos;re all images from Flickr and they were all connected to spatial level in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to be able to be very simple .
You know , I would never have thought to end to work for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifically to receive this kind of accounts here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s about a lot of different types of phones of phones who are in SLR , a significant number of those professional moons , a significant number , put together in this environment .
And if I can try and try and look at those more strange .
Many stuck from faces , etc .
Somewhere you have a series of photographs -- and so that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be a series of photographs -- and it &apos;s a series of photographs --
This is a Nobody &apos;s poster in the correctly .
We can go from the poster of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is taking data from the whole collective memory -- from the whole collective memory of how the earth the land , from the visual point of view -- and connects all that data together .
All those photos become connected , greater than the sum of the parts .
You have a model of the whole land that emerges .
Think about this as the prolungation of Stephen Lawler &apos;s work on virtual Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as people are using it , and the whose advantages for who are useful .
Their photos are marked with meaded by other people .
If somebody is the idea of contrast all these sets say , my name , my chicken cattedly , my picture of Nobody DDemadmits of Nobody DDemadmelt , and I can use it as a ingressed ingress in that space , in that metaphor , using the photos of other , and having a social experience of the kind of a cross-moon and cross-user .
Of course , a consequence of all this is virtual models , extremely elaborated by every interesting part of the land , collectious images and satellite images and similar satellite images and similar , but from the collective memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understood ? What your software is going to be going to be that at some point in the next few years , all the pictures are shared by anyone in the world in the entire world will be practically connected ?
BAA : Yes . What &apos;s doing is actually doing is to find out .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , you know , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the images .
And the thing becomes very interesting if you think about the seanti-seantic information that many of these images .
As when you do a images of the web , you have a sentence and the heads on the page of the web has a lot of information to the pictures of the photos .
Now , what happens if that picture is connecting all your picture ?
So the amount of seantic interconnection and the amount of wealth that comes to really huge . It &apos;s a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the main pleasers when you travel and one of the dolphon the hetnographic research is that you can live in the wind , and you have the antic traditions , who had the past in the wind , and the hits the walls is that in the rain , the leaving leaving the plants .
Basts to think that the shaman Jaguar , they still over the Via Lattea , or that the old old old old , or the Inuit &apos;s still cold of significance , or that in Himalayas , the buds still follow . And the important important important important of the subject of the subject of anthropology , and the idea that the world we live in which we have not solved in sense , but it &apos;s just a reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stires did , well or bad , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share essential strikes .
We all procreate .
We are subjects to start with the beginning .
We have to deal with the death of the inesorability , so we don &apos;t surprised to do it .
We all have an art .
What it &apos;s hits the particular rhythm of the song , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that the Penan of the Borneo , or the follow of the Voodoo &apos;s Borneo , or the desert warriers of the desert Kaithly in the middle of the Andeny , or the Curander &apos;s heart , or a cammelt in the heart of the Ande of the Sahara .
He was my journey of journey in the desert a month , or a yak haller in the Qomolangma , the mother &apos;s dea mother of the world .
All these populations teach us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And , if you refer , it &apos;s a concept that it can give you hope .
Insively , miriadeaths of the world are creating a spiritual and cultural life that flew the planet and it &apos;s important for the well-being of the planet as the Chinese roughly the planet as biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural race as a way to a nosphere and you can call the total nosphere , the total nosphere , the ideas , dreams , mites , ideas , inspirations , ideas , inspirations , intuitive comes from the human imagination of consciousness .
The etnosphere is the great patrimonium of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be as as inquisitive species .
And because biosphere was very very quickly to the etnosphere , and unfortunately , that &apos;s very quickly .
No biologist , for example , would say that 50 percent of all the species is the horric is just about the horric ap just because it &apos;s filled , or -- in the most apocalittical diversity -- and you don &apos;t get to the most optise -- that we could not get to the most optional diversity -- that &apos;s the most optional diversity .
The surx of all that is , obviously , the language loss .
When you &apos;re born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just composed to be by a vocabulary or a series of rules .
A language is the sprawardness of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle of which the soul of every culture comes in in the material world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a kisa thought , a thought , a thought ecosystem of the spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re sitting in Monterey , at least half not the midst in the ears of the children .
They don &apos;t get teaching children , the which means , unless than not cames something , which is already death .
What is more to be flew from the silence , of the silence , of the last speaking a language , the way that we don &apos;t transmate the wisdom of the kids or to anticipate the promise of children ?
This is a bit of somebody in some of the world in some of the world every two weeks : every two weeks , each other . And it &apos;s a few weeks , and the willing silly language .
And I know somebody who will say , &quot; Is it better that ?
The world wouldn &apos;t be a better place if we were to let all talk about the same language ? &quot; All right , then we &apos;re all yoruba .
We talk about kogs .
You &apos;ll find a sudden what it means you can &apos;t talk about their language .
I &apos;d like to do a journey through the etnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a bit of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , &quot; different ways of existing ways of existing .
So let &apos;s take for example , Barasana , in the Amazon Sthereby , the people of the anaconda , which is believing in the mist of the Eastern &apos;t the bulds of the Eastern bread &apos;s paying .
It &apos;s about a people who can &apos;t tell the color blue blue blue from green because the celests from green because the time cell , and it &apos;s identified in the forest , where it depends on the people .
They have a strange language and a matriage , called &quot; exogy language , &quot; exogy language , &quot; You have to marry a person who &apos;s talking about a different language .
All of this has roots in the mitological past , though the particularity is that in these families , where six or seven ingenious to the mitological none .
They are limited to listen and then they start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribe that I &apos;ve lived , the Waorani of Ecuador , a incredible populations that had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionaries have been trying to contact a fatal mistake .
They &apos;ve been dumped out of the photographs that they react them in the room that they were very loving , forget that this populations of the forest pluent had never seen anything about bi-dimensional .
They collected the ground , they have been around to the research of a form or a shape and , and not find nothing , they have concluse that they had the diavily treated , and they killed the five missionarts with the lance .
But the Waorani don &apos;t just have the foreign &apos;t only the foreign .
They killed each other .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by their own .
We &apos;ve been saved at eight generations and we found two natural death , and when we &apos;ve been talking about to know , they have a lot of them invecked , and then they &apos;ve been invecking , and then they killed it . And then they killed it same .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine from 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I &apos;ve been a really interesting job when my Harvard professor , I was asked if I wanted to go to Haiti and intruly intruly , I was a very interesting job of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes , and I impossesses of the poison of the poison that I use susususum .
To make sense of miraculous , I should have understand Vodoo culture and that Voodoo is not magic .
It &apos;s quite a very complex metaphorrific view of the world .
Most interesting .
If I asked you to tell me about the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christianity , Islam , Ebraism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has not religious faith . And they do , but the Voodoo is not the other one that the distilled of these religious concepts that &apos;s very profound of nates during the tragic diaspora of slavor .
What &apos;s interesting is that it &apos;s the intense relationship between life and death .
So , the living you are berites .
The spirits can be invested by the Great Act , they respond to the rhythm of the dance and replace time to the living as a short moment , the following way to the living as a brief .
For this the woodooists like , you know , you know , you know , you know , God .
We have to go into the temple and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re going to be the spirit that driving you , how can you do you get you wrong ?
So you see these incredible events : following voodoo in the state of trance that touches impunes in the sancy , which is that they touch in a very strong demonstration of the body when it &apos;s catalyzed in a state of extremitation .
And in all the people that I &apos;ve been in the most extraordinary is Kogi of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Nevada de Santa Marta , Colombia .
It &apos;s to the ancient civilization that once had lived on the aid of the span of the Colombia in the charge of the Colombia , the people were going to be on the volcanic massive volcanic massive that you could take on the charity .
In a blood continent of blood , this people have never been conquered with the spagage-of-spagnee-of-spagnees .
But I &apos;m actually in today , they &apos;ve been government from a clam , but their formation is very extraordinary .
The young people are brought from from the families to three or four years , and they live secrets in a good world and shading in a good world , which was stone of the frozen fairs for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years , of the proposal to produce the nine months of gestation that they go into the mother of the mother , they are now metaphor the user .
For all this time , they get accultured to the values of their society , values that are the values that are the forayers and only their prayers to keep the cosmic balance -- or to say the ecological balance .
And so the term of this incredible initiation , they &apos;re suddenly brought out and for the first time to be 18 years , they see a dawn . And that &apos;s the moment of the first bull , when the sun kets the wonderful valuable valuable valuable , everything that have learned in theory is all that they &apos;ve learned in the theory . The pret it is a step .
&quot; Vist ? I &apos;m like I said .
It &apos;s amazing . Now it &apos;s now to you protect it . &quot;
They call them larger brothers and say that we , brothers , we are the colpful of the destruction of the world .
This is very important .
When we think about the indigenous populations and the environment we invoke R-houses and the old history of selling selage , which is a re-called Thoreau and maybe invoke Thoreau and say that these people are closer to the Earth .
The Indigenes are not nor indebate .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the Asmat the Asmat the Asmat the Tibet , but because of time and rituals , but because of time , they &apos;ve created a mystical of the Earth based on the concept that the Earth can live only because it &apos;s more subtle . But the concept that the Earth can live only because it &apos;s infused by human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
It means that a kid of Ands that a kid in Ande that the mountain is a spirit of the mountain is a very different spirit , and it &apos;s going to have a deeply different relationship with the mountain or that place with the mountain or that place that a lot of the Montana that &apos;s a masse of rocks are going to be taken .
That &apos;s the dimora of a spirit or a mineral caught .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that &apos;s called the relationship between the individuals and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia , because I think that the forests was needed to be cut .
And this has made me a different different to my friends . Kwakiutl that believe that the forests are the dimora of Hukukukuk and the dog of the heaven and the dog the dog of the world , and the dog .
If you start to think that these cultures can create different , you can start to start with some of them senational discoveries .
I took this picture to open up in the norony Amazon the norony Amazon .
Maybe some of you &apos;ve heard about the ayahuasca , the most powerful psychoactive psychoactive ,
What makes the very fascinating the ayahuasks is not the drug of the substance , but the processing elaboration . It &apos;s also composed to two elements .
On one side , this liana legning that contains a series of Tial-, harmoline and harmoline , slightly hallucinogene .
And then you try the only plant , you have a smoke that alter a little bit that alter , but it &apos;s mixed with the leaving leaving the family of the coffee Psychotry is .
This plant contains powerful powerful powerful , very similar to the seriotonin , dimethyptamine , dimethyptamine .
If you ever see Yanomami thyanomami throwing on the nose of the nose of the sub-species , it contains methyyptamine .
Thiring that dust on the nose is a little bit like being gone from a little bit of barking and land on a bar-and to land on a bar-. &#91; Risate &#93; Not a distortion of reality .
I often have to my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who had taken the afterwards was a sevened , with his discovery of fungi hallucinogens in Mexico .
I mean my thesis is not going to be a classification of this as hallucinogens because if you &apos;re made not to tell any of being hallucinated .
It &apos;s possible to be absensus just if abunits with other chemicals that they dency MAO .
Now it &apos;s the beautiful : the Ti-coal , the Tiell that are injumbers of MAO , the same kind of need to get the triptamine . The question is the question . The question is is spontaneous . And the question goes away away , like these people are two defologically not similar , but that if you combine in this way , create a biochemical version that &apos;s the ground of the parts ?
We use the great eufemalism of the evidence and error , which can reveal .
But if we ask Indians , they &apos;ll tell us . &quot; The plants are talking about . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuasca , which distinguishment in the forest , and that we would come into the same species .
If we ask how they stopped their tabonomy will say , &quot; I thought I understood that plants , and you don &apos;t know everything ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take 17 variety in a night of a lamp and each other . And each other .
With this is not graduate at Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than to count the stami .
Now , &#91; applausers &#93; the problem is that even those of us who have to heart heart people who have to be painting , but some way reduced to the history of our real world , and it &apos;s going to go beyond .
In fact , the 20th century , in 300 years , it &apos;s not going to remember his or technological innovations , but rather like the one was where we &apos;re stopmed and we used to habbleabraced and a lot of mass mass mass destruction of mass biological diversity and cultural innovation .
All the cultures through centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibilities .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux have no stop being Sioux when they put away from the arco and frecovered as Americans have no stop being Americans when they put on the horse and calculus .
It &apos;s not the change or the technology that threatened the integrity of the etnosphere . It &apos;s the power .
The hard hard hard hard to domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you find that these are not cultures .
They are living creatures and dynamic , the living creatures out of the existence from the most of their adaptation .
It &apos;s about the Penan --
a pet peak peak in Sarawak , in the Asian , a people who lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to the servitery and reduced to the rights and the prostitution of the ries of the drams , where you can see the river of the lim that looks at the Borthththanks , where you can see the river of the well-ym , where you can see the river .
you ready to fill the wooden swarm with the forest .
or , in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that have come with the discovery of the gold .
If we put on the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you see the hard hard hard hard to see the political domain .
As you know the genocide , the extinction of a people , is convicted at the universal level , but the equals , the destruction of the style , not only is confestyle , but even celebrated in certain environments , because it &apos;s part of the development strategy .
And you can &apos;t understand the Tibet until you start .
I &apos;ve taken the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in the Western China through Western Tibet , coming to Lhasa with a young connected , but only arriving in Lhasa with a young connected , but only arriving in Lhasa I understood what we &apos;ve heard about .
6,000 monuments sacred reduced the dust and centers .
1.2 million people killed from the military during the Cultural Revolution .
And the father of this guy was ascriteria at Panchen Lama .
And that means that it was killed to the time of Chinese invasion .
His uncle , in Santiity during the diaspora that led led to the people in Nepal .
His mother was employed and his cold was to be rich .
It was brought to hide in caring at the age of two years , he was born in his gonna because he couldn &apos;t have no live without him .
The sister , who did the same , was put in reduced reeducational field .
A day , he reverted a hot hot button , and , for this transgression , was put in the transgression , was put in the seven-year-old .
The Tibet can be insopportrait , but the spirit of the people is from tener tener .
And then , it all reduces to a choice .
We want to live in the world world &apos;s monocromatic or do we want to get the world .
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he died , before he died , and we go to this amory view of the world , we &apos;re not just seeing the whole gamma of the world , we &apos;re going to see the whole gamma of thinking , but one day we &apos;ll see the whole gamma of thinking , but a day we &apos;ll see a sleeping lack of thinking , but one day we &apos;ll see the whole gamorage of thinking ,
And it &apos;s a loud to remember that our species for 600,000 years .
The Neolitica Revolution , which has given us agriculture , which has made us to overght us to restle the seed , replacing the poem of the skull with the prosa poem of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has been 300 years .
That sharp story doesn &apos;t suggests me that we have the answers to all all the challenges that we have to deal in the millennia to come .
When these miriades of the world is asked what they want to say to be human , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we &apos;re all going to refairly refairly , that has to make a way that all the people and gardens can train . And there &apos;s great moments of optimism .
I took this picture on the northern island of Baffin , when I went to core core of whales with Inuit , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and I told the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The Canese government wasn &apos;t always gentile with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to stabilize our spremate , we &apos;ve haked them in colonies .
The grandddad of this man refused to go .
The family , tempting for his life , he brought it away all the weapons , and all of his equipment .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t feel the cold , they do it .
The skills of the sliters were made of fish that flew in skin .
The granddad of this man didn &apos;t put out of the night or the byard , or the bylizard , and it &apos;s not about .
It &apos;s been disgacted the pantalones in the skin and defected the path of their hand . When I did it frozen , and they did it create a sama .
He &apos;s spruated salive on the punta of this cow and when it solido , and when it became solid .
He shshaked the dog and created a brighter , with the torate ching , has been made a slums , he daughtered another dog is disappeared on the banking , the ca bank , the ca bank , the ca bunch of handed .
We want to talk about horse with nothing ? &#91; Risate &#93; And that , in different ways , &#91; Applausers &#93; is the symbl of the resilience of the people in the world .
In the aprile 1999 , the Canads government reduced to Inuit the total control of a larger area of the Texas , and Texas .
It &apos;s their new painting . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a independent territory . They all the mineral resources .
One mark example of how a natione-state can re-re-conciliate with his people .
And , finally , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious to the who we have been in these remote areas of the planet , and I realize they &apos;re not remote .
For somebody &apos;s home .
They represent the human imagination that they go to the heat of time . And for us all , the dreams of these kids , like dreams of these children , like dreams of our children , are part of the geography of hope .
So we &apos;re in the Geographic , we are convinced that political political will never come to nothing .
We believe that polemics --
&#91; Applausers &#93; not lost , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best institution to tell stories about the world . Every month our rnow , and maybe we &apos;re the best institution to tell the stories of the world .
156 countries transmitted our television .
Our magazines are lls from millions of people .
Our work is traveling in the etnosphere to bring our public places in the reveal of our public places that they have gone from how they saw and , hopefully , abbraced , and hopefully , they will be used to find a lifestyle of life in a diversity , and we have to find a lifestyle of life in a pluralist world , and we have to find a lifestyle world in a pluralist and a world of life in a pluralist and a lot of life in a life in a life in a life in a life in a life in a life
where the wisdom of all the people can contribute to our collective well-being .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope you &apos;ve heard and try to point that you &apos;ve heard and try to point out some connections , in case you don &apos;t note .
I want to start with what I call the official dogma .
The dogma official what ?
The western official society of all the Western industrial society . The Dogma offical Dogma official . If we want to male the well-being of our citizens . &quot;
The reason is , on one side , in fact that the freedom is in itself , in fact , the useful , and essential for humans .
On the other one of us can do everything that if we are free , each of us can do everything that we have massized our well-being , without any one that decide in our well-being , without any one that decide in our name .
The way to massively freedom is massively the choice .
The more choices choices , the more libere , and the highest freedom , is their well-being .
This is so deeply I think , it &apos;s so deeply I think in the society that nobody would have to put it in doubt .
And it &apos;s also deeply roystopped in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress made .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m going to allow me a simple note of the condition .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without contact the 10 variety of olium of olive olive and 12 halls that you can buy a huge number of conditions that you can buy a huge number of conditioning around the circumstance that nobody of the 175 .
Here &apos;s what the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic store to buy a stereo : cast , the CD , radio , fold , light , light , flefer .
And in this single electronic store , there &apos;s a great audiences .
We can do six and a half million different combinations using the components that there are in a only store .
You have to put it there &apos;s a lot of choice .
Other camps : the world of communications .
And one time , when I was a child , they could get all the desire services that they were able to be a melt that were Bell .
They noleged the phone , they didn &apos;t buy it .
A consequence of that , in the other , was that the phone never crashed .
These times are gone .
We have now a nearly limited variety of phone , especially between the cell phone .
Here &apos;s the cell phone phone .
My favorite my favorite is in the middle , lake MP3 , cutting the nose of the nose , and forcing for the poully-bulgate .
If you don &apos;t have this still seen in the store below , you &apos;re very certain that I &apos;ll get .
And what &apos;s happening is that people come to the store and it &apos;s the question . And what is the answer ? The answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t make a trophic not face .
So , in other ways of life that are much more important than the acquished , the same explosished explosion .
Assistence : It doesn &apos;t happen in the United States that you &apos;re going to go from the doctor and the doctor you say what you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do it , or B , &quot; A , we could do it , and these risks &quot; Bs and these risks . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Dr. , what should I do I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; In it has these benefits and these risks , and B has these benefits and the risks . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebat , &quot; You know , if you were , what would do ? &quot;
And the doctor : &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result we call it autonomy of the malatory , &quot; expression that it looks like a beautiful thing .
But it &apos;s not that you can get the weight and the responsibility of making decisions that somebody knows something , which is the doctor , to somebody else that knows anything , and it &apos;s almost certainly sick -- and it &apos;s certainly undumb -- and it &apos;s not the patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing of products of drugs , directed to people like me and you , which if you think about it doesn &apos;t make any sense , because we can &apos;t buy it .
But if we can &apos;t buy it , because we advertit them ?
The answer is that they want to ask them to ask them to ask them to ask them to change the receiving .
Something about this , as it &apos;s our horse identity is ever a choice of , as you see in this vignet . We don &apos;t want to forcing children . They &apos;re going to get the right moment . &quot; We don &apos;t want to get it .
And we can reinventing us how many times you aggrade .
That means that every morning , in the hell , you have to decide what kind of person want to be .
I &apos;m going to get to family and matriage , a time time the perspective , almost for anyone , was that we had to get the most soon possible possible , and you started to make kids the most soon possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not even what to do after .
I &apos;m doing it , it &apos;s really to play .
I teach a lot of people very smart students , and I &apos;m 20 percent of work than a time .
And not because they &apos;re not very brilliant , not because they &apos;re not not because they are less diligent .
But why are they imposse , I mean , I should get to ask , &quot; I should get marry or not ? I should do that now ? &quot;
&quot; I should I get to get back ? I have to think before children or the career ? &quot;
They are logoring .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this implement not to complete the homework that I teach and not get a great voice to my exame .
And they have to really do that . They &apos;re important questions .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , like Carl , who was Carl submark , because it allows us to work every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from the Hotel Randolph .
And in the parentesesestimate , and I don &apos;t tell anybody what , where the Within the Within , where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use me .
What does this mean , this incredible freedom of choice we have to do this ? It &apos;s that we have to continually deciding , if we have to work or not .
We can go and see our son play , with the mobile phone in a pocket , the Blackberry in other , and the notebook .
And even if they &apos;re all spending , every minute we see our son to re-thinking , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; I need to answer this ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? I have to email this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , it makes the experience of your son very different than your son &apos;s partnerships that would be in other conditions .
So , any of the we look at , small things and large and large objects and lifestyle , life is a choice of choices .
And one time the world was this : That &apos;s that there were some possibilities , but it wasn &apos;t a choice .
The world of today is what dilemma is , &quot; Is it a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is . It &apos;s a lot of the answer .
So the positive lates them , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative .
All this choice is two negative that &apos;s two negative effects of people .
The first , paradoxically , it &apos;s that it makes paralysis that it &apos;s going .
With a lot of options that choose , becomes very difficult to do it .
I give you a significant example : a study of voluntary depensive .
A connected my colleagues at Vanguard data , the giant society of pension , with about a million clients in 2,000 of a million clients in 2,000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offering in more , the percentage of adhhhhouses of two percent .
With 50 offers , there &apos;s 10 percent of the less than a fairly than in the case when they are only five . Why ?
Because with 50 sources that choose , is evil difficult to decide , and the choice is reremoved to the indomans .
And tomorrow , and tomorrow , tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course domans , and of course , tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course tomories , and of course tomorrow , and of course
You know , it doesn &apos;t only mean that these old workers are going to get food for dogs because they don &apos;t have enough money , they want to say that the decision is so unlike the deep-on the tuning dator &apos;s work .
Not participating , they &apos;re losing until five thousand dollars for year from the work dator , which would be well disposed to be .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think that makes the world .
&quot; And to end , for the eternity : ketchup , maionese send ? &quot;
You would like to want to take the right decision , if it &apos;s for the eternity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong wrong , and yet the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can avoid the paralysis and doing a choice , at the end , we &apos;re less satisssatisssatissssatisssatisfacts .
And that for different reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions that they choose , if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would have been better . And what &apos;s going on is that the alternative imagined us to brramatically take the choice of the choice , and the repeat the decision , and the refence reaved the decision , and the reaches that &apos;s going to be done by the decision ,
even when it was a good decision .
The more choices that there are , easier than any detail is unsatisfaction of any detail .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has cleared very well as we think
And so , when there are many opposite options , it &apos;s easy to represent the features of the alternative shot and be less satisfied of the option that you have a choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m sorry with all those who are not New York .
But that &apos;s what you &apos;re probably going to think .
There &apos;s this couple in the Hamptons .
A llow place .
Spiplendida . Otttmethod . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not miss anything . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , maledit , it &apos;s Agust . &quot;
&quot; All my neighbors in Manhattan are away . &quot;
&quot; I could have to talk right right in front of the house . &quot;
And it goes to two weeks from the idea that it &apos;s losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The costo-opportunity deminishes the sod-demining , even when the choice was excellent .
And the more the options that we have to think , the most attraded .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a little bit tells us a lot .
It &apos;s about the moment , and maybe maybe of the living slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you choose , you choose to not do the other .
And the things that we don &apos;t choose to attract that they can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : spiral of expectations .
I tried it on my skin bought a new jeans .
I &apos;m almost always always jeans .
And one time the jeans were just like , they bought and they were buying and they were discomodiscomfortable , only after they brought them a lot of times , they were starting to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple of time when those old were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cutting . &quot;
The bet said , &quot; You want to make it fits , you &apos;re related , relaxed , relaxed fits ? &quot;
You want to do that with the cernic or with the buttons ? &quot; Stonewashed &quot; or &quot; acidwashed &quot; or &quot;
&quot; Was you want to do it ? &quot;
&quot; You know , you want to bust them ? Bla , &quot; Continuate it .
I was stalord , and after a little bit I was able to say , &quot; I want the guy that was the only guy was the only guy had no idea what it was , like , &quot; I tried all came out to me all the maleans , and then I came out of the store that I had ever had .
It was the very very much . I had the best .
But I was worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand that .
The reason I was worse about is that with all my choice , the jeans were altissim , jeans were to be perfected .
I was at the beginning I had minimes . I didn &apos;t expect anything that when there was a kind of , but when I saw 100 , you know , at least a kind of , at least a kind of like it was perfected .
What I did I buy was good , but not perfectly .
After I was trying to do with what I was trying to do was insatisfaced with the expectations .
The addition of options in the life of people don &apos;t do that to increase the expectations that these have respect to the options of the same options .
And this will be less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
No one in the world of marketing if it &apos;s made it .
Because if they knew it , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more to that .
&quot; It was better when you was worse , &quot; The reason it was better when you were better when you were worse was still possible to meet the surprising pleasant .
In the world we live in -- the world we live , the opulent industrialized citizens with the expectation of perfition -- the most we can hope is that things are at the altitude of expectation .
You never had pleasant to be because your expectations , my expectations , they &apos;ve been ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Baxative , &quot; Yes , you want . &quot;
I mean , small authographic moment -- that I &apos;m really married and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t have to do better , I didn &apos;t have to do better , I didn &apos;t have to do better , I didn &apos;t have to do better , I didn &apos;t have to do better , I didn &apos;t have to do it better , I didn &apos;t have to do better , I didn &apos;t have to do better , I didn &apos;t have to do better , I didn &apos;t have to
But it &apos;s not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of the buy a couple of jeans , when there &apos;s just that kind of jeans is that when you &apos;re not satisfied , and you say , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who &apos;s responsible ? &quot; The answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What could I do we ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of jeans , and you buy a unsodisdisfacing , and you ask you who is responsible , it &apos;s just very clear that the responsible , it &apos;s very clear that the responsible you .
You could have done better .
With hundreds of variety available , there are no excuse for the insuccess .
So when people make decisions , even though the result is valid , they feel insatisfacfaced and they give the cold to their own .
In the last years , depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this depression is just that people have deludent experiences because the standard are too high .
And when they have to tell that the cold is their own .
So the final result is that we &apos;re better , we &apos;re better at the end , but we felt worse .
Let me remind you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely fake . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little choice of it &apos;s better than I have no deal , but from this is not going to be a lot of choice .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic value . I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve been overed from a piece of level where the choices are improved to our life .
Now , from the political point of view -- I &apos;ve almost finished -- from the political point of view , the nocy is the following .
And what allows all this to the industrial society is the wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know about it , where the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too bad .
So the faccentery I &apos;m talking about is a mal-being exclusive of the modern , recent society .
And what it &apos;s depressing and angry is this : Steve Levitt spoke yesterday , it &apos;s Steve Levitt spoke yesterday , they &apos;re useful . It &apos;s a spreck of money .
I mean these choices , complicated and dispendiose , it &apos;s not that they are just useful .
They have deleterie .
They do have worse .
If a little bit of what we do is in our society allows to be reversed in those where people have too much possibilities , not only that they would be improved but our .
This is what economists call a relevant improvement .
A redistribution of income redistribution of all -- not only to poor people -- because of this choice in the excess of us .
To the conclude , &quot; You can be all you want . &quot;
You , people of culture , you think , &quot; What does that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t do anything in a glass . &quot;
&quot; A covered imagination , a limited view of the world --
and I &apos;m going to do it at the beginning .
But then , I realized that that the fish the long knows that that the fish the long knows that that the fish the long knows .
Because the reality is that if you &apos;re missing in frankly , you know , you can &apos;t get the freedom . You can &apos;t get the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you break the bocce that all divents you can diminize satisfaction .
You get the paralive , and you reduce the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too strange , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of some symbolic sphere is a roll for inhappiness and , and I &apos;m theme for the rovine .
Thank you very much .
