Last year I showed these slides to prove that the arctic calculus , which for almost three million years had the size of 48 , the size of 48 United States continental , it &apos;s retrofit of 40 percent .
But this suburbia this underlying the gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the spaces of the ice .
The arctic ice ice ice ice is , in a way , the clean heart of global climate system .
You &apos;re going to be reverse and summer retreat .
The next slide slide is going to be a carrelated carlying on on the last 25 years .
The glacy glacy are signed in red .
As you see , they go to the dark blue blue .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter ice , which is summer .
You can see that the so-called ice , five years or more , is like the blood , which here was a blood , which here was coming out of the body .
In 25 years , since that , in fact , in 25 years , so .
This is a problem because the heat all of the heat , you &apos;re going around the arctic ocean where there are huge amount of fuzzy frozen that , skiing , the frozen , and the frozen , and the frozen ocean , where there are huge amounts of frozen .
I &apos;m going to make a total of the atmospheric pollution , that amount could be doubling , that amount could be doubling , super-return .
And some deeply deeper in Alaska metal lakes , you know , by the water .
The Katey professor Katey Walter University of Alaska was tan , and a team at the bottom last winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Wow : You &apos;re good . The question is if we &apos;re going to be it .
And so a reason is that this exchange termal smile from the north .
This is a river at the rule of the glacial regime .
The ported never had ever reached that .
This is the Kangerlussuadian river , in the southwest of the Greenland .
If you want to know how the sal level of the skiest on of the land , here is where the sea reaches the sea .
These currents are increasing quickly .
On the other part of the planet : Antarctica , the biggest block of the planet .
Last month , the scientists have told that the ice balance of ice is in negative , and that the Western Antarctica , which is sun on on some submarine islands , is particularly reached with the sun .
Equival at six feet of the sea level of water , like in Groenland .
Sulil Himalaya , the third greatest block of ice , you see new lakes , which a few years ago were glacious .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population was getting half of the wireless water from that skiing .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the potable water of this city .
The ported is increased .
Even when it decreasing , the same happens to water .
In California , snow on the Sierra Nevada has been 40 percent .
The hyrichins are in crisis .
Science , as you read , they &apos;re grave .
The safety growing up in the world leads to a remarkable to increase in incencounter .
The environmental disaster is increasing a rhythm outside of the normal and unprecedented .
Four times over a lot of the last 30 years I was relief 75 .
This is a kind of insustainable .
If you look at it in the historical context , you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the top of the Pacific Pacific , from the Americans , to the Americans , to the west , and on both of the Indian subcontinent , where there &apos;s a radical scary root of the ocean oxygen in the ocean .
The greatest cause of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the fossil fuel use .
oil is a problem , and coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two of the most emissions , together to China .
And he proponed to build a lot of other centers .
But we &apos;re seeing a change of direction .
These are the projects annullated projects in the last years and some of the vers alternative .
Every way , there &apos;s a politics fight in our country .
The coal and oil industrial and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote to clean coal coal , which is a hosymphones .
That picture was given me to something --
Verice , in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion litri litri waste .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen it on the news .
This is the second largest fllow flow in America .
It &apos;s happened around the Christmas .
Number Christ alize one of the coal industrial .
Video : See &apos;s a thousand , and a happy allegry .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and we grow our economy .
Frosty the carbon and more clean .
It &apos;s good at price , adorable and the workers keep the salesmen .
Al Gore : From here &apos;s much of the West Virginia .
The biggest mineral societies in the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I &apos;m going to be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosy , Harry Re--- don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alliance for the Clima Protection of Clima launched two campaign .
This is one of them , a part .
Video : Attore : At the same with ALergy , we see the climate change as a snap of our business .
So , we have a priority is to invest a lot of money in a publish remarkable to make and confused the truth of fuel .
In fact , coal is not spork .
We think it &apos;s clean -- it &apos;s also a good profumber .
So don &apos;t prehensive climate change .
Let me do .
Video : Attore : Carbon -- you &apos;ve heard about it a lot of it .
So we make a turn into a turn into a structure to the avanid structure for clean .
Straordinariarily ! Mines are a little noise , but this is the sound of the pulit technology .
The coal consumption is between the main world of global warming , but the remarkable technology that you see changes everything .
You look at a look , this is the clean odien technology .
Al Gore : I finally , the positive alternative is connected to economic issue and the national security .
Video : Coming : America is in crisis ; the economy , the climate crisis .
The filter that connects all : our fossil fuel fuel fuel fuel , like the spork and oil oil imported .
Now , though , there &apos;s a new , audacy solution to use .
Repower : 100 percent clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to report of America to make us more secure , and help stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that I throw up to solve our problems .
Repower America . You &apos;re more .
Al Gore : That &apos;s the last .
Video : A : It &apos;s about reempowered energy .
One of the fastest ways of getting to dependence from fuel that killing our planet .
Comparsa : The future is here . Very , sun , a new energy network .
Comparsa : New 2 : New Yorkers for jobs to well-retributed .
Complant : Real . It &apos;s time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old African said , &quot; If you want to go to the speed , go to the faster , go to the faster .
If you want to go far , go together . &quot;
We have to go far , fast .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED I did a LHC .
And you promise to return to go back to how the car works .
So here I am here . And for the ones that the other time , the LHC is the greatest scientific experiment ever tried -- 27 kilometers of circumfirst-conference .
His task is to reach the conditions that were at least less than a billion of a billion since the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
All that is just ambitious .
This is the machine under Ginevra .
We &apos;re going to photographs these mini-Big Bang inside the relevant .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- it &apos;s wide 44 feet and it &apos;s a 2222 feet diameter diameter .
This is an amazing picture of ATLAS in construction so you can see the proportions .
The 10 September of last year we push the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was caused to immense in the control room .
It &apos;s a picture of particles that had done all the around of the LHC , entring in collision , deliberately , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles inside the detator .
In other words , when we saw that 10 September 10 , we realized that the machine worked , which was a great victory .
I don &apos;t know if it was this was going to make us exulating more ophy , when somebody went on Google and saw the initial page was this .
And that means we had a cultural impact beyond that scientific impact .
About a week after , there was a problem with the car , to just these throws up here -- these dorati wears .
These files took 13,000 ampes when the car works at the most of the power .
Now , the technical between you look at the files and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . &quot;
And instead , they can do that because when they &apos;re very cold , they &apos;re going to define the thorders .
So , at least 271 degrees , at a lower temperature at the space between the stars , these files can bring that current .
In one of the junture between the most of the magnear magnear the MRRedwood , there was a defect of fabrication .
So the files are going to climb up , and the 13,000 ampates had a sudden met out of electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think about these magnees , and that they &apos;ve moved from about about 30 centimeters .
They &apos;re damaged about 50 magnetic magnetic .
We had to take them , what we did .
We &apos;ve been repristed and upon it .
They &apos;re now coming back to their underground .
I &apos;m the end of the LHC CC is going to be new integrated .
We &apos;re going to accept that , and we expect to get data to judge or July , and continuing so our adventure to find out what the morning is the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these crashing crashing the value of the valuable of science and frontier engineering engineering .
I think the fact that &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s so hard to go beyond the limits , I think this is the value of things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of an Inglurning scientist , Humphrey Davy , who , I guess , in defense of inutilize his clean was up , his clean up was Michael Faraday , said , &quot; Nothing is so dangerous for the progress of human mind , as the ideas of science is definitely , that we &apos;re not mysters in nature , which is complete in a new mons of conquent . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start asking about rethinking , when you know , as children , you play with children ,
While you were able to get to and grab them , take them and move , and you know , you know , and to do it , and by manipulating space relationships .
Now space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand much of the world around us .
So , by the usual informat-based information , with physical objects , together to my physical objects , together to my consulting Patatattacher , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking , &quot; And if , when we &apos;re using a computer , instead of having the only mouse cursor to move on a desktop , we could have the information with both hands ,
and fix it to our pleasure ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big computer like a bik-like a biscanning .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big computer like a bik-like a biscanning .
You can move with it , they can move with your hand , they can see , &quot; you know , &quot; and they have a screen and a radio wireless radio .
But overwhelmed , are physical objects , like the morning , you can just move it down .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physicists , conwardly , conwardly to the movement , the other , and as they become more physicists , conwardly to the movement , of the other people , how we can look at the new fun and interaction .
I &apos;m going to try to start with a few simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show you about this video : if you get the video out in a direction , the video will rotate so if you get out of the other side back .
These actives are aware of the other .
If I relianco , you know , they &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re around .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can agitate a little bit .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can agitate a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was that we could use communities on data , to try to put a color on the data , for example , &quot; a color &quot; like if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configured like you and I can use them to sweet color and I can use them to put it up .
and I can use them to pour color into the central color , where they &apos;re missing .
If we &apos;re too too much , we can put a little bit of it .
You also are beautiful possibilities of learning , like languages , like the languages , the mathematics and logic where people can try things can try things very quickly , and see the results results right now .
Now I &apos;m --
This is a Fibonacci , I do with a hibonacks program .
Here we have a game of words that is in the middle of Scharabeo and Boggle .
Basically , to every Siftable , you get a letter on every Siftable , to every Siftable , to every Siftable , and while you try to compose you , he &apos;s looking for a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the children came up in the Media Lab , I &apos;ve been doing this so that I came up and turned a video .
They have very much pleased .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of applying is you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
You just say , &quot; You know , &quot; You know , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s other people who try it .
This is our beta younger tester , there on the right .
It actually wanted to be impilars .
They were only only only in the morning for him .
Now , this is an applying of an interactive cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool for learning tool . He &apos;s Felix . He &apos;s Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , soleving the Siftable , they associated with .
It can put new characters in the scene , soleving the Siftable , they associated with .
So it &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : The sun is sun .
David Merrill : Now he took a treatment in the scene .
Video : The aranange treatment .
Bobs ! Yeah ! Yeah .
So you shake the Siftable and put close them to interact the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing your story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a very open-final story , and it can decide him as it flew .
DM : It &apos;s a very open-final story , and it can decide him as it flew .
Video : Golden , cat .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , making and take a recently and make music .
It &apos;s a tool , making a recent tool , to sample and performing music .
The Siftable here are like the basic sound , low-and the battery .
Every one of these has four different variations , and you can choose to use .
You can also also put these sound sound in a sequence to your pleasure .
And to modify it just by doing a sound and a sequence .
And these are actually you can control from alive , like the reverse and the filter .
You know it to a particular sound and then you &apos;re incline to fix it .
And then there are general effects as time and volume , that you apply to the whole sequence .
Let &apos;s look at how it works .
Video : DM : We &apos;re going to put a very basic basic basic , we put them into a series , we put them into a series , we add another basic basic .
I &apos;m going to put a line of the bottom .
Video : DM : I added some percussions --
Video : And now I &apos;m going to put the filter on to the battery , so I can control the vier effect from the effect .
Video : DM : I can poising the whole sequence of time , on one hand or the side or the side .
Video : DM : And now I &apos;m going to add the bottom to the bottom to give more expression .
Video : DM : I can get the sequence &quot; to the sequence &quot; to the flying . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to plan this first , but I can suddenly make it longer or more correct .
And now , finally , I can smoking the entire sequence of the left Siftable to the Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new human interfaces and more like how we work our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that it &apos;s coming this new generation of things that are going to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time to talk to all of you .
I &apos;m a writer .
I &apos;m going to write books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the fascinating of my life .
And I don &apos;t look like to change .
But , I said this , something particular has happened in my life and my career , who led me to reezing the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I &apos;ve been written about this book , this biography called &quot; Mangia , Prega , which , diversously , from my previous books , for some reason came out in the world and became a very big , feeling , wears .
And the result is that everywhere now , people treat me , as if I was convicted .
It &apos;s true -- convicted .
They are all been going to me now and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t afraid to do than we could not be able to do ?
You don &apos;t fear to continue to write all life without being able to create a book that can matter to somebody can matter ? &quot;
what can you care about somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s reassuring , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember that over 20 years ago , I started to say that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say -- I was a written .
I went to meet the same reaction based on the fear .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you feel not going to be able to succeed ?
You don &apos;t afraid the humiliation of kills you ?
You don &apos;t fear to make this mill for all life without anything that &apos;s ever out and to die on a cumb of dreams with the mouth of dying to love cumb cles ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is : &quot; Yeah . &quot;
Yes , I &apos;m afraid of all of the things .
I &apos;ve always had afraid .
And I also have afraid of many other things that people can &apos;t have to be inherent .
Like the algaand other things very frightening .
But , as I &apos;m going to write what I thought and I was asking about and I asked to say , is why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logic that anyone should expect to be frightened by a job that you feel born to do .
But what is so special in the creative entry to make us nervous about the mental health elessly eluates that they don &apos;t do ?
As my father , for example , he was an engineer and I don &apos;t remember one once in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if he was afraid to be engineer ?
There was never -- that &apos;s that block of the engineer John , how does it ?
Not that , you know ?
Onestly , chemicals like group have not certainly , in centuries , in centuries , the reputation of being alcohhoked .
We have a writers , we have enough this reputation , and not only writers but creative , we have this reputation of being enormous instable to mentally mentally .
And it &apos;s not to look at the sad , and you &apos;re contete of the creative magnifies that , only in the 21st century , died and often by their own .
And the ones that don &apos;t have suicked to be really disdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisappeared by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before to die , in the last interview said , &quot; Each a little bit more &quot; an extraordinary fashion to work of your life .
But we don &apos;t throw out when we feel that because we &apos;ve heard these things so long that we &apos;ve completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are in some way that creativity , at the end , at the end , at the end , and the end , and the end , and the end , and the end , and the suffering are always to the corner .
And the question I want to ask to all of this idea ?
It &apos;s OK , because it also looks at it , because it also looks at a centimeter to me not good for this supposition .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous and I don &apos;t want to see it in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our big creative minds .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- in my situation -- in my situation -- would be very dangerous to begin to get to be a very dangerous supposing , overall the circumstances where I &apos;m in in my career .
That &apos;s -- you look at , I &apos;m pretty young , I have about 40 years old .
I still have about four workers of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything I &apos;m going to write about the world , as the work that came out after the setting out of the world as the work that came out after the very scary of my last book .
I &apos;m going to be sky , because we &apos;re all over or less friends here -- is likely that my greatest success is in my shoulder .
Oh , Gesu , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start drink thin the nine in the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would keep on doing this work that we love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so I think , after a lot of reflections , that the way to work to continue writing about creating a protective construction , right ?
I have to some way to find a safety distance between me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxiety of which reaction that you can get . And I was trying to try to get some more , and I started looking through through the time , trying to find other societies , and more healthier ideas and more healthier ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthy ideas . And I &apos;m trying to get some more healthy ideas and more healthier and more
about how to help people creative risks and management the emotional risks of creativity .
And that seared led me to the ancient and ancient Rome .
I &apos;m going to give you a lot of it and then comes back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity was creativity from the men , OK ?
And they thought creativity was this spirit looks like to divine and that came to men somewhere away from a few distant and unknown for some different smile and unknown .
The Greeks called these spirits of the creativity of creativity .
Socrate , wonderful , they thought , they thought that you had a deon wisdom from far .
Romorans were the same idea , but they called that kind of spirit without a genius .
Which is great , because the Romans didn &apos;t really think a genius was somebody that a particularly intelligent .
They thought , a genius was this kind of a divine that was believed literally in the walls of a little bit of the artist , a little bit like the outbreak of the work of the artist , and to model the outcome of that work .
Here &apos;s an extional -- here , that &apos;s the distance of which I &apos;m talking about -- that psychological construction that you protect from your work .
And everybody knew that was so that it worked , right ?
So the antians were protected by certain things , like the narcism , for example , too narcism ?
If your job was exceptional you couldn &apos;t take it and all the mereedy , everybody knew that you were helped by this genius .
If your falliva work , it wasn &apos;t your whole , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a incapable .
And so people have created creativity in the West for a long time .
And then the Rince came and everything , and it all happened , and it was born this great idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe above all of the mysties and no more to leave space to the mitchen .
This was the rational principle of rational humanity and people started thinking that creativity came out of the creativity came from from the idivided .
And for the first time in the story , and it started to reflew this or that artist as a kind of genius that to a person with the genius .
And I have to say , I think that was a big error .
I think that allow somebody , a simple person to believe that we &apos;re like a recipient , and essence , essence and the smile , and unknown , unknown and unknown , unknown and unknown , unknown and unknown and etheless and a very big responsibility for human pagile .
It &apos;s how to ask somebody to enjoying the sun .
It depends and details the whole ego and creates all of these expectations on performance .
And I think it was a pressure to have destroyed artists in passed .
And if that &apos;s true , and I think that is , the question is , and now ?
Can we do that diversously ?
Maybe go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between human and mystery creative .
Or not .
Maybe we can &apos;t take 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there is probably people in the audience who would be released scientific suspects on the notion of the notion of , so that they follow people are going to move on their projects .
I &apos;m not going to convince you all of this .
But the question I want to ask is is -- why not ?
Why don &apos;t you think about this way ?
Because it &apos;s more sense of anything that I &apos;ve ever heard to explain the exasperating the impredictability of the creative process .
And a process that , as anyone ever tried to do something -- so , basically , all over here -- knows , you don &apos;t comfortable .
And in fact , in fact , it can look completely paranormal .
I &apos;ve done this meeting recently with the extraordinary poem , Ruth Stone , who was a poem for the entire life and said to me that during the Virginia , working in the rural rural Virginia , working in the fields , and he felt it was in the exage , when a poetry to come from the landscape .
He said that it was like a train of air .
And that was going to roling her from the landscape .
He felt that , because he could make the earth under his feet .
He knew that I had one thing to do to that point and was , &quot; His , &quot; run like a match . &quot;
And so he was going to run home and he was going to be going to have a piece of paper and a faster , and a match enough , and a faster faster , and he got it up , and he got it up and grab it on the page .
Sometimes , he couldn &apos;t be fast enough fast , so correct and correcrecrecent and he got to go to home and the poem the rolling and he was going to continued to ring it through the landscape , looking for , and he continued to ring through the landscape , looking , and how she said , &quot; another poet . &quot;
And then there were those times -- this piece of never forget -- there were some moments when it was almost losing , right ?
So , he was running at home and he was looking for paper and the poetry and put it through , and he was going to her , and then he said , he was going to go , and then he said , &quot; he was like to put it up with the other hand and the office it .
And he was offered the poetry from and put it into his body and moved it to his body and moved it to the page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be presented on the perfect page , but at the contrary , from the last word to the first .
So when I was thinking -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly the same same as a creative process .
Not all of my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conduction !
I &apos;m a mulo , and my way to work is ; I wake up at the same orary every day and sweat and work and go over and work and go over the himself .
But even I &apos;m , in my testgin , I &apos;ve got lended against that thing , sometimes .
And I guess that many of you have the han done .
You know , even if the work and ideas came up to me from a certain source , I could not be honestly aware .
And what is this ?
And how can we relate to it in a way to not make us to lose your head , but rather , what do we do is we do ?
As I think about , the best example of the best example I have is the Tom Waits , which I interviewed several years ago .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life was the incarnation of the artist of the art contemporary , trying to control , management these species of impulses creationally completely interviewed .
But then he invecked , he hoted , and one day he was driving on a highway in Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
He was going fast and all of a sent , this little piece of melody , who comes in in his head of how inspiration , elusiva and the training , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the desider , but it &apos;s not knows how to take it .
He doesn &apos;t have a match of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pencil recorder .
So he starts to hear this kind of old anxiety , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to go up and re-marking song .
I &apos;m not enough , I &apos;m not going to do it . &quot;
And instead of going to the panic , he stopped .
And he put the whole process of the mental process and made something completely new .
He looked at the sky and said , &quot; I &apos;m not going to see what I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Would you like to write a song now ?
If you really want to exist , you get a more hurt , when I can take care of you .
Altherwise , go to importing somebody else today .
You go to Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his work process changed after this .
Not the job , the work was still dark , as always .
But the process , and the fish that was released to the genius was released when the genius , the genius that out of him , he was going to get out of it , and I went back from the reminded back to where it was , making that not to be a interiorized and tored .
But it &apos;s not Tom .
So , how much I was going to change a little bit of how I was working on and already saved me a time .
This idea , I &apos;m going to save me when I was writing , &quot; Prega , &quot; and fall in a disdispersation of the cave of the dispersation where we &apos;re all working on , and you don &apos;t have to get a disaster , which is going to be a disaster , which is the worst book .
Not only bad book , just the worst book .
And I started thinking about to throw this project .
But then I reminded of Tom that was talking about the air and I tried .
So I got up my face on on the manoscritical and I &apos;d removed my comments to a vacuum angle .
And I said to high voices , &quot; Seep , what we know , if this book is not going to be brilliant not going to be entirely to my own , right ?
Because as you see I &apos;m putting all I have , I don &apos;t have more than that I have , I don &apos;t have this .
So if you want it to be better , you have to introduce you and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know , I don &apos;t do anything .
I &apos;m going to talk to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to please that was recorded I presented to do my part . &quot; Because the end is so , OK -- centuries do in the North Africa &apos;s deserts , people were joying up to the dances of the dances of the soul-up , dance and music that went on to the alba and hours to the dances .
And they were always magnifigures , because the dantics were and they were wonderful .
But every time , something happened , and one of these artists became actually translent .
And I know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know you all , at a certain point , a performance like this .
It was like the time to stop , and the dance would walk through a kind of a portal , and it was not different from the usual , like 1,000 noticed before , but it was all of the time , but it was all of the time .
And suddenly , not only appearance as a human .
But he accurately from the divinity and under the fire of divinity .
And when this happened , in the time , people knew what was , they called him .
They were to have their hands and started to sing , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , God , &quot; . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
I &apos;m going to be storytells -- when the More I invaded the south of the Saign of Saign , I got this habits to the centuries , Allah , Allah , &quot; Ole , &quot; you can still feel in the corride or flamenc .
In Saign , when a magic , &quot; Allah , &quot; Allah , and they &apos;re a magic , &quot; Allah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alah , &quot; God .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes after , for the dancer , when you wake up and you see it and find that are the 11 in the morning of Martedesday and the God &apos;s not there .
It &apos;s just a very bad dead to the knees , and maybe it can &apos;t never be able to each other to that height .
And maybe nobody is going to sing the name of God still as a gira , and what so has to do with her life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most painful reciliations to make a creative life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so angosciant if you can &apos;t believe , you know , that the most extraordinary aspects of your being from you .
But just believe that you have been given you to a remarkable source of this team of your life that squisite of your life that you have to go to somebody else , when you finished .
And , you know , if we think about that all of it changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s certainly like I thought about it for several months in the working book that I &apos;m going to release , the dangerous book , I &apos;m going to be able to take a lot of it , and I &apos;m going to do that .
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel electrized by this is not going to have fear .
Not shortttttall . It &apos;s just your job .
Continua present-arrow you to introduce your part , any one can be .
If your job is dance , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , if your work is dance , you know , you know , if your job is dance , you know , you know , you know , if your job is dance , you know , if your work is dance , you know , you know , you know , if your work is dance , you know , if
If the divine , absurd , I &apos;m going to assigned up some kind of wonderful , for a only time through your effort , then &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Otherwise , you make the same dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot; to you .
I think and I think we have to teach it .
&quot; Ole ! &quot; to yourself , even for having the human love and testing tables tal to make you continuously introduced .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects on the human genome , about what can mean and the discovery of new set .
Now we &apos;re starting a new path : we started digital biology and now starting from that digital code , we &apos;re coming in in a new process of biology , designing and synthesizing .
We &apos;ve always tried to ask big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; is something that many biologists , I think they &apos;ve tried to figure out various levels .
We tried different approaches , reducing it to the minimum .
We &apos;re digitize for about 20 years ever .
When we sequenced the human genome was treatment to go from the analogical world &apos;s the digital world .
Now , we ask : Can we regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome between those who can authoreplicate in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little smaller even smaller .
We can get a hundred genes of the genes of the about 500 of the things here .
But when we look at his map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our way .
You think , that &apos;s simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this can bring to a cell cell .
So we decided that the only way to design was synthesize this chromosome in a way that we could change the components to bring the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of &quot; Can we synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Can you make the chemishave to make these big molecules we never could create before ?
And in case , we can make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemical material .
The speed with which we can digitize life is growing up exponential rhyththththriving .
Our ability to write gene code , instead , design disrupting , but it &apos;s getting better .
And our most recent results the results carry on a exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process has required a lot of passages , starting with a bioethical review before the first experiments .
But we &apos;ve found that synthesize DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that make small segments of DNA , the long length of 30 to 50 letters , and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the more the segment is , the longer errors .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments .
And this was our first attempt , starting from digital information from the genome of the Phi 174 .
It &apos;s a small virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , we &apos;ve got the fragments of the errors and get a molecule of DNA molecule .
And the interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material that we put it into the bacteria , the bacteria have started reading this genetic code and to make the viral particles .
The viral particles have been released by cells , come back and they have destroyed .
I &apos;ve been talking about recently with the oil industry and say that they certainly understand this model .
They have been reso far more of you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build his own hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things larger in big .
We wanted to build the whole chromosome of the bacteria .
I &apos;m more than 580 mile mile letters .
So we thought we build it in cassette of the virus dimension , so that we can change the cassette to understand what the components are of a living cell .
Somation is critical , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , in 1995 , the standard accuracy was a mistake for every 10 mies .
We &apos;ve discovered , we &apos;ve been resequencenced , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence never be able to do it work .
A process of the process is designed for a long way to design segments for long , that you get to all the other segments of the segments of the small segments .
We take a lot of unic elements here .
You &apos;ve probably read that we put in the fix-grade .
Think of it , we have a genetic code based on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters , put together about about 20 amminoacids , and there &apos;s a specific order to letters for every amminoacids .
So we can use the gene code to write , frash , thoughts .
What we did at the beginning was self-rough .
Some have been delused by the fact that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
We designed these segments to be able to just join with enzyme .
There are there that they repair them and put them together .
And we started to assembling of the parts , starting with the segments from five to seven mila letters , and they &apos;re going to form segments of 24 mila letters to them .
We &apos;ve got all step up with these segments in abundance so that we could sequencing them because we &apos;re trying to create a very roomhs -- like you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatically automatically ,
So , this looks like the tellon a basket globe .
When we get these segments very long , more than 100 thousand basis , no longer will be directly directly in E.
You get to the modern molecular biology .
So we &apos;ve been considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called mumological rewards , which in biology has to repair the DNA to get the DNA to join the DNA to join the DNA to join .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinocococcurred , can absorb three million radiation of radiation .
You can see in high hours like his chromosome is destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s reassembled exactly as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely dry .
They can live under vacuum .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life exist in space , and you have to find new environments .
Actually , NASA showed that this is happening .
This is a molecule picture that we built using these processes , just using the lievelated with the design appropriate segments to put .
The hott of it up .
This image was not taken with an electronic microscope , but with a regular microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It &apos;s a very big molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that they cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the publishing that we did a little time ago .
I &apos;m more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the greatest molecule of a defined structure ever created by the man .
It has a 300 million molecular weight .
If we &apos;re going to be a 10 without spaces , we &apos;d like 142 pages only to move this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ? How can we make it work ?
Of course , you know , you know , a game is a game .
It &apos;s a little more complicated when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s simpler even when it comes euucarily cells as our : you just pull the nuclear and put another , which is basically the process of cloning .
In the archaea bacterium , but instead , we &apos;ve been able to do a cell , but we recently demonstrated that we &apos;re able to make a complete transplant of a crumbled cell to another and vacing it .
We clean a chromosome , from a microbial crumbled species .
The two are different than men from mice .
We &apos;ve added some genes in more way we could decide which to be to choose to this chromosome .
And then it skied with the enzymes so that they &apos;re killing all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was amazing -- and you appreciate our sophisticated graph -- the new chromosome is gone into the cell .
And we were beginning to think we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to get us over there .
This is one of the majority of evolution .
We found that that they have added up a second or a third chromosome somewhere , add a few part , and I add into a second thousands of new traits to that species .
So , who think about evolution as a single gene at the time you can change not get much of the biology .
There are some enzymes called the restrial enzyme , which even digital the DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell , no one .
The phone : The chromosome we put it on --
And it &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other chromosome as exhurt material , and we found with only the cell and the new chromosome .
It became blue because of the genes we &apos;ve been put in .
And in a short short path of time , all of the characteristics of a species , and it turned into a new species , based on the new software that we put into a new species , based on the new software that we put into the cell .
All the proteins have changed , members have changed , and when we read the gene code , and when we read the gene code .
Now , this might seem to be genetic alchemy , but by allowing the DNA can change things that in a pretty substantial way .
Now , I &apos;ve been explained that here is not about genesis -- but of progress from three million years and a half years of evolution , and I &apos;ve told that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the Cambriana where we &apos;re going to create new species based on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s enough to be when we think about our needs .
We &apos;re going to go from six and a half billion people to nine in the next 40 years .
I was born for example : I born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one existing in 1946 ; in 40 years , there are four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find food , fresh , fresh and fresh , medicine and wells for six and a half billion people .
It will be even more hard to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion fuel bars , more than 30 billion barrels of oil barrels .
That means a hundred million barrels a day .
When we try to get biological processes , or any kind of process to replace them , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to understand the whole CO2 emission from these materials that finished in the atmosphere .
I think about today , because of the scientific discoveries around the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the design future .
The electronic industry , only has a dozen about components , and think about how many different things came out .
Our limits here is data , principle from reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , because of these methods of synthesization , able to create what we call combinatory .
We can build a big robot that can produce a big chromosomes a day .
Think of the 20 million different genes or to try to optimize processes to produce optimize processes , vaccines , we can change , because of a small team , and create more molecular biology right now than in the last 20 years .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemical production or fuel production , or fuel vaccines .
This is an instantanecheck of some software programmed we &apos;re working on to sit and design a species at the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know , necessarily , we don &apos;t know how they &apos;re going to be .
We know exactly how their gene code is their genetic code .
Now we &apos;re focusing on the fourth generation fuel .
You also saw you that extract ethanol from the grain was a final experiment .
We have depending on the third generation , that will be being soon soon soon to the zucchererereral sugar , or different butanle .
But the only way biology can have a big impact without increasing the cost of increasing food and limlimestone the cost of the available food and limestone that we &apos;re working to design cells that can achieve this purpose , and we can have the first fuel fuel than 18 months .
Solar combined light with CO2 is a metodo--- but in our discoveries around the world , we found different metods .
This is a organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , at about 2,500 feet deep to the webollist temperature .
It creates from CO2 using molecular hydrogen using molecular hydrogen .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can incanaling CO2 , which can easily be brought through your boods , convert that CO2 into fuel , to lead this process .
So we think we might think that we could be able to increase what the basic question of &quot; what life is life is &quot; is we , versus the whole oil industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do this for TED , where can you ?
It would come a major source of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working on to use the same methods to create instantly vaccines .
You saw this year with flu , we &apos;re always forth of a year and with a dollar in less when it comes to the vaccine .
I think that you can change change building combinable vaccines in anticius .
And that &apos;s how the future might start to start changing , now , the tree of evolution , accelling evolution with synthetic bacteria , arched , and finally , atheists , and finally , atheists , and finally , eucariote cells .
We &apos;re so much to improve people .
Our purpose is to make it a long enough to try to make it . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the faster possible , some fundamental work , of the new technology that we took the Microsoft in the purchase to a nearly a year ago . This is Seadragon . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s a environment where you can interact with a huge amount of visual level of data .
We &apos;re seeing here , many gigabyte digital photographs with a kind of zoom , and continuous , for a fast panoramic , despite the images like we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much much the amount of information that we see , how big these things are collected of data , or images .
Most of the digital photographs , but this for example is a scanning trial from the Congress Library of Congress , and it comes into the 300 megaps .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that we have to the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen at any time . It &apos;s a very flexible architecture .
This is a book , all of a book , not data .
This is the Dickens of Dickens . Every column is a chapter .
So to try to show you that it &apos;s just a text and not of images , we can make something like this , to make really really look at a representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a little electronic book .
I don &apos;t recommend it .
This is a realistic example . It &apos;s a number of The Guardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a section .
And really gives you the pleasure and the good experience of reading the real version of a magazine or a magazine , or a daily spacecraft .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of The Guardian .
We created a high-resolution advertising -- much higher than you use in a normal publishing -- and we put in a normal advertising .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even the techniques specific .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminating the space limits of space on the screen .
I hope that means to put people on the people and other similar porcheries to people and similar porcheries , not to have to be necessary .
Of course , maps is one of the poorest applications for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say we have contributing to give you even in this field .
These are all the roads in the U.S. overwhelmed over an image of NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually alive on the Web ; you can go and see it .
This is a project called Photosynthrooms , who fighting two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting visual research at the very interesting computer that we &apos;ve done by Noah Snavely , a student at Steve Seitz of Microsoft Rick Szeliski Rick Szeliski . It &apos;s a very good collaboration .
And it &apos;s from the live of the Web , management by Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from one image to the other and have this kind of experience to have this kind of experience to be multiple resolution .
But the space space space space space that has actually a meaningful meaningful .
The algorithms of the computer algorithms have recorded these images together , so that it corresponds to the real places that you imagine -- all over the near the Grasks on the Montagne Roccies have been taken . So here you see the elements of a slightly shown . So here you see the elements of a slightly show or imaging imaging , and these things have all of the space space level .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more space than a lot of space .
I want to go directly to one of the Noahh data -- and this comes from a previous prototype of Photosynthrowns that we &apos;ve done for the first time , we &apos;ve been the first time the summer -- to show you what I think is really the key behind this technology , Photososynthin . And it &apos;s not necessarily evidence looking at the environments that we &apos;ve got on the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and foreign aspects .
This is a reconstruction of Nothree-of-Nothree-Dame images taken by Flickr . Bauction three Dame in Flickr and you get images of some of the campus and on the campus and so on . Once , and so on . Once one of these boundaring this model .
So they &apos;re all taken from Flickr and they were all connected to space in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate in this very simple way .
You know , I never would have thought of finishing work for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratificent to get this kind of accounting here .
I think you can see that this is a lot of different types of photocamers : from those cell phone professional SLR , a significant number , put together in this environment .
And if I can try and try and try and look at those more strange .
Many stuck by faces , etc .
Somewhere there is a series of photographs -- here .
This is a Nothree Nthree-Dame poster .
We can go from the poster to the physical of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is taking data from the whole melt memory -- from the whole collective memory of how to appear the land , from visual point of view -- and connecting all that data together .
All of those pictures become connected together , greater than the suck .
You have a model of the land emerge .
You think about this as a prolungent of Stephen Lawler &apos;s of the world &apos;s work .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as people are using it , and the whose advantages to use it .
Their photographs are married with meadow by other people .
If you get somebody is the idea of contrast all these sants and say , my picture of the Nothing three Durge , my picture of Nothing three Demame to suddenly enries of all that data , and I can use it as a check to immersive sant into that space , in that metaphs , using the photos of all of that data , and to the social experience .
Of course , a consequence of all of this is extremely processed virtual models of every interesting part of the land , which is collected you don &apos;t just seen airplanes and similar , but from the collective memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I &apos;m doing that ? What your software is going to be doing is that at a certain point in the next few years , all the photographs are all shared with anyone in the entire world will be basically connected ?
BAA : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is basically is to find .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the images .
And what &apos;s really interesting if you think about the seant information in a lot of these images have .
As you do a picture of the images on the Web , you know , a phrase and the tising on the web page , it &apos;s a lot of information about the pictures .
Now , what happens if that picture is connecting to all your pictures ?
So the amount of semaned interconnection and the amount of wealth that comes out of it is really enormous . It &apos;s a classic effect .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible . Compoundbreaking .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure of the ethos when you travel and one of the ethnic research is that we can have not forgot to the antic traditions , between the host the past , the wind , the husband the stones that are in the waves .
Basti to think that the Samorders Jaguar , or that the Lattea , or that the old old Inuit is still colored in the Himalaya , the budgets , and the budgets , and the budgets , and the budget , and the idea that the central importance of anthropology , and the idea that the world we don &apos;t exist in which we are not solved in a sense , but it &apos;s just a reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that we have to adapted that our stirpped , well , or bad , many generations ago .
And of course , we all share of essential traits .
We all come . We all all procrease .
We &apos;re subjects to reach of initiation .
We have to deal with the inexorability of death , so we don &apos;t surprising if we &apos;re dying and we &apos;re alalallowed to dying with the inexorability of death , so we don &apos;t surprise to the inexorability of death , so we don &apos;t surprise to the death of the inexorability of death , so we don &apos;t surprising to go to the inexorability of death , so we don &apos;t surprising to go to the inexorability of the inexorability of death , so we don &apos;t surpris
We all have an art .
What it hits is the particular rhythththththm of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that are the Penan of the Borneo &apos;s &apos;s the Borneo &apos;s checks , or the following the Voodoo &apos;s warriors in Kenya , Curander in Kenya , Curander in , or a camp in the Sahara .
And he was my journey of journey in the desert a month , or a yak alaker in in Qomolangma valli , on Everest , on the Kest , on , the mother &apos;s dea mother of the world .
All of these people are teach us that there are other ways of exist to think , other ways of moving around the world .
And if you think , if you think , it &apos;s a concept that it can give you hope .
And together , the miriaths of the world create a spiritual , the world create a spiritual life and cultural wells that planet and cultural revenue , which is important to the planet , as biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural roughly roughly a ethnosphere and you can define the etnosphere , the total sum of all concepts , dreams , mate , ideas , inspirations , intuitions , brought up to be from the human imagination from the alba .
etnosphere is the great pathizes of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we can be , and what we can be as a kind of pollution .
And because biosphere was very much as a very quickly happened to the ethnic sphere and unfortunately much faster .
Nobody biologist , for example , would say that 50 percent of all species is about the extinction just because it &apos;s flip , or -- in the world &apos;s most opocalyptic diversity -- and you don &apos;t even get closer to the mystical hypothesis -- that &apos;s the most optional diversity of cultural diversity .
The surx of all of that is , of course , the language loss .
When you &apos;re born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just a vocabulary or a vocabulary or a series of grammatical rules .
A language is the springing of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle with which the animus of every culture comes in in the material world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a kiss , a thought , a spiritual ecosystem .
And of those 6,000 languages , while we &apos;re down here sitting in Monterey , at least half not being suburged in the ears of the children .
They don &apos;t get taught children , which means , unless than cameras , not a truck , who are already death .
What is more sad than you have to be silence , about the last talking about the last talking to a language , not to transmate the wisdom of the wisdom of the wisdom of the wisdom of the promise ?
This is a few years by a few of the world every two weeks . every two weeks : every two weeks , every two weeks , every two weeks .
And I know somebody who is going to say , &quot; Is it better like that ?
The world wouldn &apos;t be a better place if we were all talking about the same language ? &quot; Welderly , then we all talk about yoruba .
We talk about kogs .
You &apos;re going to have a sudden what you mean , I can &apos;t talk about their language .
I &apos;d like to do a journey through the etnosphere --
a little journey in the eththc , to give you a assage of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , &quot; different ways of existing ways of exist . &quot; I mean , very different ways of existing .
Let &apos;s take this for example , Barasana &apos;s a Soll , in the SSoll , the people of the anaconda &apos;s the River &apos;s River &apos;s River &apos;s the flatch of the west in the panish panish &apos;s .
It &apos;s a people who don &apos;t have the blue color from green because the color blue blue , because the celests , and identified in the forest of the forest , where the people .
They have a strange language and a rule , called &quot; exogamic language : You have to married a person who is talking a different language .
All of this roots in the mitological past , though the particularity is that in these families , they &apos;re talking about six or seven languages because of matriririlled , no one language .
They &apos;re just listening and then they start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribe with which I &apos;ve lived , the Waorans of the Ecuador , a incredible people that had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionary have tried a contact to a fatal error .
They &apos;ve been going down down the photographs that they retraced them in the retracting of this , forest that people were going to forest that people of the forest plug had never seen anything about bi-dimensional .
They &apos;ve been raised by the earth , they turned around to the research of a form or a figure , and not out , they have concluse that it was going to be the diavily , and they killed the five missionary missionary .
But Waorani didn &apos;t kill just kill the foreign .
They killed between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We were saving about eight generations and we found two natural death , and when we &apos;ve been born to know , they admitted that one of them was invecked , and then killed it the same .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine for 40 steps and recognize species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned me a very interesting task when my professor of my Harvard asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to Haiti my deflip with the power of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes , and the Tonton Macoutes , and impossessor to make the zombie .
To make sense of the miraculous , I would have to understand Voodoo culture and that Voodoo is not magic .
It &apos;s pretty much a complex metaphorrified vision of the world .
So , interesting .
If I ask you to tell me about the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christianity , Islam , Buddhism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always leaving out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no religious faith . And instead of the Voodoo is not another distilled with these religious concepts .
What &apos;s interesting to make interesting about the voodoo is the intense between life and death .
So the vives are going to hide the spirites .
Are spirits can be invocated by the Great Acqua , they respond to the dance of the dance and replace temporarily replaced the viable way that for a short short active active active active active to the god .
So , the white voodooists love to say , &quot; You go to talk about God .
We give the theme and become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re posing , is the spirit that you are , how can you get you wrong ?
So you &apos;re seeing these incredible events : following the voodoo state of trance that touches on the body , when it &apos;s catching a pretty strong demonstration of the body when it &apos;s catalyzed , excitement in a state of extreme excitation .
And all the people with whom I have been living in the most extraordinary is Kogi Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta Colombia , in the Santa Marta Colombia .
And they give the ancient civilization that once were living on the carries of the carac plan of the Colombia on the career , the people would retreat on the volcanic massassassassassassassassassassassassassassassassassassassassassassassment .
In a macartment of blood , this people have never been conquered by the spagnoled .
But I &apos;m government government from a cler-governments , but they &apos;re very extraordinary .
The young people are taken away from the families to three or four years , and they live secregated in a world that was done in a good world of stone , and they &apos;re stones in the basis of stones for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years I picked up to reproduce the nine months of gestation that they go into the user of the mom of the mom , now , are metaphed in the Great Mather .
For that time , they &apos;re accultured to their society , values that predicts that their prayers and only their prayers and just their prayers to keep the cosmic balance -- or to say the cosmic balance -- or to say the clock .
And so the term of this incredible initiation , are suddenly brought out and for the first time to life , at the age of 18 , see an age . And in that moment of consciousness of first bank , when the sun kisses the beautiful valli , when the sun the sun . The first stick is reached in the theory . The reach of reaching a step back and says : :
&quot; Viser ? I &apos;m like I said .
It &apos;s wonderful . Now it &apos;s now to you . &quot;
They call them a big brothers and say that we , brothers , are the colputing of the world &apos;s destruction .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the indigenous world and invoidal environment , and the old sau and the old story of the selling selling selling sophistoric concept , or maybe invoke Thoreau and we say that these people are closer to the Earth of us .
Indigenes are not not feelings , no sentimental sentimental nostaly .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the malarial paluds of the Asmat or in the vents of the Tibet , but because of time and the rhythi , they &apos;ve created a mystical of the Earth is not about the concept of being constant , but a very subtle of the world : the concept that Earth can live only because it &apos;s infected by human consciousness .
What does it mean ?
That a little bit of Ande that a boy of the Ande that mountain is a massing spirit that will lead his destiny to be a different human being deeply different with the mountain or that place a different relationship with the mountain or that place that the mountain is a masse of rock is that a mountain is a masse of rock .
which is the dimora of a spirit or a mineral cat is irrelevant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that define the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia British , believing that the forests they were to be cut .
And that I made me a different human being from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the dimora of Hukukukukukukukukukukukukukukug , who live in the Hukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukutl , and the downside of the forests that are facing the world ,
If you start to look at that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of them feeling of them . We take this plant .
I took this picture to open up in the northest Amazon .
Maybe some of you &apos;ve heard about the ayahuasca , the most powerful psychophiction of the shamanic repertory .
What makes the wild ayahuash is not the potential of the drug of substance , but its processing . It &apos;s made by two elements .
On one hand , this legning leaving a series of beta-coal series , harmoline and harmoline , slightly exucinogene .
And by taking the only plant , you have a smoke that alter a little smoke that alter consciousness , but it &apos;s mixed with the leaves of a cafterwards , Psychoices ,
This plant contains potent potent potential , very similar to the serotonin , dimethyptamine , methoxymethoxyptamine .
If you ever see the Yanomami , you &apos;ll get on the nose of the nose of the substance that make from a different set of species , it contains methyyptamine .
You know that dust that dust for the nose is a little bit of a dipinch , and land on a beat of the rare and land on a sea of electricity .
I often have to the professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who had been shown the psycheese was psychedelivered with her discovery of the hallucinogens in Mexico .
Second my thesis not to classified these trippptamines as as hallucinogens because if you &apos;re done you can &apos;t tell anyone to be hallucined .
It &apos;s possible to get the orally if you get abunte with other chemicals that deny MAO .
Now it &apos;s the beautiful : the Tibeta-coat , the AO that is inhibitors of MAO , the same kind of need to be able to get the tripps . The question is , in a four-foot foot , like these people have to find two defed defetings , like this , but if you combined in this way , create a biochemical version that is that high meant to the wall ?
We use the great eupheric of evidence and error , which can be revealing to infruted .
But if we ask Indians , we say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re the &quot; We &apos;re the &quot; We &apos;re the &quot; We &apos;re the &quot; We &apos;re the plants , &quot; We &apos;re the plants , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan has 17 variety of ayahuasca , who distinguished nicely in the forest , and that at our eyes would come into the same species .
If we ask them how they stabipped their toxonomy will say , &quot; I thought , &quot; I think , &quot; don &apos;t you know ? &quot; No , I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take 17 varieties in a night night of moon , and each night with a different tone .
And so , you don &apos;t graduate to Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than count stami .
Now , &#91; applausers &#93; the problem is that even those of us have to heart people who have in the heart of Indigenes them have painting to the margins of the history of our real world , and it &apos;s going to the sea of the history than our real world , and it &apos;s going to the world , and it &apos;s going to go beyond .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it &apos;s not going to remember her or its technology innovations , but rather like the one was where we stopped and enabled actively accepted , or the passively accepted the mass destruction of the mass diversity , cultural diversity of the planet . Now the problem is not change .
All of the cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibilities .
And the problem is not technology .
Indians Sioux have no stop being Sioux when they put out from the arm and frecovered . And so , as Americans have no stop being an American when they put on the horse and calf .
It &apos;s not the change or the technology that threatening the integrity of ethnic . It &apos;s power .
The hard hard to domination .
And if you look at the world , I find that these are not destined to disappear .
They &apos;re living creatures and dynamics spinout of forces from forces to identify the ability of their adaptation .
It &apos;s a disboscameras in the Penan --
a peaking nomad , in Sarawak , in the Asian , a people who lived in the forest to a generation , to a generation ago , and now reduced to a generation of the ridated , where you can see the river river , where you can see the river the river bar river of the website , where the naking of the horizon that the well-like the orizon , and the rumte that are the zonm ,
It &apos;s ready to fill the wooden wooden with the soth wooden .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are diseases that come with the discovery of the gold .
If we &apos;re going to move on on the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the hard dall of the political domination .
As you know the genocide , the extinction of a people who are convicted to universal level , but the ethnic , the destruction of the style of a people , not only is we announced , but even celebrated in certain cers , because it &apos;s a part of the development strategist .
And you can &apos;t understand the Tibet until you go from the beginning .
I &apos;ve path the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in the Western China through the Western Tibet , coming to Lhasa with a young link , but only came to Lhasn out of the statistics that we feel about .
6,000 huments sacries in dust and centers .
1.2 million people killed from the military in the Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was assume to the Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed to the Chinese invasion time .
Suo uncle is fuel on the Santiity during the diaspora that led led to Nepal .
His mother was imprisoned and her cold was rich .
It was brought to hide in charge to the age of two hidden under his gonna tool , because he couldn &apos;t have any any any of his gonna life without him .
The sister , who did the same , was put in the reduction .
And one day he revertitled a refined fascis-huring a Mao and , for this transgression , was put on to the forced forced for seven years .
The Tibet can be insopportable , but the spirit of the people &apos;s insopposable .
And finally , it all comes to a choice .
We want to live in the world monocromatic monoccurrent or do we want to accept the policy of diversity ?
The great anthropologist at Margaret Mead , before he died said that his greatest fear was that in our greatest vision of the world , not only see the whole gams of the human imagination , but a little bit of thinking , but one day we &apos;re going to see a probe of thinking of thinking , but one day we &apos;re seeing a foraging licing to the sleep to the forget that there was other .
And it &apos;s humiliating that our species existed for 600,000 years .
The Neolitica Revolution , who gave us agriculture , who gave us the agriculture of the seed , to replace the poetry of the seed , by the sites of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has to be 300 years .
That shared history not suggests me , I don &apos;t suggests that we have to all of the challenges that we have to deal in the millennightful .
When you have these miriaths of the world is asked what to say to be human , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all return the possibilities of being what we are : a kind of a conscious species , which all of the people and all the gardens can fell . And there are big moments of optimism .
I took this picture of the north of the Baffin the end of Baffin , when I went to the hung with the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The Canads is not always a gentile with the Inuit and the 1950s to stabilize our suprematized , we &apos;ve been rehhhhaked in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refuted to go .
His , teming for her life , he took him all of the weapons , and all his towns .
You have to know that the Inuit don &apos;t feel the cold , they exploit .
The pieces of the slites were made of fish were made of the fish flying on caribo .
The grandfather of this man didn &apos;t put up from the arctic night or the bylizes that suffering .
It &apos;s been dismissed , and it &apos;s been hot the panthotlayed in and defected in their hand . When I did it frozen , and working a sama .
He spraying salid on the punta of this cacking chnighttime , and when I solid solid , he killed a dog .
He shaking the dog and created a brilliant , with the toracy , he enjoed another dog , and he &apos;s disappeared another dog , and it &apos;s disappeared on the banking , the clothes .
We want to talk about horse with nothing ? &#91; Risate &#93; And this , in different ways , in different ways , &#91; Applusi &#93; &#93; is the symbol of the Inuit &apos;s the symbol of the world .
In the open-up , 1999 the CCanadian government reated decrease of a larger area of California and Texas med and Texas together .
It &apos;s their new pathize . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s an independent land . They &apos;re all the mineral resources .
I &apos;m going to say about a nation-state can re-up with his people .
And , to finish , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious to the people of us have been in these remote zones of the planet , make that they &apos;re not remote .
For somebody is home .
They represent sections of the human imagination that go back to the dawn of the time . And for us all of these children , as the dreams of these children , become part of the geography of hope .
To end , we of National Geographic , we are convinced that politicians will never come to anything .
We believe that polemsory --
And so , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month , 35 million visits website .
156 countries transmitted our television .
Our magazines are lected by millions of people .
Our work is traveling in the ethnosphere to bring our audience in places of cultural wonderful , where they &apos;re going to go away from how they saw and , hopefully , abbracing for time to the central revealing for the central revealing for the central revealing in a world of life in a diversity , and we have a life in a world pluralist and multicultural world and multicultural a world of a life in a world , and we have to find a life in a life in a life in a life in a life in a life in a life in
where the wisdom of all people can help our collective wisdom .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some of the things that I wrote in this book that I hope to call other people who you &apos;ve heard and try to evidence some links , in case you don &apos;t notice .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the official officer . &quot;
The dogma official ?
The dogma official society of all the Western industrial society . The dogma official officer : &quot; If we want to male the welfare of our citizens . &quot;
The reason is , on one hand , in fact that freedom is itself a value , is precious , useful , essential for human beings .
On the other one of us can do that if we are free , each of us can do whatever massized our well-being , without any any one that decide in the name of our well-being , without any deciding in the name .
The way to male freedom is massizing choice .
More choices , more choices , more are free , and the greater choice , the greater freedom , the greater well-being .
This is , I think , is so deeply radiced in the society that nobody would dream to put it in doubt .
And it &apos;s also deeply radiced in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m going to make a simple note about the stairs conditions .
In my supermarket is 175 conditions , without counting the 10 variety of oil oil oil oil oil oil oil oil oil s and 12 acets that you can buy to make a huge number of conditions in the circumstances in the circumstances that none of the 175 .
Here &apos;s what the supermarket is .
And then you go to the electronic store to buy a path : cash , CD letter , radio , flew , light bull .
And in this single electronic store , there &apos;s a great number of audio components .
We can make six million different combinations using the components that there are in a only store .
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice .
Other fields : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all telephone services , to the pat that were provided from Bell .
He was nolegg the phone , you didn &apos;t buy it .
And one consequence of that , between the other , was that the phone never break .
These days are gone .
We have a nearly limited variety of phones , especially between the cell phone .
Here &apos;s the cell phones .
My favorite is the in the middle , MP3 , cut the nose of the nose , and fornels to the brulanch for chroll crème .
If you don &apos;t have this yet seen in the store under home , you &apos;re very certain that I &apos;ll get to get .
And what happens is that people come into the store and they &apos;re doing this question . And what is you know , &quot; No . &quot;
You can &apos;t buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t make too much much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the acquiring , it turns out the same explosion of choices .
Assistence : don &apos;t happen in the United States that you go out from the doctor and the doctor you say what you have to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; Okay , we could do A or B , &quot; Okay , we could do A , or &quot; A has these benefits , and these risks . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Doctor , what should I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; You know , and these risks , and B has these benefits , and B has these benefits . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebat , &quot; Would you be me , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; I &apos;m not her . &quot;
We call it &quot; autonomy of the malate &quot; , &quot; expression that makes it look like a good thing .
But in fact , it &apos;s not that you can move the weight and the responsibility of making decisions from somebody knows something , which is the doctor , to someone else that knows anything , and almost certainly malate -- and so , not in the ides condition to make decisions that the patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing of products of drugs , directly to people like me and you , who think about it doesn &apos;t make any sense , because we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why do we advertising them ?
The answer is that they want to ask for asked to ask them to ask them to make the recipe .
Something that is , we don &apos;t want to be our ordering is a choice of how you see in this vignt . &quot; We don &apos;t want to forzing children . I &apos;m going to forzing their sex . &quot; We don &apos;t get a much identity : we have to invent .
And we can reinvent us how many times you get to get to .
Which means that every morning , at the risake , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I &apos;m going to the family and the matriage , a time the common perspective , which is almost to anyone who was that married to us the most early possible , and you started to make the most soon possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not even what to do after .
I mean , all is really to play .
I teach students very smart students , and I &apos;m going to them 20 percent in less of work than a time .
And not because they &apos;re not because they &apos;re not because they &apos;re not because they &apos;re not because they &apos;re less diligent .
but why are they imthouse , I mean , &quot; I should say , &quot; I &apos;m going to married or not ? &quot;
&quot; Should I get away ? I have to think before children or the career ? &quot;
They &apos;re logoring .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this implement not complete the homework that I teach and not a good voice to my own .
And they have to really do that . They &apos;re important questions .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , like Carl undering , because the technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from the planet , except that from Hotel Randolph .
And in the parentesthesis , and I &apos;m not saying to anyone where the Withs works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use me .
What does this incredible freedom of choice we have about working ? Is that we have to continually decide , continually , in every moment , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing calcium , with the mobile phone in the other , the Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , typically , on the knees .
And even if they &apos;re all spending , every minute we see that we see our son to roving the game , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; I have to answer this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? I have to email ? I have to email this ? &quot;
And even when the answer is is no , it makes the experience of your son very different than what would have been in other conditions .
So , anywhere we look at , small things , and big objects , materials and lifetime , life is a question of choices .
And once the world was this : Whereas there were some possibilities , but it wasn &apos;t all about choice .
The world today is a dilemma is : The dilemma is , &quot; Is it a positive thing positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Soll .
The positive layers know , we all know about the negative .
All of this choice is two negative two negative of people .
The first , paradoxically , is that produced paradoking paradows .
With many options between which choosing , becomes very difficult to do that .
I give you a significant example : a study of volunteer in the volunteer .
And a connection of the Vanguard data , the giant funds , with about a pension of pension , with about a million clients , with about a million clients .
What she found out is that for every 10 solutions that are offering in more , the percentage of adhhesian two percent .
With 50 offerts , there &apos;s 10 percent in less than we have to be able to be able to when they &apos;re available ?
Because with 50 funds of which choosing , is maledededeeply to decide , and the choice is rereturned to the indomans .
And tomorrow , and tomorrow , tomorrow , tomorrow , and of course tomorrow .
You know , it doesn &apos;t mean only that these old guys are eating food for dogs because they don &apos;t have enough money , even want to say that the decision is so unable to lose the complex funds of the dator &apos;s work .
Not participating , they &apos;re losing to five thousand dollars for year from work dator , which would be well disposed to be there .
So the parallel is a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think that makes the world like this .
&quot; And to finish , for the ethernity : ketchup , or maionese ? &quot;
You &apos;d like to make the right decision , if it &apos;s for ethernity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and even even the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can avoid the parallel and make a choice , at the end , we &apos;re less satisfied by the result of how we would have been with less options .
And that for several reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions that choosing , if you buy one and not perfect , it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have a different choice . And what happens is that the alternative . And what &apos;s going on is that the alternative imagined us will decrease satisfaction rewarded up with the decision , and the reavened the sodissatisftion reaved by the decision ,
even when it was a very good decision .
More choices , there are more choices , the more you &apos;re displeased to any detail of the option .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert : very well , very well , how we &apos;re going to the value of things depends on what we &apos;re council with .
On the rest of the option , when there are many opposable , is easy to represent the characteristics of the option of the option that you have to be less sationfying about option .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m sorry with all of the ones that are not in New York .
But that &apos;s what you probably think .
There &apos;s this couple of the Hamptons .
A leverage of luxury .
It &apos;s all for them . Otm . Otm I day day . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not missing . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , it &apos;s Agust . &quot;
&quot; All my neighbors in Manhattan is away . &quot;
&quot; I could talk about it right in front of the house . &quot;
And it &apos;s going to spend two weeks from the idea that it &apos;s losing -- every day -- the ability to park where it wants .
costo-opportunities decrease so-down opportunity for what we have , even when the choice was excellent .
And the more are the options that we have to consider , the more the actual characteristics will be return to the costo-opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a number of things .
We talk about the living moment , and maybe of the living living slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you choose , you choose to not do other .
The things we don &apos;t choose many attractive attractive that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : the growing spiral of the expectations .
I tried it on my skin butch a new jeans .
I &apos;m going to be jeans .
And the jeans were of one , and bought them and dressed them and dressed a lot of times , just after they took them a life and washed a lot of times , they started going to go well .
So , I went to bought a new pair when the old ones were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
The bet said , &quot; You know , &quot; You want to slim , &quot; relaxed fit ? &quot;
Would you want to have a cerninian or with the button ? &quot; Stonewashed &quot; or &quot; ? &quot;
&quot; Would you want to be struggle ? &quot;
&quot; Sotto li wants or stricking or stricking ? Bla , &quot; Continuated to elencare .
I was skiing , and after a while I could say , &quot; I want the guy that was the only guy , &quot; that was the only guy . &quot; He had no idea what it was , so for a hour of jeans , and then out of the jeans , and then out of the jeans I had ever ever ever ever .
It was the maximum . I had the best .
But I was worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse is that with all of that choice , my expectations were , jeans should have been perfect .
I had a minimum expectations . I didn &apos;t expect anything that was just a kind of , but when you saw 100 different , you know , but when you saw 100 different , steel steps , at least a kind of a perfect .
What I did I get was good , but not perfect .
After I had to get that I was going to do with what I was trying to do was I satisfied to the expectations .
The addition of options in the life of people don &apos;t make the expectations that have respect about options .
And that will make less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the marketing is to do it .
Because if they knew , you don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more to this .
&quot; He was better when you was worse was even better when you was worse was even even when you was worse was still possible to meet with pleasant survey ,
I mean , in the world where we live opulent -- opulent industrialized citizens with the expectation of perfeition -- the maximum that we can hope is that things are at the althetic alalth .
You never surprised to pleasant because your expectations , my expectations , have been ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Bestry &quot; Yes , &quot; Yeah , you want it . &quot;
I mean -- I &apos;m just going to say , little autobiographical moment -- which is really beautiful .
I couldn &apos;t have done better , I didn &apos;t have me .
But it &apos;s not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of the buting a pair of jeans when there is only that kind of jeans is that when you &apos;re not satisfied , and you ask , &quot; Why ? &quot;
Who is responsible ? &quot; &quot; The answer is clear .
The world is the responsible . What would I do ?
When you have hundreds of jeans , and you buy a satisfaction , and you ask who is , you ask who the responsible , it &apos;s just just just clear that responsible , it is so far the responsible is you .
You could have done better .
With hundreds of varieties , not there are no excuse for the insuccess .
So when people make decisions , even if the outcome is valid , they feel insatisfaction and give the cold to them .
In the last years , depression is explained in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only , but important -- of this honest depression is just that people have deludent experiences because standard are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation , they think that the breakthrough is .
So the result is that we &apos;re better , we &apos;re better , but we &apos;re going to have a worst .
Let me remember .
This is the official dogma , what we all take good and is completely fake .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little choice of it &apos;s better than having any of it , but from that doesn &apos;t have a lot better choice than a little bit .
There &apos;s a critical value , I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve been overated by a piece of the level where the choices are improved .
Now , from a political point -- I have almost finished -- I &apos;ve got a bit of political view , the peanch is the following .
What allows all this to do in the industrial society is wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know , where the problem is not that have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too bad .
So the faces that I &apos;m talking about is a mal-wiser of modern , rich Western society .
And what it does depressing and ended is this : Steve Levitt talked to you about how much the expensive those expensive and the car seat car seat are useful . It &apos;s a money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and dispenpendion , is not that they &apos;re just useful .
I &apos;m even deleterie .
They &apos;re doing worse .
If a little bit of what we in our society allows that much choice , it would not only be reversed to the way that people have too too much possibilities , not only their life to improve but also our .
This is what economists call a lot of improvement .
A redistribution of income redistributed to all -- not only to poor -- because of this choice in excess .
So to end , &quot; You know , you can become everything you want . &quot;
You , people of culture , you &apos;ll think , &quot; What does that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t get anything in a shocking of a glass . &quot;
&quot; A range imagination , a limited vision of the world -- &quot;
and I &apos;m interested in this , I &apos;ve been interpret .
But then , I realized that that fish the long knows that that fish the long knows the long time .
Because the reality is that if you &apos;re missing the bocks , so that &quot; everything is possible . &quot; You don &apos;t get freedom . You don &apos;t get the freedom . You get the parallel .
If you break the mocting in a way that everything is possible possible to decrease sodisfation .
You get the paralysis , and you reduce the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too strange , maybe even for fish , maybe even for us .
But the absence of a few symbolic sphere is a recipe for inhappiness and I &apos;m theme for rovine .
Thank you very much .
