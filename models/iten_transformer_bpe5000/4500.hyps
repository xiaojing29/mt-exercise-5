I showed these two two to show these two two two two two million years .
I &apos;m going to be able to the gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t see it is the ice of ice .
The sweet of the crisis , in a sense , the heart of the heart system of climate change .
It &apos;s going to be inversus and you &apos;re going to be a glass .
The next next to be a reduce a carriririst to the last 25 years .
The lack of the acts are in the red .
You see , you see , you see , you see it .
That &apos;s the ice in inversus , which you &apos;re going to be in the glass .
You can see that the end said , I &apos;m going to see that the health , is like the health , which is like the health , which is like the body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s past ,
This is a problem because the rereform of the terrap of the samong around the ocean , and they &apos;re huge amount of founding , the sssounds , the sevent , they &apos;re going to be in the microbes .
I &apos;m going to be at the whole of inquinstrument , which is a global amount of remarkable , which is a lot of the end of them .
In some lagement in Alaska little bit of the meters .
The professed Katey Walter , and I &apos;m going to Alaska is a team of a bunch of the bottom .
Video : Wow ! Gore : You &apos;re going to be right .
And the reason is that this scary , the First Groroots of the north of the north .
This is a foundation of the tunes .
And it was never reached to the brains .
This is the Kangerlusual ppair , in the succles of the Groots .
If you want to know how you want to know how you to go to the street of the launtables , and here is where the sea .
These are going to be going to be going to be going to be .
And another one of the planet : Antle , the most largest bumb of the planet .
The last month , the last few scientists have been in the columstation of ice is in the stratest artists , who are the West artists , who are the window , is particularly ularly ularly remarkable .
It &apos;s a six feet of the acy .
Sulle Himalayas , the third third , the third largest baghi , you see new lagues , which few years ago .
40 percent of the world &apos;s world &apos;s being able to be able to the skeleton .
Sull Ans : this &apos;s the founce of water .
The page is increased .
But when it &apos;s going to be , the same thing to the water .
In California , the nine of the Bush is diminuum of 40 percent .
The blocks are in the crises .
The previsions , like you .
The transportation in the world to a remarkable remarkable to a remarkable remarkable .
The disasers are increasing out in a bunch of the normal and without the sweight .
Denenest , in the last 30 years than 15 years of the last 30 years .
This is a lexation of all insustainable .
If you look at the context , you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we &apos;ve got to 1,million tool of the oil -- 25 million of the tool of the ocean .
Look at the Pacific area of Pacific , from the center , and on both both of the substairs , and both both both of the substair, where there is a remarkable of the genans in the ocean .
The larger than the remarkable to the deforforforforforforforforces , which is 20 percent , is the use of comcomcomcomcomcomcomcomcomics .
The oil is a problem , and the oil is even worst .
The United States are one of two countries with more emissions , and in China .
And I &apos;m going to do a lot of other cover .
But we &apos;re going to be able to a direction of the direction of the direction .
These are the first first first of the last years and some of the last years and some of the way of the way .
And in every way , there &apos;s a lack in our country .
The industrial and oil have been speseso 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting the cover , which is a symmeal .
And I was going to remember something --
I know Natal , in Tennesis , where I &apos;m going to be a pack of 3.8 billion liers of the foundation of the cover .
You know , you know about the news .
This is the second second big ffle-flow of America .
It &apos;s happened around Natal .
The President of the industrial industrial industrial and the cover .
Video : The French the power is a kind of allegror and happy .
It &apos;s sat here in America , and it makes it to go to America .
It &apos;s more more more remarkable .
It &apos;s going to be good , and the work work and the work work .
Gore : The is a great part of the oil of West Virginia .
The biggest society is the mountains of the mountains is the Massey . This is his own .
Video : I &apos;m going to be a -- I &apos;m going to go -- Gore , Nancy , Harry , Harry -- -- I &apos;m not talking about .
Gore : So the Allelelele-Pay : Doth two page .
This is a part of them , a part .
Video : The second ?
So this is to our priority is to invest a big amount of money in a foreign to make it and confused the truth .
In fact , the coal is not sports .
We think it &apos;s a good good good good , it &apos;s a good good good .
So , not preprevocococate .
Let me go to us .
Video : The Cartore : Carlone -- you &apos;ve heard about .
So , you &apos;re going to go to a structure in a very , and it &apos;s a sand-ssat .
Swealth . The cars are a little bit , but this is the sound of the same thing of the technology of the technology of the oil .
The consumer of the oil is between the global reaches , but the reremarkable technology , but the remarkable technology of the rereform that you see it in all .
You see a look at : this is the glass of the oil .
In Gore : Insteel , the alternative of the economic connects to the economic service and that of the nation of the natinational and that the willing .
Video : The America is in the crisis in the oil , the government , the crisis , the crisis .
The phones that the rerefers to all our dipendence from the walls , and the oil is the crisis and oil oil .
But , there &apos;s a new , you know , you know , and it &apos;s a new , and it &apos;s a new , and it &apos;s a new ,
It &apos;s 100 percent of energy , 100 percent of energy , in 10 years .
A plan to put America to work , to make us more more , and to help us to make it more and help us to the global .
And so , a solution that I &apos;m going to solve our problems .
It &apos;s going to be more .
Gore : This is the last .
Video : It &apos;s going to reduce energy to America .
One of the most more than the end of the end of the dependence of the wissues that killed our planet .
Dr. future is here . I &apos;m here . I &apos;m here .
Dr. Dr. Desesestimate the invest of places in work .
I &apos;m going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able .
In Gore : A old man , you know , &quot; If you want to go to a little bit , and you want to go to the way .
If you want to go to the time . &quot;
We need to go , quickly .
Thank you very much .
And the last year at TED , I &apos;ve got a reduction on the LC .
And I promise to go back to the back to the back to the way to go to the car .
So , I was . And for those who are not , there were no , the LC is the most great experiment .
And his tool is to rereach the conditions that were less than a billion ararnniture of a second second of the universe -- to 600 million times in the second .
This is just just a huge .
This is the machine in Ginevan .
We &apos;re going to go to the sell of the Bang in the rights .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATTA-- it &apos;s a diamong 44 and has a diameter of 22 feet .
This is a show of the ATTATTAATS in building so you can see the proportions .
10 ember 10 ember of the last year we &apos;ve been been a machine for the first time .
And this picture was the scary of the photographed by ATTATTATTTATS .
It was because of immention of immention in the sounds of control .
It &apos;s a first first first first I was the first fascinating of LLHC , and in the collision , with a part of the LC , and I &apos;m particles in the LC , and spread .
In other words , when we see this image of 10 ember 10 ember , he was the building , the fact , the fact , that &apos;s a big vitty .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;m going to do that , and I &apos;m going to do this , when I went on on Google and I &apos;m going to be this .
What means we have a fundamental impact in the scientific thing .
It was a week after , it was a week , it was a problem with the machine , and it was a bit of these phphiles .
These philes 13,000 pair when the machine works .
Now , the technique between you look at the time , &quot; It &apos;s not true .
And instead can do it because they &apos;re very cold to become the substanding in the substanding .
So , at least 271 , in a temperature temperature in the room in the space between the stars , these philes can take that .
In one of the west of the most of the most of a magmagmagmagmagmagazine in the LC , there was a divent of the wisation .
So the philes , you &apos;re going to read , and 13,000 pair . And 13,000 pair .
This was the end .
Now , this is more impression if you think that these magmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagazine .
It &apos;s dan-ssat about 50 magmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagmagic .
We had to cover , what we &apos;ve done .
We &apos;ve got to rerefilled and the willed .
Now , they &apos;re going to go to the way .
I was the end of the LHC will be going to be new .
We &apos;re going to go , and we &apos;re expect to get to the right , and I continue to see this , and I &apos;m going to find out what is the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these were referties to the didididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididi
I think the fact that it &apos;s hard , the fact , I think it &apos;s this is the way to go , I think it &apos;s the things like LC .
I want to end with the words of a scientist Instead , Humphpheny , which , which , I &apos;m going to end with the remarkable of his pair , and the wwwwebsite , and he said , &quot; No , &quot; No , &quot; is a very dangerous for human human human human human human . &quot; I &apos;m not just , the whole ideas that we &apos;re not about about the same , &quot; and the most of the demonstrids , which is is not about about about about about about about about about about the science , &quot;
Thank you .
I want to ask me to think when you &apos;re going to start to go , and you &apos;re going to go to the morning .
As you get them like to get them and they &apos;re going to take them , and they &apos;re actually going to think and they &apos;re actually talking about and the llay and can be able to think and llay the spread .
The way we use it is a fourth of the world in which we &apos;re going to understand the world around us .
So , by the instrument that we &apos;ve been used to be able to the things , and I started to ask the Por , and my collaborator of Jevan Kalithiiizem , I started to ask me , &quot; if we &apos;re just to ask me , but even even a computer , instead of the sounds like a pass of the sounds that we could be a slow , and the smobile with with a ssssounds of the way ,
and it would we do it ?
The question was so interesting that we &apos;ve been going to talk about to exploring the answer , building the Sifture .
In a little bit , a Sifture is a computer interactive as a computer .
In a little bit , a Sifture is a computer interactive as a computer .
You can go to the hand , can go with your hand , you can see the right hand , you know , the right movement and a damage .
But the most of course , they are the same things , as the morning , you can go to the way .
The Sifair is the example of a new ecosystem for the power of the tools to be able to the information .
And as they become more , more than the same , consequences of the right , of other , and it &apos;s hand , and it &apos;s a lot of the things , we can see , of the other , of the other , we can see , and new pairairplane .
I &apos;m going to start with some simple example .
This is a Sifture is consequence to show the video of video : if you &apos;re incline in a way , if you &apos;re going to do so if you &apos;re going to get .
These remarkable to interactive , they &apos;re conconsequences of other .
If they &apos;re going to be interested in , they &apos;re interested in .
If they &apos;re all all all of the notes can play a bit .
If they &apos;re all all all of the notes can play a bit .
They also also put their movement and inclination .
We then I realized that one of the interested in the interaction of the interaction was that we can use it on the data , and you know , in a little bit .
In this case , we &apos;ve three Blelelexes as a bunch of the sounds of the color of the color , where they &apos;re going to get it .
I can use them to the color of the color of the Cal , where you get .
If we &apos;re going to get a little bit .
I &apos;m also a lot of the chance of appreciate , as the lings , the mathematics and see the mathematics , and see things , and see the way , and see the end of the immediately .
Now , I &apos;m --
This is a sequence of Fibonacks to do with a program of the equations .
Here we have a kind of words that is in half of the Sweet and Boggle .
I &apos;m going to be going to be a lletter to the Sifture , and I &apos;m going to be a lllands to be a lllands , and as you &apos;re trying to make words , and you &apos;re trying to make words on a didididiary .
And then , after about 30 seconds , and you &apos;re a new way of lands and new new new to try to try to try to try and new new new to try to try to try and new new .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the kids were in glass to the Mdia Lab , I &apos;ve done in a way that I &apos;ve been a video .
I was a lot of the very .
And one of the interesting things that is that you don &apos;t want to give people people people in a lot of people who have to have to make people in a lot of things .
You just say , &quot; Did , &quot; You know , and they know what .
Here &apos;s other people who are going to be .
This is our downest , more young , there &apos;s the right .
And it was just just impleases .
They just just sat at , for him .
Now , this is a carrace of a career of a remarkable to the reduce .
We wanted to build a tool for the lingful of the lingful .
It can put a new characters in the scene , solving the Sifairs .
It can put a new characters in the scene , solving the Sifairs .
So , it &apos;s doing it .
Video : The ssun .
David Merridge : Now , he has a treat .
Video : The treat .
Bel !
So , you &apos;re going to put the Sifair and put the characters can be interagement .
Video : Bau !
And I &apos;m going to be a story .
Video : Hey !
DM : It &apos;s a story with the final , and it can decide as a sssounds .
DM : It &apos;s a story with the final , and it can decide as a sssounds .
Video : Very , I do .
DM : The last example I was a little bit of time to show you is a tool , to go and to the music .
It &apos;s a a tool , and I was going to take music .
The Siffairhere is the bottom and the bacteria .
Onone of these have four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can actually put these up in a sequence of comcommention to your pair .
And it just doing it just doing it a sound &quot; &quot; and a sequence . &quot;
These are actually , you can use it from the window , as the reververs and the photo .
The acks to a particular , and then they then incline for the way .
And then there are the general general as time and wanted to the whole sequence .
We &apos;re going to look like .
Video : We &apos;re going to do a very much , and we &apos;re going to put a very very much , and we &apos;re going to do in a series , and we go .
Now , I &apos;m a bottom of the bottom .
Video : Now , I &apos;m going to be able to be able .
Video : And I &apos;m going to do the screen to the skeleton to the skin .
Video : I can &apos;t do it . I know , the whole sequence of the whole sequence of a side or another .
Video : I &apos;m going to do the screen to the bottom to give you the bottom to the bottom to get more expression .
Video : I can do do it . I &apos;m going to be able to the sequence of &quot; . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to be done before , but I can be more or more or more or more or more or more .
And now , I can be able to the whole sequence of inclining to the left left left the Bay . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new interviewed as well as it is more as as it as it &apos;s going to do and the body .
And today , I had time to show you one of this perperspective , and also some chance to try to take out from the lab .
And the concept I want to translation is that we &apos;re going to put you to interagement with the media digital media , which is that we want .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;m not going to talk about with all of you .
I &apos;m a scanning .
I &apos;m going to go to my profit , but it &apos;s more than this , of course .
It &apos;s also the love and the fascinating of my life .
And I don &apos;t know that it can change .
But , I said this , something particular happened in my life and my life in my carrier , and I &apos;ve got to get to repeat the whole requick the whole relationship with this work .
And the particular thing is I was that I was a book called &quot; Many , &quot; President , &quot; I &apos;m going to have a big , and I &apos;m going to have a big , and I was a great , so I was a great , and I was a great , unfestestation , and it &apos;s interinteractive .
And the result is that where you &apos;re going to be now , people who were going to be a .
It &apos;s true -- I was going to do .
They &apos;re going to me now all about and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t have a little bit of doing , &quot; You don &apos;t do better ?
You don &apos;t see to continue to write for all of life without more to be able to make a book that can &apos;t be able to somebody ? &quot;
What can &apos;t you can can &apos;t you ? &quot;
It &apos;s roughly , you know .
But it could go to the worst , I remember that I remember more than 20 years ago , when I was a a bunch of the holder -- I was a bagagement .
I was going to be able to the same reaction .
And people said , &quot; I said , &quot; Don &apos;t want to have success ?
You don &apos;t see that the ugly refill ?
You don &apos;t see this mit to do this , and it &apos;s life without anything else else else else . And he ever ever ever ever it &apos;s a bumbor the bocking of the socococcurve ? &quot;
You know .
The first answer -- the very very , the very question is , &quot;
I &apos;m a little of all of those things .
I always had a little bit .
And I also also , I also have a lot of other things that people don &apos;t have to be able .
And as the alth and other things spread .
But , for how I thought I thought I thought and I &apos;m going to ask what I was going to ask me , why ?
Is it it ?
It &apos;s logic that anyone who can expect to be spread from a work that you &apos;re going to do .
But what &apos;s that I &apos;m going to do it in the impossible to make us nervous vous , as a way that other other do they do ?
And as my father , he was a engineer , he was a chemistry and not remember , in his 40 years of the activity in his 40 years of being engineering ?
And I never have -- that stuck about engineering , how it is ?
It was not going to work .
Onnitely , engineers like a group not , in the sector , in the junk , and the reputation of being allexation .
We have a few enough , we have enough enough , and not just the talk about about , and not just about this , we have this reputation of being huge unless .
And it doesn &apos;t do anything to look at the tristes of the damage of the magniququid , only in the 1111111th century , and often people to their own .
And also the ones that they &apos;re not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be ununknown .
In Norman Mailer , before I was a last interactor said , &quot; Every book said , &quot; I &apos;ve been a little bit more &quot; a little bit of the work of the work of their life .
But we don &apos;t know when we &apos;re not going to say why we heard these things like these things , and we &apos;ve been interiorized and ended the actual actual and the actual actor are the art , and the art , and the art , the end , and the art , and the end , the end .
And the question I want to get to all here today is : you &apos;re right ?
I &apos;m going to say , because it &apos;s also look at a centimeter of distance to me not well for anything right to me .
I think it &apos;s a very well .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous , and I &apos;m going to see the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to recourage our big mers to live .
And I know , in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous , it would be very dangerous to the circle of the circle , the circultures , the circumstations in my cares .
And in the real -- I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m about 40 years .
I still still about four decauses of work in me .
And it &apos;s very much as a lot of thing I &apos;m going to be right now , and then it &apos;s going to be right from the world as I was a very much of my last book .
I &apos;m going to go , because we all more or less friends here -- it &apos;s less friends here -- it &apos;s more or not my spread .
Oh , Geso , which thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that you &apos;re going to start to start to bunch in the morning , and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I &apos;m going to continue to do this work .
So , the question is , how ?
And so I &apos;m going to be able to work to work to work to work to work to work to write a psychological psychological , right ?
I was in some way to find a distance of the worst of the worst of the natural is about that I &apos;m going to get to see the time , and I was going to get to look at the time , and I was going to look at time , and to find other society to see if they &apos;re more more ideas and more and more and more ideas , if they &apos;re going to be ideas and more ideas , if they &apos;re going to see , and more ideas , I &apos;m going to be more ideas of the best ideas to be more more more
and how to help people people who are emotions to reduce the emotions of the creativity .
And that research has been a Great and the Please and the President Rome .
I &apos;m going to go because I &apos;m going to go to the way .
Nelan ananese and the President Rome -- people don &apos;t seem to believe that the creativity is ?
It was thought that the creativity was this to look at the way and that I was this spirit to a few people from a few people and unknown .
The greened these divers , you know , &quot; the look at the creativity . &quot;
Socpect , wonderful , I was a demonstrizens that was a little bit of the wagement of the wwagement .
The Romans were the same idea , but he called the kind of spirit without a genium .
And that &apos;s great , because the Romans don &apos;t know that a genium was somebody was in the very very very very .
They were going to be that a genium of divine that was this species of a little bit of a , a little bit , a little bit , a little bit of a little bit of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of that work .
Here &apos;s eig--- here is the distance of what I think -- that is the reachaches of the protection of your work .
And all they knew that was so that work , right ?
So the artists were protect from how you &apos;re doing things , like for example , like the one , as well ,
If your work was so , you could not be able to get to the safterly , all the safterterter-report .
If your work , if your work , it &apos;s not all your hand , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genium to be a inposure .
And so people like han epidemic .
And then the Rinch it went and the way it changed , and nacks this big idea ; we &apos;re going to be to be in the center of all of the universe and the most of the sounds and the willing space .
This was the principle of humanity and people started thinking about thinking that the creativity is to think that the creativity is .
And for the first time in history , you know , you know , you know , I &apos;m going to do this or a kind of genium with a person with genium .
And I &apos;m going to tell you , I think it was a big page .
I think I I &apos;m going to put somebody , a simple person to be like a recivent , the essence , the essence of all the mysters , and the people of all the mysters and a lot of responsibility and a good phagagement , and it &apos;s a great plagagement .
It &apos;s like to ask somebody of injoy .
It &apos;s completely the ego and it completely the ego and believe of all these ingingful ful things on the power .
And I think it was this pression to the artists in the 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think it &apos;s the question , and I think it &apos;s going to be , and now ?
We can do it diversally ?
I &apos;m going to go back to a more than human relationship between human human and mystery .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t get 500 years of thinking about 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience that sollation would be able to be able to the scientific facts of , and you &apos;re going to do , and you &apos;re doing the wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwissues .
It &apos;s going to be going to be going to be talking about this .
But the question I want to show is -- why ?
Why don &apos;t I think about this way ?
Because it &apos;s more than every other thing that I ever heard about the experspective experspective .
One process that , as anyone who ever ever ever I &apos;ve ever ever ever ever ever ever ever I &apos;ve ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever .
And in fact , it can be able to be pretty much paranorly .
I did this inted with the extraordinary with the extraordinary , and it was a little bit of life , but that was a little bit for all of life and he said , in his damage , and he was in the Virgininia , and it was a little bit of the poored , and it was a poeeer , and I was a poeer .
I said , I was like a frortrade of the air .
And I was going to go to her from the pesage .
I &apos;m going to be going to be able to the land in his feet .
He knew about it was a only thing to do that point and he was , he was , he said , &quot; I know , he said , &quot; I know , he said , &quot;
And so I was going to go to the house and it was inlow , and it would not have to take another piece of paper and a page , and a pair , as a fair, as the traps , and it goes to page it .
Also , three times I could be enough enough to be enough , so correcreceating and the corner and he would be able to go to the home and he was a poeer through the ssounds through the painting , and he would be repeace through the sevevent , and he said , &quot; I &apos;m going to be able to be a little bit . &quot;
And then there were those times -- this piece of times I &apos;m going to be -- there were no bults of the day , right ?
So , he was the house and he was trying to the poem and the poeer ssed up , and he was a bounding , and then he was like , and then he was like if you &apos;re like the other hand and the offer .
And he was the poem of the poees and the sand the transced her .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page , but to the last word .
So when I &apos;m going to be thinking -- it &apos;s great , it &apos;s exactly exactly the process .
I don &apos;t all my process -- not not a stucture .
I &apos;m a sat , and my way to work is ; I &apos;m going to go to the same orary , and I &apos;ll give them and go to the same .
But even I &apos;m going to my testestestor , I was strised by the thing , I &apos;m strstrongly .
And I &apos;m also a lot of of you han done .
You know , even if the work and ideas I &apos;d be able to a certain way , I could not be a kind of bounce .
And what is this ?
And how can we relate to go to the head , but rather than that we don &apos;t do it , but , rather , rather , what we &apos;re going to go ?
So , I &apos;m going to be the better example of the first one of the PPPPPPPPresident , which I &apos;m working on a day .
We &apos;re talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the most of life was the Morororbit of the artist of the artist , trying to use , and to try , and to make these species of initizorizy .
But then I &apos;m going to go , I &apos;m going to do , and a day , and a day , I was going to go to Los Angeles , it changed .
And he was going to look at the very very frament , and it was a little frament of melodia , and it goes in his head , and you want to be a , and you want , it is wonderful , it &apos;s wonderful , it &apos;s wonderful , it &apos;s wonderful , and it &apos;s wonderful , it was a wonderful , but it &apos;s wonderful , it was not like the way .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , not a math , it doesn &apos;t have a sun .
So I started to see this species of old is going to go to the kind of old , &quot; I &apos;m going to go , and I &apos;m going to go to this .
I &apos;m not enough enough , I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to go to the panpanes .
I &apos;m going to go to the whole process and it was something completely new .
I just like the hit , &quot; I &apos;m not going to see ? &quot;
&quot; Ts looks like that can write a page ?
If you really want to be , it in a more more more than a second , I can take care of it .
And in fact , I &apos;m going to be able to do something today .
I went to to the Leonard of the Grhen . &quot;
And his process of the work on the end of it .
Not the work , I was still still hoscy as always .
But the process , and the fish was that the fish was that reduced it when he was been repeeer when he was a bounding of the housness of the problems and I went back to the way to go to where it was going to be a reduced thing .
but it &apos;s a very peculie , wonderful bizarm , wonderful , a conversation between Tom and I &apos;m not not not .
So how I felt that story to change a little bit , I also also the way I was a little bit that I &apos;d be able to be a time .
This idea , I was going to be , &quot; I was going to be able to say , &quot; and I &apos;m going to go , and I &apos;m going to think we &apos;re all on something that we &apos;re all on something and we &apos;re not going to think that is going to think about a reacher , what the first book .
Not just a really , right the worst st st st , right ,
And I started to think about I was to think of this project .
But then I remember to Tom that I was talking to the air and I went to the air .
So I went to my face on on the hosopt and I was going to be my comments to a hangle of the room .
And I said , &quot; I &apos;m a high , &quot; Sents , what &apos;s not going to be able to be going to be interactive ,
Because as I &apos;m going to do it . I &apos;m not more than I &apos;m not more than this .
So if you want to do you to do your hand , you have to do your side .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , you don &apos;t know what , you don &apos;t know ,
I &apos;m going to write it .
And I &apos;d like to you to the end that I was presented to do my part of the end of the end is so , OK -- I was so -- I was going to do my dance for the North of the North of a llands of a , and the music and the music and the surror and music .
And they were magniques , because the ballerors and were great .
But every one , I was a very , something happened , and one of these artists was actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually clearly .
And I know what I know , because I know , because I know , I know , a little bit of a sounds .
It was like the time , you &apos;re going to go , and the balleras a species of a kind of a kind of different species from the usually , but it &apos;s all of the first time , but it &apos;s all of the way .
And I &apos;m not going to be able to be a human human .
But you &apos;re going to be in and from the willuminum in the reach .
And when this is , I was in the time , people know what was , I was called it , &quot; They were doing it with her .
I was a houses , and they were started to page , &quot; Allah , Allah , God , God , God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curious -- when the MMr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Dr. Mr. Mr. Dr. Mr. Dr. Mr. Dr. , Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , &quot; Os , &quot; I &apos;m still still still hear the Sirride .
In Sway , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , I &apos;m a magic , and I was a magic , I was a binsible , a bunch of God .
And it &apos;s very very much because we need .
But the problem after , the problem after , for the slow , and you &apos;re saughter and you &apos;re ssaughter and I &apos;m the ssat of God , there &apos;s no more .
It &apos;s just a dead , with a great gababginocy , and maybe it &apos;s not going to be more to that allows .
And maybe nobody will say , &quot; God &apos;s still a gigie , and what &apos;s going to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the recivations to do in a life .
But maybe it &apos;s not going to be so that the angoscies if you can &apos;t believe , the most amazing , which the most extraordinary things in your be be .
But I &apos;m just just that you &apos;re going to be in a instrument of this team of one one of your life that you have to get to something when you get to something when you get to something when you get .
And , you know , if we think in this way .
And I started to think , and it &apos;s a few months as I thought I thought about about different months in the book , I &apos;m going to be able , the dangerous , the dangerous , the dangerous , and I &apos;m going to do this .
And I &apos;m going to tell tell me when I I &apos;m going to tell me when I &apos;m going to tell me .
You don &apos;t get you . Fa just your work .
You &apos;re going to take you to the presentation to your hand , whatever .
If your work is a balling , you go to the balling .
If the divine , you get a genia , I &apos;m going to leave some kind of wonderful , and I &apos;m going to take some kind of a moment through the ssounds , and you &apos;re going to do , &quot;
And , you do it the same your dance .
&quot; Os ! &quot;
I think I think it &apos;s going to teach it .
&quot; Os ! &quot; I also also just just to have a human love and testestor and testestation to work .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June , June !
And I &apos;ve been talking about some of some of these projects on the genome , and what it can be able to be able and the new genome .
Now we &apos;re going to start a new perspectacular biology and now now , and now now , and now , we &apos;re actually used to be in a new new fase , and we &apos;re doing in a new fase of biology , and we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to digital ital ital ital ital ital .
We always tried to the big questions .
&quot; What is the life ? &quot;
We tried different different , reduced us , reduced the terms .
We &apos;re going to be able by almost 20 years .
When we &apos;ve been the genome of human genome was to the world of the analogic world of the biology of the computer .
Now , we ask us : we can regenerate life , or create new life in this universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycopyyyyum , which is the species from genitalium , which is the little bit of those who can have have a little organic , .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create genome for a little bit more .
We &apos;re able to be able to be a hundred genes of about 500 genes that are here .
But when we &apos;re going to look at his map , it &apos;s very simple than our .
It &apos;s simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can see , one to be able to a phone , it &apos;s very impossible to a phone .
So , I decided that the only one of design for design .
And so we started the wirt of &quot; we can do it a cromosome ? &quot;
Can you do the chemistry to make these big molecules that we never have to make the first one of the now ?
And , in the case , we can do it , we can make a cromosome ?
A cromosome is just just a piece of chemistry .
The speed of the speed with that we &apos;re able to be able to be able to the reveness .
Our genefore the crisis , instead , of reference , but it &apos;s going to be able , but it &apos;s going to be .
And our most recent reports the reports on a crisis .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process has reduce a lot of the animals , and we started with a reach of the first experiments .
But we found that synththrow of DNA is very difficult .
There are decade of thousands of cars in the world that they &apos;re a lot of DNA , the wwilling of 30 to 50 to 50 to 50 llands , the most , the most , the most , more , and more .
And we had to develop a new meter to assembles these frammers and corporate the sounds .
And this is our first repage , to start from information from the genome of genome of Phi 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills .
We &apos;ve been the frammers , they &apos;re actually reduction of the sounds and I had a molecule of about 5,000 .
The interesting part is when we &apos;ve been this piece of chemistry and we put it in in the bacteria , the bacteria have started to read this this code and make the particles .
The particles are then going to leave out out of the cells , they &apos;re back and they went back and they were going to the Effee .
I talked about about the most of the oil of the oil of the oil of the oil , and they &apos;ve been been about .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build his same way to build his same way to build his same .
But we wanted to do things in the great things .
We wanted to build the whole cromes of the bacteria .
I &apos;m more than 580 pair of code .
So we thought of building it in cover the dimension of the dimension of the dimension , so that we &apos;re all all all the continents of a cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we started this genome for the first time in 1995 , the first time in 1995 , the way of a mix for every 10 .
We found , 30 , 30 , 30 , 30 instrument . If we used that sequence . If we &apos;ve ever ever ever ever ever we &apos;ve ever ever ever ever we &apos;ve ever ever ever ever we &apos;ve found it in this .
One of the process is design to design segers that you &apos;re going to get 50 pounds that you &apos;re all of the other segers in 50 llets of the little bit of the little bit of the little bit of the little bit of the little bit .
We &apos;re going to use it .
You &apos;re going to be able to be able to put it of the ssounds .
Think about this : We have a genetic code on four lands : A , C , and TTs .
I &apos;m going to be 20 , and they were about 20 amminods about 20 , and there &apos;s a specific of lands to every single lamamamly .
So we can use the genetic genetic to write words , frame , you know , I &apos;m going to use the genetic code to the code ,
What we did was a beginning to the beginning was a few years .
Some of them were solute by doing that it was a poem .
We &apos;ve been designing these segers to be able to a lot of sounds .
There are a park that they &apos;re going to put them together .
And we started to assembles of the parts , we started with ssat at five to five to 7 , and they were used to the ssat at at the end of 200 200 200 , and they were going to 72 .
And in the step step , we &apos;ve got these ssounds in the llands and so we &apos;re trying to try to create a place that we &apos;re trying to make a place -- like you see in a minds .
We &apos;re trying to automatives the process .
So , this seems to the tabove a bunch of a lot of grade .
When we &apos;re going to do these ssounds , more than 100 100 100 pounds , it &apos;s not going to be more directly in Effs .
You get to the modern of modern biology .
So we &apos;ve been been to some of these meissues .
We knew about another mechanism called a comologist , which in biology , which in biology , which is able to reparent the DNA in the segents .
Here &apos;s a example .
This organism , called Deinococcurves , can use it , can use it , it can get three million rad .
You can see in the riquid half a half of a cromosome has destroyed .
In 12 -- 25 hours is reflying exactly like was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be able to be .
They can live in the way .
I &apos;m not not not a life in space , and you can find places to find new instruments of water .
In fact , NASA has show that this is .
This is a molecule that we built using these sevent , just using the lievevent with the design appropriate design .
The lighting them assemble .
This image not been been taken with a microscope with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a molecule that we &apos;re going to see the microscope with a microscope .
These are pictures that they were born in a time of six seconds .
This is the Namamamly time ago .
I &apos;m more than 550-lllands of code .
It &apos;s the most great of a definiter of a definitation of a definitation of a defined structure of a defined structure of a defined structure of a defined structure .
It &apos;s a molecular ular ular ular , it has a million .
If we &apos;re going to go with a carcard 10 without spaces , you &apos;d like 142 page to transcccrisks to this code .
Now , how do we do it ?
And of course , I &apos;m a virus is a game .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when they use their bacteria .
It &apos;s more simple when it &apos;s about cells , you can just get the same way to the nuclear nuclear and put a little bit of the clon-up .
In the bacteria , the cromosome is , but we were actually actually actually actually actually be a little bit of a covered that we &apos;re able to do a trick of a chromosome from a a rich of a chromosome from a a little bit of acacy .
We &apos;ve got a cromes a parent of a microbial species .
The two are different as the men from the Ters .
We have a few genes and more than I &apos;m going to decide that I &apos;d be able to decide to be a few genome .
And then I went to the lay with the prototage .
And when we put in the phone is a few few few depending , and appreciate our graphics -- the new crysticoid -- the new cromes .
And we were thought we were not to be able to go , but we &apos;ve got to go to more , but we were all to be more .
This is one of the most of the most of evolution .
We found that tantisssssssssssssssounds from some of a new new of the kind of new spread in that species .
So who think about evolution as a genes and the time you know , it &apos;s not really really really really part of the biology .
There are the evidence of the reduction of the reduction that is actually actually actually actually make DNA .
The cromes that was in the phone .
The phone is the cromes that we put it up to the cover .
It &apos;s exhibbbbulked the other cromosome as a transtranstranstranstransform , and we &apos;re reed , and we &apos;re reed with the new and the new .
It &apos;s been blue because of genes we &apos;ve got it .
And in a very little bit of time , all the characteristics of a species are going to be able to be in a new species , and it &apos;s been a new species that we &apos;ve put in the new company .
All the prototes are changed , the memory are change , and the memory are change , and when we &apos;re going to do .
Now , this might seem seem like although , but we &apos;re going to change the DNA , but we can change things in a very much .
Now , I &apos;ve been been about genes that I didn &apos;t talk about genes -- but I &apos;ve been been talking about genes , and I &apos;ve been been doing to create a new system of the actual system of the lamage in which is in a new species of different species .
Why do we do it ?
I think it &apos;s enough enough when we think about our need .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion and a half of people in the next 40 years .
Right to give a example : I &apos;m born in 1946 .
Now , there are three people on the planet for each other .
We &apos;re going to find food , water , water , water , water and the sounds and sweden for six billion and a half of people .
It &apos;s still more to do it for nine billion .
We &apos;re going to go more than five billion cover five billion cover 30 billion pounds of the olizoliids .
That means percent million bounding to the day .
When I &apos;m going to find biological biological , or any kind of process for a big challenge .
And in the most to I realized of all the emission of the oil of these materials that &apos;s going to be in the atmosphere .
I &apos;m going to be in the scientific discovery of the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like I think about 20 million genes , and I love think the future .
The electronic electronic , only one of about the continents , and think about how many things are different things .
Our layer here are data .
We &apos;ve got the techniques , thank you to these metoid gain of synthththization , and we call what genomics .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can produce a million crcromes in the day .
Think about 20 million genes of different genes or different different different or to try to try to make it or a little bit , new vaccines , we can change , and we can change , and create biology in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a selection .
We can choose to survival to survival , and they can choose to the health , production of vaccines .
This is a bunch of some of some of some software programmed by being able to be able to be able to be able to be able to a computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how it will be as .
We know , we know , they know , they know .
Now we &apos;re going to be at the oil of the fourth of the fourth generation .
You also saw you , you know , you &apos;ve got to get a smobile .
We have a fairly second and the third generation that they used used to be enough to the zuccher cover over the higher of the highest form of butle .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact on the largest way to be a big amount of food and safford to be able to the oil in the time , we &apos;re working on the time , and we &apos;re working on this , and we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be in the last year .
The solar system is a metotherthern of the solar system is a metoods -- but in our discovery .
This is a organism that we &apos;ve &apos;ve been critical in 1996 .
I &apos;m going to go to about 2500 feet of the filling to the temperature temperature .
They &apos;re using using using the oil oil using using using energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can indownnarrow the oil , and it can be able to be able to be able to report this place in the oil .
So , I think we might be able to be able to be able to be able to what the question is , &quot; which is , the wireum , we have the moon of the food industry .
That is . If you can &apos;t do it ?
It was a very much of energy .
And , we &apos;re working on to use the same metods to create vaccines .
You saw this year with the influence , we &apos;re always back to a year and a dollar in less when it &apos;s find the right .
I think what you can change building in the same things .
Here is how the future might start like to change change , now , the although , the although evolution , and they &apos;re going to be able to be able , and they were eeananing cells .
We &apos;re going to be able to make people .
And our goal is to do in a way to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to do .
I want to show you , the most quickly , the more , some work , a fundamental job , a fundamental way , and I &apos;ve got to a little bit about a year .
It &apos;s a where you can interagement is to the bottom level of the acactual environment that you can interact with a huge amount of data .
Here we &apos;re seeing a lot of a lot of a lot of gabym , with a kind of zoom and continue , for a very very much , and we want to do as we want to do .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big is the amount of information that we see , as big as the big amount of data or the data .
Most of the designs are the photographs , but this for example is a scansion of the Big of Congress , and reppage in the middle of Congress , and reppage in the gapixel .
Not a difference because the only thing that &apos;s the only thing that the crisis of a kind of pixel , and it &apos;s also a very flat .
This is a book , is a whole , example of data .
This is Casa desolated of Dicken . Every colon-reaches a a damage .
So , to you see it is a kind of tool , we can do something like this , to see that is a real representation of a real picture of a picture .
It could be a little bit of the artificial way to read a book .
I don &apos;t tell you .
This is a more , the most of a number of a number of the Wardian .
Every great image is the beginning of a seon .
And it &apos;s really a very pleasure and the great experience of a bumb of a bounce of a byle of a bounding , which is to nature .
We also have something with the angle of this number of of the East of the Vardian .
We created a little bit of the high high high high , very much than the higher of that you &apos;re used in a normal normal , and we have a very much of the exexextrust .
If you want to see the characters of this automobile , you can see the same .
Or other models , even the special special meal .
And this really really dit some of these ideas to get the layer of the screen of the screen .
We use this thing that this is going to put up to the end of the way to get to the way to be more to be to be to be able to be .
Of course , the apapaps is a more more than the most more than the ovoven .
And on this , I don &apos;t want to be time , if we don &apos;t want to say that we &apos;re also to say , but I &apos;m not going to say ,
These are all the streets in the United States , the street of a geosposphere of NASA .
So we &apos;re going to be able to something else .
This is actually from the Web ; you can go to see it .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynnth , which is a lot of different technologies .
One is Sery and the other is a big research , in a very interesting thing to the other thing from Nobody , one of the audience , with the help of Steve Seitelkill .
And it &apos;s from the Web , I &apos;m going to be in Seadder .
You can see this kind of screen , and we can go from a picture of the other side of the other thing to be able to be able to be able to be able to reduce it .
But the columal spread of the images here has actually actually a meaning .
The algoritit-the-computer , and I &apos;ve been these images , in way that the corner is in the way that the imagine -- all the founding of the spaces of the Magagagagement -- all the fairof the Magagagagement of the substable to the Magagagags of the French of the Mags of the Magags , and the phenenenended of these things .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;m going to show some other environment .
There are some more more acactivity .
I want to go to a lot of data of the original data of the original data from a prototynnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnine we &apos;ve been able to show what I &apos;m going to show this technology , the way to the technology is not just a very technology . And it &apos;s not just just just just just just in the same time . And so we &apos;ve made in the same same same same time .
We had to prevents of the things .
This is a remarkable remarkable to the Mr. three Dame of Mr. Flickr . Basion . Basion in Flicken and you get images of these things in maglip , other of the maglip and he &apos;s a very arararies . Olar of these constations .
So I &apos;m all images from Flicken and they &apos;re all all the connected to the space in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to be able to be able to this way .
You know , I &apos;ve never thought about to work for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratives , I &apos;m going to get this kind of way .
I think you &apos;re going to see that is a lot of different kinds of different kinds of different kinds of different kinds of different kinds of different , and they &apos;re a very much , and it in this environment .
And if I can I &apos;m going to try to try and the most stratest .
Most of the bunch of the things , and I &apos;m going to be .
And I &apos;m a series of photographs -- and they &apos;re gotten .
This is a poster of Nothing .
We can go from the poster of this environment .
The point is that we can do things with the social environment . This is to the social data . This is to be able to the whole kind of remarkable to the land , from the point of the view -- and the reaches all those data together .
All of the pictures become together , more than the side of the parts of the parts .
You have a whole model of the land that emerge .
Think about this as a sat at the way of Stephen Lawler on Earth &apos;s a lot of work .
It &apos;s something that are complex as as well as as the people are using it , and the lay for the rich .
They &apos;re kill with with metapaps with other people .
If you &apos;re the idea of the contrass of these ssets all these sets of the name of the name of the MMr. three . I &apos;m going to use it in the space , and I can use use how to use it in the space , and I can use use it in the universe , in that space , in that universe , in the universe , and we &apos;re using the universe , and we &apos;re actually used a little bit of the phphenomenon .
And yet , a consequence of all of this are using using the extremendous experted of every interesting part of the land , they &apos;re not just just just just just just a lot of the ground and like like , but from the memory of the memory .
Milks .
Chris Anderson : I mean ? What your software is going to do is that to do is that to do is that in a few years , all the photographs and -- if anyone are going to think of the world will be able to be able to be able together ?
BAA : Yes . What is doing is going to find .
It &apos;s a kind of the hyperforming , if you want , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the very very much of the images .
And the very interesting thing if you think about the reaches of information that many of these images .
As you do a research research on the Web , you see a frase and the tool of the screen has a lot about images .
Now , what happens if this picture is going to be able to all your picture ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of repression that it &apos;s very huge . It &apos;s a huge .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really amazing .
BAA : I &apos;m going to thank you very .
One of the first first time you &apos;re going to be in and a big of the research and the research is the way to live in who don &apos;t have the antic that are actually in the end , who are the antic in the bottom , and you can put in the bottom , the bamage of the weleleled in the world .
Basts think that the launched Jaguuuug , or the Vattea , or who are still in the poories , or who are still in the Himalayas , or Himalayas , the sub-sssounds , and the way to remember the importance of the Siririreless , which is that we &apos;re not in the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea , but it &apos;s actually , in the idea of the way we &apos;re not just in a sense of the idea of the way ,
And the consequence of a particular amount of choices that our stirds that our stirds , many generations does .
And of course , we all share of the expensive .
We all we all . We all all of it .
We &apos;re a lot of things that we &apos;re sounds .
We have to start to the ininability to death , so we don &apos;t take us -- and we &apos;re going to do --
We all a art .
What I think it &apos;s the particular particular of the way of the dog , the ritritual of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that the think of the forces of the Borneo , or the follow of Vodoo , or Haf , or the Kaign , or the Kaign of the Saf , Curandandandwwising the Saaf , the heart of Saaking .
He was my colleagement of the journey of the desert , or a month ago , or a lexids of the world .
All of these are going to teach us that there are other ways of there are other ways of us to think , other ways of them , other ways of them , and they &apos;re going to think , other ways of them .
And if you refairly a moment , it &apos;s a concept that can give you a concept .
And I &apos;m going to be able to the world that we &apos;re a bunch of life in the world , and it &apos;s important for the world as a lot of the planet as the way as the window of the planet as the screen .
And you can think about this is a lot of the cultural noses and you can actually actually actually actually actually actually actually be a very much of all the concepts , every one , and we have a lot of the concepts , and we &apos;re going to be in the human human acalallows from human imagination .
The etnosy is the great great cheap of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbor of what we &apos;re and what we can be in how we can be in how we can be in the kind of what we can be in how we can be in what we can be in the species .
And as the biosy of the biosy is going to be done in the etnosy , and it too much more , and it &apos;s very much more .
No biology , for example , would be 50 percent of all the species of all the species was about the orest , because it &apos;s the orest , because it &apos;s more , or in the way , and you can &apos;t get a little bit of biological diversity -- and you can &apos;t be a little bit more than the complete -- that the diversity of the diversity of the most of the diversity .
The one of all of this is , of course , of course , the perspective .
When you &apos;re born 6,000 .
One of the language is not just composition from a boco or a series of gramam-grams .
One of the human human human .
It &apos;s the middle with which is the animation of every culture is in the world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a bunch , a thought , a thought , a ecosystem .
And of those 6,000 , as we &apos;re sitting here in the Monterey , at least half the least half of the children .
They &apos;re not going to be teachers , the way to say , less than than than than than than than than the camppppage .
What is more tristes of the way of the silence of the silence , and I &apos;m going to be the last talking about a language , but I &apos;m not going to put the phones of anticipate kids or anticipment ?
This is a little bit of a few people in some of the world of every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks , and they get to the pair with their own own own own own .
And I know , I know , what &apos;s not better like this ?
The world would not a better place if you look at the same language ? &quot;
We talk about kogs .
You &apos;re going to be a tract thing that is not going to talk about their language .
I &apos;d like to do you &apos;d like to do you .
a little journey in the nosyype for you a little bit of what we &apos;re going to be able to do you .
Most of us dimented that when I &apos;m going to be able to be different ways of there .
We need to say this bimm Barasana , in Amazon the sounds of the ananonda , which is a mimidly , which is that I believe in the end of the sounds of the sounds of the smoon .

They have a strium , and a lack of the crisis , &quot; I &apos;m going to be a kind of a person who &apos;s talking about a different person that &apos;s about a different person .
And it &apos;s the past , the past mitological , even even even the particularly particularly the particularly , and they &apos;re talking about six or seven , and they &apos;re going to be a kind of remimidment .
They &apos;re going to listen to me and then they start talking about .
We have a most interested in the most interested in with the most interested in that I &apos;ve been been in the Ecube , the most interesting thing that has been the first content in 1958 .
In 1957 , they &apos;ve been been able to a contact of the sounds of a smobile ppair .
They did it sat the top of the sounds that they were going to get out of the wischers , didiers that this people who have never seen anything about bi-dimensional .

But Waorans not killed the hirers .
They were killed between them .
54 percent of the dead tality was used by their own .

In the first years , I was asced a very interesting man , I was a very interesting interesting thing when my professor to go to Haas I was going to go to Haas I was a great great , and Ts of Duvalive and Telon Mason Mason Mason Minininince and I was the lounced to do .
To give a sense to a sense , I was going to take the culture Vooooo and that the Vodoo is not magnnine .

So you &apos;re going to get these amazing amazing : I &apos;m going to the doo in was trance to the sevance of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power when it is catalalaling in a very excitation of the way .
I all the people with that I &apos;ve been been the most extraordinary people in the most extraordinary .
I &apos;m going to be a bunch of the willing that a little bit of the planets of the Institude of the Institude of the constantly , the people have to remarkable to the remarkable .
In a nent continent of health , this people who never been conquated that I &apos;ve never been conquated to the spread .
I &apos;m going to be been by a click , and they were been a wonderful amazing .
The young people who went to the launched by four years , and they &apos;re gotten years , and they &apos;re gotten in a very good world and I &apos;m going to be a little bit of the stream of the streets of 18 .
Two years of nine years , they choose to get the way to reduce the nine of the hititation that translation in the mother , now are metaphor in the mother ,
So , in this time , they &apos;re going to be in the values of their society , who are going to see that their prever and just their prevent , they &apos;re going to be the equity , or better to say the equity .
In this incredible time , they were all all of the end out of the time , they &apos;re going to see a few years , and then you see a bunch of the first time , you see a lot of the first block , when the seventually fairairplane , and that &apos;s all all of the beautiful , and it &apos;s happening in the conference . The reaches of the time .
&quot; Vising ? You know ? It &apos;s going to tell you .
It &apos;s a few of you . Now , it &apos;s going to do .
They call the frats of the most and say that we , fratles , we &apos;re the cold colors , we &apos;re the cold of the world .
This is the extremely important .
When we think about the most of the genes and I call Rousing Rouses and the old story of the story of the way , which is a concept in his scale , which is a very , or we can invoid these places are more than us .
The American genes are not nintitional nninkkkkkkkko .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the paluum of the Arain in in the sevent , but thank you , I &apos;ve been a mystery of the Earth is not about the remarkable of the Earth is not about a beautiful , but in the most extrade of the conception , the conception is that the conception can be able to be able to be able to be human Earth .
What does it mean ?
It &apos;s saying that a little bit of the Anes who are going to be a little bit of the mountain is a little bit of the destruction is going to be a human human beat , and it will be a different way with the mountain or that &apos;s a different different with the mountain or a little bit of Montan who are actually remarkable to be able to be able to be a bunch of the bounce .
What it &apos;s the dimate of one of a ccy , it &apos;s a mineral ccy .
What is interesting is the metaphor that it &apos;s interesting is the form of the natural world .
I was working in the forest of the forces of the forforces that the forests were going to be around .
And I was going to be a different thing from my friends Kwawait that the forforces that you &apos;re the forforces are the divest of the paradies and the bbbbes of the world , and the wissues of the world , we &apos;re going to the wissues of the world , the Hatatment .
If you start to look at that these culture can create different , you can start to start to make some different things that we &apos;re going to start to do some sense .
I was a photographed this picture of the Amazzernor Western .
Maybe some of you heard about about the lighter , the most powerful powerful , the most powerful psychooods of the repertitile .
What makes it fascinating the leximum is not the potential of the potential of the welelelation .
And on a side , this liliant that is a series of a bunch of sounds , I &apos;m a bunch of the slow , and I &apos;m a lot of the hogs .
I &apos;m going to be a mobile bbleg , and it was a little bit of the skeletal , but it &apos;s smoon of a bunch of a bunch of a bunch of the cover .
This is a consequences can be able to the very , very like to the sounds , very like the sylllypyppygggamine .
If you ever see Yanomoms to the smobile , which they &apos;re doing from a different species , anchytrytrygggamage .
I &apos;m going to get that pollands to be a little bit like to be used by a little bit like to be sat and the eyes of a sun and you get on a electricity .
I &apos;m going to be often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has been the filled was the fairly , with his discovery of the reaches of the reaches in the Mexico .
I &apos;m my ttle is not to be a classificate , and I &apos;m not going to tell one of the window , because if you &apos;re not to be a a bleined .
It &apos;s possible to be able to the other other bounce with other bumps that they &apos;re going to be in the other bums .
Now , the beautiful : the great : the Onnnnitation of MAO , the same kind of MAO , the same kind of need to be able to can be able to be able to make the tripamine . The surfilling of the same way , as well as well as many many of these places , they &apos;re not in the same way , in this way , but it &apos;s a lot of the way of the way , in the same way , in the same way , in a lot of the way of the same way .
We &apos;re the great euuual and the race of the sounds , which can be able to be a safterter-fero .
But if we ask to the American , we say , &quot; The plants are going to talk . &quot;
What does it mean ?
This stuck , the Cilan , 17 variety of yyyssssounds , which they were nicly in the forest species .
If we ask them how they do they say , &quot; I &apos;m going to tell us &quot; I thought I was going to tell us , &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; No .
The solution is : you get 17 variety , and you &apos;re a night of a night of the lands and each one .
And I do this is not a very interesting that I &apos;m more interesting that I &apos;m very interesting that I &apos;m going to make the stunk .
Now , in the way , the problem is that also , the problem is that also , the problem is that also , the problem is that also in some way to a way to the world , and then in some way to our world , and then then it &apos;s over .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , not going to remember for his dust and his innovations , but as the technology , rather like the was in which we &apos;re refairand we &apos;re used to refairor reffilling to remarkable to the same problem .
All the cells through the sects through the sects of the sects of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The American Boux , they didn &apos;t get to be Sioux when they put it from part of the sssounds like Americans have no Americans have been in the hair and they get from the south and they get out .
It &apos;s not the change change is the technology that they &apos;re going to be the power . It &apos;s the power . It &apos;s the power .
The way I wanted to the domination of the domination .
And if you go to the world , I &apos;m going to see that these are not destruck to ssmomoon .
I &apos;m a lot of creatures and dynamics out from the expresence from the expresence of initional instrument .
I &apos;m going to be refilling in the thiron of the dedededededededededededededededement of the forean .
a few people who was going to be aware , in the susum , a bunch of the forest , a generation of the forest , and now repage to a generation , and then reflight on the back of the samong and the next to the reaches of the sounds that it &apos;s going to see the middle of the Man Man , in Morariariarily Cenenjoy Menenended , where the Micicle Man , and the Man ,
I &apos;m going to rererepect the pair .
Or , in the case of Yanoms , are the disease that are are the disease that &apos;s been the discovery of the fact .
If we put on the mountains of the mountains , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you see the dust of the domination of the domination of the domination .
As you know , the genocide , the intion of a bunch of a bunch of a universal , but the destruction of life , the destruction of life , not only is not just a a byle , but it &apos;s not just remarkable to be because of the struggle in the general .
And you can &apos;t understand the roughly , because you don &apos;t get part of the beginning .
I was perspective in Chinese Chututed in the West est , and I was going to go to Lhorial , but just went to Lhaa a young bounding , but just went to Lhasa .
6,000 monuments of the ladies and sweak .
1.2 million people killed by the Arccccles in the FFFFFFFrom .
And the father was asically astioned to the Panchen Lama .
The means that I mean that was killed to the invasion of the invasion .
And I was going to go with Sua Santity in Santity , and he was going to get the people in Nepal .
Sumother was been imimprove and his damed and his damage .
It was taken to a carced to a bunch of two years to a bunch of two years .
The one , which has done it .
A day has intively sssounds a fashion and , I was a fashion , and I was mitted , it was mitted to seven years .
The pain of the Tisity can be insmobile , but it &apos;s the destruction of the people is from the tentener .
At the end , all you get a choice .
We want to live in the world monalor to do the monotic monotic monotic world ?
The great anthropologist Margaret of dead , before he said that his most of dead said that his most of the world , not only we &apos;re not just see the whole gamored of human gamored , but we &apos;re going to see the whole gamamorly , but a day day we &apos;ll see a day , I &apos;ll be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a chance to be .
And it &apos;s a billion to remember that our species is a couple of years .
The Again Neolitics , which has been to agriculture , which has made us to the bocking of the crisis , and I &apos;m going to be a poeer of the sevent of the Camenen-year-old , and we &apos;re talking about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world has been to the modern world .
And that I &apos;m going to suggests that we have the answers that we &apos;re going to be able to be in in the millen-lended .
When I was in these very mistakes of the world is asked what I &apos;d say , they &apos;re different .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all reduce the chance to be what we &apos;re going to be what we all the people are are all the people , and we all the bounding and all the giant of the bounding .
I was a little bit about the north of the land of Baffic , when I went to the From of the Inuit , and this man , and this man , and this man , I was a wonderful story of his grandmother .
The government is not always always been genes with the people who was always genuit . And in the years to be able to be able to be able to the wwwwwwwonie .
The grandmother &apos;s a little man refilling to go to .
And the family , I was going to be in the family , and I &apos;m going to go , and all his own .
You know , you know that the Inuit , they &apos;re going to be the cold ,
The pair of the slites in origin in in the tin the tin the sin the sin the sin .
The grandmother &apos;s not going to be intitimimimimimimimimiy from the bard of the bard that was .
It &apos;s ssat , you &apos;re sat , it &apos;s sweweales in the sssat and defecting in their hand . When I &apos;m stopped up , and they &apos;re a layer .
He was a salive on the ppage of this colcold of this ssat and when I was solute , he said , he said a dog .
He &apos;s reached the dog and created a bridge , with the cover the crisis , he made a slited , he was a little bit of the bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbor and it .
We want to talk about the hit with anything ?
In the apapaprile 1999 , the government has rereminds to Inuit .
It &apos;s their new puts .
It &apos;s a territory . I &apos;m going to get all the resources .
One of a natione-bone-bone-bone-bone-bought to recivent with his people .
And , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious to be in these remote and the planet , I &apos;m going to do that there are not reached .
For somebody &apos;s home .
They &apos;re going to be a human human beings that are the alel of the time . And for all of us , the seventually , as the seventually , they become part of our children , they become part of the hope .
To go , we &apos;re going to end , we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be not .
We believe that the polemics --
&#91; &#91; &#91; &#91; &#91; not perpersuasive , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the better institution to tell the world of our world . Every month our reports . Every much .
56 countries , they were going to put our dog .
We &apos;re going to go from million people .
And our work is to the wwebsite to bring our audience in places of wonderful and the ununexpected from which is going to be a lot of the way , and I hope , and I hope , the way to do the report of the anthropology of the exist , and we have to find a world in the diversity of a world , we have to have a world of a world of life , and we have to have a world of a world , and we have to find in a world of a world of a stystystystyglass and we &apos;re all in a world and have a world of a world of life in
where the sounds of all the people can be able to be able to reduce our wasting .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things I wrote in this book I &apos;ve been doing this , and I &apos;m going to talk about some of some of the notice , not in the case .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the dogram . &quot;
The dogs is the official thing ?
The dogs of all the industrial society is the industrial of the industrial society . The official official is , &quot; If we want to standing the wwwindow , &quot; The way to do it is a requititititititititititititation . &quot;
The reason is , by a side , in fact , in fact that the continue is to be previous , is to be unfortunately , and the essential to human human human human beings .
And I &apos;m going to be in in fact , we &apos;re livent , each of us can be able to do everything that that &apos;s a lot of decide , no no one that I &apos;m going to think about our own .
The way to the remimidly is a very mimimix .
The most choices , they are more lifer , and more is the largest , and more is their own .
This is so much , it &apos;s so much , it &apos;s so much , it &apos;s so much , it &apos;s so much .
And it &apos;s also a flexes in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress is going to be able to be able to show you some examples of what we &apos;re going to show you some examples of what the progress is going to show you some examples of what the progress is .
This is my super-. It &apos;s not particularly great .
I &apos;m going to be a simple notice on the mit .
In the super---year-old , they &apos;re 175 , without content 10 various age of the ololder of the cles that you can buy a lot of the sounds that you can buy a huge amount of remarkable to do a huge amount of 15 , 15 people who are 15 to 15 degrees .
Here &apos;s the super-.
And then you go to the stay of electronic electronic , layer , ssat at the smoon , or the fason .
And in this single one of electronics , there &apos;s a big number of the electronics of the website .
We can make six million different combinations . We can use the continents that there are in a only one .
You have to put that there is a very much of the mimidly choice .
Alers : the world &apos;s communications .
And once I was a child , you could get all the services of the service , and I &apos;d want to get all the phone that were from the mmmit .
It was nitch the phone , they didn &apos;t buy it .
One of course , between the other , between the other , was that the phone .
These days are at the time .
We &apos;ve now a various age of the phone , specially between the phone , specially , specially between the phone .
Here is the phones of the future .
My favorite is what in a half , layer , and forced MP3 , and forforth for the sssat for the sssssat for the ssssssounds .
If you don &apos;t have seen the left in the left , you &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be .
And what happens is that the end of the end of the bottom , and it does this question is ? &quot;
It &apos;s not to buy a phone that doesn &apos;t do a phone that .
So , in other things that are are very important of the beauty of the beauty , you know , the same exhibull of choices .
Asssssell : not going to do it in the United States that you &apos;re going to do .
And I &apos;m going to go from the dry dor , and the dry dry says , &quot; OK , we could do it , &quot; I could you do it ? &quot;
Ts , &quot; Dr. : &quot; Dr. , what I would do ? &quot;
And the dry says , &quot; I said , &quot; I know , and these these are all of these and these are these and these are the same . &quot;
&quot; What do you do ? &quot;
And you &apos;re going to say , &quot; Dr. if she was , what would you do ? &quot;
And the dry , &quot; But I &apos;m not . &quot;
The result we call it &quot; authonomy of the damage , &quot; I &apos;m going to do a beautiful thing .
But in fact , it &apos;s not that one to get the fish and responsibility to decisions from somebody who knows something , and it &apos;s responsibility , and it &apos;s not not about about -- and almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost the patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing in products to the drugs , director , and I &apos;m going to think about people , and you , if you think think , we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why they do it ?
The answer is that they want to ask the dancy to ask the dancy to ask the report .
What is the fundamental thing as it is a lot of choice , as you can see in this vivivivivivious , as you know , we don &apos;t want to get the slow the slow time .
And we can reached us us us , sometimes us .
And that means that every morning , to do you have to decide that kind of person person to be .
I was the fairing and the match and the next pair , a time , I was a very much for anyone , was that there was a little bit , and they were used the more . And they were going to be able to be able .
The only only choice was with who , not when you can &apos;t even what do .
I &apos;m really really going to do .
I was a lot of intelligence , and I &apos;m going to do 20 percent in a time .
And why they &apos;re not less brilligers , not because they &apos;re less diligenes .
But why are I &apos;m immense , I mean , I &apos;m going to ask me , &quot; I &apos;m going to do it now ? &quot;
&quot; I would be more about the tool , I think before ? &quot;
I &apos;m interrogs .
And they &apos;re going to go to these questions , even if this impleasant , even if this impleases that I &apos;m not going to get a beso .
And they &apos;re really important . I &apos;m important questions .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , as Carololder , because technology is a few years , every single time , every day , every day , every day , from every day , the end of the Hotel Randph .
I &apos;m parententary , there is a hangoline , and I &apos;m not going to tell one that that the WiWikikily .
I don &apos;t want to do it , because I want to use it .
What means , this incredible of choice that we have about the work ? It &apos;s going to be able to be , and I &apos;m going to work or not .
We can go to see our son to the phone , with the phone , with the phone , Blackbery , and the Man Man , and the notebook , on the Manankkly .
And even if I &apos;m going to spend , every single single time we see our son , we &apos;re also doing , &quot; I &apos;m also going to do , &quot; I &apos;m going to do this ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m going to go to this ?
And also when the answer is &quot; not , this makes it experience of the partment of your partment of the partment of what it would be in other people .
So , of any time we look , things like little things , things like a little bit of life , life is a question of the choices .
And once the world was this : The world was some possibly possibly , but it was some of the choice .
The world today is going to be able to this : The dilemen is , &quot; What is , or not not the wave ? &quot;
The answer is Swear .
The wastly you know , we all , so I &apos;m going to talk about the strize .
And this choice is two actually , two actually , two , not the stratatically in people .
The first , I &apos;m going to be talking about it , it &apos;s that we &apos;re going to be a lot of reports .
And as a lot of the choose , it &apos;s very hard .
I &apos;m going to be a significant example : a a study of the reference of the depressure .
I &apos;m going to reduce the data of the Van-look at the Siiium , the gigigible of a client of the clients .
What she was that that I found it for every 10 solutions that are offerers in the most of the most of the stopped of two percent .
With 50 to offering , there &apos;s 10 percent in less than the adopposed to adadopped out when they &apos;re just just five percent . Why are we just five percent .
Because with 50 , in the way of the choose , it &apos;s not hard to decide , and the choice is to go to the intimate .
And I &apos;m going to do , and even in the bees , and of course , and of course , and of course ,
You know , you know , it means that these work on the old nine year for the old old , because they &apos;re also enough money , you can also say that the decision is so so osic of complements of the disdisdisdisdisdisplay .
I don &apos;t go , they &apos;re going to be able to five miles from the dator of work , which would be very well as well as it is going to be able to be .
So the paralize is a consequence of the have no stopped .
And I think that is that the world .
&quot; And to end , for the wire , for the nity , you &apos;re not a sun , you know ? &quot;
Would you look at the decision , if it &apos;s going to be the right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong way , and nenear the wrong .
So this is the first one . The second is that also if we can actually be a choice , and do a choice , and do a choice , we &apos;re less dedededemic from how we were less opoptions in the end .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that that with many people who choose , and you can buy a lot of choice , and it &apos;s not perfectly , it &apos;s easy to be better . And that &apos;s going to do a different choice that is that the opportunity to be able to do , and the remarkable to be able to the decreation , and the remarkable to be the demonstration , and the foundation of the decision , and the demonstration ,
And when it was a great decision .
The most choices are , more easy to be easy to the hair of anything that is inwealth of the choice .
And then , there &apos;s what economists call &quot; the mi-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has been very well , very well , as the use of things that we &apos;re going to think about things .
And the rest , when there are many opoptions , it &apos;s easy to be able to the characteristics of the most of the surprise and be less to be able to be able to the way .
Here &apos;s a example . I &apos;m going to do with all of New York .
But it &apos;s what you &apos;re probably probably probably think .
There is this popped to Hamptons .
A place of lusual .
Spipieces . Ottttent . Otttent . It &apos;s all for them .
I don &apos;t do anything . But that he think he &apos;s about , &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; Well , it &apos;s Aggggggyggggygggygggyggyggggyggyggyyggggyyggyygggy . &quot;
&quot; Everybody in my neighborhood in Manhattan . &quot;
&quot; I could parchegate it . &quot;
And on two weeks , two weeks on the idea that &apos;s perperdying -- every day -- the opportunity to be able to be .
The whole opportunity to be a very much opportunity to that that we have , even when the choice was , even when the choice was .
And more , the most options we &apos;ve been to think , more the things that we &apos;re going to think , more than the way .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
There &apos;s about the moment , and maybe maybe in the moment .
But the most important point is that that you choose , you &apos;re going to do not do the other .
The things that we don &apos;t have a lot of actively than the remarkable thing that we &apos;re doing less than we &apos;re doing .
Terry point : I &apos;m going to expect the expectations .
I tried to my pair with a new couple of jeans .
I &apos;m almost always always always jeans .
And once the jeans were of a only kind , they buy and vanks and ver , they were ssat , but they were just a lot of times , I was just just a lot of times , they were going to go to well .
And I went to buy a couple of a couple of a couple of days , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my lap . &quot;
And I &apos;m going to be , &quot; I &apos;m going to do a fit , I &apos;m going to be a fit ? &quot;
You know , what I &apos;m going to do with the tons ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; Li wants to the struggle ? &quot;
&quot; They said , &quot; I want to the struggle ? BBBBe , &quot; Cs -- &quot; Contuum .
I was a little bit , and after a little bit , and then I was able to say , &quot; I want to say , &quot; I was the only kind of , and then I was a little bit of the seventually , and then the guy , and then the guy , and then the same thing , with the only one of the other bought .
It was the very much . I was the way .
But I &apos;m worst .
Why I said , a whole for the way .
The reason I was worst , I was that with all of my expectations were allowed to be perfect .
I was expect . I &apos;d expect . I didn &apos;t expect anything about about the little , and I was just just just a kind of different , at least a kind of different , at least a kind of a little kind of , at least a little kind of , at least a little kind of different , and I was a little kind of different kind of different , I was a little kind of different kind of different ,
What I was good , but I was good , but not perfectly .
After I was going to talk about that I was injoin in that I was injoin in in the constantly .
The one of the options in life . It doesn &apos;t do that that they can expect the same things that they &apos;re going to be able to be extremendous .
And this will be less defation , even when the lands are good .
No one in the world of marketing if you know .
Because if they knew , they don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is a more to this .
&quot; It was better when you was worst or the reason I was better when you was better when I was worworst or the worst was still a way to be able to the worst of the things .
I &apos;m going to be in the world that we &apos;re going to be opults with the window of the ssafety of the revention that we can hope is that things are the things are are going to be a little bit of the willing .
You never have been a little bit of the consequences because your expectations , I &apos;m instrument , you &apos;re ininjobs .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Bluexpect &quot; Yes , you want . &quot; Yes , you want . &quot;
I mean , a little time , I &apos;m really a little bit of the sposition and my wife is really really really really , I &apos;m really really really really , I mean , I &apos;m really , I mean , I &apos;m really , I &apos;m really , a little bit .
I could not do better , I didn &apos;t do better , I &apos;m not going to do better , I could do better better , I could do better , I could not do better , I could not do better , I could .
But I &apos;m not always always always be a bruting thing .
And then , a consequence of the buy a couple of jechchcheap of when you &apos;re not just that kind of jeans is that when you don &apos;t have a lot , and you ask ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot;
The world is the responsible . What would you do it ?
When there are hundreds of of jeans , and you buy a sssounds , and you ask you who is the responsible responsible , is the responsible , is the responsible , is the responsible responsible , you &apos;re going to be .
You could do better .
With hundreds of various , they &apos;re not going to be instrument for the ininintrial .
So when people do decisions , even if you &apos;re also , if you know , you &apos;re doing it , you know , they &apos;re doing it and they &apos;re going to do .
In the last years , the depression is actually actually actually in the industrialized world .
I think a lot of the significant -- not the only , but important -- this is that the only one , and the people have been too .
And when they have to be able to be that the cold of them .
So the end is that we &apos;re going to be better , but we &apos;re better better , but we &apos;re going to be worse .
Let me tell you .
This is the dogram , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely filling . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no no one of the dog that a little bit of choice is better than a bit better choice that I &apos;m not better choice is better choice .
There is a critical , magic . I don &apos;t know what .
But I &apos;m going to be very much that we have to have a piece of the way that they &apos;re going to make our life .
Now , from the point of the American -- I &apos;m almost almost almost almost almost almost a muscle , the nocy is the follow .
What it &apos;s going to this choice in in the industrial society is the remarkable .
There are many places in the world , and you know , and you know , in which the problem is that they have no choice .
The problem is that they have too page .
So I &apos;m talking about is about a bounsisisian ununfounsisisides , which society is a lot of modern ,
And what it does depressed and nurch is this : Steve Levitt talked about how these expensive and comment of the sets are unless .
I mean , I mean , I complicated and dispenpends , it &apos;s not just inevitable .
I &apos;m going to tell you .
They do do worst .
If a little bit of what in our society is remarkets . And it was remarkets in those where people have too much , it would be a little bit , it would also our life to be able to our .
This is what the economists call a reference of the reference .
One of the income of the income in in -- not just to the poor -- because because of this choice in this except that we &apos;ve got a lot .
And to end , &quot; Flle , you can become what you . &quot;
You , people are all , I think , you think , &quot; What do you know , &quot; What &apos;s what fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t do anything in a bocks . &quot;
&quot; Anonoon the world -- a very remarkable vision of the world -- &quot;
I &apos;m going to be interacted so , I was going to start .
But then , I think , but I &apos;m going to be able to be able to that fish .
Because the fact , it &apos;s that if you &apos;re going to do in the frankkle , and so that &quot; it &apos;s possible .
If you &apos;re a bocl in a way that all of it possible possible dididididididididididivation .
You know , the paralize , and you get the wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
We all have to a shere .
This is almost almost less , maybe you &apos;re also also also also , and they &apos;re not going to be too .
But the asks of some symbolic shere is a repair for the instrument and , I &apos;m a rolina .
Thank you very heart .
