The last year I showed these slide slide slide to show that the calm of the artics of the artics of the 48 , which for almost three million years , the size of the 48 , the size of the 48 .
But in the way , you have the gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the spessor of ice .
The artics of the artics of the global global global global .
It &apos;s expands .
The next slide will be a requires to be a revenue revenue of the last 25 years .
The layers are signed in red red red .
As you see , you &apos;re going to see , you go to the blue scape .
That &apos;s the ice in inverse , which you &apos;re ritioning in summer .
You can see that the costs of the ice , five years , of five years , and it &apos;s like the blood , which is the blood , which here fuorial , which is how the blood .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been from so .
This is a problem because the remarkable suit the land of the ground of the land where there are enormous amount of fuels , which , soulder , they &apos;re transformed in the microbes .
I &apos;m going to the totalalth of the ination of the global warming , which is doullloud , in the end of the way of not around .
In a few lagues in Alaska metan of Alaska metan .
The professored Katey Walter of Alaska team of Alaska team of Alaska team in the bottom .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : The question is if we &apos;re going to be .
A reason is that this exist termal surfacfaced the Groenland from northerthertherwise .
This is a bunch of regimes .
The one has never ever reached the brains .
This is the Kangerern Kangern , in the sovest of Groenland .
If you want to know how the level of the sea for the sea loulder on the ground , you &apos;re where the sea .
These are increases increasing .
On the other part of the planet : Antartide , the most big blocks of the planet .
The last month , the last month , the bills of the ice is in negative negative , and the Anyestern Anyyestern , which pogy on some ishes of some ishal ium in the soulloser .
Equival six feet of the actual actual actual actual , as in Groenland .
Suli Himalaya , the third largest blocks , you see new laghi , which few years ago , which few years ago ,
The 40 percent of the world &apos;s population of the water potential of the water .
Sulle Ands : This loulder is the source of water .
The ported is increased .
But when it deminures , the same happens to water .
In California , the nnow of the Sierra Nevada is deminuded of 40 percent .
The bones are in the crisis .
The pretions , as you read , are gresses .
The growing growing growing in the world door to a remarkable remarkable .
The disasers are increasing out of a normal ritual and without the normal .
Four more more more than the last 30 years of the first 30 years of the time I &apos;ve been in the past 30 years of the first 30 years of the first 30 years of the first 30 years .
This is a remarkable remarkable .
If you look at the context of the substance , you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we add 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every 24 hours .
Look at the area of the Pacific area , from the Americans , in the Americans , and both both both of the parts of the subcontinent , where there &apos;s a radical adical adversus in the ocean .
The most of the global warming , together in the deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of combustible combustible .
The oil is a problem , and the fuel is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with more emissions , together in China .
And it was proponed to build a lot of other central central central .
But we &apos;re seeing in a direction of the direction .
These are the projects annullayers in the last years and some of the alternative of the alternative .
In every way , there &apos;s a political lain in our country .
The industrial industrial and oil have speso 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the fuel fuel fuels , which is a symptoms .
That was the image of me ,
I know Natal , in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a loss of 3.8 billion lights .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen on the news .
This is the most big flection of the flow of the flow in America .
It was happened around Natal .
The public advertissue of the industrial industrial industrial .
Video : The most of the carbon is just a kind of a very very happy and happy .
It &apos;s abunant here in America , and it &apos;s grow our economy .
First of the carbon is always more pulit .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and the work of the people are repended .
Al Gore : The most of the West Virginia .
The larger society is Massey in the mountain is Massey Coal . This is its administrator .
Video : Mr. Blankenship I &apos;m going to be clear -- Al Gore , Harry Reid Pelosy -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clim &apos;s Clim has launched two campaip .
This is a part .
Video : The Attore : The ALergy of the climate change as a serious mines to our business .
For this our priority is to invest a big amount of money in a very high amount of money in a public public and confused the truth .
In fact , the fuel is not sports .
We think it &apos;s a good profumb -- it &apos;s also a profumo .
So not preprerrates of climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : The CCCC. Carbone -- you &apos;ve heard about it .
So let &apos;s do a around a system to the structure of the weird wealth for how the fuel fuel .
Straordinarily ! The machines are a little rumorose , but this is the sound of the fuel technology of the fuel .
The consumer is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology , but the remarkable technology of the fuels that you see everything .
Take a look at : this is the odiern technology of the fuel fuel .
Al Gore : Inend , the alternative of the most of the economic issue and the most security of the nururity .
Video : The America is in the economy , the nururity , the nationally , the climate crisis .
The philos that connected all of the : our dependence of our dependence , as the fuel fuels and the oil imported oil .
Now , yet , there &apos;s a new , audace solution for used circle .
Reable to America : 100 percent of energy , in a few years .
A plan to reach America , to make us more sure , and to stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that basts to solve our problems .
It &apos;s going to be . Scoprite of the more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It &apos;s about it is to reach energy to America .
One of the faster ways of the faster of the dependence of the repeak that killing our planet .
Comparking : The future is here . I feel , a new energy .
Comparent 2 : Neggs investing for work well well ,
The second thing : Rey America . It &apos;s time of being realists .
Al Gore : A old old bull , which is , &quot; If you want to go fast , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
If you want to go back , you go together . &quot;
We need to go back , fast .
Thank you very much .
The last year at TED I did an introduction on the LHC .
And promise to reach to reach you to go back to how it works .
So , the way , and for those that the other time , the LHC is the most scientific experiment that we &apos;ve ever tried -- 27 kilomers of circles .
His is reach the conditions that were less than a billion ardespite of the beginning of the universe -- until we start to 600 million times in the beginning of the universe .
That &apos;s just environmental .
This is the machine under Ginevra .
The first of these mini-Big Bang inside the rights .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- is largo and she has a diameter of 24 feet .
This is an image of ATLATLAS in the building so you can see the proportions .
The 10 10 years of the last year we &apos;ve got the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLATLAS .
It was because of immense of the intear of control .
It &apos;s an image of the first fascinating particles that had all the around the LHC , in the LHC , and the particle of the LHC , and spread particles in the webC , and spread particles in the rights .
In other words , when we see that image the 10 10 ember 10 , which is a big vast 10 , which is a big vitten vessory .
I don &apos;t know if it was to do that exposed to us more or this , when someone went on on Google and I saw that the page was this .
What means we have had a cultural impact on the scientific scientific scientific .
It was a week after , there was a problem with the machine , had to these films .
These films ms take 13,000 ampampate when the machine works works at the way .
Now , the technical technical of you look at the phils and they &apos;ll say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . &quot;
And instead of them can do it because when they &apos;re very cold to be depended the superconditions .
So , at least 271 degrees , to a nurge temperature in the space between stars , these films can bring that current .
In one of the giant of the most novemile in the LHC , there was a difer of the LHC , there was a difer .
So the phililils surfaces , and the 13,000 ampampal resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think these magnees are more than 20 tons , and that you have been moving about 30 centimeters .
They &apos;re damage about 50 magnear .
We had to task them , what we did .
We have repristed and reports .
They &apos;re now now now now now they &apos;re going to go back to their subject .
The end of the LHC will will be new integrated .
We &apos;re going to go , and we expect to get the data to jugging or the loster or the lands of which are the morning that we have the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents requires the dibags on the value of science and the engineering of the engineering .
I think the fact that &apos;s so hard , the fact of the fact that I think is the value of the things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of a scientist in the words of a Inglese Humphrey , which I guess , in the initional initional inutionary , his puzzle was the Michael Faray , &quot; No , Nious is a lot of dangerous , is so dangerous for the progress of the defined .
Thank you .
I want to start to start to ask the obvious of when children , you &apos;re playing with the morning .
While you know how to reach them and they get them , and they learn them , and they learn how to think and to find them , and to resulting them and can can be able to space .
The space is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , by the inspired by useful usually our interaction with physicists , together at my Pacts , and the collaborator of my collaborator , and the collaborator Jeevan Kanii , I started to have a computer , instead of having a computer , instead of having the mouse as a pass of the mouse as a pass of a digital mouse as a pass , and the way to a little bit ,
and it &apos;s a pleasure ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Sifty computer computer interactive computer as a biscanning biscankly .
In a few words , a Sifty computer computer interactive computer as a biscanning biscankly .
You can move to the hand , they can see the hand , you can see , &quot; in their feel , and they have a radio screen and a radio radio .
But especially , are physicists , as the morning , as the morning , you can move simply .
The Sifty is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physicists , confires of the other movement , and as as they become more physicists , and as as they become more physicists , and what we can move , we can explore new and fun of interaction .
I &apos;m going to try to be a few example .
This Sifty is configurate to show video : if you incline it in a direction , the ropping video , if you &apos;re going to get on the other side .
These remarkable interactive are conconfires of other .
If you know , they &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re interested in .
If they &apos;re circircles , you can see it and they can agree a little .
If they &apos;re circircles , you can see it and they can agree a little .
They have to get their movement and inclination .
We have to realize that one of the interesting interesting implications of interaction was the able to use of the data , to example , &quot; a color as if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Sifairs as a certain certain of the versus of the color in the central color in the central color , where you &apos;re going to get .
and I can use them to put them on the central color , where you &apos;re going to get .
If we &apos;re too , we can put a little bit bit .
And I &apos;m also becoming the possibility of the lingue , like the mathematics and logical games where people can try to try things , and see the results .
I &apos;m ...
This is a sequence of the Fibonacks that I do with a equations .
Here we have a words that is in half of the Scarabeo and Boggle .
It &apos;s basically , to every every time , you know , in every Sifty , in every first time , in every single one of the case of the Sifty , and as you try to understand the words of the Should you take a ditionary words on a dionary .
And then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new set of letter and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the children came in in the Media Lab , I made in a way that I tried to make them a video .
They &apos;re like to them .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of applied application is that you don &apos;t have to give people many intions .
You just say , &quot; Compons of words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s another people who try .
This is our own moon the most young young , there in the right .
And it was just wanted to improve them .
They were just morning , for him .
Now , this is an apapart of a carrying interactive .
We wanted to build a tool for the apetry of the ling-a-Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , by by the Sifty them .
It can put new characters in the scene , by by the Sifty them .
Here &apos;s , it &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : The sun is slow .
David Merrill : Now he took a treat the scene .
Video : The arrange .
Bellow work !
So , you shouting the Sifty and put them into the characters can make the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- by by inventing your story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a story with final final story , and it can decide him like a sell .
DM : It &apos;s a story with final final story , and it can decide him like a sell .
Video : Vola forth .
DM : The last example I have time to show you a tool , and I made a tool , and to make music .
It &apos;s a tool , to recent music , for the campaigment and to make music .
The Siflow here are sounds like the basic sounds like , the bacteria .
Ognal one of these four different variations , and you can choose to use .
You can also even even these sons in a sequence of a sequence of your pleasure .
And it &apos;s just doing it just touch a sound and a sequence . &quot;
These are actually you can control from the vivious , as the rivers and the philillion .
The acks to a particular sound and then they &apos;re incline for the reflying .
And then there are general , as the general time and volume , which they &apos;re apping to the whole sequence .
We look like it works .
Video : DM : We &apos;ll let &apos;s take a base in two Siftable , &quot; we put into a series , we put in a series , we add another base .
Now , I &apos;m going to put a line .
Video : DM : Now , I add some of percussions --
Video : DM : And I &apos;m going to put the phililillion , so I can control the effect of the effect .
Video : DM : I can &apos;t think the entire sequence of the entire sequence of the whole sequence of the other side .
Video : DM : And now I &apos;m going to add the bottom to the bottom for the most expression .
Video : DM : I can reach the sequence of the sequence . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have planning it before , but I can suddenly , it &apos;s more or more corportion .
And now , I can end up the entire sequence of the entire sequence of the inclining the left Sifairly . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new interfacing interfacing the most of how they work our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this perperformed , and also some possibility that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmitting the new generation of objects design design design for interact with digital media media digital media , which will be information in our world .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the now of you all of you .
I &apos;m a scritice .
I &apos;m going to talk about the profsion , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the fascinating of my life .
And I don &apos;t know what it can change .
But , he said , something that was happened in my life and in my career , which has to me to reef the whole relationship to this work .
The particular thing is I &apos;ve been written this book called &quot; Manate Manate , Prega , Am , Am , Am , Am , in which I was going to have a big sensational sensational sensational sensational sensational sensational sensational sensational sensational sensational interational .
And the result is that everywhere , people who are treat me like if I was conducted .
It &apos;s true -- he was , conducted .
They &apos;re going to me now everybody worried and say , &quot; You don &apos;t have the most of them to do ?
You don &apos;t have painting to write for all life without that we can be able to create a book that can be able to someone ? &quot;
which can you think about someone ? &quot;
It &apos;s rationance , you know .
But it could go to the worst of the most of the 20 years ago , when I started to say , I was an adolescent -- I was an adolescent .
I was going to go to the same reaction of the landscape .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you , &quot; Don &apos;t you have success ?
You don &apos;t have painting you kill you killed ?
You don &apos;t have painting to this moud of life without anything that nothing to come out and die on a cumb cumb bought to a cumb bing byouth of the boat .
So , you know .
The first answer -- the next answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
You have , I &apos;ve got all of those things .
I &apos;ve always had painting .
And I also have painting of many other things that people could not have to inary .
As the alge and other things are spacy .
But , for what I thought I was to write what I thought I would ask me , why ?
Is it ?
It &apos;s logic that anyone who has to be spaved by a job that you have been sent sent sent for it .
But what &apos;s there , in the implant implant to make us nervous health mental .
As my father , for example , he was a chemical engineering engineer and not remember one one time in its 40 years of activity in which asked if he had a painting ?
And it was never -- that blocks of the engineer , how do you ?
And it didn &apos;t work so , you know ?
Onestly , the engineers as a group don &apos;t have any of course , in the check , the reputation of being alcolization .
We have enough , we have enough this reputation , and not just just creative writers , but we have this reputation of all this reputation of being enormous instant .
And it &apos;s not going to look at the tristes of the magnification of the creative creative creative creative , which , only in the 20th century , they were young and often to them .
And even those who don &apos;t look at their dons are really disappeared by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before we die , in the last interview said , &quot; Every my book has killed me a little bit more , &quot; A extraordinary fascinating about the work of your life .
But we don &apos;t think about when we feel these things that we &apos;ve heard these things that we &apos;ve been completely interiorized and accepted the noon that that creativity and the art of the creative actual and the art , at the end , at the end , you &apos;ll get to the angoscccrisrisk .
And the question I want to take to all here is : I &apos;m interested in this idea ?
It &apos;s going to tell you that -- because it also look at the time , because it &apos;s going to me not good for anything that I can &apos;t mean for anything that .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s dangerous and I don &apos;t want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better encourage our big creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative .
And I know , I know , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be dangerous to start to the covered that I felt that I &apos;m in my career , especially you get the circumstances in my carer .
That &apos;s true -- I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;ve about 40 years .
I &apos;ve still about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that any thing I &apos;m going to be judicted by the world as the work that I came out after the spaving the world as the work .
I &apos;m going to be slaved , because we &apos;re all more or less , is likely that my greatable big success is to my spread .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that door a person to start to start blow in the nine of morning , and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I &apos;m going to continue to do this work we do .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it seems , after many of a lot of reflect , which is to work to write is what to create a psychological aries , OK ?
I had to find a bit of security , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural natural ange on which I &apos;m writing , and I try to get it to look at the last year models on how to do it to look through the time , trying to see if they could have have some of other societies .
on how to help people creative inerents to manage the inerents of creativity .
And that research has taken me to the ancient Great and the ancient Rome .
I &apos;m working on the circle and then I went back .
Nelil ancient Great and the ancient Rome -- people don &apos;t seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit of the bedying and that they come from a few people who who came to a few people and unknown , for reasons and unknown .
The greatest called these spirits look at the bees of the devices of the devices of the deones .
Soccurred , he believed to have a demand that elargive to have a devices from far .
The Romans were in the same idea , but they called the kind of spirit without a genium .
The one is great , because the Romans didn &apos;t really think a genium was a genium of intelligent particularly intelligent .
They think a genium was this kind of genius of divine divine that he could literally in the study of a neighborhood , a little bit like the ellow or , and that &apos;s a little bit like the way to see the outbreak of the work of the artist of the work .
Here &apos;s the distance of the distance of which is the distance of which is the distance psychological psychological .
And everybody knew that was so that they worked , right ?
So the artists were protected by certain things , like for example , like for example , like the too narcisism , no ?
If your work was excited , you could not take and everything the merge , all of the southern , all they were helped by this genium .
If your own failed work , it was not all your your own , right ?
They all know that was your genium to be a incapable .
And so the people who have to think the creative creative creativity in the West for a long time .
And then the Rinitial , and it changes , and they were all this big idea ; we put the human in the universe , and the mysters and without more to leave space , and not to leave space in the creatures that desk from the divinity .
This was the principle of humanth and people started thinking that creativity came to think that creativity came out of the hyddance .
And for the first time in history , you know , you know , and that artist in this or that artist as a genium that in a genium that in a genium .
And I have to say , I think that was a big error .
I think I think I lose someone , a simple person to believe that &apos;s like a reciplplant as the source , and the essence of all mysters , creative , unknown and the people of all mysters and etics and etics and etics a push or too much to give to the fragile the fragile that human .
It &apos;s like to ask someone to inate the sun .
It turns out of the ego and detains all these ingrestations .
And I think it was this pression to destroying the artists in the 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it &apos;s the question , and now ?
We can do it diversously ?
Magarards back to a more advanting human relationship and mystery .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can &apos;t use 500 years of the rational talk in a 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience that sold would be able scientific reventions on the notion of the notion of , insuit , you know , who they &apos;re going to get the people who are slow on their projects .
It &apos;s probably not going to convince you all of this thing .
But the question I &apos;d like to take is -- why don &apos;t you ?
Why don &apos;t you think about this way ?
Because it has more sense of every other thing that I &apos;ve ever heard to explaining the experating experating process .
One process that , as anyone who ever tried to do something -- so , basically , all here -- you know , you don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t know .
And , in fact , it can be completely paranorous .
I did this inate recent with extraordinary extraordinary poetest , which has been in 90 years , but that was a few years , but that was a little bit for all life and said that in his own own life and he said that in the Virginia , and I felt it was going to feel it , in the front of the landscape .
He said , I was like a frameous frorous froreous froreous .
And that was going to go to her from the landscape .
It felt it was going to be , because he could could be able to the land under his feet .
He knew that I had a single thing to do that point and was of , words , &quot; Sweet as a match . &quot;
And it was going to go to the house and it was used to this little little bit of paper and a piece of paper and a piece of paper and a piece of paper and a long long long long , and it would be on the page .
Sometimes I couldn &apos;t be fast , so corries and corries and corries and corries and the corries of the roled and she would continued to go through and she would continued to go through the landscape , trying to be , as she said , &quot; another few . &quot;
And then there were those times -- this piece of that I &apos;m going to be -- there were some of the moments that was almost lost , OK ?
So , it was going to go to home and the poetry and the poetry and the poetry and the poetry and then he said , which was like , and then he said , which was like if you hallunged with the other hand and the office .
And he was the poetry from the code and the transced in his body and transcated on the page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be presented on the perfect page and the contrary , and the contrary of the first word .
So when I felt that -- it &apos;s pathesk , it &apos;s exactly exactly the ugual process .
Not all my creatures -- I &apos;m not a conductor .
I &apos;m a sweet , and my way to work is ; I sweet on the same orary orary , every day and suit .
But I even , in my testestation , I &apos;ve strised against that what , sometimes .
And I think that many of you the han made .
You know , even if the work and the ideas were going to come from a certain certain source of them .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we do it in a way to do not lose the head , but , rather , which is a little bit of us ?
For me , the best example , the most example of the most example of the musician , which I &apos;ve interviewed in the moment .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the most of the most of life was the insurance of the neighborhood , trying to control , to control , and we &apos;re looking at these species of actual actions .
But then I &apos;m going to inveck , and a day as he was driving on a becoming in in Los Angeles , changes all of it .
And he was going to go back and everything of a little framework , which is a little framework , which is in its head as inspiration , and you know , and the check , and you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the desider , but it doesn &apos;t know how to take the .
It doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a bunch .
So I started to feel this kind of old , you &apos;re going to grow in him like , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and I hell up with this song of the way of this song of even even ements .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t get it . &quot;
And instead of go to the panic , you &apos;ll stop .
I &apos;m going to mit . And he did something completely new .
I &apos;m going to look at the sky and said , &quot; I &apos;m not going to see that I &apos;m going to drive ? &quot;
&quot; Ti seems to write a song ?
If you really want to get , you know , you know , you know , you know .
Altrain , you &apos;re going to be able to take something else today .
I &apos;m going to disturbing Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his work works in the work of this .
Not the work , the work was still hurse as always .
But the process , and the fish was that attempt that was a genium that was a genium , the genium that outside he was the genium of him , and I came back to where it was that they had to be a thing that you don &apos;t have to be a thing that they didn &apos;t have to be a thing that they had to be a thing about interhorized what the genization was that .
but it &apos;s not this peculiar , wonderful bizzero-bizero-sum and this straight thing that but it wasn &apos;t Tom .
So what I felt that story to change a little bit of change a little bit of the way I work and I &apos;ve been saved .
This idea , I was going to save when I was writing , Prega , Am , and I fell in a cave of those cave of those cave of the disperation that we &apos;re working on something and we can &apos;t have to think that &apos;s a disaster , which is what the workment is that &apos;s going to be a book book .
Not just just good , right the worst book .
And I started thinking about gecting this project .
But then I remember I was in the air and I try .
So I got my face on the manoscritical manost and dederess my comments to a vast ast ast ast ast .
And I said to high , &quot; Sents , what , both of all of them , both of them , and what if this book is not going to be interly .
Because I &apos;m like I &apos;m going to put all of what I have , I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want to be , you have to presented and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t know what , you know , I don &apos;t know what , I don &apos;t know what I don &apos;t know what I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m going to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to like that I was been presented to me for my part , &quot; Because the end is so , OK -- the end is so , OK -- let &apos;s in the most of the North Africa of the North of the North of the dance of the dance of the dance , and the sacred music that they were on the alyyer and to the although .
And they were always magnifallerin the ballerini were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every single , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became actually transcending .
And I know what you know about what you &apos;re talking about it , because I know that you &apos;ve seen , in a sense , a performance .
It was like the time , you stop , and the ballerin the middle of the portal species and it was not doing anything else from the usually , as 1,000 notes , and everything was that , but everything you would see it .
And suddenly , you don &apos;t just like a human .
But it &apos;s accounted by the diagnosis in the divinity of the divinity .
And when this happened , I was in the time , the people knew what was , called the name .
They were always going to be in the hands and they started dying , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , God , &quot; God , &quot; God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curious notice -- when the Mors invased Mors invased the sud of Spagna , I was this abitude with their and the ready in the lah , Allah , Allah , Allah , &quot; in &quot; Ole , &quot; I can still feel in the corries or in the flamenk .
In Saign , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , the Olah , the way , &quot; unless , &quot; unable understanding , &quot; insible , &quot; unable , &quot; unable , &quot; unable , &quot; unable , &quot; Human , &quot; Humh , &quot; I &apos;m going to be able , &quot; Alah , &quot; Humh , &quot; Alah , &quot;
And it &apos;s great because we need .
But , the problem comes the day , for the same time , when you see you sell and find that are the 11 of the morning of Martedday and I see the God of Martedday , there &apos;s no more .
It &apos;s just a mortle with a lot of bad ginockey , and maybe it can &apos;t even more to each althezza .
And maybe nobody will be the name of God again as a lot of God , and so what it has to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most payers to do in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so angosciant if you can &apos;t believe , first , which the most extraordinary expect , which the most extraordinary you .
But it &apos;s just a lot of the data in the time , you know , in a sense of the body of your life that you have to get to someone else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think in this way .
And so I started to think , and it &apos;s sure that I thought about the different months in the work of the public book that I &apos;m going to get , dangerous , the dangerous dangerous , which is dangerous , and I &apos;m sure that I &apos;m going to think about my big dious .
And what I have to continue when I feel electric , I feel an electric .
You don &apos;t get you . It &apos;s just your work .
Continua presented you to your part , whatever it can be .
If your work is balling , you know , you know , you know .
If the divin , you &apos;re genium to you get a little bit of this wonderful wonderful thing , for a little kind of wonderful wonderful , for a moment through your forforces , then &quot;
Altreme , you do the same dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot;
I think we have to teach it .
&quot; Ole ! &quot; to you know , even only for you had a human love and testestation , and testals from you to presenting .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects on the human genome , on what can significant and new new genome .
We &apos;re starting a new performed : we started to digitize biology and now now now to digital code , we &apos;re going to start to a new phase of biology , design and synthesize and synthesize .
We always tried to take the big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists I think they have tried to understand vary varararies .
We tried different different different , reduced us to the minimi terms .
We &apos;re looking at almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome had to move from the analogical world of the digital biology in the digital world .
Now , we can do we do that , or create new life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasm , which is the species from genitalium , which is the species from genome , which can authoreplicitation .
And we tried to reduce the genome for a genome to create a little little .
We &apos;re able to eliminary a hundred genetic geneel of the 500 .
But when we look at its map , it &apos;s relatively simple to our maps , it &apos;s relatively easy to our .
It &apos;s easy , this is easy .
But when we look at all the genes that we can get to the time , it &apos;s very impossible that this can bring a living cell cell cell cell cell .
So we decided that the only one on the only design of synthesize this chchromosome in a way of poterne to get some of these questions .
So we started the avure of the we can synthesize a chchchromosome ? &quot;
Can &apos;t we can see the chemical chemical chemical chemical chemical that we can never do before ?
And , in case , we can do work a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemical material .
The speed of which we can digitize life is growing on the life is growing to the exponential ritual .
Our ability to write the gene gene code , instead , designing , but it &apos;s better .
And our most recent results the reports of a curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process has been required , so many of the review of bioethical review before we start the first experiments .
But we &apos;ve found that synthesize DNA is very hard .
There are thousands of thousands of cars in the world that producing little segment of DNA in the long chasks of 30 to 50 letter and is a degenerative process : the most errors are .
So we had to develop a new method for assembling these framments and correducing the errors .
And this was our first attempt , to start by digital genome of Phi 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills .
We designed the framments , they were actual correction of errors and I got a molecule of DNA about 5,000 letter .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material and we put it in in bacteria , and we put it in the bacteria , the bacteria have started to read this genetic code and make the viral particles .
The virals were virals , and then they were reduced by cells , they &apos;re back and they destroying the Emmmits .
I &apos;ve talked about recent with members of the oil industry that they have certain of them that they have certain composted this model .
They have more than you have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where software can really build its own own hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the most great things in the big things .
We wanted to build the whole chromosome .
They &apos;re more than 580 mile code .
So we thought we thought of build it in the size of the viruses of viruses , so that we can change the casses of a cell cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the ararms was about a error for every 10 migrain .
We found , we found , 30 errors . If we had the original sequence . If we had that original sequence .
One part of the process is design segments that you &apos;re looking at the 50 letter to 50 letter to 50 letter to build more little little little little little little little little bit that work together .
We start elements on the unknown .
You can see you read that we put in the ligrant .
Think of it : We have a gene genetic code on : A , C , Good and Take .
Those of those letter to mit together , they &apos;re about 20 amminods , and there &apos;s a specific specific order to each amminoid .
So we can use the gene gene to write , fracy , the thoughts .
What we did we did at the beginning was authograin .
Some of them have been delusers from the fact that was not very poetry .
We designed these seged seged these seged seged .
There are me that refed them and put them together .
And we started to assembling in the parts of the parts of five to seven mile to seven mile to seven mile to the bits of 24 mile , to 24 mile to their own time to get to 72 mile .
So , every step , we &apos;ve been produced these segments in abundance so that we &apos;re trying to create a very very very fast , very clever -- as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatically .
So , this seems the tabellon a lot of basket .
When we get to these segments very long , more than 100 mysti , it &apos;s not going to grow more directly in Emals .
It turns out the modern tools of the molecular biology .
So we &apos;ve been looking at other mechanisms .
We knew another mechanism called an ination unbelieved biology , which in biology , which in biology , in biology , which is to rebuild the DNA .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinocate , it can be an unless than the three million rad radiation .
You can see in the top of the top of how his chromosome came out .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s been reassembled exactly how before .
There &apos;s thousands of organisms that I can do it .
These organisms can be completely .
They can live under the vast .
They &apos;re absolutely absolutely certain life in space , and you feel slowly to find new environments .
In fact , NASA showed that this is .
This is a molecule image that we built using these processed processed , just using the lieventually appropriate design .
The lights assemble them .
This image was not taken with a microscope with electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a molecule molecule that we can see the microscope .
These are pictures that coat a period of six seconds .
This is the publishing that we did a little time ago .
They &apos;re more than 580,000 letter code .
It &apos;s the most big molecule structure ever created from the man .
It has a molecular molecular fuel .
If you &apos;re going to be a career to 10 without spaces , we would like 142 ppage only to transcation this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ? How can we do it ?
Of course , you get a virus is a game of kids .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria .
It &apos;s just just just as the cells as we can just get the nuclear cells like our : you can just get the nuclear nuclear and put another , which is basically the process of clonation .
In the bacteria , the chromosome is instead of integrated the cell , but we recovered that we can do a complete trapial trapial of a cell to another and a cell to another and a cell to another and actual .
We have puzzle a cromosome from a microbial species .
The two are different as the men .
We add some gene in the most gene way that they have to decide that to get to this chromosome .
And then it &apos;s sell with the exhired of the protein .
And when we put in the cell , the ice was studies -- and appreciate our graph -- and you &apos;re going to be in the cell .
And we were we we didn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried it anyway there .
This is one of the most of the most of evolution .
We found that tantisent species have add a second or a second , or a third chromosome from some part , and I &apos;m gence in a second thousands of performed that species .
So those thinks about evolution as a gene of the time that it doesn &apos;t understand a lot of biology .
And they have been called called &quot; I requires of the DNA of the DNA .
The chromosome was in the cell , it doesn &apos;t have one .
The phone -- the chromosome we have put it .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other chchromosome , the masticated , and we found with the cell and we found with only the cell cell and the new chromosome .
It &apos;s been blue because of the genes of genes we put .
And in a short short of time , all the characteristics of a species are going to be lost , and it &apos;s transformed in the new software , which we put in the new software that we put in the cell cell .
All protected the protected , the members are changes , and when we can see the gene gene code is exactly what we transfed .
Now , this may seem to be in genetic genetic software , but in the software can change the DNA stuff in a very very well .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that here is genesis -- but of progress -- but of the progress of evolution , and I &apos;ve already said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the explosion the Cambriana in which we can get new species on this process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s enough when we think about our need .
We &apos;re going to move from six billion and half billion in the next 40 years .
Right to give one example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one in the planet for each other .
We &apos;re now now now to find food , water and pulled , water and the pollls , and the wellin six billion and a half billion people .
It &apos;s going to be more dying to do it for nine billion .
We &apos;re going to start more than five billion bars , more than 30 billion bars .
That means percent of bars in the day .
When I call it to try to find biological processes , or any kind of process for repeak them , it &apos;s enormous challenge .
We have to keep all the emission of the CO2 emission of the CO2 emission of these materials that finds in the atmosphere .
At the moment , because of the scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the components for the future .
The electronic industry has only a dozen of the components , and think about how many different things are .
Our limits here are data , as well as the biological reality and our imagination .
We have techniques , because of these methods of synthesization , in able able able to create what we call genomics combinatory .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomosomes .
Think of the processing these 20 million genes of different genes or trying to get the processes to produce , new new vaccines , we can change , new vaccines , and create more biology now that in the last 20 years of the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a bunch .
We can choose for survival , chemical chemical producproduction or fuel , production of vaccines .
This is an antanea of some software programming software that we &apos;re working for being able to be able to sex us and design species to the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how they &apos;re going to be .
We know exactly what we know is their genetic code .
We &apos;re focused on the fuel fuel of the fourth generation .
You &apos;ve seen you that extract etanle from the grain was an experiment .
We have fuel of second and third generation that will use a year .
But the only way the biology can have a big impact without increasing the cost of the food and limlimits in the cost of food and the environment in matter that we &apos;re working for the energy in the matter of the food that can reach this goal , and we think we can achieve the first oil oil than we can reach the first oil .
The light slow low low of the CO2 is a metodownnnets -- but in our world , we found different metods .
This is an organism we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
It &apos;s going to be in the ocean , about 2,500 feet of the water .
They think of the CO2 using hydrogen molecular CO2 as a molecular energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can indownnal CO2 , which can easily be transported , converted that CO2 in the energy in the fuel .
So we can think we could be able to increase what the question is , what the question is , &quot; which is the real goal of the life is , we have the deserve of repet the entire oil industry .
Right . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can you do ?
It would come a main source of energy .
And we &apos;re working for the same method to create vaccines to create vaccinting vaccines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with influence , we &apos;re always back to a year and a dollar in less when you find the vaccine .
I think what you can change in anticiques .
Here &apos;s how the future could start seem to look at the time , now , the tree of evolution , and then we &apos;re going to look at the evolution of evolution with synthetc , and inend cells .
We &apos;re so much of the people .
Our goal is to do in a way of living enough to try to do it . Thank you very much . Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
So , before I &apos;ll see it , the most quickly possible , a few few work , the new technology that we took to the Microsoft in the way to a year . This is Seadragon . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s a kind of a local environment that you can interact is a huge amount of data .
Here we &apos;re seeing many many many gigabyte of digital photos with a kind of zoom and continue , for a fast panoramic , we have to the images like we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these are data or images .
Most of the digital photographs , but this for example is a dealing dedealing from the Biary Biary library of Congress , and reentrepreneur in the 300 megapixel .
It &apos;s not a difference because the only thing that you have the presents of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any moment . It &apos;s also a very flection .
This is a whole book , for example of data not .
This is Casa desolate of Dickens . Every colonna represents a caple .
So , to show you that &apos;s just kind of text and not images , we can do something like this , to see that &apos;s a real representation of the wild , not a picture .
It could be an artificial way to read a electronic book .
I don &apos;t have any of the one .
This is a most realistic example . It &apos;s a number of the West .
Every picture is the beginning of a seat .
And it really gives you a little bit of read the real version of a real charge , or a wspacy of a wider , which is for nature of a half of a middle of a middle of a middle .
We also made something with the angle of this particular number of the Guardian .
We created a public results -- very much more high than that you use in a normal normal normal , which is a normal normal normal , and we put it in the extra extrust .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to take the limits of space in the screen .
We use that this means that this means to the end of people and other porcheries like , I don &apos;t have to be needed .
Of course , the maps is a most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this field , if I don &apos;t want to say that we have to give you to this field .
These are all the strade in the United States soved image geosphere .
So now we &apos;re going to do something else .
This is actually from the web . You can go to the web ; you can go to see .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which fight two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research at the Noah Seadly , one of the University of the University of the University of the University of the Seitz of Middle Seitz of Mrosoft Research .
And it &apos;s from the web , I &apos;m going to the web ,
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can move from another image and have this kind of experience to requires .
But the space space of the images here has actually a meaning meaning .
The algoritation of the computer visualization of the computer , which is that required to the reals that you know , all the time you see in the lagues -- all of the time you see in the Montague Roccient : you see . Here &apos;s a few of a re-class , or or some things are all of the space .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other other environment .
There are a lot more space .
I want to move directly to one of the original data of Noah---prototype of the Noahahs that we &apos;ve done to work for the first time , to show you that that &apos;s really , to show you what I think is really the key to show you that technology , the Photosynth of the technology , the Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily just as much as we have to the environmental prototynal the website .
We had to worry about the legal aspects of the legal aspects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of the clower Nobody Dame . Badigital Flickr . Badigital Nobody Dame Flickr and you get pictures of these these things in the magazine , and you get some kinds of these arararnation and so on . You have a picture that &apos;s discovery .
So they &apos;re all pictures from Flickr and they were all connected to space space .
And it &apos;s possible to be able to this simplant way .
You know , I &apos;ve ever thought of I &apos;m going to end work for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very grationally grationally .
I think you see that is a lot of different kinds of different kinds of photocaming : from those phones of those phones in the professional numbers , and significant numbers , and in this environment .
And if I can try and try to try to look more struggle .
Many of them are blocks .
And in a few part of the photographs -- eccole .
This is a Nobody of Nobody who were correctly .
We can move from the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do with social environment . This is to take data from the entire memory , from the entire memory of the entire memory of view -- and the all of those data together .
All those pictures become connected together , more of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts .
You have a model of the whole thing that emerge .
Think about this as the prolungation of Stephen Lawler on the virtual Earth virtual Earth .
It &apos;s something that grow in complexity as the people are using it , and the advantages of the useful people are increases to use .
The little pictures are married with metaps .
If you &apos;re in the idea of contrast all these sweap all these skier , my picture of Nothing , my picture of Nobody , has no three Dame suddenly , you can use how to use of all those data , and I can use as a kind of ingrade in that space , in the space , using the picture of anyone else , and have an experience of the phones , and have an experience of the cross-moon .
Of course , a consequence of all the virtual models are virtual models , and they &apos;re not just sold by vivious vious photyelitarily , but from satellitary memory .
Mili .
Chris Anderson : I realized that ? What your software is that you have been doing is that at a certain point , in the next few years , all the photographs and share from anyone in the entire world will be very very connected together ?
BAA : Yes . What &apos;s doing is actually find .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , you want , between pictures .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content content of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about remarkable information searing information that many of these pictures .
As you do a research research on the web , you know , you know , you know , a frase and the text of the pictures .
Now , what happens if you get the picture of all your picture ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of remarkable interconnection , which is really enormous . It &apos;s a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really amazing . Complimits .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure when you travels and one of the delivers and a living in the husual of those antic research , who have depressed the antic of the newwire , and the needly the husband , the byyyyyzed , you can see it in the wind , you know , in the wind of the plants .
Bells to think that the Jaguar Jaguar , or the Lattea , or the mites of the most of the old old Inuit &apos;s still cold , or the most of the subject , or the most of the subject of Dharm , to remember the most of the most of the thing , but the idea that the idea of the most of the idea of the most of the idea of the world , but it &apos;s the idea that we can &apos;t have a sense of a sense of the way , but it &apos;s actually , but it &apos;s actually , in the way that we can &apos;t even even even even even even even even even ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stirpe made , well or bad , or not good , many generations .
And , of course , we all share the extremely exextremely .
We all have . All of the wild .
We are soulders of the beginning of the beginning .
We have to take the inexorability of death , so we don &apos;t surprising it and we let &apos;s see --
We all have an art .
What it &apos;s the particular ritual , the fact of the song , the ritual of the dance of every culture .
There &apos;s no matter that the Penan of the Borneo , or the following of the Voodoo &apos;s Voodoo &apos;s willing , or the guerriers of the desert Kaight in Kenya , or a Curander , or a cammellier , or a sell .
He was my company was my journey in desert a month ago , or a month ago , or a website in the values of the Womolanger , the dedea mother of the world .
All these populations are teaching that there are other ways of think , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of them in the world .
And , if you think a moment , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
Insian , the miriades of culture , the world of the world creates a spiritual and cultural cultural life that you want the planet and it &apos;s important for the well-being in the biological spread as .
And you can think about this instrument as a cultural spacy , and you can definitititation the total suit of all concepts , and inspired , ideas , inspired , and inspired , inspired , which is , inspired to be by the human imagination .
The etnoshere is the great cheap of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbox of what we are and what we can be in how species .
And as the biosphere was gravely consumed by the same same same as well as a very fast as well .
No biological , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all the species was or the clearly in the summer of the summer , or -- in the most of the intion of biological diversity -- and not not to get to the most of the biological diversity -- and not not to get a little bit more than the cultural diversity .
The thing is , of course , the perspective language .
When you were born . They were born 6,000 lingue on this planet .
One of the language is not compost by a vocabolary or a series of grammmmouse .
One of the language is the loud of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle of the way that the animor of every culture is the material .
Every language is a forest of mind , a bunch of mind , a thought , a thought , a spirituals .
And of those 6,000 ling-up , as we &apos;re sitting in Monterey , at least half half the children .
They don &apos;t teach kids , the case , the means that it means , less that I don &apos;t know something that I &apos;ve already death .
What &apos;s more tristes of being being in the silence , of the least of being the last talking about a language , of the way to be the letter or of anticipate or anticipate the promise of the children ?
This is a little bit of the state of any two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks , every two weeks , and door to their own own the ultims of a phananan-language language .
And I know , what someone else will say , &quot; Why don &apos;t it &apos;s better like that ?
The world would not be a better place if we talk about the same language ? &quot; Benisas we talk all yoruba . We talk about the canese . We talk about the cancanese . We talk about the same language ?
We talk about the kogs .
You &apos;ll find out of a bit what means means means means it not to talk to your language .
I &apos;d like to do you do a journey through the etnoshere --
a little journey in the hoshere to give you a little bit of what we &apos;re lost .
Many of us dedealing that when I say , &quot; different ways of existing existing .
We take for example , this bimbo Barasana , in Amazon the houbt , the people of anaconda , which believe in the midance of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the husbes .
It &apos;s a populations that &apos;s not able to distinguish the blue line because the blue green , because the time you can see the cold of the forest , which depends the people .
They have a language and a language and a bunch of the skills , &quot; exogy exogy , &quot; You have to sat a different language .
That &apos;s what it has been appreciate in the past mitological particles , but the particularly in these families , and summer when you talk about six or seven .
They &apos;re limlimited to listen and then they start to talk .
We take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived , Waorans of the Ecuador of Ecuador , a populations that had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 five measured measured miss a little bit of the bedying a similar error .
They made it down to the top photographed them in the top of the top of the rrying that rituals that that they have the people who have seen anything of the forest plual had never seen anything of bi-dimensional .
They &apos;ve been taken the pictures from the earth , they have to the research of a form or a form , and they don &apos;t find anything , they have been in the diavle , and they killed the five measure .
But Waorans don &apos;t killed the husbyesterday .
They killed between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by their same .
We &apos;re risalites in eight generations and we found two of natural death and when we have been been given to know , they put a lot of them was invected , and then they have killing it . And then they killed it . We had a very much of the forest . And we had a incredible knowledge of the forest .
The crisks were able to recognize the animal from 40 pass and recognize the species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was an income to a very interesting task for Harvard , I was in the Harvard , I wanted to go to Haiti in the basic secret of Duver and the Tonton Macococes and the Tonton Macacacactions of Dures .
For a sense of the miracolous way , I had to understand the Vodoudoo , and the Voodoo &apos;s not magic .
It &apos;s rather a complete view of the world .
Many interesting interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristian , Islam , Ebraism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , we thought that Africa is not not even even the religious Africa . And instead , and you can &apos;t . And instead , you don &apos;t have another that the distilled of these religious religious religious religious .
What makes interesting is the voodoo is the intense of life and death .
So the vivious they &apos;re going to go .
The spirits can be invocated by the Grands Actually , they respond to the ritual of the dance of the dance of the dance of the way that for a short moment that for a short moment .
For this the voodoooists to say , &quot; You &apos;re going to talk about God .
We have to go in the temple and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re going to go , is the spirit that you can do it ?
So you see and these incredible events : following voodoo in state of the trance that touch imimimimplant that touch a rather than power of the body in the body when it &apos;s the body in a very exciting of the body in a extremely excited .
I have all the people who have lived in the most extraordinary people who lived the most extraordinary Kogi of Santa Marta Santa Marta , in the Colombia in the Colombia in the Centrional entrional entrional sections .
And I think of the ancient civilization that once they live on the plant plant of the gency of Colombia in the instruments of the conquosopping the most of the volcanic charge , the instrument of the plant charge .
In a bunch of blood , this people who has never been conquisted by the spagnles .
In fact , I have been government from a clever , but their formation is so extraordinary .
The young people who took away from the families of three or four years , and they live secret secret in a good world , and they were in the bottom of the stone of the loss of the loss of the loss of the stones in the bottom of the loss of the loulls , and they live secrets .
Two years of nine years of the nine years of the willing nine months of gestation that translated in the modity of mother , now are metaphor in the Grands of Mother .
For this time , they are accultured to the values of their society , values that prevenues that their prevenues and only their prevenue , and they &apos;re just to say the equilibrium -- or to say the equilibrief .
In the end of this incredible initiation , they were suddenly to the first time in life , at the age of 18 years , and then in that moment . And in that moment of the first blocks , when the sun the sun of the first blocks , everything that they &apos;ve learned in a conference . The foot of the time is a conference . The worse of the thing .
&quot; Vist ? It &apos;s just like I said .
It &apos;s amazing . Now , it &apos;s about you protect it . &quot;
They call it most people who are called the most people and say that we , fratles , we are the colors of the world .
This is extremely important .
When we think we think of Indigene and the environment invoid Rousing , and the old story of the noble selection of the noble , which is a concept of the same as a concept of these people are more neighborhood , and we say that these are more more neighborhood in the Earth of us .
The Indies are not nostalks are not nostalks from nostaly .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the Asmat Asmat Asmat the vents of the Tibet , but thank you to the time and the rituals , and they created a mystery of the Earth &apos;s the concept of an extremely , but on a most most good intuition .
What does that mean ?
That means that a boat at the Ands of Ands that you can create a bunch of the Ands is a spirit of Apu that will be a deeply different and it will have a different way to a little bit more with the mountain or that &apos;s a little bit of Montana who grow a little bit of Montana who has a massive massive massive rock .
That &apos;s the dimitten of one spirit or a mineral is irrid .
What is interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between individuals and the natural world .
They grew up in the forest of Columbia Britannics believe that the forest they were going to be cut .
And I got a human human friends , and the bedying of my friends . Kwakikikiutl that they think the forest are the dimas the heaven of the paradise and the bal bal bal downnnal bal , which we &apos;re in the world , the dedededeed in the world , which we &apos;re in the Hamb .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create different different , you can start to start some of them kinds of things . We can do this plant . We have this plant .
I &apos;ve been taken this picture to aprile in the Amazon the West Amazon .
Maybe some of you have heard about the ayahuask , the most powerful psychoactive psychoactive psychoactive .
What makes it requires of the ayahuask is not the potential pharmacological pharological pharmacological .
In one side , this liant leavy of a little bit of the birth and hardly harmed , hardly , and hardly , and hardly , and hardly ,
And by by the only planted planted a bumb , and it &apos;s a little bit of the consciousness , but it &apos;s mixed with the filled of a caffic arts is saying ,
This plant has potents tripped , very similar to the seriotonin the seriotonin the seriotonin the serious methyllypamine .
If you ever see the Yanomami pulling on the nose ose ose ose ose ose ose ose ose ose different species , anchicky is a methylyllyllylllyllyllypamine .
Tirl that dust for the nose nose is a little bit like being disappear .
I &apos;m going to be often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has taken the beddying the time , with its discovery of the fungi in the &apos; &apos; &apos; 30 in Mexico .
I &apos;m going to my testing can &apos;t be classificate these tripamine as as you &apos;re doing , because if you &apos;re doing you &apos;re doing not to tell you any of being alucucinated .
It &apos;s possible to assume , even if you &apos;re just going to have a chemical chemical chemical chemical chemical chemical chemical chemicals that sevil MAO .
Now , it &apos;s the beautiful : the birth th th th th th of MAO , the same kind of MAO , of the same kind of the same kind of need to grow tripamine . The question is that &apos;s a 80,000 species of plants , as these people who are in this case of plants , and they have a twice . But if you have a chance of this way , but if you combined in this way , which is a little bit of the size of the parts of the size of the way .
We use the big eufemale and the error of the error , which can reveal stoptifer .
But if we ask the Indians , there will tell us the plants us to say , &quot; The plants are talking about .
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Copan , has 17 variety of the ayahuask , which distinguish neckkkkkkkly in the same species .
If we ask the question how they think of their tassonomy , we &apos;ll say , &quot; I thought , &quot; I &apos;m going to think of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of them .
The solution is : you get the 17 variety in a night of the lands of a letter and each other .
And I don &apos;t have graduate to Harvard , but it &apos;s very more interesting that content .
Now , in the same applausers , the problem is that also those of us who have to the heart people who have in the Indies of the Indies of the story of our real world , and they have to find out of our real world , and they get over .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it &apos;s going to be remember or its guerre or its technology , but as the time , but as the time we stop and we use it and we use it and have used to account or to the passionate mass of biological diversity and cultural cultural cultural diversity and cultural cultural technology .
All the cultures were involved in a dance for new possibility of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux has no stopped to be Sioux when they put it from part of the American American , they don &apos;t stop being Americans have been when they put on the hot and they put on the horse and they had .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that minds the integrity of the etnoshere . It &apos;s power .
The first first first of the domination .
And if you take a look at the world , you &apos;ll see that these are not destined to swealth .
They &apos;re living and dynamics and dynamics are living in exist from the existence of the exist of adaptment .
Sia , which is that you have disbosing in the Penan of the Penan --
a populated nomade of the Soulder , a populated , a populated , a populations that has lived lights in the forest to a generation , and now redated to the rights , where you can see the flow of the filled that you can see the filled the filled that it seems to be to be on the hasn Mar Clian , where the Chinese dional Mar CEEthththrows , where the west , where the west , and the war Mar Courth of the west , and the west , and , and the west , where you can see the lastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastast
Older to reempic the path of the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that have been in the discovery of the creatures of the ones .
If we put on the mountain of the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research research , you &apos;ll see the wall of the policy of political policies .
As you know the genocide , the expedition of a populations , it &apos;s conducted to universal level , but the etnocium , but the instruction of a people , not only is to be in the most of the style , but it &apos;s not not not not to be in the actual circles , because it &apos;s part of the development .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of the Tibet until you first .
I &apos;ve lost the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in China , in the West , in the West , in Lhasa bunch of a young connected , but only came to Lhasa few miles , but only came to Lhasa thing that we feel about .
6,000 monuments in the polls and slow .
1.2 million people killed the military military in the Cultural EEval .
The father of this guy was ascritical at the Panchen Lama .
The means that it was killed to the Chinese time of the Chinese invasion .
And I was in the Sua Santitity in Santititness in the diassua that has taken the people in Nepal .
And in mother , was unprisoned and his cold cold was being reverse .
It was taken to birth of the birth of two nose of two nose bought to her gonna .
The sister , which has been mitted in field of reeducation .
A day has been stopped up a little bit of Mao and , for this transgration , and , for this transgrsion , was mitted to seven years .
The pain of Tibet can be insopposable , but the spirit of the people &apos;s people in the people &apos;s tentener .
And in the end , all you reduced a choice .
We want to live in the monotic world or we want to get the policy world &apos;s policy or we want to get the policy of diversity ?
The big antropologist Margaret Mead , before we were trying to die , before we &apos;re going to go to this view view , in our our reports , not only we see the whole gamored of the human imagination . But a day we &apos;ll see the whole gamoring , but a day we &apos;ll give us to a certain certain certain certain certain certain certain certain certain certain of the other possibility .
And it &apos;s uliant to remember that our species is exist for 600,000 years .
The Neolitics , which we &apos;ve given us us us us us us in agriculture , which we made it socking up to the cult of the search of the sweet with the next of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has been 300 years .
That &apos;s the story of the story of the story that we have been in all the challenges that we have to get in the milllllands to come .
When these miriades of the world is asked what human , they say to be human , they say to be , they say with 10,000 vices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all all return the possibility of being what we &apos;re : a kind of aware , which we have to have all the people and all the gies of the people can fill . And there are big moments . And there &apos;s big moments .
I &apos;ve been taken this on the end of the north of Baffin , when I went to cover the Inuit , and this man , and this man , and this man , and this man , and this man , and I had to tell her the wonderful story of his grandmother .
The government doesn &apos;t have been gentile with the Inuit and in the year 50 to be able to be in our premate , we have to give them in the colonies .
The grandmother of this man refuted to go .
The family , I &apos;m going to keep all my life , and then all of his life , and all its expensive .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t have the cold cold , you know , the sweet .
The pushing colors in origin in origin in the spacts of weight .
The grandmother of this man didn &apos;t have intively made by the night or the byells , or the byells .
It &apos;s sweet on , you &apos;ve been hot the pantalons in the pantalons of focus and defecated in your hand .
It has been salive on the top of this cold cold , and when it became solid , and when it &apos;s solid , he killed a dog .
He has been employed and created a bridly chasks , and he created a slited slited a slitta , and it &apos;s swear on the bane , and it &apos;s sat .
We want to talk about horse with nothing ?
In 1999 , the 1999 , the government has reminded to Inuit &apos;s the total control of an area of the greatory area of California and Texas the Texas mellow .
It &apos;s the new check . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a Indipendent land . We know all the resources all the minerals .
One splendit example of how a natione-state state could rerererecilize with its people .
And , to finish , I think it &apos;s rather obvious to the ones of us was in these remote remote , and they realize that they don &apos;t have remote .
For someone is house .
They represent the seons of human imagination that they get the alba of the time . And for all of these children , as the sets of these children , as the sets of our children , they get part of the hope .
For the we have of National Geographic we have convinced that politicians don &apos;t get any year .
We believe that the polemics --
&#91; &#91; Applausers are not lost , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and maybe we have the best institution to tell the world &apos;s best institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month our website .
156 countries transmate our television is .
Our rights are lets from millions of people .
Our work is travel in the etnosynosphere to bring our public public in the middle of the cultural places that they &apos;re going to be in and , you hope , you can hope , you &apos;re hope , to be able to the central reveal in the central diversity , and we need to find a style in a world , and muralist and multically , and the ulticultical life and murtictical contication of life and the ulticals and the crisks and and and the ultictictically , and the curalyle in a life in a life in
where the saggees can all the people can contribution to our collective well-being collective .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope you &apos;ve heard and find out to find out some connections , in case , in case not notice .
I want to start what I call &quot; the dogram official dogram . &quot;
The dogram of what ?
The dogram of all the industrial society society , the most of the West dogram , the official official official is , &quot; If we want to have the well-being in the individual way to do it is the most of the individual . &quot;
The reason is , from one side , in fact that liberal is in the same value , is useful , useful , useful , usually for human beings .
On the other is in fact that if we are livvote to each of us can actually do everything that we &apos;re lifeels to do everything that we have , no one who decide in our own .
The way to stay the freedom is massive .
And there are more choices , more are lights , and more is the freedom , the most of them is .
This is , I think , it &apos;s so deeply adicated in the society that nobody would have dream of them .
And it &apos;s also deeped in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what the progress has resist possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not big particularly big .
I &apos;m going to put a simple note on the minds for instruments .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without contact 10 variety of olium older , and the 12 acets of older , and the 12 acets that you can buy for a huge number of the number of the most of the 175 .
Here &apos;s the supermarket .
And then you go to the electronic stuck , the lector , the lector , the lector , CD , CD , CD , CD , CD , CD , CD , CD , CD , CD , CD , CD , CD , CD , CD , the lector of the electronic stereo :
And in this single single store , there &apos;s a big number of audiences .
We can do six million different combinations using the components that there are in a only store .
You have to put there is a lot of choice .
Others : the world of communications .
And once , when I was a child , they could get all the phone services of the services of the mothers who are supposed to mitted mmelting .
They were born the phone , they didn &apos;t buy it .
One of that , in the other one , the phone was that the phone doesn &apos;t get .
These days are gone .
We have now now a needly various various phones , especially in the cell cell cell cell cell phone .
Here &apos;s the phones of the future .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , C3 , cut cuts up the birds of the birds , and forth for the chchchchchk .
If you don &apos;t have seen in the store store , you &apos;re very much of the house , you know that I &apos;ll get .
And what the end is that people in the store , and it does this question . And you know what is the answer ? The answer is &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a phone that doesn &apos;t have too too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are more important than the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as you can choices .
Assistence : There &apos;s no more in the United States that you &apos;re going to go from the doctor and the doctor you know what you have to do .
Instead , you &apos;re in the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do A , or you can do , &quot; In these benefits and these benefits , &quot; B has these benefits and these benefits . What do you want to do ? &quot;
Take the dums : &quot; Dr. &quot; Dr. , what would I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A has these benefits and these benefits , and these benefits . &quot;
What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebect , &quot; Dr. if she was me , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor : &quot; But I &apos;m not . &quot;
The result of the result of the most most people , expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But in fact , it &apos;s not a moving fish and the responsibility of the decisions of how you know , or something , and the doctor , to someone who knows something else , and almost certainly is not not to any of the ideal decisions , and so it doesn &apos;t know the patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing products , directly to people like me and you , direct to people like me and you , which if you think you think it &apos;s not a sense , when you think it &apos;s not buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why they don &apos;t they get them , because they don &apos;t use them ?
The answer is that they want to ask the doctor to ask the doctor to ask the requires .
Something that &apos;s like the most fundamental identity is a choice of choice , as you see in this vignant , as you can see in this vignant , you know , they &apos;re going to get the right now , &quot; we don &apos;t have to inventing .
And we can reinventing us how many many times we think we can reinventing us .
The means that every morning , to the risis , you have to decide that kind of person to be .
I got to the family and the matriage , a long time the perspective , a long time , and it was that you could get the most pressured more . And they were the most pressive , and they were going to be possible .
The only real choice was with who , and not even what to do after .
Opound , everything is really to play .
I &apos;m going to talk to students very smart , and I &apos;m going to do 20 percent in less work .
And not because they &apos;re not not because they are less diliant , because they &apos;re not less dilights .
but why do I &apos;m imprise , I mean , &quot; I would ask you , &quot; I would have to do it ? &quot;
&quot; I would have to sell me ? I think before the children or career ? &quot;
They &apos;re interrogative .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this implant doesn &apos;t complete the actual actual actual actual , and not get a good voice .
And they have to do it . They &apos;re important .
Now , the work : We &apos;re lucky , as Carl subject , because we use technology to work every minute , every minute , from every single day , from every day , from the Hotel Randoll .
I &apos;m talking about , there &apos;s a angoline , and I don &apos;t tell anybody what the Within , where the Within the Within .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use it .
So what means , this incredible liberal of choice we have about work ? It &apos;s that we have to continuously , and yet in every moment , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing with the phone , with the phone phone in a pair , the Blackberry in the other , and the notion , on the ginocococcurred , on the ginockey .
And even if I &apos;m all of the time we see our son &apos;s partnership , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; I said to this called ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m going to answer this email ? I &apos;m abbox ? &quot;
And even when the answer is &quot; no , &quot; All this makes the experience of your son very different child from what it would be in other conditions .
So , from any time , you look at the big things and big , objects materials and lifeels , life is a question of choices .
And once the world was this : The obviously , there were some possibility of it , but it wasn &apos;t a question .
The world &apos;s what the world is the dilemma is , &quot; What &apos;s a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Seply .
The positive layers know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative .
All of this is two negative of the people .
The first , paradopopopties , is that produced paralysis that that it &apos;s going to be .
And so many options between which choose , becomes very hard to do it .
I &apos;m going to give you an example : one study study of the flying plans of flying flying .
A lot of my connected to the data of Vangift , the gift of the Vand , with about a million clients .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are office in the most , percentage of the percentage of two percent .
With 50 source of 50 percent of the less adhesions , there &apos;s 10 percent in less less than than than than than five . Why are they just five . Why ?
Because with 50 source of which choose , it &apos;s not hard to decide , and the choice is reduced to the intimate , and the choice is reduced to the intimate .
And in the most of the colans , and more in the domans , and of course , I don &apos;t get .
You know that &apos;s not just means that these old old old old old old year for the cans because they &apos;re not going to be enough money , you want to say that the decision is so that they lose the source of the dator of work .
We &apos;re not going to participating , they &apos;re lost to five dollars in the dator of work , which would be well disposing them .
So the paralive is a consequence of having trophic choices .
And I think that &apos;s the world so .
&quot; And to end , for the eternity : ketchup , or the senses , or the hetchup ? &quot;
Would you take the right decision , if it &apos;s for the eternity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and neat the wrong .
So this is the first effect . The second is that if we can get to the paralysis and to do a choice , we &apos;re less less swear in the result of how we would have been on less options between which they choose .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions of the people who choose you buy a and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could do a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us to the alternative of choice , and the plant ant ant ant ant ant ant reduced the sation of the decision , and the plant ant ant ant ant ant ant ant revenue of the decision , and it &apos;s not perfect .
And as it was a good decision .
And there &apos;s more choices there , more is easy displeasure of any detail that is inssweaking .
And in the most of the economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has been very well well stamp as the value that we &apos;re going to think about what we &apos;re going to do with .
And the rest , when there are many options , it &apos;s easy to represent the characteristics of alternative alternative to be less than the option of alternative alternative that is choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I use with all those who are not in New York .
But it &apos;s what you &apos;re probably going to think .
There &apos;s this copy to Hamptons .
A place of luser .
Sweaking on splendida . It &apos;s all for them . It &apos;s all for them .
It doesn &apos;t get anything . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , the malition , it &apos;s Agust . &quot;
&quot; All my neighborhood in Manhattan are on . &quot;
&quot; I could parking up in front of the house . &quot;
And they spend two weeks on the idea that &apos;s lost -- every day -- every day -- the possibility of the parking where you want .
The costs costs of the deminures for what we have , even when the choice was was ecucuck .
And more are the options we have to look , more the characteristics of the most characterterter-opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is vignant us .
There &apos;s about the moment , and maybe of the living life .
But the most important point is that whatever you choose , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the other .
The things that we don &apos;t have many actual actual actual actual actual what we do .
Those ose point : I &apos;m going to grow .
I tried to my skin in bought a new couple of jeans .
I &apos;m almost always jeans .
And once the jeans were a only kind of a kind of guy , they were soubt , they were sweaded , and they were sweaking a lot of times , they were they were born a lot of times , they were going to go to well .
So , I went to buy a couple of jeans , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
The committed me , &quot; Li slip slim fit , relaxed , relaxed ,
Li wants to do with the certain certain of the cloons ? &quot;
&quot; Li wants straight ? &quot;
&quot; Sell them , you know , or stretch ? Bbla , &quot; Continuum .
I was sent , and after a little bit I was able to say , &quot; I want the kind of like that -- which was the only kind of , which was like , for a moment I &apos;ve been trying to me to all the people who had .
It was the very much . I had the best choice .
But I felt worse .
Why do I wrote a whole book for the whole book .
The reason I was worse , and that I was that with all of that choice of my expectations were altissue , the jeans had to be perfect .
I had to the beginning I had been expected . I didn &apos;t expect anything about this , and when there was a kind of kind of , but when you live 100 different , the kind of , at least a kind of thing .
What I had to buy was good , but not perfect .
After I started to think that I was inssweaded in the waiting to expect .
The added of options in life of people does not increase the waiting for those who have respect to the excellence of the options of the same options .
And this is going to make less sweak , as well as the results are good .
No one in the marketing , if you know .
Because if they knew it , you don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is the most of this .
&quot; It was better when you were worse , &quot; The reason that was better when you were worse , or it was possible to meet the surprising of the surprising of the surprising one of the surprising .
Oppputs , in the world where we live -- opultimate , industrialized ads with the expectations of the performing of the most of expectations -- the most of the expectations .
You &apos;ve never surprised to think of your expectations , and my wawaiting , and I &apos;m ingigantite .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here is , &quot; Bosososososous , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , you want . &quot;
I mean , I mean , I mean , I &apos;m really sposed and my wife is really studied .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t have to be able to me .
But they &apos;re not always not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of buy a couple of jeans when there is just that kind of jeans is that kind of jeans is when you don &apos;t know ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot;
The world is the responsible . What could you do you do ?
When you &apos;re hundreds of kinds of jeans , and you buy a inssweaking , and you ask you who is the responsible , is the right right right that the responsible .
You could have better .
And with hundreds of various various various various , there are no in the intrial .
So when people take decisions , even if the result is valido , you feel inssweden , they feel inssweden .
In the last years , the depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this one-depression is just that people have experiences ences in the standard of minds because the standard are too allows you .
And when they have to explaining this situation that the cold is their own .
So the final result is that in general we &apos;re better , but we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the official dogram , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely filled . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no dust that a little choice of choice is better than I don &apos;t have any any any any of choice .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic value . I don &apos;t know what .
But I &apos;m sure we have been going to have a piece of level where the choices choices are .
Now , from the political point -- I &apos;ve been finished -- from the political point of view , the notion is the following .
What it allows all this in the industrial society is the requires .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too puts .
So the centers that I &apos;m talking about is a most people who are talking about modern modern society , which the West society .
And what does depressed and we have this : Steve Levitt has been talking about yesterday of how those expensive seats and seats are initional . It &apos;s a spread are . It &apos;s a spread .
I mean , these choices , complicated and dispendiose , it &apos;s not just that they are just useful .
They &apos;re adoptively deleterie .
They &apos;re doing it .
If a little of what in our society allows a lot of choice , you know , where people have too few possibility , you don &apos;t only have their life to improve but our life .
This is what economists call a impossible possible to be improve .
A reduction of income on in all -- not just to poor -- because of this choice in excexcited that us .
And to end , &quot; Foll , you can get everything you want to get everything you want . &quot;
You , people are , you think , &quot; But what makes you think that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t get anything in a glass of the glass . &quot;
&quot; A very much imagination , a limited view of the world -- &quot;
and I &apos;m going to be interpret so , at the beginning .
But then , I think about , instead , I realized that that that fish knows that that the long knows that that fish knows .
Because the reality of the fact of the fact that if you &apos;re in the frankkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
If you get the bocking in the way that all divents can diminule the swedying the sweaking .
You get the paralysis , and you reduced the well-being .
They all need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too struggle , maybe even for the fish , and certainly certainly for us .
But the assume some symbolic , is a recipe for inhappiness and , I &apos;m , I &apos;m going to the rovine .
Thank you .
