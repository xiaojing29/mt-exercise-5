So last year , I showed these slide to show that the glal acial glal calculus , which for almost three million years had the size of 48 , the United States of 48 continents , the size of 40 percent .
But that &apos;s the gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the spessor of ice .
The glacial glacial calculus is , in a sense , the heart of global climate system .
It &apos;s expanded and you get inverse .
The next slide is going to be a remarkable remarkable reflights on the last 25 years .
The glaciers have been signed in red .
As you see , you see , you &apos;re going to the blue box .
That &apos;s the ice in inverse , which is a summer ice of the summer .
You can see that the cosiddle ice , five or more , is like the blood , which is like the blood , which is the body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been from that , so .
This is a problem because the warming warming of interests , the glacious land , where there are huge amount of coal , where there are huge amount of fuel , which , melds are transformation in meters .
And I &apos;m going to the totalth of the atmospheric inquination to global warming , that could be doubling , super-up , super-point point of not around .
In some lagues in Alaska metan is already rebuling from the water .
The professorly Katey Walter of the University of Alaska team , and a team , and it &apos;s a very low team .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You &apos;re good . The question is if we &apos;re also going to be .
And that &apos;s a reason that is that is the thermal exchange the Groenland from north .
This is a river at regimes .
The brought never had ever reached levels .
This is the Kangerlussuaestion , in the southern ovest of the Groenlandia .
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea to the glasses on the land , you know how the sea you reach .
These currents are increasing rapidly .
On the other side of the planet : Antarctica , the biggest ice ice of the planet .
The last month of the scientists have been deeply the balance of ice is in negative , and the Western arties , which rain on some submarine islands , is particularly particularly in the sun .
It &apos;s six feet of the ocean , like in Groenland .
Sulle Himalayas , the third biggest ice ice of ice , you see new lagues , which are seeing new lagues .
40 percent of the world has been reportable to the shouts of the water .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of water .
The ported is increased .
But when it demines , the same happens to the water .
In California , the snow on the Sierra Nevada is deminuity of 40 percent .
The hypping are in crisis .
The previsions , like you have bed , they &apos;re grasses .
The growing because of the growing in the world leads to a remarkable increase in the world .
The environmental disaster are increasing out of the normal and without the previous .
Four times more many times in the last 30 years I was about 75 years I think about 75 .
This is a lot of the insustainable .
If you look in the storytells you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the ocean area of the Pacific Pacific , the Americans , to the lower of Indian , where there is a radical radical radical impoverview , where there &apos;s a radical radical impoverment of oxygen in the ocean .
The greatest causes global warming , together to the forestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossil fuel fuel .
The oil is a problem , and the coal is even worst .
The United States is one of the two countries with the more emissions , together to China .
And it was proponed to build a lot of other central central centers .
But we &apos;re seeing a change of the way .
These are the annullayers over the last years and some alternative of the alternative .
And in the way , there &apos;s a political length in our country .
The industrial industrial and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting the fuel of the fuel , which is a symptomorrow .
That image would reminds me something --
Very Natale , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a loss of 3.8 billion lights of coal foot .
Maybe you have seen it on the news .
This is the second biggest flusse of the world in America .
It &apos;s happened around Natale .
The advertising of one of the industrial industrial industrial .
Video : See , &quot; â™« Frosty the carbon is a kind of allegry and happy .
It &apos;s above here in America , and it &apos;s growing our economy .
It &apos;s always more cleaner and more clean .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and the workers are the pend .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest minerary society is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : I &apos;m going to be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Peloses -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for Prottion of the Clima has launched two campaign .
This is a bit of them , a part .
Video : Attore : At the 19th we see the climate change as a snards as a snarms of our business .
So , for this priorities is invest a large amount of money in a forget to advertising and confused the truth on the coal of the coal .
In fact , coal is not sports .
We think it &apos;s cleaned -- it &apos;s also a good profumo .
So , not prehocuption of climate change .
Let me do .
Video : Attore : Thanks -- you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
So let &apos;s do a little bit of structure at the avanating for how it &apos;s about the fuel coal .
Straordinarian ! The machines are a little rumorous , but this is the sound of the fuel technology of the fuel technology .
The consumption consumption is between the major global warming , but the remarkable technology that you see changes all .
You have a glassed glassed , this is the odial technology .
Al Gore : Infine , the alternative alternative , you put on the economic security to the national security .
Video : The America is in the crisis , national security security , the climate crisis .
The filter that connects all of the way , our dependence from the fossil fuel , like the fuel fuel and oil .
But , but there &apos;s a new , audace for using it .
Real America : 100 percent of the energy , in 10 years .
A plan to put America in the work , make us more safe , and help to stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that bastes to solve our problems .
Real America . Scoprite more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It &apos;s about re-energy in America .
One of the faster ways of putting the faster of the dependence from the fuel that killing our planet .
He talked about the future is here . I feel , I feel , a new energy network .
He only only only two : New York investiments for places of well-reports .
Comment : Real America . It &apos;s time to be realister .
Al Gore : A old old proverbio Africans says , &quot; If you want to go to the faster , and you &apos;re solers .
If you want to go away , you go together . &quot;
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
LHC : LHC : I did a LHC .
And promises to return you to get back to you on how the car works .
So , we started here . And for those that the other time there were not , LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever attempt -- 27 miles of circles .
His task is to rear the conditions that were less than a billion , at the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times in the universe -- to 600 million times in the universe .
That &apos;s just environmental .
This is the car under Ginevra .
So , we have these mini-Big Bang in the relevers .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLA
This is an image of ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLAT
The 10 secember last year we &apos;ve got the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLAS .
It was because of immense festhate in the control .
It &apos;s an image of the first fascinating in the LHHC , entring in the LHC , deliberately , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles in the relever .
In other words , when we see that image the 10 secember , we know that the machine worked , which is a great vittory vity .
I don &apos;t know if it was to make us more or this , when somebody went on Google and saw that the age was this .
That means we &apos;ve had a cultural impact beyond the scientific impact on the scientific .
It &apos;s about a week later , it was a problem with the car , had just to these films here -- these dorates .
These films take 13,000 ampes when the car works at the maker works at the most power .
Now , the technical of you will look at the films and they say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . I &apos;m films too much . &quot;
And instead they can do that because they &apos;re very cold , they can do the constuck up .
So , at least 271 degrees , at the lower temperature of the space between the stars , these files can bring that current .
In one of the giant of the most new magneti in LHHC , there was a defect of factoration .
So the films are surround up , and the 13,000 bults suddenly met a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think that these magnees are more than 20 tons , and they moved about 30 centimeters .
They have been damage about 50 magnetes .
We had to threshold them , what we did .
We have repristinted and refed .
They &apos;re going back to all their place underneath them .
And then the end of the LHC will be new integrity .
We will accuse it , and we expect to get the data or lue or lue , and we keep the adventure to find out what the universe to find out what the universe is .
Now , of course , in some way , these accidents reach accidents of the value of science and the engineering of frontier and the engineering of frontier .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so difficult , the fact of the limits , I think is this value of things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of a Inglory scientist Inglory , Humphrey , which , I guess , in the defense of the inutionary Inglad , his clean was Michael Faraday , his cleaning was Michael Faraday , which is a dangerous one of the human mind . And that the whole thing of the human mind is defines . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start asking about re-thinking about when you , you play with children , play with your morning .
As you get them and make them , and you have them , and you know , you know , you know , you know , and you know , and to think and solve problems .
The spacectation is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , from the information that uses of our interaction with physicists , with the physical objects , and my collaborator , and my collaborator , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking , &quot; And if , when we use a computer , instead of having the only roll as a roll of the mouse as a digital roll as that you move on a desktop , we could have to have a lot of these hands of the hands of them ,
and we put it on our pleasure ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable , is a computer interactive as a great bodies .
In a few words , a Siftable , is a computer interactive as a great bodies .
You can move with the hand , they can see the hand , they can see the movement and they have a screen and a wireless radio .
But overall of the things , are physicists , like the morning , you can just move them .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulating digital information .
And as they become more physicists , conscious of the motion , of the other , and as they become more physicists , conscious , the way , of the movement , of the other , of how we can move , we can explore new and interaction .
I &apos;m going to try to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show video : if you put it in a direction , the video will rush , if you get on the other side back .
These interactive retives are aware of the other people .
If you affize them , they &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re around .
If they &apos;re surrounded , you notice and they can agitate a little bit .
If they &apos;re surrounded , you notice and they can agitate a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was that we could use communities on the data , to example , &quot; as if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable , and I can use them to put them on the color , and I can use them to use them to use the color in the central , where they &apos;re missing .
and I can use them to use of the color in the central , where they put them .
And you &apos;re too , we can put a little bit of place .
And you &apos;re also beautiful possibilities of learning , like the languages , the mathematics and logic games where people can try things can try things , and see the immediately .
Now , I &apos;m --
This is a Fibonaces that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a game of words that is in half in Scarabees and Boggle .
Of course , at every turnal turnal , in the Siftall , and of course , at every turnal turnarrator , and while you &apos;re looking for him , and while you &apos;re looking for words , and while you &apos;re looking for the words of a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new set of letters and new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the kids came in in the Media Lab , I did in a way that I tried them and I made them a video video .
They liked them very much .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of applied is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
You just say , &quot; You know , &quot; You know , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s other people who provided it .
This is our little little little bit of the younger , there on the right .
It was actually wanted to impllares them .
They were only morning morning , for him .
Now , this is an appliance of a cartoon interactive .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of the languages . He &apos;s Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , solving the Sifts , solving the Sifts ,
It can put new characters in the scene , solving the Sifts , solving the Sifts ,
So , here &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : The Sun is surprising .
David Merrill : Now , he took a treatment of the scene .
Video : The arange treatment .
Bel work ! You know ! You know !
So , you shake the Siftons and put them up , you can make the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- by by inventing their story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide him as you get a flight .
DM : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide him as you get a flight .
Video : Vola , gat .
DM : The last example that I have time to show you is a tool , which is a tool , to try and make music .
It &apos;s a tool , which is a recent tool , to take music .
The Siftable here are the ground , low and the bacteria .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose which is that you use .
You can actually put these sounds in a compose to your pleasure .
And it just by making you touch a sound &quot; and a sequence . &quot;
These are actually that you can control from the vial , like the revers and the filter .
The acks to a particular sound and then incline for the waste .
And then there are general effects as time and volume , that apply to the whole sequence .
Let &apos;s look like it works .
Video : DM : We &apos;re going to start putting a base in two Siftable , we put it in a series , we put in a series , we put in a series , we add to a series of the extense , we add to a series of them .
Now , I put a line of the bottom .
Video : DM : Now , I &apos;m going to add of the percussions --
Video : DM : And now I &apos;ll put the filter on the bacteria , so I can control the effect from the vial .
Video : DM : I can reveal the whole sequence of the entire inclining time from one or the other .
Video : DM : And now I &apos;m going to add the bottom to the bottom to give more expression .
Video : I can reach the sequence of the flying . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to plan it before , but I can suddenly , make it a long way , make it a long or more corportion .
And now , I can smoke the whole sequence of the left the Siftable , &quot; volume . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to make new interfaces and more more and more more as they work as they work our brain work .
And today , I &apos;ve been time to show you one of the results of this path , and some possibilities that we &apos;re trying to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that &apos;s coming this new generation of objects to interact with digital media , that will bring information in our world we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the now of talking to you to all .
I &apos;m a scritual scritual .
See books is my profession , but it &apos;s more of that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the beat of my life .
And I don &apos;t look like that it can change .
But , he said , something particular is successful in my life and my career , which has brought me to re-report the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I &apos;ve been recently wrote this book , this biography called &quot; Mangia , Prega , Ama , &quot; which , where , I was a few reason came out in the world and I &apos;m going to get a great , sensational , bestyle .
And the result is that everywhere is now , people treatment as if I was conducted .
It &apos;s -- conducted , conducted !
They &apos;re all about me now , and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t have fear to do you not make you better ?
You don &apos;t make it fear to write for all life without able without being able to create a book that could be able to create a book that could be able book that can you can importance to make a book that could be able to make a book that could be able to make a book that could be able to make a book that could be able to make a book that could importance to make a book that you can make a book .
that can you care about someone ? &quot;
It &apos;s rassurant , you know .
But it could go worse , at the part of that I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a scritual -- I wanted to be a scritual scritation .
I would come up to the same reaction , based on the landscape .
And people say , &quot; Don &apos;t you have succeeded ?
You don &apos;t think that the ulililights you killed ?
You don &apos;t have fear to make this to make this all of life without nothing that &apos;s ever out and to die on a cumb of every sentences with the mouth of failure with the mouth of failure ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
I fear of all those things .
I &apos;ve always had fear .
And I also fear of many other things that people don &apos;t have to be ininary .
As the allows and other things like the albedroom .
But , as I think about writing what I thought , and I ask me , and I ask me , why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logic that anybody who would expect to be splied by a job that you feel like to do .
But what is that particular in the creative implemental implement to make us nervous about the mental health , so that other carefully they don &apos;t they do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don &apos;t remember one of a chemicals that he asked if he had to be engineer , if he had to be engineer ?
It was never -- that stuck of the John , how does it go ?
It doesn &apos;t work that , you know ?
Onnestly , chemicals like group they don &apos;t have certain , in the centuries , they make the reputation of being alcolized .
We have a writers , we have enough reputation , and not just creative writers , but we have this reputation of the vast , and we have this reputation of the instabove .
And it &apos;s not something that you look at the tristes of the magnifices of creative magnifies that , only in the 20th century , they died young and often to their hand .
And the ones that don &apos;t have suicidated seem to be really disappeared by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before to die , in the last interview , he said , &quot; Every book has killed me a little more , &quot; A little bit more , &quot; A little bit more , &quot; A lot of life .
But we don &apos;t give it , when we feel about it because we &apos;ve heard these things so long that we &apos;ve been all all the way we have all all interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and the art , at the end , the end , and the end , will always confidence to the cords .
And the question I want to ask you to all here is , you agree with this idea ?
It &apos;s good for this thing -- because it &apos;s also about a centimeter of me , not well for anything that &apos;s good for me .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous , and I don &apos;t want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our great creative creative minds .
And I know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start to start to be able to be able to hear about that I feel dark for the circumstances in my career .
That &apos;s -- you look , I &apos;m quite young , I have about 40 years .
I &apos;ve got about four work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything that &apos;s writing in now is going to be right from the world as the work that after the work that was after the time ,
I &apos;m going to be slavor , because we &apos;re all more or less friends here -- is likely that my biggest success is to my great success .
Oh , Gesus , which thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that is a person to start dying in the nine of the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would keep doing this work that we do this work that we do .
So , the question becomes , how do it is , how ?
And so , it seems , after many reflective reflective , which the way to work on and write is that to create a protective psychological construct , OK ?
I have to somehow to find a distance of security between me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural advanced , which is going to be able to get . And while I was trying to look at the time , I would look at the time , I try to find other societies to see if they could have better better and more and more and more and more and sane and more and more and even even even even even even even sane and more and sane and ,
how to help people people to manage the creative people to manage the emotions of creativity .
And that research , has brought me to the ancient Great and ancient Rome .
You go to the round , and then you go back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity sely creativity sely from the men , OK ?
It thought that creativity was this spirit is the spirit of the people who came to the men from a few different different surprises and unknown , for reasons and unknown .
The Greeks called these spirites of the bees of the creativity . &quot;
Socrrationally , he believed to have a demand that elargive of wisdom from the long .
Romans were the same idea , but they call that kind of spirit without a genius .
The which is great , because the Romani didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly intelligent .
They thought that a genius was this kind of divine that was literally living in the lawalls of a neighborhood of a neighborhood , a little bit like the elevent , and it came to the work of the neighborhood and to model the work of the artist and to models the outcome of that work .
Here is the distance of which is the distance of which is the distance of which is that psychological construct that you protect from your work .
And everybody knew that was so that it worked , right ?
So the artists were protected by certain things , like the too narcism , not ?
If your work was exciting , you could not take it , and all the merit , all the time , all they knew that you were helped by this genius .
If your work failed , it was not all your hit , it &apos;s not all your hit , it ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a inhasn .
And so people have to have a creative creative creative creativity in the West for a long time .
And then the Raissance came and it all the way , and we put the human being at the center of all of the universe on the universe over all the universe over all of the universe on the mouth of the universe , and the mysters and no longer leave space to the creatures .
This was the principle of humanity and people started thinking that creativity came up with creativity came from the idividust .
And for the first time in history , you start to referring this or that artist as a rather than a person with the genius that artist as a person with the genius .
And I have to say , I think that was a big error .
I think that allows somebody , a simple person to believe that you can believe that &apos;s a recipient recient , the essence and the source of all the divine mysters , unknown and ethernal and ethernical recipe is a very big person to give to the fragile fragile human .
It &apos;s how to ask someone of ingoding the sun .
It &apos;s detains and it all these hingestible to the performance .
And I think it was this pressure to destroy artists in the past 500 years .
And , if that &apos;s true , and I think that &apos;s the question , and now ?
We can do it diversously ?
And you think , you know , the most ancient understanding of human relationship between humans and mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t take 500 years of thinking in a 18 minutes of 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience that would only have to legitimate scientific remarkable , they do , they do that people are well-fat , you do , they do that they feel like people are shelf on their projects .
And it &apos;s probably not going to convince you all about this .
But the question I &apos;d like to take is -- why not ?
Why don &apos;t you think about this way ?
Because it has more sense of everything that has ever heard to explain the exact exact exact imprevedibility of the creative process .
And one process that , as anyone who ever tried to do something -- so , basically , all of this -- you don &apos;t understand rationally .
And , in fact , it can be a completely paranorful paranoral .
I did this against recently , it &apos;s just a few years , but it &apos;s now 90 years , but it &apos;s been a few , but it was a few years , but it was a little bit of life and said that during his childhood in the rural Virginia , and he felt it in if a poem , when a poem of the landscape .
He said , it was like a frorous frorework .
And that came up to her from the landscape .
It felt it , because he did it could be the ground under his feet .
He knew that you have one thing to do at that point and he was of , words , &quot; we run like a match . &quot;
And so it &apos;s going to the house and it came up by this poem , and it wouldn &apos;t have to make another piece of paper and a math , and a math , and it &apos;s a fairly quickly , as the page .
And sometimes you could be pretty fast , so correal and correds without able to be able to get in the house and the poem , and she would continue to roled through the landscape , looking , like she said , &quot; she &apos;s another little .
And then there were those times -- this piece of -- that I never forget -- there were the moments that was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was trying to paper and poem the poem through , and he was a math in the while he was going , and then he said , which was like if you halled to the other hand and the offer .
And he was the poem from the coda and he reputs it in his body and the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page and the last word at the first word at the first word .
So when I feel the -- it &apos;s pathesknife , it &apos;s exactly the same as a creative process .
It doesn &apos;t all my creative process -- not not a conducucucucucture .
I &apos;m a mud , and my way to work is ; I wake up at the same same orar orar every day and to work and go up and to work and go up up .
But even I , in my testest-to-grade tared testing , I strike up against that thing , sometimes .
And I guess , many of you the han done .
You know , even though the work and ideas came to me from a certain source of the sources , I could not be honestly .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it in a way to not lose the head , but rather , what does you do is stay ?
As I think about , the best example of contemporary example that I have the music Tom Waits , which I interviewed interviewed for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the major of the life was the incarnation of the neighborhood of the artist tormented , trying to control , manage , to run these species of impulses and we &apos;re all interyzed .
But then I said , he &apos;s hot , and he was driving on a day , he was driving on a highway in Los Angeles , he changed everything for him .
He was going to be fast and everything of a sudden , this little framment of melodia , which comes in his head as inspiration , and the waste , and the wants , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the desider , but the desyse , but the desider , but the desider , but the desider , but the desidal , but the desider , but the desider , but the desystem ,
It doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a math , it doesn &apos;t have a recorder .
So , I started to hear this kind of old ange , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;ll sweat it from this song even even even even hements .
I &apos;m not enough , and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to go in the panic , they stop .
It &apos;s the whole process of mental process and made something completely new .
He just looked at the sky and he said , &quot; See , don &apos;t you you see that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Would you make a song now ?
If you really want to exist , you get a more time when I can take care of you .
Altherefore , I get to importantly someone else else today .
I have to disturbing Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And the work work work in after this .
Not the work , it was still dark , and it was still dark as well as .
But the process , and the fish of the anxiety that was reduced when he took the genius that came up , the genius that came back to the none of them , and I went to the back to where it was , and he didn &apos;t have to be a interorized thing that you didn &apos;t have to be a interorized thing .
but it &apos;s well-peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration of Tom and this strange thing that straight and outside that was not Tom .
So how I felt that story that story , it &apos;s also a way I worked , and I &apos;ve been working and already saved me once .
This idea , I &apos;ll save me when I was writing &quot; Many , Prega , &quot; and fall in a of those cave of the disperation where we &apos;re all working on something and we can &apos;t start to think that &apos;s a disaster disaster , which is the worst book .
Not just good , just the worst book wrote .
And I started to think of of gecting this project .
But then I reminds me of Tom that I talked to the air and you try .
So I got my face on on the manoseign and diress my comments to a vacuum angle of the room .
And I said to high , &quot; Sents , what we know , both know , if this book will not be not going to be a brilliant , not it ?
Because I &apos;m going to see that I &apos;m putting all that I have , not more than that .
So if you want to want to be better , you have to talk and you to you .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , I don &apos;t do it .
I &apos;ll talk to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I would like to please that it was recorded that I &apos;ve been presented to me to do my part . &quot; Because the end is so , OK -- centuries , and the people were dance of the North of the North of the dance of dance , and the music that went on to the hours and the alba .
And they were always magnifies , because the dots were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every one , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became actually transcendent ,
And I know what you talk about what you about , because I know that you &apos;ve all seen , at a certain point , a performance .
It was like if you stop , and the ballerin , and it &apos;s a kind of a portal species and it was not doing anything else from the usually , like 1,000 notes before , but it &apos;s all you hit .
And suddenly , you don &apos;t look like a human .
But it &apos;s accession in the divinity of the divinity .
And when this happened , it was , you know , people knew what was , they called him by his name .
They were told their hands and started to dry , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allalah , God , &quot; God , God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Sectively notes -- when the More &apos;s Spet , I was the south of the Spna , preserved this abitude with them and the ready to change in the centuries . &quot; Allah , Allah &quot; Ole , I still hear in the shoot or in the flamense .
In Said , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , I , I have , Alah , I magnifiction -- a flife-, and then , a heart of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need .
But , the problem comes the day after , for the ballerin the same , when you wait up and find that &apos;s 11 in the morning of Martedesday and the God is not there .
It &apos;s just a dead to the ginocrates , and maybe it &apos;s not going to each other to that altitude .
And maybe nobody will you have the name of God still while you go , and what &apos;s going to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s difficult .
This is one of the most results of the most porous life .
But maybe it &apos;s not to be so far if you can not believe , you know , the most extraordinary aspects of your being being being from you .
But it just makes you , you know , in the data from a remote of this team of your life that team of your life that team you have to do something else when you &apos;ve finished .
And , you know , if we think about this way it changes .
And so I started pensary , and it &apos;s certainly as I thought about it for different months during the working of the book that I will public , I &apos;m going to take , dangerous , and we follow on my great success .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel applied by this is , not having fear .
Not at you . It &apos;s just your work .
It &apos;s going to talk to you for your side , any can be .
If your work is dance , you know , you can blow , you know , you know , if your work is dancing , you know , if your work is dance , you know , if your work is dance ,
If the divine , absurd , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , for a only time through your forforces , then &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Otherwise , you do the same your dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot; You know the same .
I think , and I think you should teach it .
&quot; Ole ! &quot; And you know , even for having the human love and testestation and testables to you reach .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects on the human genome , on what it can mean and the discovery of new genes .
We &apos;re starting to digitize biology and now , we started to digitize biology and now we &apos;re going to have to a new phase of biology , we &apos;re going to have a new fat of biology , designing and synthzing and synthzing life .
We always tried to take great questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists , I think they have been trying to understand the levels .
We tried different approaches , reducing it , and we have a lot of the minimes .
We &apos;re digitizing by the 20 years ever .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the analogic world of biology at the digital world .
Now , we ask , we ask the life , or create new life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma , which is the species from the smallest genome of the smallest genome that can self-oreplication in the lab .
And we tried to reduce you to reduce the genome to create a little little bit more .
We can actually take a hundred genes of the about 500 that are here .
But when we take a look at his metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our .
Think , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can take , one once , it &apos;s very imlikely that this can bring to a living cell cell .
So we decided that the only way to design is synthesizing this chromosome , so we could change the components to take some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of the &quot; we can synthze a chromosome ? &quot;
Can you have the chemical chemical contributing these great molecules that we never did do to create before ?
And , in case , we can make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemical material .
The speed with which we &apos;re able to digitize life is growing at the exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , design , rather slowly , but it &apos;s better .
And our most recent results the take on a curve .
We &apos;ve got more about 15 years ago .
The process has retired , and we start with a bioethics before we started with a bioethics before .
But we found that synthesize of DNA is very difficult .
There are thousands of machines in the world that produce little segments , the long long , of the long , of the long , and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the most segment is long , the more mistakes .
So we have to develop a new method to assembling these fragments and correct the mistake .
And this was our first attempt , to start with digital genome of Phi 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed framments , acts the correction of errors and I got a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material , and we put it in bacteria , they started reading this genetic code and make them them , they have started to read this genetic code and make them them .
The viral particles have been reminds from cells , they &apos;re back and they destroy .
I talked about recently with the members of the oil industry , say that they have certainly started to understand this model .
They have more than you .
We think this is a situation where the software can actually build his own hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in great .
We wanted to build the whole chromosome of the bacteria .
They &apos;re more than 580 middness .
So we thought of building it in the size of the size of the viruses of viruses , so that we can change the casses of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard of a mid-mid-based mid-basi .
We found , resequence , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence , we didn &apos;t have been able to work .
And one part of the process is designed to design segments that you overwhelming with all the other segments of 50 letter to build a little little little bit of the working together .
Let &apos;s try to take things together .
You &apos;ve probably read that we can put in the side of the grall .
Think of it , we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters together , and it &apos;s about 20 amminoacids , and there &apos;s a specific order of letter , for every amminoacid .
So we can use the genetic code to write , frass , thoughts .
So what we did at the beginning is self-respect .
Some of them have been dolphuses that was not poem .
We designed these segments to do just unning with with enzyme .
There are many of them reparate and put them together .
And we started assembling of the parts , starting with the segments from five to seven mix , unendles in a way to make them , so we can make them , and we put them to 72 , and we put them to 72 , and we put them to 72 .
So , we took these segments in abundance so that we could sequence that we have been trying to create a very very much robust -- like you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re looking at the process .
So , this seems like the tabellon of a basket player .
When we get these segments , more than 100 myths , more than 100 myths , they &apos;re not going to grow directly in the E.
You get the limits of the modern biology of molecular biology .
So we &apos;ve been considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called the homologist called the homologist , which in biology , we use to repect the DNA to repect the DNA to be able to unununits .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinoccurred Deinoccurred , can make three million radiation .
You can see in the upper rise of the cromosome is destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s just just like it was before .
There &apos;s thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely completely completely .
They can live under vacuum .
They &apos;re absolutely sure that life exist in space , and you get to get new environments of water .
And to say , NASA has shown that this is .
This is a molecule picture of the molecule that we built using these processes , just using the lieventually design of the appropriate design of the appropriate segment .
The lieventually assemble them .
This picture was not taken with an electronic microscope , but with a regular microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It &apos;s a molecule so big that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the publisher that we did a little time .
They &apos;re more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the biggest molecule has ever created by man .
It &apos;s a molecular weight .
If we &apos;re going to do with a 10 without spaces , we would like 142 pages only to transform this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ? How do we work ? How can we acre it ?
Of course , you take a virus is a game from kids .
It &apos;s a little more complicated when they use bacteria .
It &apos;s easier to do when it &apos;s about eucariote , you can just get the nuclear nuclear , and put one of them , which is basically the process of clonation .
In the bacteria , the chromosome is instead of integrated inside the cell , but we &apos;ve been able to demonstrate that we can do a trapiant trapial trapial , and you can see it .
We cleaned a chromosome from a microbial species .
The two are different as the men from the mouth .
We added some gene in a way that you could decide which you choose to have to be able to decide that you can decide what you do for this chromosome .
And then it &apos;s melt with the enzyme ,
And when we put it in the cell is studipendoes -- and you &apos;re appreciate our graph , the new chromosome is gone inside the cell .
And we thought we were we could not go beyond , but we tried to get over there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that tantissim , they have added a second or a third chromosome from some of a few of the new trains of that species .
So those thinks evolution as a only gene at the time that you change has no longer understood of the biology .
There &apos;s a deallights called &quot; remarkable to make a sense that you can tell them the DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell , it doesn &apos;t have one .
The cell phones -- the phones we have put it .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other chromosome as a material , and it has masticked , and we refined with the cell and the new chromosome .
It &apos;s become blue because of the genes we put .
And in a short time , all the characteristics of a species are gone , and it transformed in the new species , based on the new species , based on the new software that we put in the cell .
All the proteins are changed , the members are changed , and when we read the genetic code exactly what we &apos;ve transfit .
Now , this may seem to look like genetic alchemical allows , but we can change things in a very substantial way .
Now , I &apos;ve already explosion that is not about genesis -- but of progress from three million years and half million years , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the explosion of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explores in which they will be new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think that &apos;s enough to be in the way , we think about our need .
We &apos;re going to spend from six and a half billion people at nose billion in the next 40 years .
Right to give example , I was born in 1946 .
Now , there are three people on the planet for each other in 1946 , in the 1946 , there will be four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find food , fresh water and wealthy , medical medicine and welline for six and a half billion people .
It &apos;s going to be more to be doing it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion fuel bars , more than 30 billion barles .
That means percent million barles a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replace them , it will be a huge challenge .
And in the more we have to realize of all the CO2 emission from these materials that end up in the atmosphere .
And in the day , because of the scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the design of the future .
The electronics industry has only a dozen about components , and you think about how many different things came out of it .
Our limits here are data data , principles from biological reality and the imagination .
We have some techniques , because of these methods of synthesization , able to create what we call what we call genomics combinatory .
We can build a big robot that can make a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day .
Think about processing these 20 million different genes or to try to optimize the processes to make them , and we can change , but , we can change , but , to make more biology molecular biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemical production or fuel , production of ethc vaccines .
This is an instantanea of some software programmed that we &apos;re working to be able to seat and design species .
Well , we don &apos;t necessarily know how it will be .
We know exactly what is their genetic code .
We &apos;re focusing on the quarter generation of the quarter generation .
You &apos;ve seen that extract ethanol from the grain of the experiment .
We have depending on the third generation and third generation that will use enough to be on the higher zuccher , as they put on the highest value of the ninanol .
But the only way that biology can have a great impact without increase the cost of food and limest-results , the cost of the food and limarts the cost of CO2 in the first , we &apos;re working to design cells that , and we think we can reach this purpose , and we think we can have the first quarter in about 18 months .
The solar light with CO2 is a metododownntown , but in our discoveries in the world , we have found different metods .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It &apos;s going to be in the ocean , at about 2,500 feet of the water .
It makes a metan using CO2 hydrogen using molecular hydrogen as much of energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand whether we can incanaling CO2 , which can easily be transported by your average , convert that CO2 in fuel , to drive this process .
So , we think we could be able to increase what the question of &quot; which is what the question of life is , &quot; and we have the dest goal to replace the dest of the food industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can you do ?
It would be a major source of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working to use the same metods to create instantanetic vaccines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with influence , we &apos;re always back to a year and a dollar in less when it &apos;s about the vaccine .
I think that &apos;s what you can change building together in the anticip .
Here &apos;s how the future could start to look at the future , now , the tree of evolution , accellating evolution with synthesizing evolution with synthesielf , and then eucariit .
We &apos;re so much on the way to improve people .
Our purpose is to make a way to live enough to try to make it . Thank you very much .
So , first of all I &apos;m going to show you , the faster possible , some fundamental work , the new technology that we took the Microsoft in follow . This is Seadragon . This is Seadragon . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s a environment where you can interact is at the local level that remoon with a huge amount of visual data .
Here we &apos;re seeing a lot of digital pictures of digital photo-digital pictures of a kind of digital zoom and continue , for a fast panoramics , despite images like we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big it is the amount of information that we see , how big these data are these crops of data or images .
Most of them are common photographs , but this for example is a provened scansion from the Biary of Congress , and reentral in the Biary of Congress , and it in the 300 megaps .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that limit &apos;s the number of pixels like this is the number of pixels on your screen in any time . It &apos;s also a very flessible architecture .
This is a whole book , of the data of not .
This is the Casa desolate of Dickens . Every colonna represents a caple .
So , to show you that it &apos;s just about text and not of images , we can do something like that , to see that it &apos;s about a real representation of the text , not of a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read an electronic book .
I don &apos;t recommend it .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s a number of The Guardian .
Every big image is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you a pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading the real version of a magazine or of a daily view , which is for a multiple kind of a half of a half .
We have something with the corner of this particular number of The Guardian .
We created a public advertising advertising -- much higher than what it uses in a normal publisher -- and you have a content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific models .
And this really shows some of these ideas to take the limits of space on the screen .
We lose that means that it means to put up the people , and to other kind of the similar , not to be necessary .
Of course , the maps is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say we have to help you do in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States overcome over an actual picture of NASA .
So now we &apos;re going to move what else .
This is actually from the Web on the Web ; you can see it .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which fight two different technologies .
A is Seadragon and the other is a visual computer that Noah Snavely interesting by Noah Snavely , a student of the University of Washington , with the help of Steve Szeliski and Rick Szeliski of Microsoft Rick . It &apos;s great collaboration .
And it &apos;s from the website , the Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from a picture of the other and have this kind of experience of the multiple .
But the space of the images here has actually actually a meaning .
The algoritems of the computer visualization have these images together , so that I correspond to the re-reducing places where you imagine -- all the next to the lagues -- all the next to the Plaghi Grasis . Here &apos;s the part of a score or or images , and these things are all connected to space .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more spaces .
I want to go to one of the original data set of Noahs -- and this is from a previous prototosynth that we did work for the first time , the first time the summer -- to show you what I think is the key behind this technology , Photosynth . And that &apos;s not necessarily evident to look at the environments that we put in the website .
We had to worry about the legal aspects and say .
This is a reconstruction of the Nobody , Dame images made by Flickr . Badigit . Bae Nobody Dame in Flickr and you get images of these kinds of maglit and you get . Olickr and he &apos;s looking .
So , they &apos;re all taken by Flickr and they &apos;re all connected to space in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate in this simple way .
You know , I never thought of you &apos;re going to work for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifically to get this kind of accounts here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different different different different photocamers of those phones in the professional cell phone , and a significant number of those professional phones , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try and try and look the most strange .
Many of them are stuck by faces , etc .
And somewhere , you find a series of photographs -- eccole .
This is a Nobody poster , the Nobody , Dame recorded .
We can go from the poster physics of this environment .
The essential is that we can do things with the social environment . This is taking data from the whole memory , of the whole memory of the world , from the view of view , and connects all those data together .
All those pictures become connected together , more of the parts of the parts .
You have a model of the earth of the whole of the earth .
Think about this as the prolungent of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complex complex complex as people are using it , and the whose advantages to get them , and the wisdom to increase with the use .
Their pictures are married with metadopted by other people .
If somebody is the idea of contrast all these subsidies , you know , my picture of the name , my picture of the Nobody of three Dimprovisissues , and I can use the one of all those data , and I can use the kind of ingresses to immerse me in the space , using anyone else , and having a social experience of cross-modity and cross-modity experience .
Of course , a consequence of this is virtual models , extremely elaborated of every interesting of the land , and the satellite images and satellite images and satellite , but from the memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I did it well ? What your software is that you can do is that at some point , in the next few years , all the photographs , all the photographs , and share if you in the whole world will be practically connected together ?
BAA : Yes . What is that &apos;s doing is basically discover .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , you want to , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the remarkable of information that is that many of these images have been done .
As you do a research of images on the Web , you take a frase and the text on the Web has a lot of information about images .
Now , what happens if that picture is connecting to all your pictures ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of wealth that comes to really is a lot of remarkable to the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the pleases when you travels and one of the dolphins of the research , the living of the waste of the people who have no forgotten , the waves of the world , who have the past in the wind , the touches in the wind , the waving in the wind , the fleaving of plants .
Basti thinking that the sciamani Jaguar travel , and the U.V. , or the Inuit &apos;s still columns of the old old old , or Himalayas , Himalayas , the disti budes , and the budgets to remind the most of the Dharma , to remind the importance of the anthrology of anthrology , and the idea that the world we live in sense , but it &apos;s just a reality , but it &apos;s just a model of reality , but it , of reality ,
the result of a particular set of choices that our stirpe has done , well or bad , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential straight .
We all all of the tough .
We &apos;re subjects to reach .
We have to deal with the death of death , so we don &apos;t surprisingly smile , and we don &apos;t surprisingly --
We all have an art .
What it is the particular rhythm of the song , the rhythm of the dance of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that the Penan of the Borneo , or the following the Voododoo , or the desert guerriers of the Saimmas the Sahara , or the Curge of Ande , or a cammellias , or a cammells in the heart of the Sahara .
And he was my company , he was my journey in the desert a month ago , or a hallor of the Komolangma , Everest , the dealth of the world .
All these populations teach us that there are other ways of exist , there are other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And if you think , if you think , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
Insides , the miriades of cultures are creating a spiritual life and cultural and cultural life that flight on the planet and it &apos;s important for the planet , and it &apos;s important for the planet , so as the biological roughness .
And you can think about this cultural raves like an etnosphere and you can call the ethnosphere , the whole whole concepts , submites , ideas , inspired , ideas , inspired , ideas , inspired , a inspirational imagination .
The ethnosphere is the great pathiiium of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be as as much species .
And because the biosphere is just just to be so consumed by the same as happened to the ethnosphere and unfortunately ,
Nobody biologist , for example , would say that 50 percent of all the species is or is about the ord of the extinction , just because it &apos;s phon , or -- in the most apococalittal diversity -- and you don &apos;t even get a little bit of biological diversity .
The of all of this is , of course , the language .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just compost by a vocabolary or from a series of rules .
A language is the spraking of human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle of which is the middle of every culture comes in the material .
Every language is a forest of mind , a kick ecosystem , a thought , a spiritual ecosystem .
And of those 6,000 languages , while we &apos;re sitting in Monterey , at least half not the subsurrated in the ears of the children .
They don &apos;t get more teacher to children , the which means , less that you don &apos;t have any camps .
What is more tristes of the most tristes of the silence , of the last few of the last to talk about a language , not having to transmit to the promise of the kids or anticipating the promise of the kids ?
This is a few years old is the state of someone in some of the world every two weeks , every two weeks , every two days , they die , and he brings to the birth of silly language .
And I know somebody of you will say , &quot; Is it better like that ?
The world would not be a better place if we talked about all the same language ? &quot; Benisite , then we talk to all yoruba .
Let me talk about the kogs .
You &apos;re going to get a sense of what it means you can &apos;t talk to their language .
And I &apos;d like to do you do a journey through the ethnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a abay of what we &apos;re losing .
Most of us forget that when I say &quot; different ways of existing exist , &quot; very different ways of existing .
Let &apos;s take for example this bimbo Barasana , in Amazon Since , the people of the anaconda , which creates the midst of the latest of the milk of the milest in the shall of the sacres .
It &apos;s a people who can &apos;t be able to distinguish the color from the green because the time celests of the blue as you can identify in the forest , where people do it .
They have a language and a birth rule , and a matrimonial rule , &quot; exogamia , &quot; you have to sposite a person that talks about a different language .
And all of this has been , but it &apos;s the particularly , but the particularly in these families , the extinct that in these families , and the size that you talk about six or seven languages because of the matriries of the mythery .
They limited listening and then they start talking about .
Let &apos;s take one of the most interesting tribe with which I lived , the Waorani of Ecuador of Ecuador , a incredible people who had the first contact in 1958 .
In 1957 five missioned missioned a mistake error .
They made up the top of photographs that they react them in the room that they were adverted them , forest that people have been gone from the plumb , they forest that people had never seen anything about bi-dimensional .
They &apos;ve taken the pictures from the Earth , they made the research of a shape or a shape or a figure and , not by the way , they have been concluse that was the diavy of the diavy , and they killed the five missionary of the ground .
But the Waorani didn &apos;t kill the foreign .
They killed between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by their own .
We &apos;re going to be eight generations , and we found two natural death and when we have been done to know , they admitted that one of them was invecting , and then they killed it . And then they killed him . And then they killed it .
The citizens were able to recognize the animal urine 40 pass and recognize the species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned a really interesting task when my professor of my Harvard , asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti in the basic secrees of Duvalier and the Tonton Macoutes and Tonton Macoutes , and the Tonton Macaties .
To make sense of a miraculous , I should have to understand the Vodoun culture and that Voodoo is not magnapes .
It &apos;s quite a metic view of the world .
Many interesting .
If I ask you to tell me about great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristian , Islam , Buddhism , Ebraism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has no religious faith . And they yes , and the Voododoo is not the other than the distillustrated distance of these religious religious concepts of nation-safe .
What makes the interesting voodoo is the intense intense to the relationship between life and death .
So , the vives are being hidden .
They can be invocated by the Grands can be invocated by the race of the dance of the dance of the dance of the waste , so that for a short short active active , and you can see the god .
So , for this voodooists love to talk about God .
We give God . We give God . &quot;
And from the moment that you &apos;re position , is the spirit that you , how can you do you do it ?
So you see these incredible events : following the voodoo in state of trance that touches impunes a lot of the power of the body when it &apos;s catalyzed demonstration in a state of extremely extremely exciting .
And in all the people who have seen the most extraordinary Kogi of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta , in the Colombia .
They have to the ancient of the ancient civilization that once lived on the aid plant on the aid of the commodity , the people have a ritional massure , the people have a ritional mess that you take on on the volcanic cards .
In a continent continent that has never been conquisted by the spage-based continent .
But I have been government government government by a clever , but their formation is so extraordinary .
The young people follow up with the families at three or four , and they live secrets in a good world , and they &apos;re reached in a good world of the glacious layer for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years choices to reproduce the nine months to reproduce the nine months of gestation that they transfted in the modity of the Grands of Maasian .
For all of this time , they &apos;re acculturated to the values of their society , values that are the prayers and just their prayers and the preayer , they &apos;re better than the cosmic balance -- or to say , the way the most of say .
And the term of this incredible initiation , they &apos;re suddenly taken out and for the first time in life , at the age of 18 years , see a alba . And in that acecraft of the first bleap , when the sun the sun of the first blow , all that they &apos;ve learned in theory is all that they &apos;ve learned in theory . The pret of it does a step back and say , &quot; and he says , &quot; It &apos;s a step back and say , &quot;
&quot; Vist ? Right ? Right , how I said you .
It &apos;s amazing . Now it &apos;s about you . &quot;
They call them very much larger brothers and say that we , brothers , are the minors of the destruction of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the Indigene and the environment we call Rousseau and the old history of selvacures , which is a concept of the waste of its simplicity or maybe invoke Thoreau and maybe invoke Thoreau and we say that these people are nearest to Earth .
The Indies are not nostaly of the nostaly of nostaly .
There is no space for these things in the Asmat the Asmat or in the Tibet , but because of the time , and we have a mystic mystic myth of the Earth is not about the concept of the Earth &apos;s not about the concept of being ununbelievable to be . The concept that Earth can be only live because it &apos;s infected by the human knowledge .
What does that mean ?
It means that a little kid in Ands that &apos;s increasing that the mountain is a spirit of the Apu that will will be a depin that you will be a depor a long way to have a lot different relationship with the mountain or that place in the mountain or that place a lot of rock of rock , which is a rock of rocks of rocks that is a rock of rocks of the Ands that you &apos;re going to be score of a rock of rocks .
That &apos;s the dimatic of one or a little mineral or a mineral irrilevant is irrilevant .
And what &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that define the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the House Britannics , creating the forests that they were going to be cut .
And that has been a different human being different from my friends Kwaucucucl that the forests are the dimora of Hukukukukukukukukukukukule , which we live in the Hamadise , spirits that we &apos;re going to extreme in the Hamadise .
If you start to consider that these cultures can make different , you can start to understand some of them sensational discoveries .
I took this picture to open up in the Amazon the Western Amazon the Western Amazon the Western Amazon the Amazon the Amazon the nards Amazon the nards .
Maybe some of you &apos;ve heard about the ayahuasks , the most powerful psychoactive , the most powerful psychoactive ,
And what makes it fascinating the ayahuasks is not the potential of the substance , but his elaboration . It &apos;s compost by two elements .
As one side , this liana leavy of a series of Tial-coal , harddddogen and harddddry , slightly housing .
And by taking the only plant , it &apos;s a comfortable , which allows the cosence , but it &apos;s mix with the leaves of a bodies of the family &apos;s told Psychopoptions , and Psychopopoptions .
This plant contains powerful powerful , very similar the serotonin serotonin , dithyllyptamine , five methyptamine ,
If you &apos;re going to see the Yanomami pull up for the nose basically they make a different set of species , it &apos;s a different set of species , it &apos;s a methyptamine .
And that &apos;s about the dust of the nose is a little bit like being gone from a little bit of the career , and land on a sea of electricity . &#91; Ris&#93; &#91; &#91; Ris&#93; not believe a distortion of reality .
I have to use my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who wrote the man who wrote the coal was pitch , with his discovery of the hallucinogens in Mexico .
And I &apos;m my thesis not a classification of these tripamine as alucinogens , because if you &apos;re actually , you can &apos;t tell any of any hallucined .
It &apos;s possible to assume , if you get together with other chemicals that denian MAO .
Now , it &apos;s the beautiful , the moalities that are in this liana inches of MAO , the same kind of need to make the tripamine of the same guy necessary to make the tripamine . The question is spontaneous , that if you &apos;re all about about two morfological morfological , not similar , but if you &apos;re all about this way ?
We use the great eufemism of the evidence and the mistake , which can reveal infruted .
But if we ask the Indians , they say , &quot; The plants talk about &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribe , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuasks , which can tell you in the forest , and that you can get in the same species .
If you ask them how to say they think about their tasses , they say , &quot; I thought you know , &quot; I said , &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take the 17 variety in a night of the snards and each of a snat at the bottom .
And this is not graduate at Harvard at Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting that you can count the stami .
Now , &#91; applausers the problem is that even the ones of us have the Indies have the Indies are peaces them , but somehow reduced to the sea sea of the history of the history of the history of the history of the history of the world , and it &apos;s going to the real world , and it &apos;s going to the real world , and it &apos;s going to be over .
In fact , the 20th century , in 300 years , it &apos;s not going to remind for his or its technological innovations , but rather like the one was where we stop and we abbraced and we used actively abbraced or passive , or a lot of biological diversity and cultural planet . Now , the problem is not the problem .
All the cultures across the centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibility .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux , they don &apos;t stop being Sioux when they put from the arco and frecent as Americans don &apos;t stop being Americans when they put from the horse and hot .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that mines the integrity of ethnosphere . It &apos;s the power .
The wall of the domination of the domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you &apos;ll find that these aren &apos;t cultures to disappear .
They &apos;re living creatures and spines out of the existence from forced exist from the forces of adaptment .
It &apos;s that disbosygent in the Penan of the Penan --
a people names of Sarawak , in the ground of the Asian , a people who lived in the forest to a generation , and now reducing to a generation , and now reduction on the rights , and the prostitution of the rights , where you can see the inquate the wine of the waste that &apos;s waves the waste , where you &apos;re going to have to be a well-fleaves , where the horizon , where you have the horizon ,
It &apos;s ready to reempires with the forest of the forest .
Or , in the case of the Yanomami , are the diseases that came with the discovery of the gold .
If we put on the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the wall of the political domination .
As you can see the genocide , the exectively of a people , is convicted to universal level , but the destroyle of the life of a people , not only is conviction , not only is to announcement , not only is constraints , because it &apos;s part of development .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of Tibet until the beginning .
I &apos;ve been spent the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in the Western China through the Western , came to Lhasa with a young connection , but only came to Lhasa young connection , but only came to Lhasa .
6,000 monuments sacred reduces in the dust and centers .
1.2 million people killed the military during the Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascritted to the Panchen Lama .
The means that it means that it was killed at the time of the Chinese invasion .
Her guy is fuel with Sua Santity during the diaspora that has brought people in Nepal .
However , she was imprisoned and his cold was to be rich .
It &apos;s taken of birth to the age of two years , he hidden , because he couldn &apos;t live without him .
The surprising , which has done the same , it was a meal in the field of reeducation .
A day , he ended up a little bit of Mao and , for this transgression , was put on the forth of the Sinforced for seven years .
The pain of Tibet can be insopposite , but the spirit of the people is from tener .
And in the end , it &apos;s all reduces to a choice .
We want to live in the world monocromatic world or we want to get the policy of diversity ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he died told that his biggest painting was that , in our view of the world , we don &apos;t just see the whole gamma of human imagination , we don &apos;t just see the whole gamma of human imagination , but we &apos;ll see it up to a proof thinking , but a day we &apos;ll see it up to the way that there were other possibilities .
And it &apos;s uliliant to remind that our species is 600,000 years .
The Neolitica Revolution , which has given us us us to agriculture , which has made us to socking the poem of the melting of the melting of the melting of the meline of the melting of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has 300 years .
That &apos;s a story that doesn &apos;t suggests me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to deal in the millennia to come .
When these miriades of cultures the world is asked what they want to say to be human , they respond to 10,000 different different voices .
And that &apos;s in these answers that we all reflights , we &apos;re all about the possibility of being what we are : a real species , that has to make all the people and the gizes can fire .
I took this picture on the north of Baffin , when I went to the whale bale of whales with Inuit , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , and I told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The canadese government has not always been gentile with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to stabilize our sprematia , we have them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refused to go .
The family , I think for his life , and it took them all the weapons , and all his actual attreches .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t have the cold , they do it .
The paints of the slites of the origin were made of the carries in the caribes .
The grandfather of this man didn &apos;t have intimidded by the night or the bard or of the bard , and he was suffering .
It &apos;s been waste , it &apos;s hot the pantalons in focused on and defecated in their own hand . When you did it . When you did , I did have a lamp .
It &apos;s got salive on on the punta of this cold , and when I became solier , and when I became solier , he killed a dog .
It &apos;s got the dog and created a brighter , with the towel , and it &apos;s a slta , has uncaught another dog and it &apos;s gone on on the banking , and it &apos;s gone on on the banking , and it &apos;s gone .
Let &apos;s just want to talk about horrise with nothing ? &#91; Ris&#93; And this , in different ways , &#91; Applausers &#93; is the symbol of the people of the Inuit and all the Indies of the world .
In the open 1999 , the government government has reduced to Inuit &apos;s control of an area of a largest land area of California and Texas a lot of California and Texas a lot of California and Texas .
It &apos;s their new paintings . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a independent land . They have all the mineral resources .
One of the snation-state nation-state could re-re-re-re-conciliant ,
And , to end , I think it &apos;s quite obvious to the people who have been in these remote areas of the planet , I realize that they don &apos;t remote .
For somebody &apos;s home .
They open up the human imagination that they &apos;re at the alba of the human imagination that they &apos;re at the alba of these kids , as the dreams of our kids , become part of the geography of hope .
And we have , we of National Geographic , we have to convince that politicians will never be at anything .
We believe that polemics --
And so , they don &apos;t have persuasix-persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month , our re35 million visits .
156 countries transmate our television canal .
Our magazines are lets from millions of people .
Our work is traveling in the ethnosphere to bring our public places in the wonderful places that they will go away from which they will go away from how they &apos;re going to be able to be able to the central reveal in the middle of the anthrology of the exchange of the exchange in the diversity of the exchange , and we have to find a life of life in a world , and we have to find a life of life in a world , and we have to find a life in a world ,
where the wisdom of all the people can contributes to our collective well-being collective .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some of the things that I hope you &apos;ve heard about it , and I hope you &apos;ve heard and try to try to look at some connections , in case you don &apos;t notice .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the official dogma . &quot;
The dogma official of what ?
The dogma official of all the Western industrial society , the dogma official , &quot; If we want to maximize the well-being of our citizens . &quot; The way to do it is massive the individual freedom . &quot;
The reason is , from one side , in fact that the freedom is itself itself , in fact that the freedom is , useful , for human beings .
And the other is in fact that if we are free , each of us can act to do everything that we can act to do everything that that we have our well-being , no one that I decided to say in our well-name .
The way to massize freedom is massive .
And the most choices of people , more libing , and more is their freedom , is their well-being .
This , I think , is so depth in the society that nobody would dream of put it in the society that nobody would be dreamful to put it in .
And it &apos;s also deeply radical in our lives .
And I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly great .
I lose a simple note about conditions for injump .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without contact the 10 variety of olium extrant olds of olds , the whom you can buy for you a huge number of conditions in the circumstances of the 175 already .
Here &apos;s what the supermarket is .
And then you get to the electronic store , the CD store , CD , radio , lifer , light , radio , light , light , light , light , light , light .
And in this single store store , there &apos;s a great number of audio .
We can make six million different combinations using the components that are in a store .
You have to admit that there is a very much of choice .
Almost people : the world of communications .
And once I was a kid , they could get all the phone services services , at the ball services that they were proved by mom , they could have a modities from mom Bell .
They were born the phone , it didn &apos;t buy it .
And one of that , in the other , was that the phone never made .
These days are gone .
We have a nearly variety of phones , especially between the cell phones , especially between the cell phones .
Here &apos;s the phones of the future .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , P3 , cut cut off the birds of the birds , and forth to the bruleline ,
If you don &apos;t have the case you haven &apos;t seen in the house , you &apos;re very much certain that you will get .
And what is the end of the people get in the negotives and it &apos;s the question , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the acquished the same explosion of choices .
It &apos;s healthcare : : it doesn &apos;t happen in the United States that you &apos;re going to be from the doctor and you say , what you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor you say , &quot; OK , we could do it , or B , &quot; Are these benefits and these risks . &quot; You know , &quot; B has these benefits and these risks and these risks . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Dr. , what should I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; At it has these benefits and these risks , and the benefits , and these benefits . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebits , &quot; Dr. if she was me , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not like her . &quot;
The result we call it &quot; authonomy of the event , &quot; expression that it looks like a beautiful thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not that one to move the weight and responsibility to take a decisions of someone who knows something , which is the doctor , someone who knows about -- and almost certainly certainly , and almost certainly certainly , and almost certainly doesn &apos;t know in the ideal condition to make a decisions that you can make a patient .
There is a huge marketing of products pharmaceutical products , direct to people like me and you , if you think you don &apos;t have any sense , because we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why they advert them ?
The answer is that they want to ask the doctor to ask us to ask them to change the receiver .
And something that fundamental as is our identity has been a question of , as you see in this vignity , &quot; We don &apos;t want to forces the kids .
And we can reinvented us , how many times we do it .
The means that every morning , at the risis , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I &apos;m going to get the family and matriage , a long time , the common perspective , almost for anyone , was that you sed the most preserved possible , and it started to make the most presents .
The only one of the one of the ones , not when and what to do after .
So , it &apos;s really to play .
I teach them 20 percent in very smart students , and I do their 20 percent in less than a time .
And not because they &apos;re less brilliant , not because they &apos;re less diligent .
but why are they imbilities , intense to ask , &quot; I should do you feel ? &quot;
&quot; I should be going to get later ? I have to think before children or the career ? &quot;
They &apos;re interrogative interrogen .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this implica not to complete the companies that asseatment and not get a beautiful voice to my exact .
And they have to really do that . They &apos;re important questions .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , as Carl underneath , because the technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from the Hotel Randolph .
And it &apos;s parentesesthate , and I won &apos;t tell nobody where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use me .
What means , this incredible freedom of choice that we have about the work ? Is that we have to continually decide , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son play , with the cell phone , with the cell phone , the Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the notebook ,
And even if they &apos;re all spend , every minute we see that we see our son , we &apos;re also asking , we &apos;re asking , &quot; I have to answer this ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? I have to email this letter ? &quot;
And also when the answer is &quot; no , &quot; that makes the experience of your son &apos;s experience of your son &apos;s very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , from any of the look , small things and great , materials and the materials and the material of life , life is a question of choices .
And once the world was this : That , that &apos;s that there were some possibilities , but it wasn &apos;t a question of choose .
The world today is what is about this : The dilemma is , &quot; Is it a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Syelcipe .
The positive layers , we know all , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative of the negative .
All this choice is two negative effects of people .
The first , paradoxically , it &apos;s production paralysis that it &apos;s production paralysis that it &apos;s production paralysis that it &apos;s paralysis that it &apos;s paralysis that it &apos;s production paralysis that it &apos;s a lot of liberation .
And so , as many options of which choices , becomes very difficult to do it .
I give you a significant example , a study of the volunteer of volunteer .
And a connection has been taken at the data of Vanguard , the giant society of the funds of pension , with about a million clients , with about a million clients .
And what she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offering in the more , the percentage of adaptive , the percentage of two percent .
With 50 sources , there &apos;s 10 percent less less than when they &apos;re available to when they &apos;re available to when they &apos;re available to the one of them . Why ?
Because with 50 sources of which choose , is sick to decide , and the choice is rerereached to the intomorrow .
And tomorrow , and tomorrow tomorrow , tomorrow , and of course , tomorrow , and of course , tomorrow , and of course , tomorrow .
You know that it doesn &apos;t only mean that these guys are going to be a lot of money , because they &apos;re not going to say that the decision is so that the decision is so that they lose the complements of work .
They &apos;re not going to participating , they &apos;re losing to be a year from the dator of work , which would be well be .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too much choices .
And I think it &apos;s the world .
&quot; And to end , for the ethernity : ketchup , send or maionese ? &quot;
You would like to take the right decision , if it &apos;s for ethernity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong wrong , and yet the wrong condition .
So that &apos;s the first effect . The second is that even if we can avoid the paralysis and to make a choice , at the end of how we would be less options of how we would be with less options that choose .
And this for different reasons .
And one of these is that with a lot of people who choose , if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could make a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us in the hell of the choice , and the remarkable to the deminds of the decision , and the deminds the decredit , and the deminds , and the deminds ,
And also when it was a good decision .
And the choices , there &apos;s easier to be easier than any detail that is insatisfacing of the option of the choice .
And also , there is what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has been very well , it &apos;s very well as we think about the things we have .
And the rest , when there are many options of alternative exections , it &apos;s easy to represent the alternative of the alternative shot , and be less sation-made of opposition that you have choice .
Here is an example . I took with all of the ones that are not New York .
But that &apos;s what you probably think you &apos;re probably going to think .
There is this couple of Hamptons .
A place of lury .
It &apos;s all for them . Ottnties . It &apos;s all for them .
It doesn &apos;t miss anything . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , eventually , it &apos;s Agust . &quot;
&quot; Everybody my neighbors at Manhattan is on . &quot;
&quot; I could parking up in front of the house . &quot;
And it &apos;s going to spend two weeks on the idea that &apos;s perdying -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The costo-opportunity demining the sodshall for what we have , even when the choice was excellent .
And the more are the options that we have to consider , the most attracts are going to be going to be able to be on the cost of opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
It &apos;s about the moment , and maybe of living slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you choose , you choose to not do the other .
The things that we don &apos;t choose many attractive attractive that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : it &apos;s growing for the increasingly expectations .
I tried to my skin bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
It &apos;s almost always jeans .
And you know , the jeans were just like , you bought them and van and they were sed , they were sweat , just after they were sweat , just after they started to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple of new when those old who were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Li wants to do you , you know , you know , fit , fit , fit ? &quot;
You want to do it with the cernic or with the buttons ? &quot; Stonewashed , &quot; or &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; ?
&quot; Li wants to struggle ? &quot;
&quot; You know , you want to strict them ? Bla &quot; &quot; Continua -- &quot; Continugly .
I was salkiddle , and after a little bit , and I want the guy , which was the only guy , &quot; he was the only guy , &quot; he had no idea of what , so I did , I came out of the magazine , and then I came out of the magazine , and then I had ever ever .
It was the most of that choice . And so , I had the best .
But I feel worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was that I was that with all that choice , my waiting was high , jeans had to be perfect .
And I had expectations to have been expectation . I didn &apos;t expect to be a kind of , but when you saw 100 different , steps , at least a kind of thing .
And what I had been bought , but not perfect .
And after I started to talk about the chose with what I was trying to do was inexextended to expectations .
The adds of options in life of the people don &apos;t increase the expectations of the same options .
And this will make less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing is that .
Because if they knew , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more to that .
&quot; It was better when it was worse , &quot; The reason that he was better when it was worse , you know , when you were worse , you can meet the survey survey ,
In the world where we live -- opulents are , industrialized citizens with the expectations of perfetion -- the most we can hope is that things are at the altitude of the expectations .
You &apos;re not surprising to be pleasant because your waiting for you , my waiting , you have been ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Beswaiting for you . &quot;
I mean , little authographed moment -- which I really sposited and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn &apos;t do it , I don &apos;t have me .
But it &apos;s not always a bad thing .
And then , a result of the buy a couple of jeans , when there &apos;s only that kind of jeans is that you &apos;re just the kind of satisfacts , and you ask you , why ? &quot;
&quot; Who &apos;s responsible ? &quot;
The world is the responsible . What could you do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a insoddisfacing , and you ask you who is the responsible , is the responsible , is so so that the responsible is you &apos;re .
You could have better .
And with hundreds of varieties , there are not scuse for the insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even if you have a result , you feel inssatissssatisfident , and they say the same .
In the last years , depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only , but important -- of this honest depression is just that people have deludent experiences because the standard are too alts .
And when they have to explain this that the cold is their fail .
So the end result is that in general we &apos;re better , but we feel worse .
Let me reminds you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely , not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit of choosing is better than I don &apos;t have any any of that there is no one of that you don &apos;t have a little choice .
There is a critical value , magic . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m quite sure we have overed by a piece of the level where the choices are improvements our life .
Now , from political point -- I &apos;ve been nearly finished -- by the political point of political view , the nocy is the following .
What it allows all of this to the industrial society is the wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know about the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too paid .
So the facids that I &apos;m talking about is a mallexial exclusive of modern , is , the Western society .
And what it makes you depressing and angry is this : Steve Levitt has talked about how those expensive and seat at the time of the inutilary , and it &apos;s a split of money .
I mean , these choices , complicated and dispendious , it &apos;s not just that they &apos;re just inutives .
I &apos;m deleterie .
They do make worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows you to have a lot of choices in the people , it &apos;s not only their life to make it , it &apos;s not only their life to make but our .
This is what economists call a better better paretetetical .
A redistribution of income , it &apos;s good at all -- not only to poor -- because of this choice in the case that we go .
So to end , &quot; Filililder-end , you can become what you want . &quot;
You , people of culture , you think , &quot; But what makes that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t make anything in a glass of the glass . &quot;
&quot; A sense of imagination , a limited vision of the world --
and I interprepreprepreprepregnant .
But then , we think , instead , I realized that that the long knows that the long knows .
Because the reality of the fact of the fact of the frankon , so that you can &apos;t get freedom . &quot; You don &apos;t get freedom . You don &apos;t think the freedom .
If you take the bocols in the way that everything you can diminues the satisfat .
You get the paralysis , and you reduces the well-being .
They all need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too strange , maybe even even for the fish , and certainly certainly for us .
But the above some symbolic sphere is a recipe for inhappiness and , and I throw it .
Thank you .
