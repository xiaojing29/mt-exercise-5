Last year I showed these slides to show that the glacial ice ice ice ice , which is almost three million years had the size of 48 , the size of 48 United States continental , it &apos;s retroops 40 percent .
However , this underlying gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t exhibition the ice of ice .
The artica ice ice is , in a sense , the clean heart of global climate system .
It &apos;s expanded up and you &apos;re dealing .
The next slide is going to be a carrying buled by the last 25 years .
The glaces are signed in red .
And as you see , they go to the blue blue .
That &apos;s the winter ice in the winter , which is summer ice .
You can see that the cosiddle of five or more , it &apos;s like five years or more , it &apos;s like the blood , which is like the blood , which is like the blood , which is like the blood .
In 25 years , it was so that .
This is a problem because the interests that &apos;s interests the land around the arctic ocean where there are huge amount of fuel fuel fuel that , they &apos;re transformed into metane by the microbes .
I &apos;m going to totalities of the atmospheric pollution to global warming , that amount could double , overwhelming this is not return .
In some proper Alaska metan , the metal is already related from the water .
The Katey Walter &apos;s University of Alaska &apos;s team , and we &apos;ve been a team , and a team prices last winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Wow ! The question is if we &apos;re also going to be that .
One of the reason is that this is that the termal exchange the Groenland from north .
This is a river at regime .
And the ports had never reached like that .
This is the Kangerlussuaimation , in the southwest of Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level for the shelf of the glaciers on the ground , here is where it comes to the sea .
These currents are rapidly increasing .
On the other side of the planet : Antarctica , the biggest blocks of ice on the planet .
Last month , the scientists have said that the balance of ice is in negative , and that the Western Antarctica , which is the Western artide , it &apos;s particularly quick with some submarine isles , it &apos;s particularly haright-houbleg .
There was six feet of the foot of the water , like in Groenland .
Sulla Himalaya , the third greatest blocks of ice , you see new lakes , that a few years ago , they were glaciers .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population is going to get half of the water from that skills .
Sulle Ande : this glacier &apos;s the source of the water .
The ported is up .
But when it decreates , the same happens to the water .
In California , the snow on the Sierra Nevada has 40 percent .
The hyriries are in the crisis .
The predictions , as you &apos;ve read , they &apos;re grave .
The increasing certain in the world leads to a remarkable increase inceness .
The environmental disaster is increasing to a rhythm and unpreceding .
Four more numerous times in the last 30 years I was dealing on the 75 .
This is a unsustainable time .
If you look in the historical context , you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the attempt area of the East Pacific , from Americans , to the west parts of Indian subcontinent , where there is a radical radical impoverment in the ocean .
The greatest cause of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , it &apos;s the use of fossil fuels use .
oil is a problem , and coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with more emissions , together to China .
And he proponates to build a lot of other central central .
But we &apos;re seeing a change of direction .
These are the projects annullated in the last few years and some alternatives .
At any way , there &apos;s a politics fight in our country .
The oil industrial and oil has spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the pulit fuel , which is a symptoms .
That image would remember me something --
Verice , in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion liers loss of coal fourer .
You may have seen that on news .
This is the second largest flow of the highest flow in America .
It &apos;s happened around Christmas .
Naligament , the advertising of the coal industrial .
Video : Huer &apos;s Jewel &apos;s a very happy ,
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it grows our economy .
Frosty the carbon is increasingly clean .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and workers keep the workers .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest mineral society is Massey Coal . This is his administrator . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I &apos;m going to clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelososis , Harry Re-, Harry Re--- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alliance for the Clime for the Clime .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : At the next thing : At the next thing we see the climate change as a business threat to our business .
For this , our priorities is to invest a lot of money in a publicitary and confused the coal truth on the fuel .
In fact , coal , it &apos;s not spork .
We think it &apos;s a good profumo .
So , you don &apos;t prefer of climate change .
Let me do .
Video : Cbone : Carbon -- you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
So , let &apos;s do a turn into a structure at the avanguard of the pulit .
Straordinarily ! Os are a little noisy , but this is the sound of the puzzle technology .
The coal consumption is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology that you see change everything .
You look at a look : this is the hdiern odial technology .
Al Gore : Finally , the positive alternative , you can relief to economic issue and national security .
Video : America is in crisis ; national section , national security , climate crisis .
The wilk that the connection of all : our dependence from fossil fuels , like coal and oil fuel .
Now , though , there &apos;s a new , audacace solution to use .
Repower : 100 percent clean energy in 10 years .
A plan to reach America to work , make us more secure , and help stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that drink of solving our problems .
Repower .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It &apos;s about re-energy to re-energy to America .
One of the fastest ways of getting the dependence of dependence from the fuel that are killing our planet .
Comparsa : The future is here . Vent , sun , a new energy network .
Comparsa : two : New expressed by the way of work well well well well , as well , as well , as well as retributed .
I mean , Repower . It &apos;s time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old African , they say , &quot; If you want to go speed , go up with solers .
If you want to go far , you go together . &quot;
We have to go far , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED I did a LHC .
And I promises to go back to how the machine works .
So I &apos;m here . And for the ones that the other time there was , LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever attempt -- 27 kilometers of circles .
His task is to reach the conditions that were less than a mildesylights from the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
This is just ambitious .
This is the machine under Ginevra .
I &apos;d like to go to the Big Bang in the relevant .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAATLAS -- it &apos;s large 44 meters and it has a 22 meters .
This is an amazing image of ATLATLAATLAATLAATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLAS .
So , 10 section of the last year we &apos;ve pushed the machine for the first time .
And this was taken from ATLALATLAATLAATLAATLAATLATLATLATLAATLATLATLAS .
It was because of immense fescue .
It &apos;s an image of particles that he had done all the around the LHC , entrance in collision , deliberately , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles inside the detector .
In other words , when we saw that 10 section , we realized that 10 section , which was a great vinity .
I don &apos;t know if this was this is going to do more optie or this , when someone went on on Google and saw that the initial page was this .
And that means we had a cultural impact beyond that scientific ,
About a week later , there was a problem with the car , had to these films on here -- these dorts .
These films will take 13,000 ampampes when the machine works at the most power .
Now , the technical between you will look at the films and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . I &apos;m willing to be too throoms . &quot;
And they can do that because when they &apos;re very cold to become the soils .
So , at least 271 degrees , at a lower temperature temperature to the space between the stars , these films can bring that current .
In one of the gigye yguntures between the magnetic LHC , there was a defect of factory .
So the films surrise , and the 13,000 ampamparized , and the 13,000 ampamparized a electricity .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think that these magnees are more than 20 tons , and that &apos;s moved about 30 centimeters .
They &apos;re damaged about 50 magnetic magnees .
We had to take them , what we did .
We re-wells .
Now , they &apos;re going back to their underground .
I end up the LHC is will be a new integrate .
We will accept it , and we expect to jugggggggggggames , and continue our adventure to find out what the universe is going to make the universe .
Now , of course , in some ways , these accidents reaching the value of science and the values of science and the frontier engineering . It &apos;s easy to confutures . It &apos;s easy to confutures .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s so hard to go beyond the limits , I think it &apos;s the value of things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of a scientist Inglad Davy , Humphrey Davy , which , I guess , in defense of the experiments of his clean up , his pupillo was Michael Faday , he said , &quot; Nothing is so much for the progress of the human mind as rhythenenenenening as as the ritenenenes , and that &apos;s all of our triumber , and that doesn &apos;t make us . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start asking about rethinking about when you , you &apos;re playing with children , you &apos;d play with the morning .
As you could get them to go and grab them , and you get them and move them , and you &apos;re actually learning to think and solve problems and by doing and by the space relationships .
Now , the space of the way we understand most of the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , from the useful information that &apos;s the use of our interaction with physical objects , together to my Patatattached , and the collaborator Jeevan Kalanii , I began to ask , &quot; And if , when we use a computer , instead of having the only one treatment of the mouse as a digest pypass that we could grab it on a desktop , we could have to grab that it &apos;s definitely information with both , and their hands ,
and do you fix it ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftune is a big interactive computer as a biscotto .
In a few words , a Siftune is a big interactive computer as a biscotto .
You can move with your hand , you can see them , &quot; you can see , &quot; they &apos;re just listening and they have a screen and radio radio .
But mostly , they &apos;re physical objects , like the morning , you can move them .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physicists , they know of their movement , other other , and as they become more physical , of the other other , as they become more physical , of the other way of the other , how we can explore new and interaction , of how we can explore new and interaction .
I &apos;m going to start with some simple example .
This Siftargets is to show video : if you cline video : if you include it in one direction , the video will rotate like this , if you cline on the other hand .
These interactive portraits are aware of the other .
If I release , you know what they &apos;re going to be around .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can act a little bit .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can act a little bit .
They also have their own and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was that we could use common gestures on data , for example , &quot; we put a color on a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configured out as a verb , and I can use them to the poulder , and I can use them to go .
and I can use them to the color in that central , where they &apos;re missing .
If we &apos;re too too , we can put a little bit of it .
And there are also beautiful possibilities of learning , like languages , the mathematics and logic games where people can try things very quickly , and see the results of the things quickly .
Now I &apos;m --
This is a Fibonacks us to do with a pleasant equations program .
Here we have a game of words that &apos;s in half of Scarabeo and Boggle .
Basically , at every time you get a letter to case on every Sifresh , basically , at every Turn every Siftable , to every time , and as you &apos;re trying to understand the words of a dictionary .
And then , after about 30 seconds , you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the children came up in the Middle Lab , I did so that I &apos;d come up and I went out a video .
They &apos;ve liked very much .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
You just have to say , &quot; You know , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here is other people who try it .
This is our Tibeta youngest tester , there on the right .
It was actually wanted to imple .
They were only the morning , for him .
Now , this is an appliance of a interactive cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool for learning . He &apos;s called &quot; Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , lifting the Sifresh of them associated with .
It can put new characters in the scene , lifting the Sifresh of them associated with .
So , it &apos;s going to go out the sun .
Video : The sun is surprising .
David Merrill : Now he took a treatment in the scene .
Video : The aranange treatment .
Bobs !
So , you shake out the Siftons and put them close them ,
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing your story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a open story with open , and it can decide him as he gets .
DM : It &apos;s a open story with open , and it can decide him as he gets .
Video : Got , shake .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool that I made up a tool , to sample and performing music .
it &apos;s a tool , which is made of a tool , to sample and performing music .
The Siftable here agree from sounds like the basis , and battery .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose which use .
You can also , you can put these sound in a sequence of your pleasure .
And it just by doing a sound and a sequence .
These are actually you can control from alive , like the rivers and the filter .
And then you acks to a particular particular sound and then incline for the wandering .
And then there are general effects as time and volume , that you &apos;re appliance to the whole sequence .
Let &apos;s look at how it works .
DM : DM : We will start putting a base in two Sifresh sequence , &quot; We fix &quot; sequence , we put it in a series , we add on . We add to the other base .
Now , I put a line of the line .
DM : DM : Now I added percussions --
Video : DM : And now I &apos;m going to put the battery on the battery , so I can control the effect from live .
DM : DM : I can I make the whole sequence of the whole sequence of time , or the other .
DM : DM : I &apos;m going to add the bottom of the bottom to give more expression .
DM : DM : I can reach the sequence of the flying flight .
So I didn &apos;t have to plan this first , but I can suddenly , make it longer or more correct .
And now , finally , I can smoking the whole sequence of inclining the left Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new human interfacts that it &apos;s more and more resemble as our brain .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some possibilities that we &apos;re trying to bring out of the lab .
And the concept I want to move to is that we &apos;re going to do with digital media , which is to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time to talk to you with all .
I &apos;m a writer .
I &apos;m books , it &apos;s my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the fascinating of my life .
And I don &apos;t expect it to change .
But , I said this , something particular particular happened in my life and my career , which I brought me to reealibrate the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing I &apos;ve recently written this book , this biography called &quot; Mangia , Prega , &quot; which , diversity from my previous books , for some reason that was there in the world and become a great feeling , interational bestseller .
And the result is that everywhere now , people are treating as if I was convicted .
Really -- conducted , conducted !
They &apos;re all come from me now and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t fear you couldn &apos;t be able to do better ?
You don &apos;t fear to go out and write all of life without being able to create a book that can improve a book that can improve someone ? &quot;
what can you have to improve someone ? &quot;
It &apos;s reassuring , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I began to say to people -- I was an adolescent writer -- I was an adolescent writer .
I would go to the same reaction based on the fear .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you feel me to get successful ?
You don &apos;t afraid the humiliation of refigures you ?
You can &apos;t fear to do this up for all life without life , and that nothing else is ever out and to die on a cumb of any violating violating cumers with the mouth of failures of wild failures ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
Yeah , I &apos;m afraid of all the things .
I &apos;ve always had afraid .
And I also fear of many other things that people can &apos;t inform .
Like the algae and other things very frightening .
But , as I was saying , what I was thinking and I was asking myself the ultimally is why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logical that anyone has to expect to be frightened by a job that you &apos;ve been born to do .
But what is there &apos;s so creative in the business of the creative companies that are the mental as well as as a other career , in a way that other career don &apos;t they do ?
How my father was a chemical engineer and I don &apos;t remember one time in his 40 years of activity in his 40 years of activity in which he was asked if he was an engineer ?
There was never -- that blocof engineer John , how do you ?
It wasn &apos;t working like that , you know ?
Onestally , chemicals like a group have no certainly , in the centuries , in the reputation of being alcolized .
We have a writers , we have enough this reputation , and not only not only the writers , but we &apos;ve got this reputation of being huge instables .
And it &apos;s not going to look at the sad of the sad of the magnifts of creative magnifts that only in the 20th century , dead young and often by hand .
And the ones that don &apos;t have suicked to be really disfacts from their dones .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , &quot; Each of my book has killed me a little bit more . &quot; A remarkable thing about his work .
But we don &apos;t throw it when we feel that because we &apos;ve heard these things so long that we &apos;ve completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and the suffering are in some related way with and that art , at the end , it will always be to the angosion .
And the question I want to ask everybody here today is : you agree with this idea ?
It &apos;s OK , that &apos;s what -- because it also looks like a centimeter to me doesn &apos;t really do anything that &apos;s good for nothing to do this .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous , and I don &apos;t want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better encourage our big creative creative minds .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- in my situation -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous , to that felt dark , overeign the circumstances in which I &apos;m in my career .
That &apos;s a lot of -- you know , I &apos;m rather young , I have about 40 years old .
I still have about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely to write about what he &apos;s going to write about the world , as the work that came out after the savelevent success of my last book .
I &apos;m going to schiure , because we &apos;re all more or less friends here -- it &apos;s likely to be in my own shoulder .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that it leads to a person to start dying to nine in the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would keep doing this work that I love .
So , the question is , how do you ?
And so I think , after a lot of thinking , after a lot of working on to continue writing is to create a protective psychological construct , OK ?
I have to find a security distance between me , I &apos;m writing , and my natural race on which reaction that can get . And as I was going to go through the time , trying to find other society , trying to find other societies to see if they could have some better ideas and more healthy ideas more more and more healthy ideas and more societies to see if they could have better ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthy ideas
about how to help people manage the emotions of the emotional risk of creativity .
And that research I brought to the ancient Great and ancient .
I &apos;m going to go back and then comes back .
In the ancient Great and ancient -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
And they thought creativity was this spirit looks like this , and that came to men from a few distant and that came to men somewhere surprising and unknown , for distant reasons and unknown .
The Greeks were these spirits of the deones of creativity .
Socrate , wonderful , he believed to have a deelargive dealing from far .
Romans were the same idea , but they were called that kind of spirit without a genius .
And what &apos;s great , because the Romans didn &apos;t really think a genius were someone who &apos;s smart particularly smart .
They believed that a genius was this kind of divine that was living in literally in the walls of a study of a little bit of the artist , a little bit like the elevant element of the artist , and it came out to hide the work of that artist and models the outcome of that work .
Here &apos;s east -- here , that &apos;s the distance of which I &apos;m talking about -- that , that psychological construct that you protect from your work work .
And everybody knew it was so that it worked , right ?
So , antiks were antiks protected from certain things , as well as narcies , for example , no ?
If your work was exceptional , you couldn &apos;t take it all the deserred , everyone knew that you were helped by this genius .
If your fails work , it was not all your fail work , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a incapable .
And so people have the creativity in the West for a long time .
And then the Rended came up and everything , and it turned out , and it was a big idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe on the center of the universe on the mysties , and they descend up detached from the divinity .
This was the principle of the rational principle and people began to think that creativity came out of the creativity came from their hydivide .
And for the first time in history , you start that to refer this , or that artist as a rather than a genius that is as a person with the genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think it allows someone , a simple person to believe that it &apos;s like a recipient , as a source , as a source , and the source of all the divines , creative , unknown and unknown to be a loud of human page .
It &apos;s like to ask someone to enjoy the sun .
I &apos;m depending and completely distors and it makes all of these ingestials on the performance .
And I think it was this pressure to destruction artists in the past 500 years .
And if that &apos;s true , and I think it &apos;s , the question is , and now ?
Can we do that diversity ?
Maybe you would have to a more ancient understanding of human relationship and mystery creative .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t take 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience who would be leaving scientific suspects on the notion of , you do , you know , they follow people straight on their own own own own their projects .
I &apos;m probably not going to convince you all about this .
But the question I &apos;d like to ask is -- why isn &apos;t it ?
Why wouldn &apos;t you think about this way ?
Because it has more sense of anything else that has ever heard of the exasperating imprevedability of the creative process .
And so , as anyone who ever attempt to do something -- so , you don &apos;t really understand here -- you don &apos;t understand rationally .
And in fact , it can be a completely paranormess .
I &apos;ve done this recently with the extraordinary Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but it was a very poetest for all life and he said to me during his own childhood in the Virginia , and he felt it , in fact , in if when a poetry to do it , when a poetry to do it .
She said he was like a train frageous train .
And that was going to roling her from the landscape .
And it felt , because he was doing the ground down under his feet .
He knew that you had one thing to do at that point and he was , words , &quot; run as a matta . &quot;
And so he was going to home and he was followed by this poetry , and have not to do it to take a piece of paper and a match enough match enough , as the trapart , and grab it on the page .
Other time he couldn &apos;t be fast , so correcal and corrective hanging , and he was going to go back home and her poetry and go her and forced her out and she would continue to roll through the landscape , trying to , as she said , &quot; another poet . &quot;
And then there were those times -- this is not forced -- there were moments when there were moments when it was almost losing , OK ?
So he was running home and he was trying to paper and poetry her through , and he was trying to get a match in the while he was going , and he said , he was like you hallway up with the other hand and the office .
And he was offered poetry from the tail and repair it in his body and transmit on the page .
And in these cases , poetry , you &apos;ve presented on the perfect page , but the contrary , from the last word to the first word .
So when I was thinking -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly the same as a creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conduction !
I &apos;m a mule , and my way of working is ; I &apos;m wake up to the same orary every day and go and go up and go on the himself and work on the himself .
But even I , in my aggin , I &apos;ve striped against that thing , sometimes .
And I guess a lot of you have the han done .
You know , even if the work and ideas came to me from a certain source of a source , I could not be honestly aware .
And what is this ?
And how can we relate to it so that we can &apos;t lose your head , but rather , than we can remain healthy us ?
As I think about , the best example of the same contemporary I have is the Tom Waits , I interviewed several years ago .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life was the incarnation of the art of the incarnation of the art of the deeption of the foundation of creativity .
But then he invecked , he hot , and one day , he was driving on a highway in Los Angeles , he changed everything for him .
It was going fast and it all of a very dish of this little framment of apples , coming in in his head as inspiration , elusiva and housing , and the desidera , and the desidera , but it doesn &apos;t know how to take it .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a match .
So , it starts to feel this kind of old anxiety , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to go up with this song even .
I &apos;m not enough , I &apos;m not good enough and do it . &quot;
And instead of going to the panic , he stopped .
And he got the whole of the mental process and he made something completely new .
He just looked at the sky and he said , &quot; Sorry , don &apos;t you see that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Do you know what to write a song ?
If you really want to be able to be more hurt when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , you &apos;re going to import somebody else today .
You &apos;re going to disturbing Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his work process changed after this .
Not the work , the work was still dark as always .
But the process , and the fish that was reduced it was released when the genius , the genius out of him , the genius out of him .
But it &apos;s not a lot of peculiar , collaboration , a conversation between Tom and this strange thing that &apos;s out of Tom .
So , how I felt that story I was going to change a little bit of the way I worked out and already saved me once .
This idea , I was saved when I was writing , &quot; Prega , &quot; and fall in one of those cave of the desperation of the cave of the desperation we &apos;re all working on something and we can start thinking that it &apos;s going to be a disaster , which is the worst book .
Not just good , the worst book .
And I began to think of the project .
But then I remember Tom , I was talking to the air and I tried .
So I got up my face on on the manoscritical and I was dealing my comments on a room .
And I said high voices , &quot; You know , both , what both of us know that if this book is not going to be hillightly , you know that if this book is not going to be holder , you know that if this book is not going to be hillighting , &quot;
Because I &apos;m seeing it , I &apos;m putting all I have , I don &apos;t have that more than that .
So if you want you to be better , you have to show you and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , you don &apos;t do anything .
I &apos;m going to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to be recorded that I was today to do my part . &quot; Because -- eventually , that &apos;s so -- OK -- the end of the Northern Africa &apos;s people were joining the deserts of the lone , dance and the music that went on and the room and and and and and sacred that they were going on to the room .
And they were always magnifts because the dancers were pretty fantastic .
But every one of these , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became really transcender .
And I know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know what I &apos;m talking about , to a point , a performance .
It was like the time you stop , and the dance would walk through a kind of portal , and it was not doing anything different from the usually , like 1,000 noticed , like the 1,000 noticed , but it was all the way up .
And suddenly , you don &apos;t just look like a human .
But he came from the divinity , and it &apos;s the fire of divinity .
And when this happened , the people knew what he was , they called him up with her name .
And they were , they were starting to sing , &quot; Allah , Allah , God , God , God , God , God , God , God , God , God , &quot; God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
I was historic notes -- when the Mororders invaded this habits with them and the ready to them and the ready to go to the centuries in the day-from &quot; Allah , &quot; Allah , &quot; Ole , &quot; which you can still feel in the corrids or in the corride or flamenc .
In Spain , when an artist has done something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , the guy , Allah , the magnification , Allah , &quot; uncomprehensive , &quot; uncomfortable , &quot; Human , &quot; Hyelf , &quot; Allah , &quot; Allah , &quot; Allah , &quot; Allah , &quot; Allah , &quot; Allah , and magic , &quot; Allah , &quot; Alah , &quot; Hundry , &quot;
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes next day after , for the dancer itself , when you wake up and you see that are the 11 in the morning of Martedesday and the last one is the last one .
It &apos;s just a very bad dead in the ginoccurs , and maybe it &apos;s not going to get more to that altitude .
And maybe no one will sing the name of God while it comes up , and what &apos;s going to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most sweet reconciliations to do in a creative life .
But maybe it &apos;s not to be so angosciant if you can &apos;t believe , you know , you know , the most extraordinary aspects of your being being from you .
But just believe that you &apos;re given data in the preserve from a unimaginable source of this team of your life that &apos;s part of your life that you have to go to someone else when you finished .
And , you know , if you think of this way .
And so I began thinking about it , and it &apos;s certainly like I thought about it for several months during the working on the work that I &apos;m going to soon in the work that I &apos;m going to do with my great great attempt acting , and I was the very successful ,
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel electrized from this is , not being being electrized .
Don &apos;t flow you . It &apos;s just your work .
And you have to show you for your part , any of the way .
If your work is dance , you dance .
If the divine , you genius assigned decides to leave some of wonderful , for a moment through your effort , for one moment through your efforts , then &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Otherwise , you do the same dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot;
I think and I think it &apos;s got to teach it .
&quot; Oh , &quot; to you know the same , even for having human love and testablishesty testing you will require continuously .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
You know , I &apos;ve talked about some of these human plans on what human genes , what it can mean and the new set of genes .
Now we &apos;re starting a new path : we start digalize biology and now starting to digitize the digital code we &apos;re going into a new phase of biology , designing and synthesizing and synthesizing life .
We &apos;ve always tried to ask big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists believe that they &apos;ve been trying to figure out out of levels .
We tried different approaches , reducing it to the minimum terms .
We &apos;re digitize for about 20 years ever .
When we sequenced the human genome was treating to go from the analogy world &apos;s the digital world of computers .
Now we ask : can we regenerate life , or create new from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome between those that can authoretic genome in the lab .
And we tried to reduce a genome to create a little little little more .
We can be able to eliminate a hundred genes of the 500 that I &apos;m here .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our .
I think of myself , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this can bring into a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to make it synthesize was synthesizing this chromosome so that we could change the components to ask some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of &quot; Can we synthesize a ? &quot;
Can you have the chemistry condies to make these big molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create before ?
And in case , we can make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemical material that is inert .
The speed with which we can digitize life is growing up exponential rhythm .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , design , rather slowly , but it &apos;s getting better .
And our more recents the results get it on a exponential curve .
We started more than we started more than we were started .
The process required a lot of steps , starting with a bioethical review before the experiments .
But we found that DNA is that synthesize is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that producing little segments of DNA , the length of 30 to 50 letters and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the more mistakes .
So we had to develop a new way to assemble these fragments and correct the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , starting from the digital information genome of Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , we &apos;ve made the correction of the mistakes and get a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material inert , and we put it into bacteria , they &apos;ve started reading this genetic code and make viral particles .
The viral particles have been released by cells , they go back and they &apos;re destroyed .
I &apos;ve talked about recently with the time and the time industry to say , &quot; I think it &apos;s certainly understood this model .
They &apos;ve got more of you .
We think this is a situation where the software can really build the same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the bigger things .
We wanted to build the whole chromosome of bacteria .
They &apos;re more than 580 mixture letters .
So we thought we &apos;ve got to build it in cassette of the virus , so that we can change the cassette to understand what the components are the components of a living cell .
The design is critical , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these are very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard accuracy was a mistake for every 10 midden mums .
We &apos;ve discovered , resequencing it , 30 errors . If we were used that original sequence we &apos;d never be able to work .
One part of the process is designing segments 50 letters to make 50 letters that overwhelming with all other segments of 50 letters to build smaller underounce that they work together .
We try to take a unic elements here .
You &apos;ve probably read that we put the filigrain .
So , think about it , we have a genetic code based on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters , put up about 20 amminds of acids , and there &apos;s a specific order of letters for every amamamamminds .
So we can use the genetic code to write , frasases , thoughts .
What we did the beginning was authogen .
Some people have been delused by the fact that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
We designed these segments to be able to just joining them with enzymes .
There are some of them relate and put them together .
And we started assembly of the parts , starting with five to seven mix them , and we &apos;re starting with five to seven mix them , and they &apos;re going to form segments of 24 mile mix , and then then the letters to 72 mile .
So , every step we made these segments in abundance so that we could sequencing it because we &apos;re trying to create a very robust process that we &apos;re trying to create a very robust -- as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems the tabellon a basket player .
When we get these very long segments , more than 100 mies , more than 100 mixes , it doesn &apos;t grow directly more directly in the E.
You get to the modern molecular biology .
So we &apos;ve looked at other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called the reomologist , which is in biology to repair DNA to repair DNA to repair DNA to unting to get the DNA segments .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinoccurred to the radiation , it can absorb three million radiation .
You can see in the upper rightly like his chromosome is destrucks .
In 12 , 24 hours , it &apos;s just like it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely dry .
They can live under empty .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life exist in space , and you can find new environments .
Actually , NASA showed that this is happening .
This is a molecule image that we built using these processes , just using these processes , just using this stuff , using these processes from the design of the segments of the design that we &apos;ve built .
The automatically assembust them .
This image was not taken with a electric microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It &apos;s a lot of molecule that we can see it with a little microscope .
These are pictures that cover a period of six seconds .
This is the publication that we did a little time .
They &apos;re more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the greatest molecule structure ever created by the man .
It has a 300 million molecular weight .
If we &apos;re going to do with a 10 without spaces , we want to 142 pages to move this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ? How can we activate it ?
Of course , you &apos;re going to be a game .
It &apos;s a little more complicated when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s easier even when it comes from eucarily cells as our : you can just pull the nuclear , and put another one more , which is basically the process of cloning .
In the archaea bacteria , the chromosome is integrated inside the cell , but we &apos;ve recently shown that we &apos;re able to do a complete trapizing of a chromosome from one cell to another and acvote it .
We can clean a chromosome from a microbial species .
The two are different as men .
We added some gene more in a way we could decide which to choose to choose what to chromosome .
And then I was melt with the enzymes so that it &apos;s killing all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was amazing -- and you &apos;ll open our soft graph -- the new chromosome is going into the cell .
And we were thinking that we couldn &apos;t go further , but we tried to get us more in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that tantissim species have added a second or a third chromosome somewhere , I added a second thousands of new traits .
So , who think about evolution as a gene once you change doesn &apos;t really get much of biology .
There are some enzymes called the restrials of restrition that even digits DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell , you couldn &apos;t have one .
The mobile phone -- the chromosome that we put it on .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other chromosome as a material , and he had a chromosome , and we found out with only the cell and the new chromosome .
it &apos;s become blue because of the genes that we put .
And in a short time , all the feature of a time , all the feature of a species , and it turned into a new species , based on the new software that we put into a new species , based on the new software .
All the proteins have changed , members have changed , and when we read the genetic code itself itself to what we &apos;ve moved to the genetic code exactly what we &apos;ve moved .
Now , this may seem to be genetic alchemy , but by allowing DNA , we can change things in a very substantial way .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that here is not about genesis -- but progress from three million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the Cambriana explosion of Cambriana in which you will be created new species of this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s enough obvious when we think about the need .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion and a half billion people to 9 billion in the next 40 years .
I was born for example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each other in 1946 ; 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medicine and wellin for six billion and a half billion people .
It &apos;s going to be more hard to nine billion .
We use more five billion fuel barrels , more than 30 billion barrels .
That means percent million barrels a day .
When I call it to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replace them , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
We have to keep all of the CO2 emission from these materials that end up in the atmosphere .
At the day , thank you to the scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the design components for the future .
The electronic industry , only only only one dozen about components , and you think about how many different things came out .
Our limits here is data , principle and from our imagination .
Now we have some techniques , thank you very quickly , to these methods of synthesization , that can create what we call a combinatory ,
We can build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think of the 20s , you think of the 20s or to try to optimize the processes to produce optimize those 20 million different , we can change , because of a little team , and create more molecular biology now in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemical or production or chemical vaccines , production of ethc vaccines .
This is an instantanetic of some software programming software that we &apos;re working on to be able to seat and design species on the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t necessarily know how they will be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
Now we &apos;re focusing on fourth generation .
You also see , you &apos;ve also seen that from the grain was a hurt experiment .
We have depending on the third generation that will be used enough to be soon soon soon soon by the sugar to be higher than they are or different butanle , or different butanle .
But the only way biology to have a big impact without increasing the cost of food and limb the cost of food and limb the willing to turn CO2 in the matter before we &apos;re working out to design cells that can achieve the ability to turn out out out out the fourth generation in about 18 months .
War with CO2 is a metodo--- but in our discoveries in the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It &apos;s in the deep ocean , at about 2,500 feet of depth of the webollition of water .
It creates metane by CO2 using molecular hydrogen as a source of energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand whether we can ing CO2 , which can easily be brought through the tubes , convert that CO2 in fuel , to drive this process .
So we can think that we can be able to increase what the question of &quot; is what &apos;s life is , &quot; is we , versus the bits of the goal of replacing the whole oil industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where do you do ?
It would be a major source source of energy .
Also , we &apos;re working on the same methods to create instantanezing vaccines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with flu , we &apos;re always forth of a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s about the flu vaccine .
I think what you can change combinable vaccines in anticius .
Here is how the future might start to look , now , the tree of evolution , accellyating evolution with synthetic bacteria , arches , and finally eating cells .
We &apos;re so much so much better than people .
Our purpose is to make it .
So , first of all I &apos;m going to show you , the faster , some fundamental work , some fundamental work , in the new technology that we brought Microsoft in the purcheck , just a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s a environment where you can interact with is local level that remode with a huge amount of visual data .
We &apos;re seeing here , many gigabyte of digital photograph with a kind of zoom , continuous zones , for a very quickly , for a very quickly , despite the images like we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much the amount of information that we see , how big these are collected of data or the images .
Most of the digital photographs , but this is for example , is a scan coming from the Library of Congress , and it comes in in the launch of 300 megamma .
It doesn &apos;t make a difference because the one thing that limits its its prestations of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen at any time . It &apos;s a very flexible architecture . It &apos;s also a very flexes . It &apos;s also a very flexible architecture . It &apos;s also a very flexel architecture . It &apos;s also a very flexels architecture .
This is a whole , example of the data doesn &apos;t have images .
This is the Dickens . Every column . Each hell .
To demonstrate that it &apos;s just about textent and not of images , we can do something like that , to really see that it &apos;s a real representation of the textbook , not of a picture .
It could be an artificial way to read an electric book .
I don &apos;t advised it .
This is a very realistic example . It &apos;s a number of The Guardian .
Every big image is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the nice experience of reading the real real version of a magazine or of a daily view , which is for a multi-type of a half .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the Guardian .
We created a high-resolution advertising fashion -- much higher than that you use in a normal publicle -- and we put you in the extra content .
If you want to see the feature of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
And we hope that that means to put people on and other similar , and to bring out of similar , not to be necessary .
Of course , the mapaps is one of the poorest applications for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say that we have contributing to give you in this field .
These are all the roads in the United States overwhelming geospace on on a NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually live on the Web ; you can go and see it .
It &apos;s a project called Photososynth , who &apos;s a few different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual computer that &apos;s very interesting computer made by Noah Snavely , a student of the University of Washington , with Steve Seitz of Microsoft Rick Szeliski .
And it &apos;s live on the web , I was management by Seadragon .
You can see that when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from one image to the other and have this kind of experience to multiple resolution .
But the space of the images here actually a meaning .
The visualization algorithms of the computer have recorded these images together , so that it &apos;s correspond to the real places where you imagine -- all the next to the launch the Grasis on the Montagne Roccious dog -- have been taken . So here you see the elements of a de-sho-stable view of elements of a de-stable slides or imaging , and these things have been all connected to space .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original set of Noah-data set from a previous prototype of the first time we &apos;ve done the first time the summer -- to show you what I think is the first summer . And so it &apos;s really the key behind this technology , Photososynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily evidence to the the ambers that we put in the website .
We had to worry about legal legal aspects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of Nobody Dame &apos;s cattle . Bauctar . Bauction Nothing three Dame in Flickr and you get images of types in shirt , and you get a picture of these things that is discovered a picture that it &apos;s discovered that it was a picture that &apos;s discovery to this model .
So they &apos;re all images from Flickr and they were all all spatial connected to the spatial level in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to igate this very simple .
You know , I would never end up to work for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifying to get this kind of accounting here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of photocamers : from those cell cell cell phones that SLR professional , and a significant number , and it &apos;s significant number , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to try to look the more strange .
Many blocks from faces , etc .
Somewhere you have a series of photographs -- here .
This is a Nobody . Dame recorded correctly .
We can go from the physics to the physical of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is taking from the whole data -- from the whole collective memory of how you &apos;re going to look at the Earth , from visual point of visual view -- and connects all that data together .
All those pictures become connected together , bigger than the sum of the parts .
You have a model of the whole land that emerges .
Think about this as the prolungation of Stephen Lawler &apos;s of the work of Stephen Lawler &apos;s work on the virtual Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as people use it , and the whose advantage to use .
Their pictures are marched with metaphors with other people .
If someone is is the idea of contrast all these sets say , my picture of my name , my picture of Nothing &apos;s Cath-three DDemadmitty of all that data , and I can use it as a place of ingress for diving me in that space , in that way , using anyone else , and have an experience of the cross-user .
Of course , a consequence of all that are virtual models of any interesting virtual , that &apos;s very elaborated virtual models and from satellite images and from satellite images and similar , but from the collective memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized that ? What &apos;s your software is going to be doing is that at some point in the next few years , all the photographs that you &apos;ve got all all the photographs with everyone in the whole world will be connected by everyone in the whole world will be very , very connected ?
BAA : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is basically is to find out .
It &apos;s making hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the images .
What is really interesting is if you think about the wealth of information seant that many of these images .
As you can do a research of images on the web , you have a sentence and the text on the web page , the Web page has a lot of information about pictures .
Now , what happens if you have the picture you connected to all your pictures ?
So , the amount of injection interconnection and the amount of wealth that comes out of it is really huge . It &apos;s a classic network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible . Compliments .
BAA : thank you very much .
One of the main lights when you travels and one of the ethnographic research is the way to live in who have no forgotten the antic traditions , between the host the past in the wind , and the stick , you touch it in the wind , and the stands .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re shamani Jaguar , they still travel over the Via Lattea , or the elequals of Inuit &apos;s still the respect of significance , or in Himalaya , the distinct of the central Dharm , to remember the central of the anthropology , and the idea that the world we have no matter in a sense of reality , but it &apos;s a reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of adaptive choices that our own stirpful stopped , or many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential trawers .
We all procream .
We are subjects to rhythas .
We have to deal with death of , so we don &apos;t surprisingly surprisingly , if we &apos;re talking about it , and we &apos;re alalallowing .
We all have an art .
What it hits is the particular rhythm of the song , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that they &apos;re the forests of the forests of Borneo , or the follow of Haiti , or the desert &apos;s desert Kaign in Kenya , in the entrional Sahara .
And he was my journey in the desert a month ago , or a yak hallway of Qomolangma in Qomolangma , on the mother of the world .
All of these populations teaches us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And if you think of a moment , it &apos;s a concept that it can give you hope .
Together , the miriades of the world create a spiritual , cultural life that happens to be a spiritual , and it &apos;s important for the well-being of the planet as biosphere as biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural spilling as a ethnosphere and you can define the etnosphere , the total of all the concepts of all the concepts , and inspirations , ideas , inspirations , intuition brought from being from being the human imagination of the foods of .
etnosphere is the great potential of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and of what we can be as as a kind of inquisitive .
And because biosphere was very much consumed as it &apos;s been so much more rapidly .
Nobody biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all the species has been or is on the east of the extinction simply because it &apos;s fake , or -- in the most apocalyle -- in the most apocalyptic field -- and you can &apos;t even get a little bit more mystery -- that is the most optial hypothesis , the most optional hythesis , and you don &apos;t even get a little bit more ophit .
The survey of all that is , of course , the language loss .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not a language of a vocabulary or a series of grammas , or a series of rules .
One language is the spring-up of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle that the soul of every culture comes in in the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a stick , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re sitting in in Monterey , at least half not being sussurrounded in the ears of the children .
They &apos;re not teaching children , which means , unless , they have no longer bedded .
What is more sad is more sad than the silence , of the last one of the last talking about a language , the last last one language , you don &apos;t have a way to transmit the wisdom of the promise of the children ?
This is a fair state of someone in a few places of the world every two weeks : every two weeks , every two weeks , every two weeks , every two weeks , every old lingua .
And I know somebody who will say , &quot; Is it better ?
The world would not be a better place if we were talking to all the same language ? &quot; Watch , then we &apos;re all yoruba .
We talk about kogi .
You &apos;ll find a sudden what it means you can &apos;t talk to their language .
I &apos;d like to do a journey through the etnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a above what we &apos;re lost .
Many of us forget that when I say &quot; different ways of existing , &quot; I mean , very different ways of existing .
Let &apos;s take for example , this Barasana , in the Amazon section , the people of the anaconda , which creds on the midst of coming from the side of the side of the west in the severe of the poured sets .
It &apos;s a people who can &apos;t be able to distinguish the blue color from green because the time cell , you depend in the forest of the forest , where it depends on the people .
They have a strange language and a matrig rule , said , &quot; exogamia language , &quot; You have to marriage a person talking about a different person talks about a different language .
And all of that has root in the mythological past , is that in these families , is that in these families six to seven languages because of the matririse of mystery , no one language .
They &apos;re just listening and then they start talking about .
We take one of the most interesting tribe with , the Waorans of the Ecuador , a great people of Eastern Eastern , an incredible people that had the first contact in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionaries have tried a contact error .
They &apos;ve been going down on the top photographs that they reduced them to make a lot of people who were willing that this people in the forest pluent forest that this people in the forest plug .
They &apos;ve collected the photograph from the Earth , they turned out to the form or a figure , and not find anything , they have concluse that was going to be the hell , and they killed five missionals with the lance .
But Waorans don &apos;t just have foreign &apos;t just the foreign &apos;t killer .
They were killing between them .
54 percent of mortality was caused by their own .
We were saving eight generations and we found two of natural death , and when we &apos;ve been bought to know , they admitted that one of them was invecked , and then they killed it itself . And then they killed it itself .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine for 40 pass and recognize that species .
In the first &apos; 80s , I was assigned a very interesting task when my Harvard professor , I asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti in my secret secret with the power of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutpy , and the Tonton Macout-sum zones .
To make a sense of the miraculous , I would have to understand Vodoo culture and that Voodoo is not magic .
It &apos;s a very complex metaphance of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the big religions of the world , what do you say ?
Christianity , Islam , Buddhism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no religious faith . And instead , and the Voodoo is , and the Voodoo is not the distillustrated by the way , of these religious concepts .
What makes the interesting voodoo is the intense intense relationship between life and death .
So , the ones are going to hide the spirits .
The spirits can be invocated by the Great Actually , they respond to the rhythm of dance and replace time replace time to the living as a short active active active active active active active active active active active to the follow soul .
And so , for this voodooists say , &quot; You go to talk about God .
We &apos;re dancing in the temple , and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re sitting , is the spirit that you , how can you get you wrong ?
So you see these incredible events : you &apos;ve got these incredible events . The woodoo in state of trance that touch impunishment , a rather strong demonstration of the body when it &apos;s catalyzed in a state of extremely excitation .
I &apos;m all the people with which I have been living in the most extraordinary is Kogi Serra Nevada de Solar Marta . Colombia &apos;s in the entrional Solombia .
They have to be a lot of the tyrangement that once lived on the charge of the charge of the Colombia on the charge of the comment of , the people would be on the volcanic massassment that you have to be on the charge plan .
In a macaries of blood , this people have never been conquered by the spageed .
But I &apos;m today , they &apos;re governmental formation is very extraordinary .
The young people are brought away from families to three or four years , and they live secreted in a good world , and they &apos;re living in a good world of buium frozen flights for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years of the proposal to produce nine nine months of gestation that they go into the user of mother , now , they &apos;re in metaphuter in the US &apos;s laws .
For this time , they &apos;re accululated to the values of their society , values that are the prayers and only their prayers to keep the foreign balance -- or to say the most of the foreign balance .
And so the term of this incredible initiation , they &apos;re all taken out and for the first time in life , at 18 years , they see an alba . And that &apos;s what we see is the fancor , when the sun foods , when the sun fits its beautiful landscape , everything that they &apos;ve learned in theory . The prefer is prendor the reach a step back and says : : &quot; You &apos;re going to be a step back and says : : &quot; You know , you know ,
&quot; Visice ? I &apos;m like I said .
It &apos;s amazing . &quot; Now it &apos;s now to you . &quot;
They &apos;re called the greater brothers and say that we , rats , are the colpful of the destruction of the world &apos;s destruction .
This level of intuition is very important .
When we think about the indigenous populations and the environment we call Rousseau and the old history of selling selling history , which is a race of its own own own own own . or we say that these people are more closer to the Earth .
Indies people are not feelings nor unless feelings .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the paluds of the Asmat , or in the skydivents of Tibet , but thank you for the time and rituals , they created a mystical mystical of the idea of being aware , but it &apos;s very much more subjunk , the concept that the Earth can live only because it &apos;s infected by human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
And that means that a kid of Ande that Ande that is going to grow up with the mountain is a massive person will drive his destiny is a lot different human being deeply different , and it &apos;s going to have a very different relationship with the mountain or that place to a boy .
which is the dimonds of a spirit or a mineral irrelevant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that define the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia Britannics , creating the forests that they were seriously going to be cut .
And that I made a different human being different from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are Hukukukukukukukukukukukukug and the cannibal spirits that live in the Hukukukuk-initiation .
If you start to see that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of them feeling of their sensations of the sensations of the sensations of that .
I took this picture to open the picture to open the ninth nordan Amazon nordc .
Maybe some of you &apos;ve heard about the ayahuased , the most powerful psychoactive , the most powerful psychoactive psychoactive ,
What it makes the ayahuasely , it &apos;s not the potential of the drug , but the elaboration . It &apos;s what it &apos;s about two elements .
On one side , this lian lian side , that it &apos;s a series of Tioline , little , harmoline and harmoline , little hallucinogen , slightly hallucinogen .
And by by trying to the only plant , it has a smoke that alter a little bit of consciousness , but it &apos;s mixed with the family of a caffuction of a coffee caffecting ,
This plant contains powerful powerful powerful , very similar to seriotonin , dithylyptamine five , methylyptamine .
If you ever see Yanomami pull up for the nose of the nose of the nose of the substance that are doing a different set of species , it &apos;s about methylyptamine .
Tirating that dust is a little bit of being gone from a little bit of being gone from a flap of bear and land on a sea of charge and land on a sea of electricity .
I got to do with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who was scatenched the age of the Polugly , with her discovery of fungi in Mexico .
I think my thesis not going to classifying these tripptamines as as hallucinogen hallucinogen . And you can &apos;t tell any hallucinated .
It &apos;s possible to absorts of chemicals that would be above with other chemicals that would deny MAO .
Now it &apos;s the nice : the fuel proud that are in this lian injitors of MAO , the same guy needs to potence the triptamines . And the question is a lot of plants , like these people have to find two deflie morphologically not similar , but if you combine in this way , you create a biochemical version that is the upset of the parts of the parts of the parts ?
We use the great eugly of the evidence and the error , which can be infruted .
But if we ask Indians , they say , &quot; The plants talk about us . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribe , the Cofan , has 17 variety of the ayahuasks , which are neply in the forest , and that &apos;s the same species would come in the same species .
If we ask them how they stabipped their tabonomy will tell us , &quot; I thought , &quot; I &apos;d like like that , you don &apos;t know everything ? &quot;
The solution is : you take the 17 variety in a night of moon , and each night of the moon , and each other other will .
And so , you don &apos;t have graduate Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than count stami .
Now , , , you know , the problem is that even those of us who have to heart people who have painting people in Indies , but somehow reduced to the sea of the history of the real world , and it &apos;s going to go over the world , and it &apos;s passes over .
In fact , the 21st century , in 300 years , it won &apos;t remember for his own or its technological innovations , but rather as the one was where we stopped and we abbractivity , and we abbractivity passive , cultural diversity and cultural diversity , and cultural the planet . Now the problem is not change .
All the cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibilities .
And the problem is not technology .
Indians Sioux Indians have no stop being Sioux when they put it from arck and frecovered as Americans have no stop being Americans when they put on the horse and calated .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that threatened the integrity of ethnosphere . It &apos;s power .
The hard hard hard .
And if you look at the world , you &apos;ll find that these are not cultures going to disappear .
They &apos;re living creatures and spines out of the existence from the forces of identificable forces that are beyond their adaptation capability of .
It &apos;s disbing in the potential of Penan --
a lot of the nomads of Sarawak , in the Asian East , a people who have lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to a generation ago , and now reduced to the ride of the rights of the rivers , where you can see the river of the lim that sounds brought back to the middle of Merional Misissues , where the black black , where the black black ,
It &apos;s ready to fill the wooden soul with the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that have come with the golden of the gold .
If we move on on the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the hard hard hard hard to see , you &apos;ll see the hard hard hard hard to domination .
As you know the genocide , the extinction of a people who is convicted in universal level , but the ethnocience of the style of a people , not only is to celebrate in certain ambient , because it &apos;s a celebrated , but it &apos;s celebrated in certain ambient , because it &apos;s part of the strategifts of development .
And you can &apos;t understand the Tibet until you go from the beginning .
I &apos;ve lost the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in the Western China through the Western Tibet , coming to Lhasa with a young connection , but only came to Lhaked out what the statistics behind us .
6,000 hits bust , the ridgs in powder and centers .
1.2 million people killed by the military during the Cultural Revolution .
And the father of this guy was ascriteria in the Panchen Lama .
Which means that it was killed to the time of Chinese invasion .
His uncle I was in Santity , in the diaspora that led led to Nepal .
His mother was imprisoned and her her her fault was rich .
It was brought to hide in caring to the age of two years , he hidden under his gonna because he could not live without him .
The sister , who did the same , it was a reduced camp .
One day he revertired a bunch of Mao and , for this transgression , it was put on the forced for seven years .
The Tibet can be insopportable , but the spirit of the people is from tener tener .
And then , it turns out to a choice .
We want to live in the world of monocromatic monoton or we want to account the world policemen diversity ?
The great anthropologist at Margaret Mead , before he died said that his greatest fear was that in our view of the world , not only we &apos;ll see the whole gamma of the human imagination , we can &apos;t just see the whole gamma of thinking , but one day we &apos;ll wake up a sleep forgamm .
And it &apos;s humiliating that our species is existed for 600,000 years .
The Neolitica Revolution , which has given us agriculture , that has given us us us us to socks on the crash of the seed , by by by by by making the track of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has been 300 years .
That sharp story doesn &apos;t suggests me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we &apos;re going to deal with the millenses that we &apos;re going to deal .
When you have these miriades of the world is asked what they want to say to be human , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all refer the chance of being what we are : a unable species , that has to make all the people and the gardens can fit . And there are great moments of optimism .
I took this photograph on the north of the only island of Baffin , when I went to hung with Inuit , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , and he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The canadese government didn &apos;t always have gentile with the Inuit and the &apos; 50s to stabilire our suprematia , we &apos;ve rhhhhhhit .
The grandfather of this man refused to go .
His , tempting for his life , he brought him all the way to the weapons , and all of her equipment .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t have the cold , they exploit .
The paintings were made of fish fish flying out in origin , they were made of spread there .
The grandfather of this man didn &apos;t intie from the night or the bylizard that was suffering .
It &apos;s disgattached off , he &apos;s calculated the panthoused in the skin of foca deflit and defected it in your hand . When I did I frozen , and they were working a sama .
It &apos;s sprayed up on the downtown of this cholder , and when I solid solid , he killed a dog .
He shake the dog and created a brighter , with the kidney , and it &apos;s imbrired another dog , he imbrired another dog , and it &apos;s disappeared on the banks , the camera of it .
We want to talk about horarselling with nothing ?
In the berile 1999 , the Canadian government reduced to the total control of an area of the greater of California and Texas .
It &apos;s their new patha . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s an independent land . They &apos;re all minerary resources .
One beautiful example of as a nation-state can reconciliating it with his people .
And , to finish , I think it &apos;s rather obvious to who of us was in these remote areas of the planet , realize that they &apos;re not remote at all .
For someone is home .
They &apos;re presenting sections of the human imagination that go to the dawn of time . And for us all , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our children , they become part of the geography of hope .
And finally , we have National Geographic we are convinced that politicians will never be anything .
We think the polements --
&#91; Applausers &#93; not persuasive , but we think that stories can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the best institution to tell the stories of the world &apos;s round 35 million visits website . Every month our website has to be 35 million visits .
156 countries transmit our television canal .
Our magazines are fired by millions of people .
Our work is traveling into the ethnosion to bring our public places in the place of cultural wonderful and what they &apos;re going to go out and , and hopefully , abstract year for the central reveal of the central anthropology : the world of existing in diversity , and we have to find a life in a pluralist world , and we have to find a lifestyle in a world , and we have to find a life in a pluralist in a world .
where all people can contribute to our people can contribute to our collective well-being .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book I hope to call a few things that you &apos;ve heard and try to evidence some connection , in the case you don &apos;t notice .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the official dogma . &quot;
Dogma official what ?
The dogma official of all the West industrial society . The dogma official dogma official , &quot; If we want to massize the well-being of our citizens . &quot;
The reason is , on one side , in fact that liberty is itself a value , it &apos;s precious value , is precious , useful , essential for humans .
On the other other one of us can do that if we are free , each of us can act for the whole thing that massively maximimum , without no one that decided in our well-being , no one of the decide in our own .
The way to massizing freedom is massizing choice .
The more choices of people , they are libere , and the greater is their freedom , the greater is their well-being .
This , I think , it &apos;s so deeply roadicated in society that no one would dream to put it in doubt .
And it &apos;s also deeply radicated in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m going to allow me a simple note about conditions .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without contact 10 variety of extrated olive and 12 actions that you can buy for a huge number of conditions that you can buy for a huge number of conditions in the firespect that no one of the 175 .
Here &apos;s what the supermarket .
And then you go to the electronic store : cases , CD letter , CD letter , radio , piason , light .
And in this single electric store , there &apos;s a big number of audio components .
We can make six million different combinations using the components that there are in a store .
You have to admit that there &apos;s a lot of choice .
Other fields : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the telephones , at the pat the time , at the same time , to know , you know , Bell .
She was nolegg the phone , didn &apos;t buy it .
One of that , in the other , was that the phone never break .
These times are gone .
Now we have a nearly illimited variety of phones , especially between cell phones .
Here &apos;s cell phones of the future .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , cuts , and I cut them them off the bits , and the forb for the brullet , for the kitchropes .
If you don &apos;t have that yet seen in the store below , you &apos;re very certain that will soon get .
And what happens is that people come in in the store , and they &apos;re doing this question . And you know what &apos;s the answer ? The answer is &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t make too much .
So , in other ways of life that are much more important than the acquiring of the acquired out of choices .
Assistence : it doesn &apos;t happen in the United States that you &apos;re going to go from the doctor and you say what you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do A or B , &quot; OK , we could do A , or B &quot; has these benefits and these risks . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Doctor , what should I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A has these benefits and these benefits , and B has these benefits and B is these benefits and the risks . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; Dr. if you were , you &apos;re me , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
We call it &quot; autonomy of the malated , &quot; , that &apos;s what it looks like a nice thing .
But it &apos;s not that it &apos;s a shift the weight and responsibility to make decisions of someone knows something , which is the doctor , to someone else who knows that &apos;s what you know -- and it &apos;s almost certainly sick -- and so it doesn &apos;t know -- and so in the ides of the patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing of pharmaceutical products of people like me and you , who you , if you think about it doesn &apos;t make any sense , because we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why do they advertising ?
The answer is that they want to ask him to ask him to ask him to ask him to make it .
Something of the way is our orphotos is a question of choice , as you see in this vignet . &quot; We don &apos;t want to forzen the children . And they &apos;ll not forced their sex at at the right moment . &quot; We don &apos;t really have to be an identity : we have to invent .
And we can reinventing us how many times you get to .
Which means that every morning , at the riss , you have to decide what what you want to be .
I &apos;m going to family and the matrimonium , a time time time the perspective , it almost for everyone , was that there was the most early as you can , and you start to have children the most soon possible possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not even what to do after .
So , it &apos;s really to play .
I teach very smart students , and I do 20 percent in less work than a time .
And not because they &apos;re not brilliant , not because they &apos;re not very much less diligent .
but why are they imthoughts , I mean , &quot; I should be married or not ? &quot;
&quot; Do I have to marries later ? I have to think before children or the career ? &quot;
They &apos;re rogative interrogation .
And they &apos;re trying to answer these questions , although this is that implementing not to complete the homework that I don &apos;t get a nice voice to my exam .
And they really have to do that . They &apos;re important questions .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , like Carl underneath , because the technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from the Hotel Randolph .
I &apos;m talking about it , there &apos;s a corner , and I won &apos;t tell nobody where , where the Within Fi works .
I don &apos;t tell you , why I want to use me .
What does this incredible freedom of choice that we have to work ? It &apos;s that we have to continuously decide , if we need to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing hot , with the cell phone in a pocket , Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , tily , on the knenenees .
And even though they &apos;re all spending , every minute that we see our son who &apos;s roving the game , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; Do you know , I have to answer this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? I have to email this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , you know , it makes the experience of your son very different than what it would be in other conditions .
So , any part we look , small things , things and large , things , life is a matter of choices .
Once the world was this : That &apos;s the case , there were some possibilities , but it wasn &apos;t a matter of choice .
The world today is like this : Design is , &quot; Is it a good thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is . It &apos;s a lot of it .
The positive layles we know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative .
All this is that that has two negative effects of people .
The first , paradoxally , it &apos;s that produced paralysis that it &apos;s paralysis that it &apos;s made paralyss .
And so , with a lot of options between which choose , it becomes very difficult to do that .
I offer you a significant example : a study of volunteenager .
And my colleague has been on the Vanguard data , the giant company of pension , with about a million clients in pension , with about a million clients in 2000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of adhesian down two percent .
With 50 sources , there &apos;s 10 percent in less than adhesions when they &apos;re only five . Why are they only five . Why ?
Because with 50 sources of which choose , it &apos;s bad hard to decide , and the choice is reached to the indomans .
And tomorrow , and tomorrow , tomorrow , tomorrow , and of course tomorrow .
You know , it doesn &apos;t just mean that these guys are going to be filled to dogs because they &apos;re not going to say that decision is so unlike the decision is so unlike the sounds , they also lose the funding of the dator of work .
Not participating , they &apos;re lost to five dollars per year from work dator , that would be very well displace to be versary .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think that makes the world .
&quot; And to finish , for ethernity : ketchup , ketchup , maionese sends ? &quot;
You &apos;d like to make the right decision , if it &apos;s for the ethernity , isn &apos;t it ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and yet the condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even though we can avoid the paralysis and make a choice , at the end of the result of how we would be with less options between which choose .
And that &apos;s why it &apos;s a different reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions between which choose , if you buy one and you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have a different choice . And what what &apos;s going on is that the alternative imagination will be better . And what &apos;s going to be a lot of a decision ,
even when it was a very good decision .
The more choices there are , the easier of any detail that is inssatisfaction is inssatisfaction .
There is what economists call costs opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has clearly lifts very well as a value that we &apos;re going to things depends on what we can compare .
On the rest of the other other other other other , it &apos;s easy to represent the features of alternatives that you have alternatives that &apos;s not a satisfacts of option that is choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m sorry with everybody who are not New York .
But that &apos;s what you would probably think .
There &apos;s this copy in the Hamptons .
a place of luxury .
Spiach . Otma . Otma day . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not miss . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , it &apos;s Agust . &quot;
&quot; Everybody &apos;s my neighbors in Manhattan are away . &quot;
&quot; I could parking right in front of the house . &quot;
And it comes to two weeks from the idea that &apos;s losing -- every day -- the chance of parking -- every day -- the chance of parking where it wants .
costo-opportunity , you decreation for what we have , even when the choice was excellent .
And the more of the options that we have to think , the more the actual features will be refer to be constitute to how we &apos;re cos-opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
It &apos;s about living the moment , and maybe of living slowly .
But the most important point is that whatever you choose , you choose , you choose to do not .
The things that we don &apos;t choose to attractive that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : the growing expectations .
I tried to do it on my skin bought a new pair .
I &apos;m almost always always waters .
Once jeans were just a guy , bought and wire them , and they were willing with a life and they were so far , just after getting them a life and they were a lot of times , they start going to go very well .
So I went to buy a couple of time when the old ones were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
And he said , &quot; You know , do you want to slim fit , relaxed ? &quot;
You want to do it with the cernial or with the button ? &quot; Stonewashing , &quot; or &quot; aciddle ?
&quot; Would you like it ? &quot;
&quot; You know , you want to strike them ? Bla bla , &quot; Continupright .
I was sballoon , and after a little bit I did , &quot; I want the guy that was the only guy , &quot; I was the only guy , &quot; he had no idea what it was , so for a time I tried to do all of the maledeals , and I came out of the jeans I had ever had .
It was the very very good . I had a better choice .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand that .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice , my expectations , jeans had to be perfect .
I had minimum expectation . I didn &apos;t expect anything exceptional when there was a hundred different , accidents , at least a kind of , at least a kind of a perfect thing .
What I had had been purchase , but not perfect .
After I was compared to the chose with what I was trying to do with what I was so I was very confronted to the expectations .
The addition of options in people of the most people don &apos;t do that to increase the expectations that are on the excellence of the options of the options of the options of the options of the people who are on the excellular excellence of the other people who are on the excellence of the other people who are on the excellular excell
And that will produce less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the marketing world .
Because if they knew that , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more like this .
&quot; It was better when you was worse , &quot; The reason why was better when you was worse was worse was even even even meet the surprises .
So , in the world where we live in -- opulents , industrialized citizens with the expectancy expectancy -- the very very , we can hope is that things are at the altitude of the expectations .
You &apos;ve never surprised because your expectations , because your expectations , they &apos;ve been giant undancing .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Beslyesterday , you want . &quot;
I mean , small authographical moment -- that I really married and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t have any content .
But it &apos;s not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of the bought a couple of jeans , when there &apos;s only that kind of jeans is that when you &apos;re not satisfacts , and you say , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot; The answer is clear .
The world is the responsible . What would I do you do ?
When you have hundreds of kinds of jeans , and you buy a unsatisfaction , and you ask who is the responsible , it &apos;s the responsible , it &apos;s just a clear responsible , it &apos;s the responsible you .
You could have done better .
With hundreds of varieties , there are no excuse for the insuccess .
So when people make decisions , even though the outcome is valid , they feel unsatisfacfacts and give the cold .
In the last years , depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only , but important -- of this wave of depression is just that people have deludent experiences because they &apos;re too high .
And when they have to explain this situation they think the cold is .
So the end result of the final outcome is that we &apos;re better , but we feel worse .
Let me give you member .
This is the official dogma , what we all get a good fake . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little choice of choice is better than having any of it is better than that he would have no choice much better than a little bit .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve overcome from a piece of the level where the choices improved our life .
Now , from the political point of view -- I &apos;ve got almost finished -- from the political point of view of political , the nocy is the following .
What allows all of this in industrial society is the wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know about it , where the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too bad .
So the facts I &apos;m talking about is a bad evil of modern , rich Western society ,
And what it does depressing and angry is this : Steve Levitt spoke to you yesterday , as the expensive seats for a little bit of the expensive seats are not useful . It &apos;s a money spare of money .
I mean these choices , it &apos;s not that they are just useful .
I &apos;m even deleteries .
They &apos;re worse .
If a little bit of what we have in our society allows a lot of choice in those where people have too few people have too much chance , it &apos;s not just their life to improve but our .
This is what economists call a lot of improvement .
A redistribution of income re-income re-income re-income re-income rel .
To conclude , &quot; You can become everything you want . &quot;
You , people of culture , you &apos;ll think , &quot; What does that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t do anything in a glass . &quot;
&quot; A castrade imagination , a limited view of the world --
I &apos;m really interested in this , so , at the beginning .
But then , I realized that that that fish knows the long knows that that that fish knows the long knows that that that fish knows the long knows .
Because the reality is that if you &apos;re missing in the bocks , so that you can &apos;t get freedom . You can &apos;t get freedom . You can &apos;t get freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you break the bye so that it &apos;s all possible to decreation .
You &apos;re excited about it , and you reduced the well-being .
Everyone needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too strange , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of some symbolic sphere is a recipe for inhappiness and , I &apos;m theme , for rovine .
Thank you very much .
