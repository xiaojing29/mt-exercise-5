And last year I showed these slide to the slide that the calculate seval wild , which for three million years of years has had the size of 48 , the size of 48 , is requiet of 40 percent .
But , in the way that we have the gravity of the ice of the ice .
The calculf wild wild is , in a sense , the heart of the climate system .
It expanded up in invern and you &apos;re ritier .
The next slide slide here is going to be a re-re-re-seventually revenvenue of the last 25 years .
The stuck are replaced in red .
As you see , it &apos;s going to go to the blue .
That &apos;s the ice in inverter , which you &apos;re ritier .
You can see that the constantly stay , five years or more , is like the blood , which is like the blood , which is here , that here &apos;s the body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been by so ,
This is a problem because the re-sex re-rolder , the terraised where there are huge amount of coal , where there are huge amount of fuel , they slow-flow .
And I &apos;m going to be the parent of the inquination of global warming , that amount of layer , that &apos;s very layer , that &apos;s going to be going to go .
In some laghi very very proof of in Alaska meters of the water .
The professed Katey Walter of the Alaska team of Alaska team .
Video : Wow ! Gore : Lore ! The question is if you &apos;re going to be .
A reason that this is that that the exist termal surroll from north .
This is a foundation of the regulal .
The ported had never reached to the brains .
This is the Kangerlymc Kangerlymics , in the safterovest .
If you want to know how to look like the sea level of the sea .
These are increasing on the time .
On the other part of the planet : Antle the planet .
And the last month , the most scientists have been dancy that the ice is in negative , and that the Anyestern artists , who pogen on some sun sun , it &apos;s particularly ularly remarkable .
And it &apos;s just six feet of the actual acy of the actual acactual acactual actual .
Sulle Himalaya , the third more big bull of ice , you see new laghi , which was gotten .
40 percent of the population has remarkable water than the potential .
Sulle Ande : this layer is the power of the potential water .
The pported is increased .
But when he fitted when it , the same accounts to water .
In California , the neve Bar Nevada is deminual of 40 percent .
The bull are in the criccrisis .
The previous pretions , like you know , I &apos;m grass .
The growing growing in the world leaders to a remarkable remarkable .
The disasers are increasing to a straim out of the normal and without any any any time .
Four times more than the last 30 years of the first 30 years of the first time .
This is a remarkable to all ininable .
If you look at the context of the context , you can see the consequences .
And the last five years , we &apos;ve got to 70 million tons of the food every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the area of the Pacific area of Pacific , by the countries , and on both both the parts of the substent , where there is a hadadadicted by oxygen in the ocean .
The most because of the global warming , with the deforforforforever , that &apos;s 20 percent , is the use of unknown unable .
The oil is a problem , and the coal is even worse .
The United States are one of the most emissions , in China .
And he took a lot of other central central central .
But we &apos;re seeing a direction of the direction .
These are the first first projects in the last years and some of the alternative .
And we have a lot , there &apos;s a politics in our country .
The industrial industrial and oil have speso 250 million dollars in the last year to promising the coal .
And I remember me to something --
I know , in Tennesis , in Tennesis , where I &apos;ve been a loss of 3.8 billion billion billion liers of the coal .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen the news .
This is the most great flu of the flow of the flow in America .
It &apos;s happened around Natal .
The public public initional industrial of the industrial industrial industrial .
Video : However the carbon dier is a kind of legry .
It &apos;s just abundant here in America , and it &apos;s growing our economy .
Frosroses the carbon and more and more disdisdislied .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and the most of the safterwards .
At Gore : From here is the most of the West Virginy .
The most great society on the mountain in the mountains is the Massey . This is his ammer . This is his ammer .
Video : Man : We &apos;ll just just clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosy -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking .
At Gore : So the Allelelelease of Clim Clim has launed two campaim .
This is a part of them , a part .
Video : The Take the Take the Tergy of the climate change as a very minute .
And so this is to invest a big amount of money in a forest amount of money in a forest and confused the truth of the oil .
In fact , the coal is not to sevening .
We think it &apos;s also -- it &apos;s also a good good good thing .
So , not predict to change .
Let me give us us .
Video : Attore : The Chinese hone -- you &apos;ve heard very much .
So we &apos;re going to take a structure in a structure to look at the same thing about the coal structure for a sheer .
Strtrain ! The machines are a little rums , but this is the sound of technology of technology .
The consumer is between the main re-coal is between the global wardment , but the remarkable technology , but the remarkable technology , you see everything .
Take a look at a look at the technology of the oil .
Al Gore : Instead , the alternative alternative to the question and to that the economic security and that in the nationally .
Video : The government is in the economic security , the nationally , the crisis .
The philililils that connected to all our dipendence from the commoon , as the coal and oil oil oil .
Now , there &apos;s a new audent , and there &apos;s a new audent ,
Rey America : 100 percent of energy energy , in 10 years .
A plan to re-going to re-work , to make more sure , and help us to stop the global warming .
And so , a solution that basts to solve our problems .
It &apos;s more than America . Scoat more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : We know , it &apos;s about reach energy to America .
One of the most of the most of the most of the dependence from the comfortable to our planet .
See : The future is here . I feel , a new energy .
But , three two : NNNati investimate for places to work .
So , I mean , it &apos;s time to be a none .
Al Gore : A old wild , or Africa says , &quot; If you want to go to the flow .
If you want to go to , you go together . &quot;
We need to go to the long time .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I &apos;ve got a introduction on LHC .
And you can get back to return to back to reach you to go back to the car .
So , I have . And for those that the other time , the LHC is the most great experiment . And for those who had -- 27 kilomers of circrisis .
And his task is to rerererereing the conditions that were less than a half of the beginning of the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
Everything is just extremely .
This is the machine under Ginever .
We &apos;ve got these mini-Big Bang in the ririd .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called TTTAAS -- is a 44 feet and has a diameter diameter .
This is a show of the ATLAAAS in building so you can notice the proportions .
The last 10 10 to the last year we got the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAAAS .
It was because of immense , and it &apos;s a bunch of control .
It &apos;s a first one of the first first first of particles that had been around the LHC , in the collision , with a part of LHC , and spread particles in the LHC , and spread particles in the welellow .
In other words , when we see that this image the 10 , I mean that the machine was the machine , which is a great vitty .
I don &apos;t know if you &apos;re going to do more opposed to do this , when somebody went on Google and vivide that the page was this .
And that means that we had a cultural impact on the scientific .
It was a week after , there was a problem with the car , to have this philils here -- these philils here -- these phililils .
These philililils , and we &apos;ll have 13,000 light .
Now , the technical technical , and they &apos;re going to say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . &quot;
And instead of the time they &apos;re very cold to become the constantly stantly stuck .
So , at least 271 degrees , to a nururity to that the stars , these phils can take that .
In one of the giant of the most of the most of the most of the LHC , there was a difer of the wild .
So the phililils are going to give them a lot of time , and 13,000 light , and 13,000 light light .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive , if you think that these magnenetic weight , and that they &apos;re move about 30 centimeters .
It &apos;s dan-to-magnetworks .
We had to get them , what we did .
We have rere-ined and reached .
Now , they &apos;re going to go back to the place .
And finally , the end of the LHC will will be new integrity .
We &apos;ll be going to go , and we expect to judge data to judge , and continuing so our own , and continuing so our our own own .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these cents reacting the value of science and engineering value of science and engineering engineering . It &apos;s easy to confuture . It &apos;s easy to confuture . It &apos;s easy to confuture .
I think that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s going to go beyond the limits , I think that the value of things like LC .
I want to conclude with words of a scientist Inglal , Humbber , which , I think , in difer , in difer , the initional initional , his pille was Michael Faray , he said , &quot; No , it &apos;s so much for the human human human human . &quot; The mind of the mind , the idea of the ideas that are not dangerous for the human science , that are not to the new monstrize of the new .
Thank you .
I want to start asking to reduce when , by children , and you &apos;re going to play the morning .
While you understand how to reach them and sounds them , and let them go and move them , learn learn learn how to think and remarkable to think and repacacactivity .
The spacer is the very very connected to the way we understand that much much part of us .
So , by the inspired inspired by the initional objects , together to the consequence , together to my consequences , and my collaborator , and my collaborator . I started asking , I started asking me , &quot; And if we &apos;re just a computer , instead of the mouse , instead of the mouse , the rolder of the mouse like a sounds that you can see a digit , and the hands with a strongly demonstral information with a brains that they &apos;re going to be able to depending up with with a string .
and put it to our pleasure ?
The question was so interesting that I decided to exploring the answer , building the Sifty .
In a few words , a big computer interactive interactive , a great computer interactive .
In a few words , a big computer interactive interactive , a great computer interactive .
It can move with the hand , they can see it , &quot; and you can see , &quot; in their own and they have a screen and have a screen .
But the most of course , they are the rolds , as the morning , you can move to the sandles .
The Sifty is the example of a new ecosystem for manipulate information .
And as they become more , they &apos;re going to be more , conconsequences , and the other , and as they become more , configures , the other , of the other , of the other , of the other , of the other things , we can bring new and fun to the interaction .
I &apos;m trying to be a few example .
This is configured to show the video : if you &apos;re going to show you , if you &apos;re going to get this , if you &apos;re going to do so , if you &apos;re going to get it .
These remarkets are conconfigures of others .
If you &apos;re doing them , they interested in what they &apos;re around .
If they &apos;re circles , they notice and they can agagagitate .
If they &apos;re circles , they notice and they can agagagitate .
They also have their inclination and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interested of the interesting interesting implications of the interaction that we can use the data , to example , &quot; a color like a color as if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three roughout of the walls like to the walls of the color in the central color in the central , where they &apos;re going to get .
And I can use them to the color in the central , where they &apos;re going to come .
If we &apos;re too , we can put a little bit bit of place .
And I &apos;m also going to give you a lot of the lingue , the mathematics and games , the mathematics and see the games where people can try and see things , and see the immediately .
Now , I &apos;m --
This is a sequence of Fibonacks that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a game of words that is in half Scarroll and Boggle .
It &apos;s basically to every rich , to every Sifty , in every Sifty , Princincincinct , to every rich one of the roughly round , and as many of the Shanks .
And then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new set of loss and new possibilities to try to try and new possibilities to try to try to try .
Thank you .
And here is the children came in the Media Lab , I &apos;ve done it in a way that I &apos;ve been been a video .
And they were very much .
And one of the interesting things that that are going to have to give people people a lot of intions .
You just say , &quot; Pleons of words , and they know what to do .
And here is other people who try .
This is our downnal of the most young , there &apos;s the right .
It was just wanted to impipiles .
They were just just morning , for him .
Now , this is an actual acactual interactive .
We wanted to build a tool for the apple of the lingful . He &apos;s Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , solved the Sifair .
It can put new characters in the scene , solved the Sifair .
And that &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : The SSwear is .
David Merrist : Now he took a treatment in the scene .
Video : The treat at the time .
Bel ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah .
So he sounds the Sifer and put them up to interagement --
Video : Bau !
And he was inventing their story .
Video : Hey !
DM : It &apos;s a story with final final , and it can decide as a swide .
DM : It &apos;s a story with final final , and it can decide as a swide .
Video : Since ,
DM : The last example that I have the time to show you a tool , to go to the music .
It &apos;s a tool , I &apos;ve got to reduce music .
The Sifty here are the sounds like the bottom and bacteria .
Each of these have four different variations , and you can choose that to use .
You can also put these sounds in a sequence of a sequence to your pleasure .
And it just just touch a sound &quot; &quot; and a sequence . &quot;
These are actually that you can control from the wellow , as the reververs .
The acks to a particular sound and then they &apos;re incline to re-re-re-time .
And then there are actually general as time and volume , which is that they &apos;re going to be the whole sequence .
Let &apos;s look like it .
Video : DM : We &apos;ll try to put a base in two Sifty , &quot; sequence , &quot; sequence , &quot; sequence , we put it in a series , and we &apos;ll add another .
Now , I &apos;m just a bottom line .
Video : DM : Now , I &apos;m going to have perception of percussions --
Video : DM : And now I &apos;ll put the philililer , so I can control the effect from the welder .
Video : DM : I can remarkable to the whole sequence of time .
Video : DM : And now I &apos;m going to give the bottom for more expression .
Video : DM : Can rererequired the sequence . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to be a first , but I can suddenly , make it more or more corn .
And now , finally , I can smoon the whole sequence of the world , &quot; First . &quot; It &apos;s &quot; First . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is new interinterinterinterface . And so more , as they &apos;re going to work .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this perperspective , and also some possibilities that we &apos;re trying to bring out from the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that we &apos;re going to be this new generation of the digital media , which is that we &apos;ll be information in our world in our world in our way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the now now I don &apos;t see it .
I &apos;m a track .
It &apos;s the books is the most of course , but it &apos;s more than that .
It &apos;s also love and the fashion my life .
And I don &apos;t think that can change .
But , he said , something that &apos;s happened in my life and in my life and in my life , which has taken me to rereach the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I &apos;ve been been , this book , this book called &quot; Many , Prega , Prega , Am , I know , for some reason , for some reason , and he &apos;s a great , unun-sensational interinterinterational interational .
And the result is that that there is that there , people have to treatment as if I was going to be .
It &apos;s true -- it &apos;s going to be .
They &apos;re going to me now all worried and say , &quot; Don &apos;t you have more than being able to do you have no longer to do ?
You don &apos;t have a little bit of continuing to write for all life without life without able to create a book that can be able to somebody ? &quot;
What can we can can do you get to somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s roughly , you know .
But it could go to the worst of the most of 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was an adolder -- I was a sritual .
I was a very very , the same reaction of the same reaction .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t that people don &apos;t have successful ?
You don &apos;t have a lot of the re-flow .
You don &apos;t have a little bit of doing this to give all life without any life without any people who ever ever ever come out and dead on a cumumber of a cumber of the waste of the wild wild .
You know , you know .
The first answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
I &apos;ve been a lot of all those things .
I always had a little bit .
And I also also , I also have a lot of other things that people could not have to be able .
And as the alth and other things spacy .
But , for how I thought I thought and I thought I thought and ask me , I &apos;m why ?
Is it ?
It &apos;s logic that anybody who would expect to be spaced by a job that you have sent to do .
But what &apos;s that that we &apos;re so particular in the immit to make us nervous , as as the other cards ?
As my father , he was a chemistry and I don &apos;t remember a chemistry and not remember a time in his 40 years of activity in his 40 years of activity in his 40 years of being engineering ?
It never have -- that stuck of engineering engineering , as you ?
It doesn &apos;t work so , you know ?
Onestly , engineers like a group of chemistry , as a group , in the reputation of being alcold aled to be alcold .
We have enough to have enough to this reputation , and not just creativity , but creativity , we have this reputation of all kinds of being huge member , of being huge memory .
And it &apos;s not just just just to look at the other people who are dead dead , and unbelieves that , only in the 20th century , they &apos;re going to be young and often often often often often often often often often often often often often often often often often often often often often often often often often often often often often often often often often often often often often often often often often often often help them .
And also those who don &apos;t have been able to be able to be able to be able to their dons .
Norman , before he was trying to die , in the last interview said , &quot; Every little bit more &quot; a little bit more &quot; An , a little bit more . &quot; A very much more .
But we don &apos;t have to be , when we feel because we &apos;ve heard these things like long long , and I &apos;m totally interized and accept the noon and accept the noon that creativity and the noon are in some way , and the end , the end , the end , the end , the end , end .
And the question I want to take all here is , you are the right now , you are you right ?
It &apos;s good , because it &apos;s also looking at a tape centimeter to me not well for me to me right for anything well .
I think it &apos;s oodious .
And I think it &apos;s also danger and I don &apos;t want to see the next century .
I think it &apos;s better encourage to live .
And I think , in my case , in my case -- in my situation -- that would be very dangerous to start to refuel that I felt the circle of the circle of the circle of the circle of the circle in the circle of the cirrier .
And I &apos;m very young , I &apos;m quite young , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m about 40 years .
I still have about four decades to me .
And it &apos;s very likely that any thing I &apos;m going to be judge in the world as the work that he came out of my last book .
I &apos;m going to be a little bit more or less friends here -- it &apos;s likely that my most successful successful .
Oh , Geso , which thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that leaders to start to start blow in the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I &apos;m going to continuing to do this work that we &apos;re going to do this work .
So , the question is , how do they do it ?
And so it seems to me , after many of a lot , which the way to work to work to write what to create a psychological protective psychological protective , right ?
I have some way to find a distance of security to me , and I &apos;m saying , and my natural is on which reaction is where I &apos;m going to get to look at the last year , trying to look at the time , trying to look at the time , trying to look at the time , trying to have more ideas and more ideas and more ideas and more and more ideas and more ideas ideas and more ideas and more and more and more and more and more and I &apos;m going to try to try to try to be more more more more more
on how to help people people people who are emotional to the in-wel-consequence .
And that research has been to me to the Great Great and the Rome .
I love to go because I &apos;m going to go back .
Nelil Great Great and the Good -- people don &apos;t seem to believe that creativity creativity .
It was thinking that the creativity was the creativity was going to look at and that they were born by a few people from a few people from a few people from a few people , and unknown .
The great-called these divers , you know , &quot; they &apos;re going to be . &quot;
Soccurred , wonderful , he was a demon that elargiant , it was a demon .
The Romans were the same idea , but called the same idea , but called the kind of spirit without a genium .
The thing is very very very dious , because the Romans didn &apos;t really thought that a genium was somebody particularly smart .
They thought that a genium was this kind of kind of employees that he had literally in the murs of a artist , a little bit like the eleleled , and that it &apos;s going to be able to the work of the artist and models to the artist of the artist .
Here &apos;s the distance of the distance of the way that parent , that &apos;s the distance of the welellow .
And all they knew that was so that worked , right ?
So the artists were protected by certain things , like example , like example , as a narcisism , no ?
If your work was very very very check and all the seventually , all they were helped by this genium .
If your work , you don &apos;t have all your work , right ?
Everyone was your genium to be a incapital .
And so people have han epidemic creativity in the West for very time .
And then the Rinition came up and all all the way , and nacy this great idea ; we put the human human universe on the center of all the universe and the wild of the universe that they &apos;re going to get to the human crease .
This was the principle of humanity and people started thinking that creativity is that creativity has completely creativity .
And for the first time in history , you know , you know , I &apos;m going to reference this or that artist in a genium that artist in a genium .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a very mistakes .
I think I want to somebody , a simple person to be like a recipile , the essence , the essence and the extra and the extra and the unknown people , creativity , ununknown and et-dealing , a lot of the wilern , which is a very much much for the fragile that human .
It &apos;s like to ask somebody to injoy somebody of in-sun .
It &apos;s completely detains completely the ego and creates all of these ingingful resh .
And I think it was this pression to rereduce 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think that is , the question is , and now ?
Can we do it diversally ?
And I think we go back to a more antage of the relationship between humans and stumped .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can &apos;t remarkable to be 500 years of thinking about 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience that solved would be able to the scientific scientific facts on their own own .
It &apos;s just not really really really really really really really you .
But the question I want to take is -- why don &apos;t you ?
Why don &apos;t I think in this way ?
Because it has more sense of each other thing that I &apos;ve ever heard to explain the experative experative process .
A process that , as anybody who ever tried to do something -- so , basically , all here -- you know , you don &apos;t know , it &apos;s not going to be rationally .
And , in fact , it can times it look at least , it can be completely paranorous .
I &apos;ve done this inated with the extraordinary extraordinary Ruth Stone , which has 90 years , but that was a poeter for all life and he said that during his life and he said that during his double in the Virginy , and it &apos;s going to be in the camps , and it was going to be able to the skilled .
He said that he was like a fragentrain .
And that was going to go to to her from the landscape .
It was just to go , because he he would be able to the land under his feet .
He knew that I had a only thing to do that point and he was , his words , &quot; However , &quot; Snnone . &quot;
And it &apos;s going to go to home and it was the poetry , and it didn &apos;t have to get any one piece of paper and a none of paper and a long time , as the south and sounds it .
Also , by three times , so it &apos;s very fast , so correed and correed without being able to go to home and the poetry and she had been been able to go to home and she had been been going to continued to continued to the landscape , and he he had a poet . &quot;
And then there were those times -- this piece of time I &apos;m going to be -- there were the moments that was almost perdying , right ?
So , he was looking at home and he was trying to paper and the poetry and he was just just like a sheer in the way that was coming up , and then he said , that he was like , and then he was like the other hand and the offer .
And it was the poetry from the poetry and he had to her body and transced the crisis .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page , but the last word .
So when I felt the thinking -- it &apos;s the check , it &apos;s exactly the kind of creative process .
It &apos;s not a whole process -- it &apos;s not a constation .
I &apos;m a slow , and my way of work is ; I see it &apos;s sweight every day and put it up up and go up and go up and go up up and go up up and go up up and go up and go up and go up up and move up up and go up up and move up up up up .
But even I , in my testestestabgine , I &apos;ve got the strised that thing , sometimes .
And I think that also many of you the han made .
You know , even if the work and ideas me just just just give me a certain amount of time you don &apos;t know ,
And what &apos;s this ?
And as we can relative to get it to it in a way to do it , but , rather , that you have a lot of sans ?
And so , the best example of the same time , I have the musician , which I have the interviewed different years ago to a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the most of the most of the artist of the artist of the artist of the artist of the artist , to the way , to reduce these species of acactual actual acacy .
But then I invited , he he &apos;s haked , and a day when he was driving on a Los Angeles , it &apos;s all all of him .
It was going to be very fast and everything a tract of melodia , which is that you get in his head as inspiration , which comes to the inspiration , and it wants to hotter and the deserve , you know , it &apos;s amazing , and the desider , but it was not like to get it .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , it &apos;s not a spread .
So , I start to hear this species of old old the kind of the kind of a kind , &quot; I &apos;m going to perpert , and reflying from this downnone .
I &apos;m not enough enough enough to do it . &quot;
And instead of going to go in the panic , it &apos;s going to go .
It &apos;s going to mit the whole process and he did something new .
I just just just just the sky and he said , &quot; Sweight , I don &apos;t see that I &apos;m going to be doing ? &quot;
&quot; Ti seems that can write a song now ?
If you really want to get , it in a more time , you can get me to care of you .
Altrain , you &apos;re going to importantly something today .
I went to the disturbing Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his process actually worked after this .
Not work , the work was still hurn work as always .
But the process , and the fish , and the fish was that attack that was reduced when he had the genium , the genium that out of him out of him out of it . And they came back to where it was going to the way to be an interinterviewed .
but it &apos;s very very , wonderful bizzzero-sum collaboration between Tom and this thing that strian conversation between Tom and this thing that but it was not Tom .
So , how the story that story to change a little bit of the way I work and he &apos;ve been been going to save me a time .
This idea , I save when I was the time , I was going to be , Prega , and falling of the disperation in a pile of the disperation in which we &apos;re all working on something and we can &apos;t start thinking about something and we &apos;re going to think that &apos;s a disaster , which is the worst book .
It &apos;s not just good , the worst book .
And I started thinking about the project .
But then remember I remember Tom that park to Tom that I &apos;ve got to go .
So I went to my face on the hossand dealing my comments to a task of a room .
And I said to high , &quot; Sents , what if you know , they know , both of course , if this book is not going to be interviewed , no ?
Because I &apos;m going to do everything I &apos;m not to do that , I don &apos;t have more than this .
So if you want to be better , you have to presenting your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t know what you know , you know , I don &apos;t know what I don &apos;t do it .
I &apos;m going to try to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I want to say that it was the moment I presented to do my part of the time , OK , OK -- so that &apos;s so , OK -- OK -- I &apos;m going to be a dance for the dance of the North Africa of the dance , and it &apos;s just a dance , and it &apos;s just to the alba .
And they were always magnifer , because the ballerors were a professionals .
But every single , rarly , something happened happened , and one of these artists was actually transcely actually transcely .
And I know , I know what you know , because I know , I know , a certain point , a performance , a performance .
It was like the time , it was like 1,000 notes and the ballerine and he didn &apos;t do anything different from the kind of different from the kind of the kind of a moment , but everything was going to be able .
And suddenly , it doesn &apos;t look like a human human .
But it &apos;s accounted from the welder of divinity .
And when this happened , I was , the people knew what was , the people knew that was , called her name .
They were trying to blow your hands and started to blow , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , God , &quot; &quot; God , God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curious notice -- when the MMMMMMMMMMMMs , I was this hables with their and their ready to change in the way , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , &quot; &quot; Ole , &quot; I &apos;m going to hear in the Samn sheer in the hamamly .
In Spain , when a artist , when a magical artist , &quot; Allalah , &quot; Allah , the magnical , &quot; unless , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; Hean .
And it &apos;s very very much because we need .
But , the problem comes the day , for the time , for the same , when you get a daughter and find that are the 11 and then the foot of God is not more .
It &apos;s just a very good dead with the ginocy , and maybe they &apos;ll never be more to each other to that altives .
And maybe nobody will say the name of God still , and what &apos;s going to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most payer to do in a life .
But maybe it &apos;s not to be so much force if you can &apos;t believe , so so that the most extraordinary , which the most extraordinary aspects of your being from you .
But I just just just just that you &apos;re in a time , you know , in a sense of the team of this team of the one one one one one when you &apos;ve got to someone else when you get to someone else when you get to something else when you &apos;re going to someone else when you get to someone else when you &apos;re going to find it .
And , you know , if we think about this way .
And so I started thinking about the , and it &apos;s because I thought about the book , I thought about the book that I thought about the book that I &apos;m going to be able , the danger , and I &apos;m going to be able to the whole whole thing .
And that I have to continuing me when I feel like to tell me when I feel like this .
It doesn &apos;t falls . It just just just your work .
Contua presenting to presenting your part , any can be .
If your work is balling , blow .
If the divine , you get a genium to decide to decide a few kind of wonderful things , for a long time through the time the sounds , then &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Altrain , you do the same dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot;
I think and I think it &apos;s teacher to it .
&quot; Ole ! &quot; You know the same , even only for people to have love and ttal , and it &apos;s just to give you a continuously representing .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
And as you know , I &apos;ve talked about some of the human projects , on what can significant and discovery of new genome .
We &apos;re starting to a new perspective : we started to digital biology and now to start from that code , we &apos;re going to start in a new new phase of biology , design and synththththize life .
We always tried to report for the great questions .
&quot; What is the life ? &quot;
We &apos;ve tried to have different to reduce us .
We &apos;re going to be digalize by almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to the world of the digital of biology in the digital of the computer .
Now , we ask , we can regenerate life , or create new life from this universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , the Mycoplasm , which is the species from genome , which is the species from genome .
And we tried to reduce the genome to reduce a little more .
We &apos;re able to get a thousand geneer of about 500 , which are here .
But when we look at his map to his map , it &apos;s very simple than our .
It &apos;s simple . This is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can get to the time , it &apos;s very impossible that this can take a cell cell cell cell cell cell .
So , we decided that the only only on the only reminds to re-going to be able to be able to be able to be able to reflow the components to get some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the avure of &quot; We can synthththize a chchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchcheap ?
Can you have the chemical consequence that we &apos;ve never able to create before ?
And , in case we can make a chchcheap , we can make a cromosome ?
A chchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchcheap .
The speed of the speed that we can be able to digital life is growing to be able to be able to be exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , of design design , but it &apos;s going to be able .
And our most recent results the rich curve to exponential .
We started more about 15 years ago .
The process has required many of the world , starting with a review of the first experiments .
But we discovered that synththththize DNA is very difficult .
There are decade of thousands of cars in the world that they make small segments , from the long dancy of 30 layer , and it &apos;s a very generative process , the most complex .
And we had to develop a new meter to assembling these framments and corret the mistakes .
And this was our first attememements , to start from the digital of the genome of PP .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills the bacteria .
We designed the framments , they &apos;re actually designed the correction of the mid-mid-housing molecule of DNA about 5,000 losing .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material , and we put it in the bacteria , the bacteria have been working on the bacteria , the bacteria have been looking at this code and transpted to make the viral particles .
The viral particles are then to leave from cells , they &apos;re back and desdestruck and they destruck .
I &apos;ve talked about the oil industry with the oil industry industry that they have to have their own that they have all all of the model .
They have to get more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build his same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the more things in great things .
We wanted to build the entire chchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchcheap .
They &apos;re more than 580 mid-lls of code .
So we thought we thought we &apos;re going to build it in the size of the virus , so that we can change the coveres to understand what the components of a cell cell cell living .
The design is crucial , and if we start with information in a computer , these need to be very accururate .
When we sequence this genome for the first time in 1995 , the first time in 1995 , it was a mid-walls .
We &apos;ve discovered , resequence , 30 errors . If we had been able to be able to be able to be able to do that .
One part of the process is design cheap for 50 layers that you get to all the other segent of 50 pounds to build a long time .
We start elements here .
It &apos;s just just you read that that we put of the slow-sslow-flow .
Think of the so , we have a genetic code on four layer : A , C , C and T.
Tre of those lls ls them together , they &apos;re about 20 amminods , and there &apos;s a specific specific of each other .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , franies of the fragement .
What we &apos;ve done to the beginning was authograised to do it .
Some of a lot of been hured by fact that it was no .
We designed these segments for poter-up to poter-up .
There are are reparent that reparent and put them together .
And we started to assembling the parts , we start with the bbunch of five to 17 mid-lands in a way to get to to 70,000 .
And in each step , we &apos;ve been produced in the seventually , so that we &apos;re trying to try to create a process that we &apos;re trying to create a very very cloud , as you see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems the tabellon a basis of a baskkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
When we &apos;re going to go to these very long long long , more than 100 mid-mid-mid-to---mid-walls ,
You get to the limit of modern biology .
So we &apos;ve been looking at the other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called the other mechanism called the omologist , which is to reparate the DNA to reparate DNA in the DNA able to reparate the DNA in the way .
Here &apos;s a example .
This organism , called Deinoccurrics , it can be a three million rad of radiation .
You can see in the high high high school as his chcheap .
In 12 hours , it &apos;s refled exactly how it was before .
They &apos;re thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be able .
They can live under the way .
They &apos;re absolutely absolutely absolutely the life in space , and you &apos;re sounds to find new extremely reference of water .
And the real , NASA has showed that this is .
This is a molecule that we built using these process , just using the lieventually using these design design .
The lieventually reeventually .
This image was not been taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a great molecule that we can see the microscope with a microscope .
These are photos that coat a period of six seconds .
This is the remarkation that we &apos;ve done a little time ago .
I &apos;m more than 5880,000 lls of code .
It &apos;s the most great , the most of a structure ever ever made from the man .
It &apos;s a molecular molecular ular .
If you &apos;re going to be a carcareful 10 to a carcareful to transppit , we &apos;d like 142 page to transcents this code de code .
Now , how do we do it ?
Of course , I mean , you have a game from kids .
It &apos;s a little more complicated when they use the bacteria .
It &apos;s more simple , when it &apos;s the same cells like our : you can just just track of nuclear cells and put a nuclear nuclear , which is basically basically the same process of clonation .
In the bacteria , the chchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchcheap of a cell cell cell .
We refed a little chchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchch
The two are different as men from mits .
We have a few gene in the more way that they choose to decide that chchchchchcheap .
And then he sell with the rich way to killing all the protected .
And when we put in the cell , the building was studies -- and you &apos;ll open our graphics -- the new cromy -- the new cromes .
And we started , we didn &apos;t start to go beyond , but we &apos;ve tried to get more in there .
This is one of the most of the most of evolution .
We discovered that tantisium species have to add a second or a third chchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchcheap in that species .
So who think about evolution as a gene , and the time that it doesn &apos;t have the most of biology .
And they &apos;re going to call me to retrial to retrip that that addiction to say that DNA .
The chchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchch
The phone phone phone phone phone that we put it .
It &apos;s exhibbbuled the other cromes like the other chchcheap , and we &apos;ve got to be a building and the new cell and the new cromes .
It &apos;s been blue because of the genes that we put .
And in a short short , all the characteristics of a species are going to be perform , and it &apos;s transformed in a new species , the basis that we put in the new software .
All the prototine are changing , the members are changing , and when we look at the code de de genetic code to what we transfted .
Now , this could look at the software alchemy , but we &apos;re going to change things in a sense .
Now , I &apos;ve been explains that here here is not about genesis -- but progress of the world , and I &apos;ve been told that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the exploring Cambriana in which will be new species on this .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s enough to be able to be able to our need .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion and a half billion in the next 40 years .
Right for a example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one .
We &apos;re going to be able to find food , water water and slow-scale , medicine and welal , and welline of people .
It will be more dant to do it for nine billion .
We &apos;re going to use more than five billion crisis , more than 30 billion bars .
That means percent of the bars .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process for repushing them , it will be a huge challenge .
And in the more we have to the world of the emission of the CO2 from these materials that finding in the atmosphere .
At the day , by the scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the future .
The electronics industry has only a dozer-store industry , and think about how many are different .
Our limits here is the principle here is actually the biological and the imagination .
We &apos;ve got the technic , because of these metods , in these metods , able to create what we call genomics combined .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can produce a million chchcheap .
Think about the 20 million genes of different different genes or to try to make a very mimimid-new vaccines , new vaccines , we can change , and more molecular biology now , and create more molecular biology now , and create more molecular biology .
And it &apos;s just a check .
We can choices for the possibilities of survival , production or of vaccines , production of vaccines .
This is an istic of some software programmed that we &apos;re working to be able to be able to be able to be able to sex us and design species .
Well , we don &apos;t know how they &apos;re going to be .
We know exactly what it &apos;s their genetic code .
We &apos;re focusing on the oil oil .
You &apos;ve also seen you that extrain from grain from grain .
We have a fuel of the second and third generation that will use enough to be dancy to the cover over the highest value as the pain or different kinds of butanle .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increase on food food and limited the food food food and limits in the food , which is to transforming the oil in the first time , we &apos;re working to design , and we think we &apos;re going to be able to the first , and we think we can can be the first fourth of about 18 months .
The solar solar solar combined with the CO2 is a metodownnal metods in all the world , we &apos;ve found different metods .
This is a organism that we &apos;ve got to invested in 1996 .
It &apos;s going to be in the ocean , about 2,500 feet of the water .
They think of the CO2 using using using the oxygen molecular energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can ininitial the CO2 , which can be able to be transported to the cover that CO2 in the oil , to be able to be able to report this process .
So we think we can be able to be able to increase what the question of &quot; which is the question of &quot; which is , we have the moon , we have the moon of the entire oil industry .
Right . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can &apos;t we do it ?
It was the main amount of energy .
And we &apos;re working to use the same metods to create vaccines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with the influence , we always come back to a dollar in less when it &apos;s find the vaccine .
I think that we can change building vaccines in anticial anticial .
And that &apos;s how the future could start look at the future of evolution , the tree of evolution , accelling evolution with the evolution with the synthetics , and ininince cells .
We &apos;re so much to make people .
Our purpose is to do in a way to live enough to try to try to try to try to try to do . Thank you very much .
And I want to show you , the most quickly , the most quickly , some fundamental work , new technology that we &apos;ve taken to the Microsoft in the following one year ago . This is Seadadly .
It &apos;s a a place that you can interacting it is that remoon with an enormous amount of data .
We &apos;re seeing many many giant giant ant ant ant digital with a kind of zoom , and continue , for a very very quickly , for a very very quickly , in the images like .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much much is the amount of information that we see , how much are the big spread .
Most of the photographs , and digital for example is a scansion for example is a scansion of Congress from the Biary Last of Congress , and reean an apixel .
It &apos;s not a difference because the only thing that we have the only one system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any moment . It &apos;s also a very flu architecture in any moment . It &apos;s also a very flying architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data are not .
This is Casa desolated Dickens . Every colonna represents a caple .
And to demonstrate you , and we don &apos;t know , we can do a thing , to see that it &apos;s a real representation of the wild , not a picture .
It could be a little bit more , to read a little bit electronic book .
I don &apos;t have a lot .
This is a most realistic example . It &apos;s a number of the number of the Wardian .
Every big image is the beginning of a sewhere .
And it really give you a little bit of the great version of a carcards of a wild review or a test of a taily spacy of a half , which is for a a half of a half .
We also have something that with the angle of this number of the World Wardian .
We &apos;ve created a public bank to the high high didioxygen -- very much more than the normal ination . And we put it on the extra extra extra .
If you want to see the characistics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific specific .
And this really really shows some of these ideas to get the limits of space on the screen .
We use that this means to the people to get the people to the people , and to other porate , but I don &apos;t have to be able .
Of course , the map is a most surviving of the most oven to this kind of technology .
And on this this way , if I don &apos;t want to say that we don &apos;t mean to give you to give us to give us to give you to give it in this field .
These are all the strongest in the United States , and there &apos;s a geosphere .
So we &apos;re going to be something else .
This is actually actually from the Web ; you can go to see .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which is that that spine two different technologies .
One is Seadly and the other is a very interesting research to the computer computer . It &apos;s a very interesting research to Noah , one student of the Last Seitz of the USeitz of MW and Rick SSnnnavikkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
And it &apos;s from the Web , to the Web , and I &apos;m going to be .
You can see this when we do this kind of screen , which we can go from a other image of the other and have this kind of experience to solve this .
But the columal spacer of the images here has actually a meaning .
The algorit-visualialization of the computer have been working , in the way that correspond to places that the imagination in which imagined -- all the time you see , all the time to the Montagague Remememements -- you see . Here &apos;s a lagagers . Here &apos;s a lot of re-stable to the friend of the things are all of the spaces of the spspaces ,
I don &apos;t know if I don &apos;t know if I &apos;ve got to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more more spread .
I want to go to one of the data of the original data of the Noahs -- and this is not just just just just just just to show that the first time to be able to reppit -- to show you what I think is really , the way to show you what I think is really , the round to show you that technology . And it &apos;s not just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just
We had to predict about the gain and he said .
This is a remarkable reduce the clower of NoDame images from Flickr . Badigit . Badigital . Badigit in Flickr and you get images of kinds of kinds of kinds of acacy in magazine , and he &apos;s been able to the image that &apos;s going to be able to keep this .
So they &apos;re all images from Flickr and they &apos;re all all connection to space space .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate in this simplant way .
You know , I &apos;ve never thought about the way to work for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratification to get this kind of accounts here .
I think that &apos;s a lot of different kinds of kinds of kinds of fotocaming : from those photococate SLR , a very significant number of different .
And if I can try to try to try to look more strikes .
Many of you &apos;re stuck by the way .
And I &apos;ve got a series of photographs -- and it &apos;s a series of photographs .
This is a poster of NoDame , and the correct .
We can go from the physics of physics that environment .
The essential is that we can do things with the social environment . This is where we &apos;re trying to be the data from the entire memory , from the whole memory , from the point of view -- and connected to all those data together .
All those are the photos of the parts of the parts of the parts .
You have a model of the entire land that emerge .
Think about this as the prolder of the work of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It &apos;s something that exexity in complex , and the people use them , and the whom that are the rantages for who are going to be with .
And they &apos;re mark with metapaphed by other people .
If somebody is the idea of contrasing all these smothers , my photos of the name of Nothing , my photos of NoDr. suddenly rererererequired to all those data , and I can use how to use it to use it to imate me to the space in that space , and I &apos;m going to have a kind of social experience , and the phphphotos of the images , and have a a kind of the mo-moon .
And yet , a consequence of all the extremely elaborate of all the extremely elaborate of all the interesting of the land , sounds not so much vivious and satellellellite images .
Milks .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What you know , what your software will be able to do is that to a certain point , in the next years , all the photographs and share if anybody from anybody in the world will be prin-connected together ?
BAA : Yeah . What it &apos;s doing in the fact that it &apos;s doing .
It &apos;s a kind of the hyperforming , if you want , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about remarkable to remarkable to the information that many of these images .
As you do a research research on the Web , you see a frase and the page of the Web has a lot about the information about pictures .
Now , what happens if that picture is the photos of all your photage ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of remarkable to remarkable that &apos;s very huge . It &apos;s a classic effect of the network . It &apos;s a classic effect .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really amazing .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the main west , when you travel and one of the waste of the research is that that we have to live in who don &apos;t dimented the traditions , who are actually diicted in the wind in the wind , and it &apos;s the hogs in the wind , the hogs in the wind , the houter of the plants .
Well , the way we think the skills Jaguar , or who are still in the Vy Lattea , or who are still cold to me , or who are still cold to me , or who are still cold to the resh of the Dharder , the most of the best best best best to the best best best best best , and the idea that we have the idea of the idea that we have to be able to the idea , but it &apos;s actually , the idea that we don &apos;t just just just just just just just just about a sense of the idea that we have a sense of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea that we can &apos;t just to reflow ,
The consequence of a particular set of choices that our stirds , well , well or ununknown , well or unknown , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share the extremely .
We all all of the smom .
We &apos;re smom to start .
We need to be a churity of death , so we don &apos;t care if we &apos;re going to talk --
We all have a art art .
What it &apos;s the kind of the particular particular of the song , the ritual of all of all culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that are the forest of the Borneo , or the following of the Voodoo Haiti , or the Haiti , or the Cural , Curan Cural , Curn Curer , Curn Curer , a cameras .
He was my task of the journey of the journey in the desert , or a evator of ype in the values of the Her , the Mest , the mother , the mother &apos;s mother .
All of these are teaching us that are other ways of exist exists to think , other ways of try to think , other ways of move in the world .
And , if you think a moment , it &apos;s a concept that can give you a concept that we &apos;ll give you a conceive .
And I mean , the mid-genetic life of the world are creates a double of the becoming out the planet and cultural , and it &apos;s important for the planet , as the planet as as the biological biological .
And you can think about this gain , as a etnosy , and you can definitely definition of all the concepts of all the concepts , and , unmites , the inspiration of the human .
The etnoshere is the great cheap of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbole of what we can be in how we can be in how species .
And because the biosphere was the same unknown as well as it happened to the etnosy , and it too much more quickly .
No biological , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all the species is on the orest of the gestestintion because it &apos;s flist -- in the powerful , or in the extrain -- in the field of biological diversity -- and it doesn &apos;t get to the most powerful .
The one of all of this is , of course , the perperspective .
When you &apos;re born there were 6,000 linging on this planet .
One of the language is not composition to a series of grammatics or a series of rules rules rules .
One of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle with which is the animation of every culture is in the world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a bunch of mind , a thought , a ecosystem .
And of those 6,000 lingue , as we &apos;re sitting at Monterey , at least half half half the half of the children .
They don &apos;t teach kids , the children , the case that means , to less than the campal , which are already death .
What is more trister and to be a little bit of the silence , of the last at the last at a language , of the last at the time , of the time or of anticipate or anticipate the promising of the children ?
This is a few weeks , I &apos;ve been a few weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks , and it &apos;s going to be a few weeks , and it &apos;s a few weeks , and a language .
And I know , I know , &quot; Don &apos;t you do it ?
The world would not be a better place if we look at all the same language ? &quot;
We talk about kogs .
You &apos;re going to have a tract thing that means to talk to their language .
I &apos;d like to do you do a journey through the etnosy --
a little journey in the etnoshere to give you a message of what we &apos;re going to be able .
Many of us dimented that when I say , &quot; different ways of exist exist .
Let &apos;s take for example , this bimbe , in Amazony , the people in the Man inan in-hadadadadded , which credit to try from the foundation of the Last in the panpants of the wild .
It &apos;s a populations that is not able to distinct the blue blue , because the time you &apos;re identify in the time , which is identify in the time , which depends the people .
They have a strished strished shaper , I said , &quot; exogogue , &quot; you have a different person who talks about a different person that talks about a different language .
Everything has been the past mitological , in the past mitological particularly is that in these families and estan in those families , and the six or seven ling-ling-----h-----h-----h-----hoom .
They &apos;re going to listen and then start to talk .
Let &apos;s take one of the most interesting tribes with the most interesting people that I have been been , Waoran , a ununknown people that had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , they &apos;ve been a contact of the sounds a mistakes .
They &apos;ve done it down from the top of the top of the hurn that they were going to have a wasten-dimensional forest , dimenting that this people have never seen anything than bi-dimensional forest .
They &apos;ve been taken the land , the land , they have to the research of a form or a form and , not find nothing , they have been cloud that they were treated by the five .
But the Waorans don &apos;t killed only hurs .
They were killed between them .
54 percent of mortality was used by their same .
We &apos;re been a generations of eight generations and we found two of natural death and when we have been been invent to know , they put that one of them was invited , and then they had been been been invited , and then they had killing it .
The crisks were able to recognize the animal from 40 pass and recognize the species .
In the early &apos; 80 , I was a very interesting task , I was a very interesting man of Harvard I asked to go to Haiti , I wanted to go to Haiti in the base of the potential .
To give a sense to a miracy , I would have to take the culture Vodoo and that Vodoo is not magical .
It &apos;s quite a complex view of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristian , Islam , Buddddhey , Ebraism , so eter .
A continent is always left out of the sub-Saaaan Africa has not not have to religious . And instead , and say , Voodoo &apos;s not the other than the sub-to-to-wil-wil-demic .
What it &apos;s interesting is the woodoo is the intense to life and death .
So the walls are going to be able to the spirites .
The spiritual can be invocated by Grange Actually , they respond to the dance of the dance and they remarkable to the seventually , in the way that for a short time .
And so that the dooooists are going to say , &quot; Very white who go to talk about God .
We have a double and then we become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re sitting , is the spirit that you can do you do you see , how you can do you do it ?
So you &apos;ve got to find these incredible events , the voodoo in was trance that touch the sounds that touch cles are very strong , rather than the body of the body in the body of the body when it &apos;s been extremely .
And I have all the people with the most extraordinary people who have been the most extraordinary .
I think of the antestestors that once once live on the planets that once once live on the planets of the Colombia in the conquic inches of the insecurity that you can get a check of the sky that you &apos;re going on on the mouth .
In a continent that that had to blood , this people have never been conquisted by the spread .
And we have been been by a clly nured by a clly .
The young people following the roughout of the families and three or four or four or years , and they live in a wild world , and it &apos;s going to be in the end of the layer than 18 .
Two , by the nine years , they choices to re--months of gestation that translation in the mother , now are metaphor , now , they &apos;re metaphor .
And so that time , they &apos;re acculated to values , which are going to see that their prever and only their prevent and just their prevent to the equity and the equilient , or better .
At the term of this incredible initial , they have been been been taken out and for the first time in life , at the age of 18 years , you see a bunch . And in that I think of the first bince , when the sun the bone of the beautiful beautiful . And that they &apos;ve learned that they &apos;ve learned in the talk about his own .
&quot; Vising ? Probably as I said .
It &apos;s been a pend . Now , it &apos;s going to have . &quot;
They call a fratles , and say that we , fratles , we are the colcold of the world .
This level of the intuition is extremely important .
And when we think about the most of the Indian exist and the old history of the wising of the wisdom of the wising , which is a conceive of the same way , or maybe invosion , and they say that these are more neighborhood .
The people are not ninined nal inin-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-hhoses .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the palube in the skat of the Arain in the moon , but thank you , but thank you , and I think , they have a mystic stery of the conceiver of the conception of the conception of the conception , the conception of the conception of the world .
What does it mean ?
It &apos;s going to say that a girl who are going to be able to be a little bit of the mountain is a Apple that will be a human human bees . It &apos;s going to be a human human beings , or that &apos;s a little bit more than a girls that they &apos;re going to have a little bit different standing on the mountain .
And that &apos;s the dimer of one spirit , or a mineral is irriant to .
What is the interesting is the metaphor that defines the individual and the natural world .
I &apos;m stood up in the forests of the forests that forests the forests that they were going to be clearly .
And this has been different from my friends . And I have to be different from my Kwake that the forests are the dimitter of Hukukuk and the bal is the hoth of the world , and the downnnal , which are going to extrain in the world , the Hamong Hamong .
If you start to look at that these culture can create different , you can start to start some of them discoveries . Prench this plan . Prench . We &apos;ll be a little bit .
I &apos;ve been taken this picture to aprile in the Amazony .
Maybe some of you &apos;ve heard about the ayaahuh , the most powerful psychoactive actual acactual repertory .
What it makes it fer the ayaahuash is not the potential druological druological phphphphphphphphphphphant . It &apos;s what it &apos;s going to be .
From a one of the leana , the leavy of a bunch of a bunch of wild and smom , smom and slowly , it &apos;s a lot of gogs .
And I &apos;m going to be a commoon the land has a little bit of the constantly , but it &apos;s mistakes , but it &apos;s mistakes with the fourth of a caffaffic family ,
This was a lot of the potent that constantly , very similar to the very very similar , dimethypine , five , a half , a five , a methypamine .
If you ever see the Yanoms to the none of the none of species , you &apos;ve got a different kind of species , you &apos;ve got a methypypamine .
Tiring that pollue to nose the sent of a little bit like to be shapes from a fule of dipit and sent your eyes and sent on a electricity .
I wanted to be often with my professor , Richard Evan Shules , the man who has been safterter-hhhhot , with his discovery of the inogens in the &apos; 30 years in Mexico .
Second my tis not to the classificate of these tripppamine as as alalyes because if you &apos;re not to tell any of them to be alalalalent . But , they can &apos;t be ununununununteous because they &apos;re ununununununununununed to the hair , because they &apos;re also going to be a ununununununcent , but they can actually be a unununununununununununununununless .
It &apos;s possible to reminds the orally if you get to the other expensive chemical that seventually seventually ,
Now , it &apos;s the beautiful : the nal meal that are ininjobs of the MAO , the same kind of the same kind of the same kind of the same kind of the same things that are going to be in a 80,000 species of plants , like these people who are doing these people in a 80,000 species , like these people who are going to have a couple of people who are going to be able to be a cheap in the same way to the same same way ,
We use the great eugal , and the mid-mid-h-haf , which can revehiced .
But if we ask the Indians , you tell us &quot; The plants are going to talk . &quot;
What does it mean ?
This store , the Cofan , has 17 variety of the ayaahub , which they have to get nicicly in the forest , and that we &apos;re going to get in the same species .
If you ask how to do how they do their tables to say , &quot; I thought I understand it , the rest of the rest of the world , of the rest of the rest of the world , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : they take 17 variety in a night of the night of a pioner and each one .
With this is not a very more interesting that you &apos;re very more interesting that content to content me .
Now , in the way , the problem is that also the problem is that also the people who have heart people who have a heart roll them in a few ways of our own world , and they &apos;re somehow to our real world , and they &apos;re going to be able .
In fact , the 111st century , in 300 years , it will not remember for his innovations , but as it was in which we fered and have a lot of the technology , but as it was in the way , and we have a passion of the planet . Now , the problem is not the problem . Now , the problem is not the problem . Now , the problem is not the problem . Now , the problem is not the problem .
All the culture through the secure of the secure of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indian Sioux don &apos;t have to be Sioux when they put it from part of the Americans have have been sent and fasts like Americans have been been been , when they put it from the horse and hhhot .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that they &apos;re used the integrity of the etnosy . It &apos;s the power . It &apos;s the power .
The way to the domination of the domination .
And if you look at a look at the world , you see that these are not destinate to satives .
They &apos;re living and dynamics and dynamics from the exist from the extra forces that go beyond their ability to adaptation .
I think it &apos;s kind of disbosed in the think of the think of the think --
a noms of the noms of Saraware , in the safford , a people who have been been a rich rich in the forest , and redated to the next titution , where you can see the founding there , where you can see the faster . where you can see the faster .
You &apos;re ready to rerepair the waste of the forest .
But yet , in the Yanomami , are the disease that are coming with the discovery of the those .
If we put on the mountain of the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing many of the research , you see the double of the policy .
As you know , the genocide , the intion of a populations , it &apos;s been been to universal , but the destruction of the style , the destruction of life , but it &apos;s not just unable to be an ununknown , but it &apos;s going to be in the insection of the development .
And you can &apos;t understand the rolder of the Tibet , because they don &apos;t part of the beginning .
I just have 6,000 miles from Chutdu in China in the West , in the West , in Lhasa with a young young connected , but just came to Lhasa . But it &apos;s the statistics of the statistics of that we &apos;ve been on .
6,000 monuments are sacrers in the pollus and slow-wwwelers .
1,,2 million people killed if the military in the Chinese Culal Culal .
The father was the guy was discritical to the Panchen Lama .
The reason that it was killed to the time of invasion .
And it &apos;s required with Sua Santity in Santity in the diaspora .
And she was employed and his weled her hell was required .
It was taken to a nnone of the age of two years , they &apos;re going to have a living .
The guy , who had done the same , it was mitted in the camp of redididididiers .
A day has inined a bunch of haked a bunch of Mao and , for this translation , it was mitted to seven years .
The pain of the Tibet can be ininincome , but the spirit of the people is from the people from the people is from tentener .
At the end , everything is reduce to a choice .
Let &apos;s go to live in the world of the monotic monotic monotic monotic monotic monotic monotic monotic monotic monotic monotic , or we want to get the world .
The great anthrologist Margaret Man , before he said that his most of the most of the most of the great cheap , in our own view of the world , not only we &apos;ll see the whole gams of human imagination . But a single thing that we &apos;ll give us a very , thinking , but a day day , I &apos;ll give us a lot of thinking about a way that they were able to be able to the other possibility .
And it &apos;s a billion to remember that our species is exist for 60,000 years .
The First Neolution , that has given us us to agriculture , which has done sweight of the crising of the seeming , and re----year-old , dedealing the poetry of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world has been to store 300 years .
And that I don &apos;t suggests that we don &apos;t suggests that we have the answers that we &apos;re going to have to go in the millended to come .
When I mean , these mid-genes of culture is asked what we want to say , humans respond to 10,000 different different .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all refed the possibilities of being what we &apos;re , a kind of confishing , which we have to have all the giant amount of good , and there are great , and there are great , and there are great , the same moments of the same .
I &apos;ve been taken this on the end of the end of Baffin , when I went to cacks with Inuit , and this man , and this man , and this man , and this man , and this man , he had told me the wonderful story of his grandgrandmother .
The government is not always been always genes with the Inuit and the 1950 to solve our smom , and in the &apos; 50 to depend , we have to reusers in colonies .
The grandmother &apos;s the man will refed us .
The family , I &apos;m going to be the family , and I &apos;ll give all his beings .
You know , you know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t have the cold cold , you know , it &apos;s slow .
The buline buline in origin in origin in the origin of career .
The grandmother &apos;s not this man didn &apos;t have a slow---h-slow-slow-slow-slow-like .
It &apos;s swise , it &apos;s haked the pantyons of the smoon and defecated in their hand . When they did it , they have been smom , they have been sounds a lama .
It &apos;s been salive on the bull of this collie , and when he became sold , he killed a dog .
It &apos;s a wild and created a daughter , with the crisis has created a sliter , has impleased a sliter , has been been a sliter on the banks of the banks , the tells of the hit .
Let &apos;s go to talk about the horse ?
Nelil aprile 1999 government government has rerereed to Inuit , the total area of the most of the greater of the greater of California and Texas , the Texas ,
It &apos;s the new cheap .
It &apos;s a independent , and they &apos;re all the world .
One splendier of like a nation-re-re-re-re-re-re-concivent .
And , for the final , I think it &apos;s rather oven to the planet , and the planet , make it that they &apos;re not remote .
For somebody is house .
They &apos;re representing the human imagination that they &apos;re going to get the alba of the time . And for us all of these children , as the sets of our children , as a safterterography of hope .
For the National Geographic Geographic , we &apos;ve got to be able to be any .
We believe that the polemics --
&#91; &#91; &#91; Applausers are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the best institution to tell the stories of our world . We have a 35 million visiting .
156 countries will put our dog television .
Our revivivious people are lets from millions of people .
Our work is to travel in the nosultimate to the public places of wonderful and cultural places from which are going to the well-in-in-in-time time , and we hope , the most exist of the central anthroughout of the exist in the world , and we need to find a style of life , and we need to find a style in a world , and we need to find a world . And we need to find a styyyyyyyle in the world and and and and and we have have have have have to find a world .
where the sagreed of all the people can conconstantly our wissues .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope you &apos;ve heard and just just just just just just to be a lot of connected , in the case not notice .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the dogue . &quot;
The dogs official official ?
The west official official society of all the West dogue , the official official official , &quot; If we want to have the well-hurs to do it is the individual . &quot;
The reason is , from a hand , in fact that the freedom is in the same value , is predictable , exexist for human beings .
And so , by the other is that if we &apos;re liant to us us to understand that that we &apos;re going to do everything that that allowed our own own own , no one that they decide in our own .
The way of the freedom of the freedom is the choice .
More people have , more and more is the most libes , and more is their freedom , the most of the freedom , it &apos;s their wellow .
This , I &apos;m going to be so much , it &apos;s so much , it &apos;s so much , they have a dreams of that .
And it &apos;s also deeply deeply deeply ,
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress is .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly great .
I just just have a simple notice on the mouth .
In my supermarket , there are 175 , no context of the extrade of the extrade of the extrade of the extrade , and 12 acets that you can buy a number of force in the resulous amount of the resulous surrents that you can buy a number of 175 , it &apos;s going to be in your own .
Here &apos;s the supermarket .
And then you go to the electronics of electronics to buy a pig : CD , the CD , the CD , CD , CD , light light , light .
And in this single single store is a big number of electronics , there &apos;s a big number of audddry .
We can do 6 million combinations using the components that are in a only store .
Bisogs to put that there is a very much choice .
Also many camps : the world of communications .
One time , when I was a child , they could get all the phone phone phone phone , payer that were paid to the mit were to mit .
It &apos;s just just the phone , they didn &apos;t buy it .
One consequence of that , between the other , it was that the phone never double .
These days are gone .
Now we &apos;ve now a variety of the phone , especially in the phones .
Here &apos;s the phones of the future .
My favorite is in a middle , slow-up , slow-foot , covered the band and forth for the smoke , and foreating me .
If you don &apos;t have seen in the store , you &apos;ve got a lot of time , you &apos;ll be able to be .
And what the end is that people go to the end of the end of the question is , you know what the answer is &quot; No ? The answer is &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a phone that doesn &apos;t have to make something .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the same explosion of the same explosion of choices .
Asnnnurity : not the most in the United States that you &apos;re going to be able to be .
Instead , you know , you know , and the dumped you , &quot; OK , &quot; OK , &quot; OK , &quot; Well , &quot; Are these benefits and these are the benefits and these are they . What do you want to do you to do ? &quot;
Tu the dogs , &quot; Dr. , what I should I do you do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A has these benefits and these risks , and B has these benefits and these risks . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebits , &quot; Dr. if she was me , what would you do you say , &quot; Dr. &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I don &apos;t have her . &quot;
The result of the result of the instrument , &quot; expression that does it look like a beautiful thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not that one move the weight and responsibility to decisions from somebody who know something , and it &apos;s the dumb , to somebody who knows anything -- and almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost used to decisions .
There &apos;s a huge marketing produced produced by the people like me and you , I know , that if you think about it , you think , it &apos;s not a sense , because we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t you buy them , because they use them ?
The answer is that they want to ask the answer to ask the dancy to ask ask us to ask us .
Something we &apos;ve been as the fundamental as as our identity is ever a question of choice , as you see in this vivivious , &quot; We don &apos;t want to get children . They &apos;re not going to have to inventing the right now , &quot; We need to inventing the most identity , we have to inventing .
And we can reinvented us us .
The next thing that means that every morning , you have to decide that kind of person person want to be .
And I &apos;m going to be a family and the time the time the next time , I have a common common content , unsposes almost for anybody , and they started the most expression , and they started the most pression .
The only one choice was with who , and even when I don &apos;t even when I don &apos;t even when it .
Onnal , everything is really to play .
I love to students very smart , and I &apos;m going to be 20 percent in less of time .
And because they &apos;re not less brilliant , because they &apos;re not less diligenes .
But why are I imposition , I mean , I mean , I should I have to ask me , or not you ? &quot;
&quot; I should I have to be a little bit more , or I think before the children or to be ? &quot;
I &apos;m interrogative .
And they &apos;re trying to answer these questions , even if this implics , even if this implant that you don &apos;t get a lot to be a voice .
And they have to really do it .
Now , the job : We lucky , as Carl of the way , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , every day , every day , from every day , from all of the planet , and they &apos;re going to work .
Ter parentis , there &apos;s a angoline , and I don &apos;t tell anybody that , where the WiWithas works .
I don &apos;t tell that , because I want to use it .
What means , this incredible freedom of choice that we have about the work ? It &apos;s going to be able to continually , in every moment , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son to play , with the phones in a pair , Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , and the notebook , on the ginocococulation , on the gyyyocy .
And even if I &apos;m all just just just just , every minute that we see our son , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; Does I said , &quot; Does this ? &quot;
&quot; I mean , I answer this ? I had to this letter ? &quot;
And also when the answer is no , &quot; This makes experience the experience of your son of your son of a lot of different than than the other conditions .
So , from any time we look at all , things and the great objects , objects and the life is a question of the question .
And then , you know , there were some possibilities , but they were some possibilities .
The world today is just just like this : The world is , &quot; It &apos;s a good thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Seping is Seping .
The good good well----------strikes .
All of this reasons that &apos;s two negative ,
The first first , paradly , it &apos;s that they &apos;re going to be very much .
And so , as a lot of the ones that choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I &apos;m going to give you a significant study of the founded of the depensive sounds .
A colleague has been taken on the Vandendenium , the giant ant ant ant society of the founding of the crisis , with about a million .
And what she discovered is that for all 10 solutions that are offerte in the most percental of the percental adophhesian .
With 50 covering , there is 10 percent in less than the hair as as as they are available available . Why ?
Because with 50 degrees of which choices , it &apos;s ununbelievable to decide , and the choice is reflow to the intimate .
And I &apos;m going to ask the colans , and I &apos;m going to be .
But you know , it doesn &apos;t just mean that these work on the old people are going to be enough money , it &apos;s also going to say that the decision is so so so dator that they &apos;re also so so so so so so so dator of the dator of the dator of work .
Not particularly participate , they &apos;re going to be able to five dollars from dator , which would be well .
So the paralive is a conconsequence of the trophy .
And I think that &apos;s the world so .
&quot; And for the final eternity : ketchas , you &apos;re going to be a hoom ? &quot;
You know , you know , if it &apos;s to the right right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong wrong .
So this is the first effect . The second is that if we can evooid the paralive and make a choice , we &apos;re less sswide by the end of how we would be been with less options between which .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that that we have to have the rich , and you buy a lot of the way , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would be better . And that that &apos;s the alternative imagination . And that &apos;s what &apos;s the alternative imagination to the imagination . And the reminuum , and the seventually , the seventually reminded the seventually , the sation ,
And then when it was a very good decision .
More there are more easy to be able to be able to any detail .
And there &apos;s the most , that the economic economists call &quot; &quot; &quot; A-opportunities .
Dan Gilbert has been very well , as the value of the value that we &apos;re going to think about things that we &apos;re going to do .
And so , when there are many options , it &apos;s easy to represented to the characteristics of the alternative and being less sevel and be less seventually .
Here &apos;s a example . I use with all those who are not in New York .
But it &apos;s probably probably probably think .
There &apos;s this couple of the Hamptons .
A place of luser .
Spig splendial . Otttttle . It &apos;s all for them .
It doesn &apos;t get nothing . But that he thinks is , &quot; Well , &quot; Well , it &apos;s Agust . &quot;
&quot; Everybody of my neighbors are . &quot;
&quot; I could parking up to front of the house . &quot;
And it &apos;s two weeks , from the idea that is that it &apos;s perdying -- the possibility of park where it wants .
The constation for the ssssssssssssssssssssssslowly .
And more are the options that we have to think , more characterterterterwards , we have to be reve-opportunities .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
There &apos;s about the moment , and maybe in the moment , and maybe in live .
But the most important point is that any thing you choices , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
The things that we don &apos;t have many actual acactual acactual things that we do .
Term point : the growing on the way of expectation .
I tried to my push a new couple of jeans .
I &apos;m almost always always jeans .
One time , you know , they were just a kind of one , and they sounds safterwards , they were smoon , and they were just just just just after it .
So , I went to buy a couple of time when those old were left , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my own . &quot;
The committed said , &quot; Li wants to me , &quot; First , rerepresented , represented ,
Li wants with the certain nian hons ? &quot;
&quot; Li : Li Would you say , &quot; Li ? &quot;
&quot; See them clary or stricks ? Bil the bil -- &quot; Continuum .
I was slower , and after a little bit of , and after a little bit , I want the kind that -- that was the only kind of the kind of the guy , so for a few people who had to me . And then I was going to get the other than the other or of the other or , the best best or of the best couple of , and the best couple of .
It was the last time . With all that I had the best way .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for the way .
The reason I was worse that I was that with all of that choice had been allowed to be perfect .
I had expected to be minime . I didn &apos;t expectional , when there was only a kind of , but when I saw 100 different , at least , at least , at least , I had to be perfect .
And I had a good isted , but not perfect .
After I started paragoned that I was trying to do that I was inssation-resuled .
The add of options in life of the people don &apos;t do that increase the expectations that have to expectent of the same expedition .
And that will be less sweight , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing if it &apos;s made .
Because if they knew , they don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more to that .
&quot; It was better when he was worse , &quot; The reason I was better when you were worse , I was worse , or it was still possible to be able to be able to be able to the surrying .
Onnal , in the world where we live -- opultimate , industrialized aders with expectful of the perspective that things are in the alalalalal .
You &apos;ve never been surprised because your expectful , I &apos;m going to expecties , they &apos;re ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- that you &apos;re here -- it &apos;s , &quot; Well , &quot; Yeah , &quot; Yeah , &quot; Yeah , you want to do it . &quot;
I mean -- I mean -- that I &apos;m really really really remarkable and my wife is really studies .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I don &apos;t have to do better , I don &apos;t have to do better , I don &apos;t have to do better , I didn &apos;t have to do better , I didn &apos;t have to do better , I don &apos;t have to do better , I didn &apos;t have to do it better , I didn &apos;t have to do better ,
But content it doesn &apos;t always be a bruted .
And finally , a consequence of the buy a couple of jeans , when there is just that kind of jeans is that when you &apos;re not sssswide , and ask you ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot;
The world is the question is the question . What I could do you do that ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of jeans , and you buy a in-sssmodly , and you ask you who is the responsible responsible , is the responsible , is the good responsible .
You could have to do better .
With hundreds of various various , there are not going to be the inintrial .
So when people have decisions , even if the result is , even if the result is , they feel like sssssssswide and they &apos;re sweight .
And the last years , the depression is the exploring world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only important , but important -- that &apos;s the most of this depression that people have been too alty .
And when they have to explain this situation that the rolder is .
So the result is that in general , we &apos;re better than we &apos;re going to be worse .
Let me remember that I remember .
This is the dogram , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely freserve . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no one of a double that a little choice of choice is better than I don &apos;t have any any any more choice is that much choice is better than a little choice .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic value . I don &apos;t know what .
But I &apos;m enough that we have to have a piece of level in which the choices will be our life .
Now , from the political view -- I almost finished -- from the politics , the nocy is the follow .
What it allows all this choice in the industrial society is the remarkable material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , in which the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too paid .
So the way the welelda I &apos;m talking about is a nurely welium , rerericulal society .
And that it &apos;s going to have and arrarration----------deeply , and comods to the bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
I mean , I mean , complicated and dispendious , it &apos;s not that they &apos;re just just initious .
I &apos;m going to say that it &apos;s a deleteries .
We &apos;re going to be worse .
If you have a little bit of what in our society allows that they have too much choice , where people have too much much , it &apos;s not just their life to make life to make a life .
This is what economists call a impressive immate .
A reduction of the income in -- not just to all the poor people -- because of this choice in the except that we &apos;ve got .
And to go to the &quot; First , you can become everything that you want to be what you want to be all &quot;
You know , people , you think , &quot; What &apos;s what you believe that weight ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s where you can &apos;t get nothing in a bocl of the glass . &quot;
&quot; A lot of the imagination , a limited view of the world -- &quot;
And I have the interpretation , so I &apos;ve been interpretation .
But then , I think , instead , I &apos;m rescued that weight the long time .
Because the fact , it &apos;s that if you &apos;re in a frankkle , in the way that &quot; all , &quot; you can &apos;t good . &quot; It &apos;s going to be the freedom . It &apos;s a parallililights .
If you take the boccer in the way that everything we can diminds the sssssssssssssssssssssmodly .
And you &apos;re going to be the paralive , and you &apos;ll be the well-being .
Everyone needs a shere .
This is almost almost almost too much much much , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the one of symbolic sent , it &apos;s a rich for the income and , I mean , for the rovine .
Thank you heart .
