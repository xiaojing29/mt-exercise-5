Last year I showed these slides to show that the artica to show that the glacial ice , which for almost three million years , has the size of 48 United States .
But this underneath the gravity of the problem because it &apos;s not showing the ice of the ice of the ice .
The artica is glacial ice is , in a sense , the clean heart of global climate system .
It &apos;s about winter and the summer .
The next slide is going to be a carrelevant revenue , the last 25 years .
The glaces are reported in red .
And as you see , they &apos;re expanding to the blue .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter , which is the summer ice .
You can see that the soil said , about five years or more , is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood here , which is a blood here from the body .
In 25 years , it was so that .
This is a problem because the deeper interested in the arctic ocean where there are enormous amount of fuel fuel that , skiing , they go into the arctic ocean where there are enormous amount of fuel that , they go into metane .
I &apos;m going to do this in the total of atmospheric pollution , that amount could be doubling , that amount could be doubling , that amount could be doubling , that amount could be doubling , that amount could be doubling , that amount could be doubling , that amount of global warming , that amount could be doubling , that
In Alaska little deeper in Alaska metan is already righting from water .
The Katey Proessor Katey Walter at the University of Alaska team , and a team prices at the past winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You &apos;re good . The question is if we &apos;re going to be that .
And that &apos;s a reason this is that this thermal surrise from the north .
This is a river at the glacial regime .
The ported never had the similar levels .
This is the Kangerlussuathethethetheast of the Greenland in the southwest of the Greenland .
If you want to know how the sea level to the shelter for the shelter of glaces on land , here is where the sea reaches .
These currents are increasing .
On the other side of the planet : Antarctica , the largest blocks of the planet .
Last month , scientists have delared that the balance of ice is in negative , and the Western Antarctttttica , which pogy on some submarine islands , is particularly quiture in the skiest .
It &apos;s about six feet of the five feet of it , like Groenland .
Sulil Himalaya , the third largest blocks of ice , you see new lagey , that few years ago .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population received half of the wells .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the water of this city .
The ported is increased .
But when it decreass , the same falls to water .
In California , snow on the Sierra Nevada has been 40 percent .
The hyries are in the crisis .
The predictions , as you read , they &apos;re grasses .
The safety growing up in the world &apos;s leading to a remarkable increasing inceness .
The environmental disaster are increasing to a rhythm and unprecedented .
Four times more of the last 30 years I was before 75 .
This is a kind of unsustainable .
If you look in the historical context if they can see the consequences .
For the last five years , we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day .
Look at the attempt the area of East Pacific , from the Americas to the West , and both the parts of the Indian subcontinent , where there &apos;s a radical royscontinent on the oceans .
The greater cause of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossil fuels .
The oil is a problem , and coal-coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two of the most emissions , together to China .
And it was proponates to build a lot of other central centers .
But we &apos;re seeing a change of a change of direction .
These are the announced projects in the last few years and some alternative ways .
And in any way , there &apos;s a political fight in our country .
The coal-coal and oil has spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the coal of the year to promote cocoal , which is a bone .
And that picture I reminded me --
Natale , in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a loss of 3.8 billion geters of coalers .
You may have seen it on the news .
This is the second largest flow of the flow of the shortage in America .
It &apos;s happened around Christmas .
Ninalize one of the coal of the coal of industrial .
Video : Sweet the carbon , it &apos;s a kind of allegro and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it &apos;s growing our economy .
Frosty the carbon is increasing .
It &apos;s at good price , adorable and the workers keep the workers .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The greatest minerary society is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I &apos;ll be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosososis , Harry Re--- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima has launched two campaign .
This is one of them , a part .
Video : At the next thing : At the match ALergy , we see climate change like a serious threat our business .
For that our priority is to invest a large amount of money in a publish advertising for public and confused the coal truth .
In fact , coal is not sports .
We think it &apos;s pulit -- it &apos;s also a good profumo .
So don &apos;t preupside of climate change .
Let me go to us .
Video : Caw : Call -- you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
So let &apos;s go to a turn into a look at the Savanch for it , for it &apos;s about fuel .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little noisy , but this is the sound of the pulit technology .
The fuel consumption is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology of pulit that you see changes everything .
You look at this : this is the pulist of pulist .
Al Gore : The positive alternative is connected to economic issue and the economic issue of national safety .
Video : America is in the crisis ; national safety ; the economy , climate crisis .
The filter that connects to all : our dependence from fossil fuels , like cocoal and oil .
Now , there &apos;s a new , audacace solution for being circuit .
Regeneral : 100 percent of clean energy in 10 years .
A plan to report for America to make us more safe , and help stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that drinking our problems .
Repower America . You &apos;re more .
Al Gore : That &apos;s the last .
Video : It &apos;s about re-energy .
One of the faster ways of putting the dependence on fuel from fuel that killing our planet .
Comparsa : The future is here . Goll , the future , sun , a new energy network .
So , you know , New extiments for good work well retributed .
Complplementy : Regeneral . It &apos;s time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old African lunch says , &quot; If you want to go fast , go from alone .
If you want to go away , go together . &quot;
We need to go far quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED I introduction .
And you can get back to the back to you go back to how the car works .
So I am here . And for those that the other time we didn &apos;t have , the LHC is the greatest scientific experiment ever attempted -- 27 kilometers of circles .
His task is to rear the conditions that were less than a billiondesimate than a billiondest of a second at 600 million times per second .
That &apos;s just ambitious .
This is the car under Ginevra .
We &apos;d be photographs these mini-Big Bang in the relevant .
This is what I work on . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- it &apos;s 44 feet and it &apos;s a diameter of 22222 feet .
This is an ATLATLATLAS in construction so you can see the proportions .
The 10 September of the last year we have pped the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken from ATLATLAS .
It was because of immense fit in in control .
It &apos;s an image of particles that had done all the around the LHC , and entering in collision , deliberately , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles inside the relevator .
In other words , when we saw that image the 10 September , we realized that the machine worked , which is a great vination .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to do more or this , when somebody went on Google and saw that the beginning of Google and saw that the beginning was this .
That means we &apos;ve had a cultural impact beyond scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the car , it was just these filters here -- these dories sleeping .
These files will take 13,000 ampamping when the car works at the most of the power .
Now , the technical technical , they &apos;re going to look at the films and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . They &apos;re too throws . &quot;
And they can do that because when they &apos;re very cold , they &apos;re very cold of the so-called films .
So , at less 271 degrees , at a lower temperature at the space between the stars , these films can bring that current that current .
In one of the gigypan of the magnetic , the magnear the LHC , there was a defect of factory .
So the files surrise slightly , and the 13,000 amppherant , and the 13,000 ampals suddenly met an electrical resistance .
That was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think these magnetic magnear that these magnetic magnear , and that they moved from about 30 inches .
They &apos;re damaged about 50 magnetic .
We had to take them , what we did .
We &apos;ve reinated them and wearing .
They &apos;re now coming back all the sub-war .
I &apos;m going to be a new integrate .
We will accept it , and we expect to get data to judge or July , and continuing our adventure to find out what the brains are constitute to the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these crashes reach the value of science and the value of science and the valuable engineering .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so difficult , the fact to go beyond limits , I think is the value of things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of a Inglese Inglese , Humphrey Davy , who , I guess , in the defense of experiments of her clean , his pupillo was Michael Faraday , said , &quot; No is so dangerous for the progress of human mind as human mind as well as the ideas of science as the ideas of science as the ideas of science is definitive , that doesn &apos;t expense in nature . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start asking about rethink about rethink about when you , you play with the morning .
And as you were able to get them and grab them and get them and get them and move , and you learn to think and solving problems and resolved spacecting and resolution relations .
So , space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , from the usememployed by our own interaction with physical objects , together to my Pattach-consulator , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking asking , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of having the mouse , we use a computer , instead of having the mouse , we could have to get them , we could have to have the information with their hands ,
and fix it as well ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building Sifmonetary .
In a few words , a Siftool , a big interactive computer as a biscope .
In a few words , a Siftool , a big interactive computer as a biscope .
And you can see them , they can see them , &quot; they can see &quot; they &quot; they feel their movement and they have a screen and a wireless radio .
But above all , they &apos;re physical , like the morning , you can just move them to just get shells .
The Sifmoneterosystem of tools to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physical , conscious of the movement , of the other , and as they become more physical , conwardness of other , as they become more physical , the movement of other people , how we can we explore new fun styles of interaction .
I &apos;m going to start with some simple example .
This Sifounded to show video : if you include it in one direction , if you include it in one direction , it &apos;s going to rotate on the other hand .
These interactive portraits of other people are aware of the other .
If I put them , you care about what they &apos;re going to them .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can note it and they can act a little bit .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can note it and they can act a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was that they could use common gesture on data , for example , &quot; to put a color like it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Sifmonetary configurated like verted , and I can use them to go to the color in that central , where they misclosure .
and I can use it to go into the central color , where they measure .
We can get too much , we can put it a little bit .
And you &apos;re also beautiful possibility of learning , like languages , the mathematics and the math and logical games where people can try things fast , and see the results results .
Now I &apos;m --
This is a Fibonacci that I do with a equations program of equations .
Here we have a words of words that is in the miabeuum and Boggle .
Basically , to every Turn every Siftargeted , basically , to every Turn one one of every Siftool in every Siftabove , and while you &apos;re looking for words to compose words , he &apos;s looking for him , I &apos;m looking for a dictionary .
And then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new set of letters and new set of letters and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
There &apos;s the kids came to the Media Lab , I did so that I came to try it and come up and I went to try and put a video .
They were very much pleasure .
And one of the interesting things about that kind of apply , is that you don &apos;t have to give people many instructions .
You just say , &quot; You know the words &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
There &apos;s other people who are provides .
This is our beta younger tester , right there on the right .
It was actually just going to imple them .
They were only morning for him .
Now , this is an apply to a interactive cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool for learning . He &apos;s Felix . He &apos;s Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , relevant the Sifmonks them .
It can put new characters in the scene , relevant the Sifmonks them .
So it &apos;s doing it &apos;s getting out .
Video : The sun is surprising .
David Merrill : Now it took a treatment in the scene .
Video : The arange treatment .
Bucel work ! Yeah !
So , shake the Siftool and put in them close , can be interacting the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing your story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a story with open end , and it can decide him as it flies .
DM : It &apos;s a story with open end , and it can decide him as it flies .
Video : The cat it , cat .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , which is to show you is a fairly , to sample and performing music .
It &apos;s a tool that we did , to sample and perform music .
The Sifestyield here are sounds like the bottom and the battery .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose which you can use .
You can also get these sounds in a sequence that you can compose to your pleasure .
And it just by making a sound and touch a sound and a sequence .
These are actually you can see vive , like the reverberation and the filter .
The acks to a particular sound and then cline for a bunch of it .
And then there are general effects as time and volume , which is that they apply to the whole sequence .
Let &apos;s look at how it works .
Video : We &apos;ll start putting a base in two Siftness in two Siftness &quot; sequence , &quot; we put them in a series , we add more basic .
I &apos;ll put a line of low .
Video : I added percussions --
Video : And I &apos;m going to put the filter to the battery , so I can control the live effect from live .
Video : I can reveal the entire sequence that &apos;s going to be a long time from one side or the other .
Video : And now I &apos;ll add the bottom line to the bottom line the bottom of the lowest to give .
Video : I can re-fit to the sequence &quot; at the flying flight .
So I don &apos;t have to plan this first , but I can suddenly improvise , making it longer longer or more box .
And now , finally , I can smoking the entire sequence of the left Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new human interfaces and more resembling like our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some possibility that we &apos;re trying to bring out of the lab .
And that I want to transmit is that &apos;s coming up this new generation of design objects to interact with digital media , which will lead information in our world that we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the right now of talking to all of you .
I &apos;m a writer .
I &apos;m going to be writing books , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the fascinating of my life .
And I don &apos;t look like it can change .
But , I said , something particularly happened in my life and my career , which led me to report the entire relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called &quot; Mangia , Prega , Ama , &quot; which , &quot; which is diversely , for some reason to go out to the world and became a big , senational , westseller .
And the result is that everywhere you go now , people treat me as if I was convicted .
It &apos;s convicted , convicted !
They are all come from me and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t fear you couldn &apos;t fear than ?
You don &apos;t fear to keep writing all of life without more than able to create a book that can matter to someone &apos;s a book that can matter to someone ? &quot;
that can matter to someone ? &quot;
It &apos;s resurrassuring , you know .
But it could go worse , except for that I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a teenager -- I wanted to be a writer .
I would go to the same reaction that was based on the fear .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you feel the temple I couldn &apos;t succeeded ?
You don &apos;t fear that the humiliation of kills you ?
You don &apos;t fear to do this mestim for all of life without ever it ever to be outside and to die on a cumb of dreams with the mouth of dust cumb cles ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I fear of all those things .
I always had fear .
And I also fear of many other things that people can &apos;t even inherently .
Like the algae and other things very friendly .
But , for how I was writing what I thought and I was asking and I was the ultimately is it ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logical that anybody &apos;s supposed to expect to be friendly from a work that you feel born to do .
But what is there about so particular in the creative companies to make us nervous about mental health as elessly as a way that other career ?
And as my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don &apos;t remember one once in his 40 years of activity in which he was asked if he was an engineer ?
John &apos;s never -- that &apos;s that block of the engineer John , how does it go ?
It wasn &apos;t working that , you know ?
Every , chemical engineers as a group don &apos;t have certainly , in the centuries , in the centuries of being alcohhhhhhhhhhit .
We writers , we have enough this reputation , and not just creative writers , but creative you know , we have this reputation of being enormous instable .
And it &apos;s not about it , looking at the sad of creative magnifies that , only in the 20th century , and often by their young people .
And the ones that don &apos;t seem to be really suicked by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , &quot; Every book has a little more &quot; A very , &quot; A very little bit more &quot; A extraordinary affermation about their life work .
But we don &apos;t throw it when we feel that because we &apos;ve heard these things so long that we &apos;ve completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and the suffering are in some ways that creativity , at the end , at the end , it &apos;s always constressed to the anges .
And the question I want to ask everybody to ask about this idea ?
It &apos;s going to give you this thing -- because it &apos;s also looking at it for a distance to me not that &apos;s good for anything that .
I think it &apos;s a hate .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous , and I don &apos;t want to see it perpetuated in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our big creative creative minds to live .
And certainly I know that , in my case -- in my situation -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start to the way to that I felt dark for the circumstances that I &apos;m in my career .
That &apos;s -- you know , I &apos;m quite young , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m about 40 years old .
I &apos;ve got about four work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that everything I &apos;m going to write about right now , it &apos;s going to be right from the world as the work that came out after the very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very likely to be right from the world as the work that was going to be right from the world as the work that came out of the world as the work that came out after the very , very , very , very likely to be done by the world as the way ,
I &apos;m going to be skin , because we &apos;re all more or less friends here -- it &apos;s likely that my greatest success is in my own own own own own own .
Oh , Gesu , what you &apos;re !
You know this is the kind of thinking that &apos;s going to be a person to start dragging nine in the morning , and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would keep doing this work that I love .
So , the question is , how ?
And so , I think , after many reflective reflect , that the way to work to continue writing is to create a protective psychological , OK ?
I have to find a safety distance of me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxiety on which I &apos;m going to go to look through . And as I was trying to look for it all last year , trying to find other society to see if they could have better ideas and more healthy ideas and more societies and more healthy ideas and more healthy ideas and more societies .
how to help creative people manage to manage the emotions of creativity .
And that research has taken me to ancient Great and ancient Rome .
I &apos;m going to go through and then it goes back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
And it was thinking that creativity was this spirit looks like to be divination and that came to men from some distant and unknown , for distant reasons .
The Greeks called these spirits of the devices of the demons of creativity .
Socrrates , wonderful , believed that they had a deeleper from far .
Romans were the same idea , but they called the the kind of spirit without a body .
That &apos;s great , because the Romans didn &apos;t really think that a genius was somebody who was particularly intelligent .
They believed that a genius was this kind of divine that was believing literally lived in the walls of a artist , a little bit like the vinexact act act as well as the whole thing .
Here &apos;s a remarkable -- that &apos;s the distance of which I talk about -- that that &apos;s psychological construction that you can protect from your work .
And everybody knew it was so that it worked , right ?
So the antic artists were protected from certain things , as the way too narcies , for example , too narcies , right ?
If your work was so big you couldn &apos;t take it all the mertime , everybody knew that you were helped by this genius .
If your failure work failure , it wasn &apos;t your entire fault , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a incapable .
And so people have han conceit &apos;s for a long time .
And then the Rinisissance came and it changed this great idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe on the center of all of the mysties and mysteries and without more to leave space to the mess .
This was the principle of rational , and people started to think that creativity came from completely hydivided .
And for the first time in history , it started to reference this or that artist as a rather than a person with the genius .
And I have to say , I think it was a big mistake .
I think that allows somebody , a simple person to believe that they &apos;re like a recipient as a recient as a source , and the source of all the mysteries , creative , unknown , unknown and unknown , unknown and a philet too big to give to the human pagile .
It &apos;s like to ask someone to enjoy the sun .
It &apos;s details and it completely details and create all these print prints on performance .
And I think it was this pressure to destroyed the artists in the 500 years .
And if that &apos;s true , and I think that &apos;s , the question is , and now ?
We can do it it diversity ?
Maybe you go back to a more ancient understanding of between humans and mystery creative .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t sing 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience who would be linked to scientific suspects on the notion of , so that they follow people dramatically fed on their own projects .
I &apos;m not going to convince you all about this .
But the question I would like to ask is -- why not ?
Why don &apos;t you think about this way ?
Because it has more sense of anything that I &apos;ve ever heard to explain the explanning of the imprevedability of the creative process .
And a process that , as anybody ever attempted to do something -- so , basically , everybody here knows , you don &apos;t understand rationally .
And in fact , it can seem to be completely paranormess .
I did this , I did this , I did this very quickly Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but it was a very poem for all life and said to me that during his childhood in the rural Virginia , working out in the field , and it felt it , in if when a poem came from landscape .
He said it was like a fairly air .
And that was going to roling her landscape .
He felt it , because he was doing the ground tremendous land under its feet .
He knew that I had one thing to do to do at that point and was , he said , &quot; run like a matta . &quot;
And it was running towards home and it was going to come from this poem , and it wouldn &apos;t have to get a piece of paper and a match enough , while it &apos;s a faster , while it was the trapart .
Sometimes I couldn &apos;t be fast , so it &apos;s very fast , so it &apos;s correct and correct and he couldn &apos;t get to the home and the poem that was going to continued to rating through the landscape through the landscape , looking , looking , as she said , &quot; another poet . &quot;
And then there were those times -- this is not going to fort -- there were moments in which was almost losing , right ?
So , he was running at home and she was trying to paper and paper and the poetry and put it through , and he was going on , and he said , &quot; He was going to go , and then he said , &quot; he was like to put on the other hand and the hand and the career .
And he was the poem from the tail and he would reach it into her body and transform it on the page .
And in these cases , poem would be presented to the perfect page , but at the contrary , from the last word to the first .
So when I felt that -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly equal to my creative process .
Not my creative process -- it &apos;s not a conducucucucucucture !
I &apos;m a mulo and my way to work is ; I wake up to the same orary every day and go and work and go and go and go and work and go on top of it .
But even I , in my Testardaggin my Tagin , I &apos;ve strike up against that thing sometimes .
And I guess that a lot of you in the han .
You know , even if the work and ideas came from me to a certain source , I could not honestly know .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it so that we can &apos;t lose your head , but rather , which is it &apos;s going to stay healthy ?
And as I think , the best contemporary example I have is the Tom Waits musician , which I interviewed several years ago .
We were talking about this , and Tom , for the most of the life was the incarnation of life was the incarnation of the art art art that we &apos;re all all looking at , to control , bringing these species of deployed , and I dominstruction species of being being absolute .
But then he inveck , he hot , and a day he was driving on a highway in Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
It was going fast and it all of a very quickly , this little framment of melody , coming in in his head as inspiration , and it &apos;s a very inspiration , and the desidera , and the desidera , and the desidera , but it &apos;s not knows how to take it .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a match , it has no recorder .
So it starts to hear this kind of old anxiety in him , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m obsessed by this song even .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to the panic , they stopped .
And I &apos;ll put the entire mental process and made something completely new .
He just looked at the sky and said , &quot; Sculuses , don &apos;t you see that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Do you look like to write a song right now ?
If you really want to existing , it &apos;s going to be a little bit of it , when I can take care of you .
Altherefore you go to importing somebody else today .
You go to Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his work was changed after that .
Not the work , the work was still dark as always always .
But the process , and the fish that was reported it was released when the genius , the genius that came out of him -- the genius that was going back from , to where it was doing , to go from it , to where it was doing , I didn &apos;t have to be an interorized and gmented .
But it &apos;s a black-free , wonderful bizarre , collaboration with Tom and this strange thing , and this strange and the outside that it was not Tom .
So how I felt that story started to change a little bit , the way I worked out , and I was saved a time .
This idea , I &apos;ll save me when I was writing , &quot; Mangia , Prega , Ama , &quot; and fall in one of those despair of the despair we cause all have when we all work on something and we can &apos;t start to think that &apos;s going to be a disaster , which is the worse book .
Not just bad book , just the worst book writing .
And I started thinking about how to throw this project .
But then I remember Tom , who was talking to the air and I came to us .
So I got up so raised my face and I got to a vacuum corner of a room .
And I said high voices , &quot; Sem , what we know if this book is not going to be brilliant is not going to be entirely hit , right ?
Because as I &apos;m seeing on I &apos;m putting everything I have , I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to introduce you and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do that , you know what I don &apos;t do .
I &apos;ll go to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I would like to please that was recorded that I was here to do my part . &quot; Because the end is so , OK -- centuries ago in North Africa , people were rown up with the bar of the moon , dances and brings that went forward for hours and until the alba dances .
And they were always magnifies , because the danceros were great professionals .
But every once , it was a lot of , something happened , and one of these artists became really transcender .
And I know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know that you &apos;ve all seen , at one point , a performance .
It was like the time stopped , and the dancer walks through a kind of portal and was not doing anything different from the usually , like 1,000 noticed before , but it was all going to put out .
And suddenly , it &apos;s not just like a human .
But he turned out from the divinity and below in the fire of divinity .
And when this happened , they were , people knew what he was , they called it up to her name .
They were to dogs and started dogs , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , God , God , God , God , God , God , God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
I was historic notes -- when the Mori invasing the south of Spain , preserved this habits with them and the ready to change in the centuries , Allah , Allah , Allah , &quot; Ole , &quot; the hole , &quot; which you can still hear in the cords or flow in the cords or flashflame .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , and I , Allah , and Allah , magnification , &quot; Hunan understanding of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But the problem comes next day , for the dancer itself , when you wake and you see it and find that are the 11 in the morning of Martedday and the flows are in the morning , God doesn &apos;t have more .
It &apos;s just a big deadly deadly to the knees , and maybe it &apos;s not going to each other to that altitude .
And maybe nobody is going to sing the name of God still while and what &apos;s going to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s difficult .
This is one of the most painful reconciliations to make in a creative life .
But maybe it &apos;s not to be so angosciant if you can &apos;t believe , you know , the most extraordinary aspects of your being being being from yourself .
But I just believe that you &apos;re in soon data from a unimaginable source of this team of your life that team in your life that you have to go to someone else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think that it &apos;s all about it .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s certainly like I thought about it for several months during the work that I &apos;m going to soon soon soon the work that I &apos;ll soon soon soon , the dangerous dangerous , and I did do this .
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel electrized from this is , not to be fear .
Not shorts . It &apos;s just just just your job .
It &apos;s going to introduce you to your hand for any time .
If your work is dancing , you know , if your work is dancing .
If the divine , absurd genius , they made a little bit of wonderful , for a moment through your effort , for a moment through your effort , then &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Otherwise , you do the same dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to yourself .
I think and I think we have to teach it .
&quot; Ole ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to yourself , even for having a testure and testure cals to give you a tour , &quot; tals to give you a tuns continuously .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As I &apos;ve been talking about some of these human genome projects on the human genomius , what can mean and discovery of new genes .
We &apos;re starting a new way , we started digitizing biology and now we started digital biology and now we &apos;re going to go from that digital code , we &apos;re coming in a new phase of biology , designing and synthesizing life .
We &apos;ve always been trying to ask big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists , I think they &apos;ve been trying to understand to various levels .
We &apos;ve tried different approaches , reducing it to the minimum terms .
We &apos;re digitizing by almost 20 years ever .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the analog world &apos;s biology to the digital world .
Now we can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome , which is the species from the smallest genome , and they can in the laboratory .
And we tried to reduce that genome for a little more small .
We can be able to eliminating a hundred genes of the about 500 that are here .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our .
I think I &apos;m going to be simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can get out , one at the time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this can bring to a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to design was synthesizing this chromosome so that the only way to change the components to take some components to take some of these basic questions .
And so we started the adventure of the &quot; we can synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Can you make these big molecules that we can &apos;t have ever done to create before ?
And in case , we can get a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemical material .
The speed with which we can digitize life is growing at exponential .
Our ability to write genetic code , instead , progress , but it &apos;s better .
And our most recent results the results on a very clearly curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
And the process required a lot of steps , starting with a bioethical review before the first experiments .
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that producing little DNA , the long length of 30 to 50 letters to 50 letters , and it &apos;s a degenerative process : more mistakes there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these fragments and correct the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , to start by the digital information of the Phi 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , we &apos;ve designed the correction of the mistakes and got a DNA molecule about 5,000 letters .
And the interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material that &apos;s inhert and we put it in the bacteria , they started reading this genetic code and to make viral particles .
The viral particles have then been released by cells , they come back and they have the Ecles .
I talked about recently with the members of the oil industry , and say they they &apos;re certainly understands this model .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build his own hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the largest things .
We wanted to build the entire chromosome of bacteria .
They &apos;re more than 580 mies of genetic code .
So we thought we &apos;re going to build it in the cassette of viruses , so that they can change cassettes to understand what the components are the living components of a living .
Saction is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the first time , it was a mistake for every 10 midst .
We &apos;ve discovered , we &apos;ve been made it , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence we never have been able to do it work .
One part of the process is to design segments for long 50 letters that overwhelming all the other segments of 50 letters to build smaller underounits little little smaller that work together .
We &apos;re trying to take unic elements here .
You &apos;ve probably read that we put the pyard .
Think it this is : we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters together that they code about 20 amminds , and there &apos;s a specific order of letters , and there &apos;s a specific order of letters .
So we can use genetic code to write , sentences , sentences .
What we did at the beginning was self-reating .
Some people have been delused to be delused to be .
We designed these segments to be able to just join with enzyme .
There are some that they repair them and put them together .
And we started to assemble parts , starting with the parts of five to seven mix to seven mix them , and they form them to form segments to form the 24 mila letters to them , and then they get to 72 to the letters .
At every step , we made these segments in abundance so we can sequence it because we &apos;re trying to make a very very very good process -- as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatize this process .
So , this looks like the tabellon of a basket .
When we get these very long segments , more than 100 basis , more than 100 basis , it won &apos;t grow higher in the Ecles .
You get to the limit of the modern molecular biology .
So we looked at other other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called the homological receives , which in biology to use the DNA to repair the DNA that can join the DNA to unite .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism called Deinococcus , called the &quot; Plitechen , it can absorb three million radiation .
You can see in high school as his chromosome is destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s exactly like it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be dry completely .
They can live under empty .
They &apos;re absolutely sure that life exist in space , and it &apos;s subject to find new environments of water .
And it &apos;s about NASA has shown that this is .
This is a molecule picture that we built using these processes , just using the yeast with design appropriate design of the segments that are made .
The hell them automatically .
This picture was not taken with an electronic microscope , but with a regular microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It &apos;s a so big molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that they cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the publishing that we did a little time ago .
They &apos;re more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the largest molecule of a definitely created by man .
It has a high-speed molecular weight .
If we &apos;re going to go with a 10 without spaces , it would take 142 pages to move this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ? How can we do that ?
Of course , you do a virus , it &apos;s a game .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria .
It &apos;s easier even when it &apos;s about eucarily cells as our : you can just get the nuclear or and put another , which is practice the process of clonation .
In the archaea bacterium , instead , but we &apos;ve been recently demonstrated that we &apos;re able to do a complete trapart that we are able to do a complete trapart of a chromosome from a cell trapart .
We can clean a chromosome parent from a microbial species .
The two are different than the men from mice .
We added some gene in a way that we can decide which to choose to choose what to do for this chromosome .
And then it &apos;s skiing with the enzyme so that they kill all the protein .
And when we put it in the cell was astonishing -- and you &apos;re going to open our sofisticato--- the new chromosome is gone into the cell .
And we thought we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to get us beyond .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that a lot of these species have added a second or a third chromosome somewhere , I added in a second thousands of new traits to that species .
So , who thinks about evolution as a gene once you change not much of biology .
There are enzyme called the restriction enzyme that they won digital DNA .
The chromosome was in the cell , you didn &apos;t do one .
The cell phone -- the chromosome that we put it on the one .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other chromosome as a material , and it &apos;s stopped it , and we found with only the cell and the new chromosome .
It became blue because of the genes that we put .
And in a short short amount of time , all the characteristics of a species , and it turned into a new species , based on the new software that we put into a new species , based on the new software that we put it into the cell .
All the protein has changed , members have changed , and when we read the genetic code exactly what we &apos;ve moved to do is .
Now , this may seem to look like genetic alchemical , but by allowing the DNA can change things in a very very very substantial .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that it &apos;s not about genesis -- but progress of three and a half million years of evolution , and a half of evolution , and I said maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion in which they will be created new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s enough to be obvious when we think about our needs .
We &apos;re going to go from six and a half billion people in 9 billion in the next 40 years .
I was born for example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each other in 1946 ; 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medicine and fuel , health for six billion and a half billion people .
It &apos;s going to be more hard to nine billion .
We use more than five billion fuel bars .
That means 100 million bars a day .
When we look at biological processes , or any kind of process to replace them , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
We have to keep in the whole CO2 emission from these materials that end up in the atmosphere .
At the day of the time , because of scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the design of the future .
The electronic industry , only only only has a dozen about components , and you think about how many different things came out .
Our limits here are data here is principle , and from our imagination .
We now have techniques , thanks to these synthesization methods , able to create what we call a combinatory .
We can build a big robot that can make a big robots that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think of these 20 million different genes or try to optimize the processing to produce the processes to produce pharmaceums , new vaccine , we can change , thanks to a little team , and more molecular biology now than the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemical production or fuel production , or fuel production .
This is an instant of some software programmed that we &apos;re working on to be able to sit and design species at computers .
Well , we don &apos;t know necessarily , we don &apos;t know how they &apos;ll be .
We know exactly how they &apos;re their genetic code .
We &apos;re now focusing on the fourth generation of the fourth generation .
You also saw you that extract ethanol from the grain was an experiment .
We have depending on the third generation of that will be used enough to be on the sugar fuel , more than the fuel or different kinds of butanx .
But the only way biology can have a big impact without increasing the cost of food and limestone of food and limestone the cost of CO2 in matter , so we &apos;re working to design cells that can achieve this purpose , and we think we can achieve the first coalt of food and we think we can first first first quarter-generation in about 18 months .
Solar War Acombined to CO2 is a metodowntown -- but in our discoveries in the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
It &apos;s going to the deep ocean , about 2,500 feet of the ebollion the water &apos;s temperature .
It creates methane from CO2 using molecular hydrogen using a molecular energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can incanaling CO2 , which can easily be carried through , convert that CO2 in coal , to drive this process .
So , short we might think that we might be able to increase what the question of life is what life is &quot; is we &quot; is &quot; is we , versus the modest goal to replace the whole oil industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can you do it from TED ?
It would come a main energy source .
Also , we &apos;re working on the same methods to create instantly vaccine .
You &apos;ve seen this year with flu , we are always back of a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s about find the right vaccine .
I think that you can change building combinatabables in anticius .
That &apos;s how the future might start to look at , now , the tree of evolution , accelling evolution with synthetic bacteria , arches , arches , and finally cells .
We are so much of the way to improve people .
Our purpose is to make it . Thank you very much .
I &apos;m going to show you , the faster , I &apos;m going to show you , some basic work , in the new technology that we brought to the Microsoft in the following one one year . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s an environment where you can interact is local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data .
We are seeing a lot of digital pictures , with a kind of digital pictures of a constantly , with a kind of a very quick , and we have a very quickly , we have our images as we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much the amount of information that we see , how big these are crops of data or images .
Most of them are common photographs , but this for example , is a scanning coming from the Library of Congress , and reentrance .
It doesn &apos;t make a difference because the only thing that &apos;s limits of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen at any moment . It &apos;s also very flexible architecture .
This is a whole , example of the not data .
This is the Dickens of Dickens . Every represents a chapter .
To show you that it &apos;s just about textbook and not of images , we can do something like that , to really see that it &apos;s a real representation of the textbook , not of a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a little electronic book .
I don &apos;t recommend it .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s a number of The Guardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading the real version of a magazine or a everyday , which is for a multiple of a kind of a half .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of The Guardian .
We created an extra fashion ads -- much higher than what you use in a normal publish -- and we put in the normal content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see them here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really is about some of these ideas to eliminating the space limits of space on the screen .
We hope that this means you can get people to get people and similar to the people and the similar , not to be necessary .
Of course , maps is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say that we have a contribution to give you in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States overhead of a NASA &apos;s geospatial image of NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually alive on the web ; you can go to see it .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which is a project called Photosynth , which is a project .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual computer that &apos;s very interesting research that we &apos;ve been doing by Noah Snavely , a student of the University of Washington , with the help of Steve Seitz , Microsoft Rick Szeliski Rick Szeliski &apos;s great collaboration .
And it &apos;s alive on the web , I management from Seadragon the web .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from one image to another and have this kind of experience to multiple resolution .
But the spacectial of images here is actually meaning .
The algorithms of the computer algorithms have these images together , so that they corresponding to the real places that the real lakes -- all close to the Grases Montagne Roccies -- they &apos;ve been taken . Here you see the elements of a slip-show . So you see the elements of a slip-show or imaging , and these things are all connected to the space level .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more space space .
I want to go directly to one of the original set of Noah-data set from a previous prototynth of the First , which we did work for the first time the summer summer -- to show you what I think is really about the key to behind this technology , Photosynthrowing technology , Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily evidence that we put in the website .
We had to worry about legal legal aspects and so forth .
This is a reconstruction of Nothree-year-old Caur &apos;s images made by Flickr Flickr . Baucuct Nothing three Din Flickr , and you get pictures of these orange samet and said . Ogns one of these orange cons , a picture that &apos;s discovery to this .
So they &apos;re all pictures made from Flickr and they were all connected to the spacecraft level in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to igate this very simple way .
You know , I would never have thought to end up working for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifying to get this kind of accounting here .
I think you can see that this is a lot of different different kinds of phones of phones that are from the cell phone professional SLR , a significant number , put together in this environment .
And if I can do it , I try to try those more stranger .
Many blocks from the faces , etc . .
Somewhere here is a series of photographs -- there .
This is a Nobody . Dame poster .
We can go from the poster to physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking from the suit -- from the entire collective memory of how the earth is from visual standpoint -- and connects to all that data together .
All those pictures become connected together , more than the sum of the parts .
You have a model of the earth .
You think about this as a prolder of Stephen Lawler &apos;s work on the virtual Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as people use it , and the people who use it , and the use of the use of the use of the use .
Their pictures are marked with meadapted by other people .
If someone comes to the idea of contrast all these smooth , my photograph of the Cathedral of Nothing three Dsuddenly visly , getting rightly enrifs of all that data , and I can use it as ingressed to immersgerms in that space , in that metaphor , using the pictures of whoever I have a social experience of the kind of mood cross-mood and having a social experience of the kind of cross-mood ,
Of course , a consequence of all that are virtual models of all interesting things that are very much interesting processed by each interesting , the ground , and they &apos;re all collective , but from the collective memory .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I realized what your software is going to take us to do is that at one point in the next few years , all the time , all the shared pictures that you can see anybody in the entire world will be practice together ?
BAA : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is basically to find .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , you &apos;re going to be , amateurs .
And it &apos;s doing it in the basis of the content of the images .
And the thing becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of seant information that many of these images .
As you do a picture of the web , you get a sentence and the text on the web page , the web has a lot of information information about the pictures .
Now , what if that &apos;s the picture is connecting to all your pictures ?
So the amount of seant interconnection and the amount of wealth that is really enormous . It &apos;s a classic effect . It &apos;s a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure of the ethnographics of ethnographic research is the way to live between who have the antic traditions that hadn &apos;t forget the antic traditions , among the rains in the wind , it hits the rain , the stone of the waving leaving , and the leaves of the plants .
Well , the way the science Jaguit &apos;s still over the Via Lattea , or that the Inuit &apos;s also known as well as as a result , or the Inuit &apos;s still the rescued , or that in Himalaya , to remember the central of the Dharm , to remember the central of anthropology , and the idea that the world we live in no absence of absolute anthroughout , but it &apos;s a reality , of reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our own own own , well or bad , many generations .
And of course , we all share of essential overall .
We all come . We all all procream .
We are subjects to start with initiation .
We have to deployment of death , so we don &apos;t surprise and we whale --
We all have an art .
What &apos;s the particular thing that hits is the particular rhythm of culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that the Penan of the Borneo &apos;s following , or the Voodoo Haiti , or the Sure Kaith-Haiti guerriers , or the Curge of the Kaith-Curandero , or a cammellier in the Sahara .
He was my journey of my journey in the desert a month ago , or a yak haller in Qomolangma , on Everest , the mother of the world .
All of these populations teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And if you reflect a moment , it &apos;s a concept that it can give you hope .
Together , the miriades of the world create a spiritual , spiritual life that has the planet , and cultural that &apos;s going to have the planet and it &apos;s important for the wealth of the planet as biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural spider as a way to a way to call a total etnosphere , the total of all the concepts , dreams , mits , ideas , inspiration , inspiration , ideas , inspiration , from the human imagination of consciousness .
Eetnosphere is the wonderful patrimony of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be as as a kind of inquisitive .
And because biosphere is very much consumption as a very quickly did happened to the ethnosties and unfortunately .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species is about the orge of the orge of the right time , because it &apos;s fairly , or -- in the highest hypothesis -- in the field of biological diversity -- and not get close to the most optional hypothesis -- that &apos;s that it &apos;s not even more optimistic -- that of cultural diversity .
The surx of all that is , of course , the language .
When you &apos;re born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not composed by a vocabulary or a series of rules , or a series of rules rules .
One language is the spraking of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the half of the way the soul of every culture comes in in in the material .
Every languages is a forest of your mind , a kissing , a thought , a very spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , while we &apos;re sitting here in Monterey , at least half no longer is subsurrounded in the ears of the children .
They &apos;re not teaching to children , which means less beat , less than less camps , which is already death .
What &apos;s more sad than the being flying from silence , of the last last talk about a language , the last last talk about a language , the way to be the wisdom of being able to transmit the wisdom of children or anticipate the promise of the children ?
This is a horrying was the one in some of the world every two weeks . every two days . Every two weeks , every two old days , every two days , every sillabs of a language .
And I know somebody who will say , &quot; Not that ?
The world wouldn &apos;t be a better place if we let all talk about the same language ? &quot; Well , we all talk about yoruba . Let &apos;s talk about it .
We talk about kogs .
You &apos;ll find a sudden what it means you can &apos;t talk about their language .
I &apos;d like to give you a journey through the etnosphere --
a little journey in the ethnosphere to give you a bit of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I say &quot; different ways of existing , &quot; I mean , really different ways of existing .
Let &apos;s take for example , this Barasana bim in Amazon Sentrional Amazon , the people of the anaconda &apos;s River &apos;s Redwood &apos;s flourishing in the pockrows of the milk &apos;s panish .
It &apos;s a people that can &apos;t be able to distinguish the color from green because the time cells is identified in the forest , which depend the people .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rule , called &quot; exogamia language , &quot; PPurge a person : You have to marry a person who talks a different language .
And that has roots in the mythological past , but the particularly the particularly the same is that in these families that are in these families , where you &apos;re talking about six or seven languages because of the marriage .
They &apos;re just listening to it and then they start talking about it .
We take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived , the Waorans of Ecuador , a incredible people who have the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionaries have tried a contact wrong .
They &apos;ve been down down the top photographs that they react them in the way they were retract that this people who were amichevolved , forest that this people had never seen anything bi-dimensional .
They &apos;ve been taken from the earth , they turned to be a form or a shape , or a figure and not out , they have the diavian that was treatment that the hell , and they killed five missionaries with the lance .
But the Waorans didn &apos;t just kill the foreign &apos;t just the foreign .
They killed between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We were saving eight generations of natural death , and we found two natural death , and when we &apos;ve been doing it , they admit that one of them was invecked , and then they killed it the same .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal that &apos;s 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the early 1980s , I was a very interesting job when my professor of my Harvard , and I wanted to go to Haiti in my my Harvard , and Tonton Mridgs to the basis of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes , and Tonton Macoutes , and impossessor .
To make sense of a miraculous , I should have understand Voodoo culture , and that Voodoo is not magic .
It &apos;s a very complex metaphorrible view of the world .
Very interesting .
If I asked you to ask the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christianity , Islam , Buddhism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no faith religious . And instead of religious , and the Voodoo is not other than the distilled to these religious concepts .
What makes interesting is the voodoo is the intense relationship between life and death .
So , the living in the spirits .
Tei can be invocated by the Great Act , they respond to the dance of the dance and replace temporary replace to the vier soul , so that for a short active active active active active , becomes the following become the god .
So , the voodooomic saying , &quot; You &apos;re going to talk about God .
We give us to the temple and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re sitting , is the spirit that you are the spirit that drives you , how can you get hit ?
So you see these incredible events : following voodoo state of trance trance that touch , sweet infuel , a pretty strong demonstration of the body &apos;s mind about the body when it &apos;s catching in a very very strong state of the body &apos;s when it &apos;s catching in a state of extremely excited .
And in all the people that I have the most extraordinary lived are the Kogi of Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta Cs , in the Santa Marta Colombia .
They have to the ancient civilization that once they lived on the careers of the Colombia in the waiting of the commons , the people would be retreated on the volcanic massassassment that you would be on the volcanic massics .
In a maceeeeeaten of blood , this people has never been conquered by the spagnoled .
But they &apos;re government government government , they &apos;re government , but they &apos;re their formation is very remarkable .
The young people are taken away from families to three or four , and they live secreted in a dark world made , and shadow in a dark , and shadow of stone foods at the bottom of the 18 glacier .
Two periods of nine years of the proposal to reproduce the nine months of gestation that they go to the user mother , now are metaphor in the mother uter laws .
For that time , they &apos;re acculated to the values of their society , values that they predict that their prayers and only their prayers their prayers and keep the balance -- or to say the foreign balance .
And then the term of this incredible initiation , they suddenly brought out and for the first time to be in their lives , at 18 years , they see an alaltitude . And in that moment of awareness , when the sun kissing the beautiful valuable valuable , everything that has learned in the theory is going to be conference in this this . The pret pret is a step .
&quot; Visto me as I said .
It &apos;s wonderful . Now it &apos;s now to you . &quot;
They call them a big brothers and say that we , are the cold of the destruction of the destruction of the world &apos;s destruction .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the indigenous populations and invoke Roussau and the old history of the selectious selectist , which is a race concept , or maybe we invoke Thoreau and say that these people are closer to the Earth .
Indies are not nor feelings are not feelings from nor deeper .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the malarial paluds of the Tibet , or in the Tibet , but because of the time and rituals , they created a mystical of the Earth based on the concept of being aware of close to it , but more , a very , very , very , very , very concept that the Earth can live because it &apos;s infected by human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
That &apos;s a little bit of Ande that Ande who &apos;s grown to create that the mountain is a massing , it will be a different human deeply , and it &apos;s going to be a very different relationship with the mountain or that place with Montana that groan who grown to create a Montana who grown to be shot .
That &apos;s dimoning of a spirit or a mineral caught is irrelevant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that define the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia , they believed that forests were west to be cut .
And that I have a different human being different from my friends Kwakiutl , who believe that forests are the Hukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukuk-initiation , which is that we can debris that we have to the Hukukukukukukukukukukukukuk------up .
If you start to look at these cultures can actually create different reality , you can start understand some of them sensors . Let &apos;s make this plant .
I took this picture to open up in the nordest Amazon the nordest Amazon Amazon .
Maybe some of you &apos;ve heard about the ayahuasks , the most powerful psychoactive , the most powerful psychoactive psychoactive repertory .
What makes the fascinating ayahuasks is not the drug of the substance , but the processing . It &apos;s called the two elements .
On one side , this lian leaving legning that contains a series of beta-coal series , harmoline , harmoline , slightly hallucinogen , slightly hallucinogen , that lighttime .
And by by taking the only plant you have a smoke that alter a little bit of consciousness , but it mixed with the leaving of a caffee &apos;s family &apos;s family &apos;s called Psychtry is .
This plant contains powerful triptamin , very similar to the serotonin , dimethyptamin .
If you ever see Yanomami pull on the birthday , the substanti-called a different set of species , they &apos;re methylyptamin .
Tirate that dust on the nose is a little bit like being shot from a bull cartooning bank and floating on a sea sea of electricity . &#91; Risate &#93; Not to create the reality .
I often have to my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who had taken the psychedelic age of the Amon , with her discovery of the hallucinogens in Mexico .
And I think , in my thesis can &apos;t be class these triptamin as hallucinogens , because if you &apos;re done you can &apos;t tell any hallucinated .
It &apos;s possible to the orequals , if they above with other chemicals that they denian MAO .
Now it &apos;s the beautiful : the beta-fuel that are in this lian inhibitors of MAO , the same kind of need to potential to potential the triptamined . The question is a flora of a fairly flashhhhhs , not similar , but if you combine in this way , create a biochemical version that is going to be on to be there .
We use the great eugly of the evidence of the evidence , which can reveal to be infruttifer .
But if we ask Indians , they say , &quot; The plants talk about us . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Copan , has 17 variety of ayhuasks , which distinguished neply in the forest , and that at our eyes would come into the same species .
If we ask them how they stbipush their toxes will say , &quot; I thought of the plants , the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of it ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take 17 variety in a night night of moon , and each night with each other .
With that you don &apos;t have graduate at Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than count the stami .
Now , &#91; applausers &#93; the problem is that even those of us that are at heart , the Indies , they find painting people in the sea sea sea sea sea sea sea sea sea sea sea sea sea , and it &apos;s going to go beyond .
In fact , the 20th century , in 300 years , it &apos;s not going to remind for his wars or its technological innovations , but rather like the one was where we stopped and embracked the mass destruction of mass mass diversity and cultural , the planet . Now the problem is not change .
All the culcultures through the centuries are involved in a dance for new possibility .
And the problem is not technology .
Indians Sioux have no smell of being Sioux when they put on the arm and freceived as American American when they put on the horse and warm .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that threatening the integrity of ethnosties . It &apos;s the power .
The hard hard to domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you &apos;ll find that these are not destined to disappear .
They &apos;re living creatures and spinted , from existence from existence from existence from forforeign foreign .
It &apos;s a disbing disbing in the Penan --
a nomasian nomad . Southeast Asian , a people who lived in the forest to a generation of free to the forest to a generation of it , and now reduced to the servitu and the prostitution of the ridge of the ridge that sounds like to get up with the lim of the wliar , where the nurturtle of the Merian Meridional Merian Merious Merian Merious Merian Merious Merionte Merian EEElan Elan Elan East , where the wagagagagagagagagagagagagagagagagagagagagagagagagagagagagag
It &apos;s ready to fill the wooden of the slower .
Or the Yanomami , are the diseases that have come with the discovery of the gold .
If we &apos;re going to move on the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the hard durchy of political domination .
As you know genocide , the extinction of a people , is convicted in the universal level , but the ethnocid , the destruction of the style of a people , not only is constyle , but even even celebrated in certain ways , because it &apos;s going to be part of development .
And you can &apos;t understand the Tibet suffering of Tibet until you go from the beginning .
I &apos;ve been path the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in the Western China through Western Tibet , coming to Lhasa with a young lina , but only came to Lhasa young college , but only came to Lhasa , I realized what &apos;s behind the statistics we feel about .
6,000 sacries sacrice reduced in dust and centered .
1.2 million people killed by the military during the Cultural Revolution .
And the father of this guy was assume to Panchen Lama .
That means that it was killed at the time of the Chinese invasion .
His uncle , Sua uncle , in the diaspora that led led to the people in Nepal .
His mother was imprisoned and her blamed to be rich .
It was brought to hidden to carch at the age of two hidden under his gonna because he couldn &apos;t have any of him .
The sister , who did the same , it was put in the reducation field .
A day , he reverted a Mao and , and it &apos;s about this transgression , and , for this transgression , was put to the forced to seven years .
The Tibet can be insopportable , but the insopposable , but the insophistories of the people is from tener tener .
At the end , it &apos;s all reduces to a choice .
We want to live in the world monocratic monocrates or we want to get the policeman world of diversity ?
The great anthropologa Margaret Mead , before he died was that , in our greatest fear was that , in our going to look at the entire world , we &apos;re not just going to see the whole gamma of human imagination , we can &apos;t just see the whole gamm of thinking , but one day we &apos;ll wake up a sleep in the perspective of thinking that we &apos;re going to have other possibility .
And it &apos;s equipment to remember that our species is existed for 600,000 years .
The Neolitica , who gave us agriculture , who gave us agriculture , who has made us restle for seed , replace to replace the poetry of the skier with the prosthetic of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has at 300 years .
That shared history doesn &apos;t suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we will deal with in the millenninise .
When these remirihs of the world is asked what to say to be human , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all return the chance of being what we are : a conscious species , that has to make all the people and the gardens can bear . And there are great moments of optimism .
I took this picture on the north of the Baffin , when I went to the wells of Baffin Inuit , and the Olaya , and the Olaya , and the Olaya , and the Olaya , and the Olaya , and the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The canadese government has not always been gentile with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to staff our suprematia , we have them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refused to go .
Heeeeem , theme for her life , and he took them all the weapons .
You have to know that the Inuit don &apos;t feel cold , they exploit .
The paintings of the origin were made of fish fish in origin .
The grandfather of this man didn &apos;t put out the arctic or the byle that was suffering .
It &apos;s unfted away , and they &apos;ve been socked the pantalones in foca and defected in their hand . When I did the frozen them , they work crew a fire .
He &apos;s spraying salive on the top of this caca cacy , and when I became solid , he killed a dog .
He shake the dog and created a bright , with the toracy , and he ended a slitta , he daughter another dog and it &apos;s disappeared on the bang , and it &apos;s disappeared .
We want to talk about horse with nothing ? &#91; Risate &#93; And that , in different ways , &#91; Applaux &#93; &#93; is the symbol of the Inuit &apos;s the symbol of the Inuit and of all the Indies of the world .
In the open-9 , the Canadian government reduced to Inuit , the total control of a larger area of California and Texas med together .
It &apos;s their new pathria . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s an independent land . They all of the minerary resources .
A beautiful example of how a natione-state can re-up with his people .
And , to finish , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious at least as much of the people in these remote areas of the planet , to realize they &apos;re not remote .
For someone is home .
They represent sections of human imagination that they go to the dawn of the time . And for us all , the dreams of these kids , as dreams of these kids , become part of the geography of hope .
And finally , we are National Geographic we are convinced that political politicians will never get to nothing .
We believe that polements --
&#91; Applusi &#93; are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and perhaps we &apos;re the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month , every month , we reve 35 million visits .
156 countries transmit .
Our reviews are lets from millions of people .
Our work is traveling into the ethnosties to bring our public to the public places in the places of cultural way away from which they have the abbracing out , they will be abbracing for the centered reveal of the centering of anthroughout the way the centers of anthropology : the world of existence in a life of a life in a pluralist and multicultural world to a life in a pluralooooooooooooooooopia to and reveal world to find and a life in a life in
where the wisdom of all the people can contribute to our collective wisdom .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; I hope I &apos;ll talk about it , and try to evidence some connection , in case you don &apos;t note .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the &quot; dogma official dogma .
The dogma official thing about what ?
The dogma official of all the Western industrial society . The dogma official dogma : &quot; If we want to maximize the well-being of our citizens . &quot;
And the reason is , on the one side , in fact that liberty is itself itself a value , is precious , useful , essential for human beings .
On the other hand , if we are free , each of us can be able to do everything that massively to do what the massives , without nobody who decide in our well-name .
The way to massizing freedom is massizing choice .
The more choices are more check , and more is their well-being .
This is , I think , it &apos;s so deeply roadicted in society that nobody would have dream to put it in a doubt .
And it &apos;s also deeply roadicted in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;ll allow me a simple note about the star conditions .
In my supermarket is 175 conditions , without counting the 10 variety of olive olive olive olive olive olive and 12 acets that you can buy a huge number of conditions in the circles that no 175 .
That &apos;s what the supermarket is .
And then you go to the electronic store to buy a stereo . CD , radio lettor CD , radio , plasis , lifer .
And in this single electronic store , there &apos;s a great number of audio components .
We can make six and a half million different combinations using the components that there are in a only store .
You have to admit that there &apos;s a lot of choice .
Some people : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all telephones , at the ball services that were at the melt that were Bell .
They were nolegyed the phone , you didn &apos;t buy it .
A consequence of that , in the other , was that the phone never made .
These days , they went .
We now have a almost limited variety of phones , especially phones , especially in cell phones .
Here &apos;s cell phones .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , MP3 , cut them of the birthday , and forth to the bite for crust crust .
If you haven &apos;t seen it still saw in the store under the house , you &apos;re very well certain that will get .
And what &apos;s the end of the end of people in the stores and they &apos;re doing this question , &quot; What &apos;s the answer ? The answer is &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
So , in other ways of life that are much more important than the acquissues , it &apos;s the same explosion of choices .
Assistence : It doesn &apos;t happen more in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor &apos;s doctor and doctor what you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do A , or B , &quot; You can do it , and these benefits these benefits . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Doctor , what should I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; You have these benefits , and B has these benefits , and B has these benefits . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; Dr. if you were , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; I &apos;m not her . &quot;
We call it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
But it &apos;s not that it &apos;s that a weight and responsibility of making decisions from someone knows something , which is the doctor , to someone else else else knows something , and almost certainly , malated -- and almost certainly it &apos;s sick -- and therefore it doesn &apos;t have any ideal condition -- and so it doesn &apos;t have an patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing of pharmaceutical products , directed to people like me and you , if you think about it doesn &apos;t make any sense , because we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why are there ?
The answer is that they want to ask the doctor to ask them to make it change the receiver .
Something that &apos;s how we &apos;re our horse identity is a choice of how we see in this vigngnessed . We don &apos;t want to forced kids . Soreign their sex at at the right moment . &quot; We don &apos;t get it more an identity : we need to invent it .
And we can reinventing how many times we go .
That means that every morning , at the restricks , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I &apos;m going to family and a marriage , a time time the perspective , almost for anyone , was that it married the most soon possible , and you start to get kids .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not even what to do after .
I did , it all is really to play .
I teach very smart students very smart , and I &apos;m 20 percent in less of work than a time .
And it &apos;s not because they &apos;re not very brilliant , not because they &apos;re less diligent .
But why are it impossessing , &quot; I should be going to marry or not ? I should do that now ? &quot;
&quot; Should I get married later ? I have to think before children or career ? &quot;
They &apos;re logoretical interrogation .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this implica don &apos;t complete the tasks that I teach and not a beautiful voice to my own own .
And they have to really do that . They &apos;re important questions .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , as Carl underground , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from every day ,
In parentesesesesesesesesesesesesession , and I won &apos;t say what the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t say that , because I want to use me .
What does this mean , this incredible freedom of choice that we have to work ? It &apos;s that we have to continuously decide , continuously at any moment , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing soccer , with cell phone in a pocket , Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , typically , typically , on the knee .
And if they &apos;re all spending , every minute that we see our son rovating the game , we &apos;re asking , &quot; Do you answer this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? I have to email this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is &quot; no , &quot; that makes your son experience of your son &apos;s game very different than what it would be in other conditions .
So , any of them we look at , small things , small and big objects and big , materials and life is a choice of choices .
And once the world was this : that there were some possibilities , but it wasn &apos;t all about choice .
The world of today looks like this : The world of today is , &quot; Is it a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is . It &apos;s a lot of it .
So the positive layers we all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative .
And this is all about two negative effects on people .
The first one , paradoxically , it &apos;s that it &apos;s paralysis that that &apos;s paralysis that it &apos;s made paralysis that it &apos;s made paralysis that it &apos;s paralysis that it &apos;s produced paralysis that it &apos;s produced paralysis that makes paralysysis that makes paraly
With many options between which choosing , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I give you a significant example : a study of volunteer ,
A colleague , and the giant company , the giant society &apos;s gigantic society society , with about a million pension , with about a million customers .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of adhhhhhhhhhhhhhot from two percent .
With 50 offerts , there &apos;s 10 percent in less than adhesive to when they &apos;re available to only five . Why ?
Because with 50 funds of which choose , is maledemic deciding , and choice is the choice being removed to the domans .
And tomorrow , and tomorrow , tomorrow , tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course tomorrow .
You know it doesn &apos;t just mean that these old workers are going to be a good food for the dog because they won &apos;t have enough money , it &apos;s also saying that the decision is so that they lose the funds of the databetary dator &apos;s work .
Not participating , they &apos;re losing to five dollars per year from work dator , which is going to be well disposed to versarli .
So the paralysis a consequence of having trophy .
And I think that makes the world .
&quot; And to end , for the ethernity : ketchup , ketchup , for maionese ? &quot;
You would like to make the right decision , if it &apos;s for ethernity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to pick the wrong wrong , and yet the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can avoid the paralysis and make choice , at the end , we &apos;re less satis-down , we &apos;re less smooth .
And that &apos;s about it .
One of these is that with many conditions between which you choose , if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would be better . And what &apos;s going on is that the alternative imagined us to branches of choice , and the remote reaches to the decision , and the remote decredimining the decision ,
even when it was a very good decision .
More choices are more important than there , it &apos;s easier than any detail is unsatisfaction of option .
Also , there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert : It &apos;s very well , as we value to the things that we &apos;re depends on what we count them .
On the rest of the options , and there &apos;s a lot of possible options , it &apos;s easy to represent the possible alternative , shot , and be less sationally , is choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m sorry with everybody who &apos;s not in New York .
But that &apos;s what you &apos;re probably going to think .
There &apos;s this couple of the Hamptons .
A luxury .
It &apos;s all about them . Otttaps . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not miss . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , maledition , it &apos;s Agust . &quot;
&quot; All my neighbors in Manhattan are away . &quot;
&quot; I could talk right right in front of the home . &quot;
And it &apos;s going to go on , it &apos;s losing -- every day -- the chance of parking of parking where it wants .
costo-opportunity , constaints the sodeding for what we have , even when the choice was excellent .
And more the options that we have to consider , the more the attractive acts us will be remarkable to be constantly making it against as a cos-opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a little bit of us , it tells us a lot of things .
It &apos;s about the moment , and maybe of living the moment , and maybe of living .
But the most important point is that everything you choose , you choose to not do the other .
The things that we don &apos;t choose many attractive attractive that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : the growing spiral of expectations .
I tried to my skin buying a new jeans .
I &apos;m almost always always jeans .
Once the jeans were just like , buys and they were willing them , and they were wrestle , just after they brought them a life and washed a lot of times , they started to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple of old when the old people were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cutting . &quot;
The committer said , &quot; You want to slim fit , you relaxed fit ? &quot;
You want to be a certain nicense or with the buttons ? &quot; Stonewashhed , &quot; or &quot; acidst &quot; ? &quot;
&quot; You want them stripped ? &quot;
&quot; Sotto it wants to stripped , or stripped the bla ... &quot; Continuad helencare .
I was unfortunately , and after a little bit I did say , &quot; I want the kind of -- which was the only guy , &quot; that was the only guy , &quot; he was a jeans , then I came out of all sick . &quot; jeans , and then I came out of the jeans that I had ever ever ever ever .
It was the maximum . I had the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was that I was that with all of my choice , my waiting for me , the jeans had to be perfect .
At the beginning , I had expectations . I didn &apos;t expect anything that was when there was a kind of a kind of , but when I saw 100 different , at least a kind of be perfect .
What I did I bought was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
After I was compared to the chose with what I was trying to do was unreleved to the expectations .
The adds of options in the lives of people don &apos;t do that to increase the expectations that they have respect to the excellence of the options themselves .
And that &apos;s going to make less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
No one in the world &apos;s marketing if they can see it .
Because if they knew it , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more about that .
&quot; It was better when it was worse , &quot; The reason he was better when it was worse was that when the worse was worse , when it was worse was still possible to encount of pleasant .
So , in the world that we live in -- opulent , industrialized citizens with the expectancy -- the maximum that we can hope is that things are altitude to the altitude of expectancy .
You never surprising to be pleased because your expectations , my expectations , they &apos;ve been ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Baxative &quot; Yes , you want it . &quot;
I mean , little authographical moment -- that I really married and my wife is really beautiful .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t content .
But it &apos;s not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of the buying a couple of jeans in when there is just that you have that kind of jans is that when you &apos;re not satisfied , and you ask , &quot; Why ? &quot;
Who &apos;s responsible ? &quot; The answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What could I do you do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a insosatisfaction , and you ask who is responsible , it &apos;s just clear that responsible , it &apos;s just clear that responsible , it &apos;s just clear that responsible for you .
You could have done better .
With hundreds of variety available , there are no excuse for the insuccess .
So when people make decisions , even if the result is valido , they feel insatisfigured and give the hit to them .
For the last few years , depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this honest waving is just that people have deludent experience because standard are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation they think the blame is their own .
So the final outcome is that we &apos;re better , but we feel worse .
Let me give you a member of it .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely false . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit of choice , but that it &apos;s not a lot of it , but from this doesn &apos;t go a lot of choice .
There &apos;s a magic value , magic value . I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve been overcome from a piece of level where the choices improve our lives .
Now , from political standpoint -- I almost finished -- from political point of political view , the borcaught point , the nocy is the following .
What it allows all this to do in industrial society is the wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know pareasks , where the problem is not they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too much at it .
So the facceness that I &apos;m talking about is a bad exclusive of modern , the Western society .
And what it &apos;s depressing and angry is this : Steve Levitt Levitt spoke yesterday , what those expensive and uncomfortable seat are useful . It &apos;s a money spspread .
I mean these choices , complicated and dependious , it &apos;s not that they &apos;re just useful .
They &apos;re even deleterie .
They &apos;re doing worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows to be reverted in those where people are too too too much possibility , it &apos;s not just their life to improve but also our own .
That &apos;s what economists call parthththetean improvement .
A redistribution of income redistributed to all -- not only to poor poor people -- because of this choice in the excess .
To conclude , &quot; You can get everything you want to be what you want &quot; --
You &apos;re going to think , &quot; What does that create that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t get anything in a shocrow . &quot;
&quot; A rantrate imagination , a limited vision of the world --
I &apos;m interested in this , at the beginning .
But then I realized that that that fish knows the long knows that that that that fish knows the long knows the long knows that that that the fish knows the long .
Because the reality is that if you &apos;re missing in frantums , so that &quot; everything is possible . &quot; You can &apos;t get freedom . You get freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you break the bite so that it &apos;s all possible possible possible to decrecrecreation .
You &apos;re exceedly and you reduce the well-being .
They all need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too strip , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of some symbolic sphere is a recipe for injjury , I &apos;m afraid for the rovin .
Thank you very much .
