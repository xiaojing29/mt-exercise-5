And last year I showed these very few few few few few years , which the arttal of the artica , which is almost three million years of the United States , it &apos;s remote the United States , it &apos;s remarkable .
But it would be the astest gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t exhip the ice of the ice .
The heat of the artic glacial is , in a sense , the heart of global climate system .
You see the inverse of the inverse and you &apos;re ritira .
The next next slide is to be a carrelated remote savoid reveness of the last 25 years .
The glaciers are reported in red .
You see , how you can see , you can see it down to the blue .
That &apos;s the ice in inverse , which you &apos;re ritira .
You can see that the costs of ice , five or more , five years or more , is like the blood , which is a blood , which is that you can see that the blood out of the body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s past , so .
This is a problem because the heat of interests , the ground of the widest land where there are huge amount of fuel , where there are huge amount of fuel that , they &apos;re refilling , they &apos;re transformed in the microbes .
I can be a total of the inquination of global warming , that could double , that &apos;s a layer , overwhom that &apos;s not around .
In some lagues in Alaska metan of Alaska metan is already rebing out of the water .
The professored Katey Walter Walter of the University of Alaska team of a team of the last inverse .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Well , I &apos;m good . The question is if we &apos;re going to be .
A reason is that this is that the termal survival .
This is a fishing fighting .
And the ported never had ever reached the brains .
This is the Kangerlussuaking , in the southern overs .
If you want to know how the level of the sea level to the glacier , here is where the sea .
These are increasing up .
On the other side of the planet : Antarccccles , the biggest ice of the planet .
And last month , the last month , the bank is in the negative , and the Antarccccy , which is in some of the West , which pogy on some iellow sun .
And it &apos;s six feet of actual level of actual actual actual , like Groenland .
Sulla Himalaya , the third biggest bank , you see new lagues , which a few years ago , that a few years ago , that a few years ago ,
40 percent of the world &apos;s population reported half of the water .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of water .
The ported is increased .
But when you deminds , the same accounts to water .
In California , neve the neve of 40 percent .
The bones are in crisis .
The previsions , like you read , are grass .
The growing because of the world leading to a remarkable remarkable .
The disasers are increasing out of the normal and without the wild .
Four times more than about the last 30 years of the last 30 years of the day ,
This is a remarkable of all insustainable .
If you look at the subtext , you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we &apos;ve got 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean .
Look at the middle area of the Pacific area , from the Americans , from the West , and on both both of the subcontinent , where there &apos;s a radical deeply in the ocean .
The biggest causes of global warming , with the forestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fuel fuel fuel .
The oil is a problem , and the coal is even worst .
The U.S. is one of the United States is one of the most emissions , and in China .
And it was proponed to build a lot of other central central central .
But we &apos;re seeing a direction of the direction .
These are the annullayed in the last years and some alternative of vers .
And anyway , there is a political lets in our country .
The industrial industrial and oil have to speso 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the fuel fuel , which is a symosympair .
And that image would remember something --
I know Natal , in Tennessee , where I saw , there was a loss of 3.8 billion liers of the fourth of the four-four-foot lands .
Maybe it &apos;s the news .
This is the most big flow flow of the flow in America .
It &apos;s happened around Natal .
The public advertising of the industrial industrial industrial was this .
Video : However , the carbon is a kind of alleg and happy .
It &apos;s ababove here in America , and it &apos;s growing our economy .
Frosty the carbon is more and more pulit .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and the work of the waste .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The largest society is Massey in the mountains is Massey . This is his administrator .
Video : I &apos;m going to be clear -- I &apos;m clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Peloses , Harry Reid -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for Prottion of Clima has launched two campaiet .
This is a part of it , a part .
Video : Attore : The War : The War : The War ,
And so our priority is to invest a big amount of money in a wild of the waste to make advertical and confused the truth .
In fact , the coal is not sports .
We think it &apos;s pulit -- it &apos;s a good profumb .
So , not preprerent of climate change .
Let me go .
Video : Attore : Carbone , you &apos;ve heard a lot of a lot of time .
So you &apos;re going to do a around a structure of the heavy of how the fuel fuel fuel .
Straordinariarian ! The machines are a little rumorous , but this is the sound of the fuel technology of the fuel .
The fuel consumption is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology , but the remarkable technology that you see everything .
You look at : this is the odiern technology of the fuel fuel .
Al Gore : Inally , the positive alternative alternative to the economic security and the the most of the national security .
Video : The America is in the crisis ; the U.S. government , security , the climate crisis .
The philo that connected to all of our dependence from the fuel fuel , like the fuel fuel and oil imported .
Now , but there &apos;s a new , audace solution to use .
Rey , 100 percent of energy , in a few years .
A plan to re-working , and make more sure , and help to stop the global warming .
And finally , a solution that bastes to solve our problems .
Rey . Scode of more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : How do it is to reach energy to America .
One of the faster ways of the faster than the dependence from the remarkable to be killing our planet .
Comparty : The future is here . I feel , a new energy .
Comparty : Number two : Neggs for work , well ,
So , I mean , America . It &apos;s time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old old bulch , which is &quot; If you want to go to the fairly .
If you want to go back , you go together . &quot;
We have to go , quickly .
Thank you very much .
And last year at TED I did a introduction on the LHC .
And you promises to go back to you to the car on how it works .
So , so they did . And for those that the other time was not , the LHC is the biggest experiment that we &apos;ve ever attempted -- 27 miles of circles .
His is to reach the conditions that were presents less than a billion ardest of the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times in the universe -- until 600 million times in the second .
All that is just environmental .
This is the machine under Ginevra .
And the remarkable these mini-Big Bang in the remote .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- is about 44 feet and it has a diameter of 22 meters .
This is a picture of ATLAS , in the building so you can notice the proportions .
The 10 sects of last year , we &apos;ve got the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken from ATLAS .
It was because of immense of the ards in the room .
It &apos;s a picture of the first fascinating of particles that had all around the LHC , entring in the LHC , and deliberately , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles in the remote .
In other words , when we see that image the image of the ember 10 , understand that the machine works , which is a great vitty .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to do that when somebody went on Google and vide that the page of Google and travel that the page was that the page was this .
What we means we had a cultural impact beyond the scientific scientific impact .
It &apos;s a week later , there was a week , it was a problem with the machine , it had to these films .
These philillion 13,000 ampamping when the machine works at the same time .
Now , the technical between you will look at the philes and they &apos;re going to say , &quot; it &apos;s too good . I &apos;m too good . &quot;
And instead of them can do that when they are very cold to become the constantly superconductor .
So , at less 271 degrees , to a nururch temperature in the space between stars , these philes can bring that the current .
In one of the giunture between the most novemiil in the LHC , there was a difest of factory .
So the philes are going to heat the lawers , and 3,000 ampampty , and 3,000 ampampty .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressionant if you think that these magnees are more than 20 tons , and that they are moved about 30 centimeters .
They &apos;re about 50 magneat at at 50 magnetic .
We had to tackles , what we did .
We have reported and travel .
Now they &apos;re now back to all their own place .
The end of the LHC will be new integral .
We &apos;re going to enjoy , and we expect to get the right or I &apos;m going to continue and continue so our adventure to find what are the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these reporting accidents required the value of science and engineering of the engineering and engineering .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s the value of the thing like LHC .
I want to end with the words of a scientist Inglese , Humphrey , which , I think , in the difense of his publict , his publict , his publicle , his fense was Michael Farch , &quot; No , is so dangerous for the progress of our mind that the ideas of the dedepending that is not mystery , which is the reminds of our our own own of our our own own own own own monstrate ,
Thank you .
I want to start asking obvious to rethink about when children , children , you play with the morning .
Whereas you can get them and make them , you know , and you know , and they learn to think and to understand them , and we can see it and remarkable to the space .
The spacy is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , from the usual inspired by useful ways of our interaction with physicists , and in my consultations , and at the collaborator , and at Jeevan Kanii , I started asking , &quot; And if when we use a computer , instead of having a computer , instead of having a computer , instead of having a computer , which is a lot of mix , which is a lot of a lot of a fixious way of a lot of a lot of a lot of errorous ,
and it &apos;s going to do ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the Sifty .
In a few words , a Siftable is a computer interactive computer as a biscope .
In a few words , a Siftable is a computer interactive computer as a biscope .
You can move with the hand , they can see , &quot; they can see the hand , you feel the right movement and they have a wireless radio .
But most atategy , are physicists , like the morning , you can move .
The Sifty is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physicists , conscious of the movement , of the other , and as they become more physicists , conscious of the movement , of the other , of the other , of how we can move , and how we can we explore new and unfilling and fun of interaction .
I &apos;m going to try to some example .
This is Siftable to show video : if it &apos;s remote to show video : if it &apos;s the video , the video will recline from the other side side .
These remarkable interactive , they are conconfigured .
If you &apos;re interested in , they &apos;re interested in what &apos;s about them .
If they are circumbs , they can agitate a little bit .
If they are circumbs , they can agitate a little bit .
They also get their own movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the way to use of the data , to example , &quot; a color as if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configured like the green and I can use them to use them to the color in the central , where they &apos;re going to get .
and I can use them to put them in the central , where they &apos;re going to get .
If we can &apos;t get it , we can get a little bit of place .
And I also think that you can get the chance of open , like the hotos , the mathematics and games where people can try to try and look at the results .
Now I &apos;m --
This is a Fibonacks that I do with a equations .
Here we have a kind of words that is at half between Scarabeet and Boggle .
It &apos;s basically , to every time , you &apos;re going to have a letter in every Sifty , at every single one of the rich in the Sifty , and while you &apos;re trying to understand him .
Then , after about 30 seconds of 30 seconds , and you have a new set of letter and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
And there is the children came in in the Media Lab , I did in a way that I tried them and I took a video .
They &apos;re very happy .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of applied is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
You just say , &quot; How do you know , &quot; How do you know exactly what to do .
And there is other people who are trying to .
This is our downnal methesks , there on the right .
It was just wanted to implease .
They &apos;re just morning in the morning , for him .
Now , this is an apappreciation of a cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool for the appreneurs . He &apos;s Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , sold the Sifty , they can be a associated .
It can put new characters in the scene , sold the Sifty , they can be a associated .
So , it &apos;s doing it .
Video : The sun is .
David Merrill : Now he took a treat at the scene .
Video : The araral treat .
Bel work !
So you shake the Sifty and put it can be interact the characters --
Video : Bau !
and by inventing your story .
Video : Hao !
DM : It &apos;s a story with the final story , and it can decide him as it .
DM : It &apos;s a story with the final story , and it can decide him as it .
Video : Vola , gat .
DM : The last example that I have the time to show you a tool , and I &apos;ve got to get music .
It &apos;s a tool , and it &apos;s a recent tool , and it can get music .
The Sifty here , they &apos;re going to be on the bottom and bacteria .
And you have four different variations , and you can choose what they use .
You can even even even these sounds in a sequence of compose .
And it just just doing it a sound sound and a sequence . &quot;
These are actually that you can control from the vivivious , like the reverse and the philty .
The acks to a particular sound and then incline and then incline .
And then there are general , as long and volume , which is applied to the whole sequence .
We look like .
Video : DM : We will we &apos;re going to put a base in two Sifty , &quot; sequence , &quot; we &apos;re going to put in a series , we &apos;ll add another base .
Now I &apos;m a low line .
Video : DM : Now I &apos;m going to add to the percussions --
Video : DM : And I &apos;ll now put the philt of the bacteria , so I can control the effect of the vivious .
Video : DM : I can I think it &apos;s the whole sequence of the whole sequence of the other side .
Video : DM : And now I &apos;ll give the bottom to the bottom to give more expression .
Video : DM : I can get the sequence of the volo . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to plant it before , but I can sudden , make it more , and it &apos;s more coral .
And now , I can smoke the whole sequence of inclining the left the Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new interfaces as a little bit more as they work as our brain and body .
And today , I had to show you one of the results of this perspective , and some chance that I call to bring out the lab .
The concept I want to get to the new generation of objects that we &apos;re going to get this new generation of objects to interact with digital media , which will be information in our world .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the now of talking to you to all of you .
I &apos;m a scander .
I &apos;m going to go and it &apos;s my profession , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the boat of my life .
And I don &apos;t expect to change .
But he said this , something that happened in my life and in my life , and in my career , which has to get me to reach the whole relationship to this work .
The particular thing is that I &apos;ve got this book , this book called &quot; Manear , Prega , Am , Am &quot; which , the diversously , and I &apos;m going to find a big , and I became a big , feeling , bestyestler .
And the result is that everywhere , people are treat at the way , people who are getting out of it .
It &apos;s true -- I was a -- it &apos;s a little bit .
They &apos;re all worried about and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t have a little bit more about ?
You don &apos;t have a little bit of write for all life without able to be able to create a book that can be able to somebody ? &quot;
that can be able to somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s rough , you know .
But it could go , at the part of the most 20 years ago , when I started to say , I was a covering -- I was a candle -- I was a scritice .
I was going to put it at the same reaction .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t I would not have to get ?
You don &apos;t see that the uth-foot ulit ?
You don &apos;t have to do this maps to the whole life without any of the life that has ever out and die on a cumb of every wheel with the bocking of the south of the south of failure ? &quot;
So you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
I &apos;ve got all of those things .
I &apos;ve always been painted .
And I also have a lot of other things that people can &apos;t inch .
How the alge and other things are .
But what I thought I write what I thought and I ask me , and I ask me , why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logic that anybody should expect to be spaving from a job that you have to do .
But what is there is so particular in the implant imded with a nervous health of the mental health of the mental health of how other carefully do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemical engineering and I don &apos;t remember a little bit of the time in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if he would be engineering ?
It never had to -- that blocks of the engineering John , how do it ?
It wasn &apos;t so , you know , how ?
Onestly , engineers like a group of checks , like a group , they have a reputation of being alcolized manipulated .
We have enough to have enough this reputation , and not only a design writers , but creativity of every kind of reputation , we have this reputation of initional instant .
And it &apos;s not going to look at the tristes of the magnificent of the magnifers that , only in the 20th century , they &apos;re going to die and often often .
And the ones that they don &apos;t sicked to be really disappear by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before we die , in the last interview said , &quot; Every little bit more &quot; One amazing amazing air . &quot; A little bit more , &quot; A little bit more , &quot; A little bit more , &quot; A little bit more ,
But we don &apos;t bunch when we feel these things like , because we heard these things very long as we &apos;ve got these things very interized and accepted the notion that creativity and the suffering that creativity and the art , the end , then it will be a few of the way of the angosccover .
And the question I want to get to all here is : I agree with this idea ?
It goes right for that thing -- because it &apos;s a little bit of a distance of a distance of me ,
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s dangerous and I don &apos;t want to see the perpepepeat in the last century .
I think it &apos;s better encourage our big creative creative creative creative .
And I know that , in my case -- in my situation -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start to the circumstances , especially you to get the circumstances in my career .
And that is -- you look , I &apos;m pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I &apos;ve still about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything I &apos;ll write from now now now now it &apos;s right from the world as the work that he came out after the world .
I &apos;m going to be slavery because we &apos;re all more or less friends here -- is likely that my greatest success is to my own .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that door a person to start bind in the morning of the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I &apos;m going to keep to continue to do this job .
So , the question is , how do it is , how ?
And so I think , after a lot of reflect , which the way to keep write is what to create a psychological design , right ?
I had to find a distance of security between me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural natural thing that I &apos;m writing , and I try to look at the time , trying to look at the time , trying to find other society to see if they could have have some of the best ideas and more sane and more sane and more sane and more sane and more sane and more sane and more sane and more sane and more sane and and and and more sane and more sane and and more
on how to help people people who are emotional inherent risks .
And that search me to the Great and old Rome .
I do you go because I read in circle and then back .
In the ancient Great and old Rome -- people don &apos;t seem to believe that creativity sell that creativity sell of the men , OK ?
It was thinking about creativity was this spirit , and that sell people who sell their own own own as a few distant and unknown .
The grew us called these spirites of the devices of deployed . &quot;
Socppitely , he believed to have a deeld of a dealing dealing .
Romans were the same idea , but they called the the kind of the spirit .
The Romans was very great , because the Romans didn &apos;t really think a genius was a very smart .
They think a genius was that a genius of divine that was literally in the murt of a neighborhood , a little bit like the ellow of the elf and that sell it , and that sell it out of the artist and the model of the artist and model the result of that work .
Here is ealtional -- here is the distance of which is the distance of the results of your work .
And all they knew that was so that it was so that it was , right ?
So the artists were protected by certain things , like example , for example , like , not ?
If your work was excited to get and all the southern , all they all know that they were helped by this genium .
If your job job , if your work , it was not your your own , right ?
They all know that was your genium to be a incapable .
And so people han concept of han concept for a long time .
Then the Rinch came and everything , and it changed , and it &apos;s going to be the human idea ; we put the human the universe on the universe , and mysters and mysters and mysters and mysters and so they desk detached to the creatures of the well-detached to the human love .
This was the principle of humanity and people started thinking that creativity came to think that creativity came out of idivide .
And for the first time in history , you know , you know , how to a genius to a genius that artist in a genius that to a person with the genius .
And I have to say , I think it was a big mistake .
I think I hope to put somebody , a simple person to believe of being a recipient , the essence and the essence of the vines and the people of all mysters , unknown and etern and etern is a responsibility to a phililillion .
It &apos;s like to ask somebody to inherate the sun .
It &apos;s completely the ego and detains all of the ego and creates all these ingresh .
And I think it was this pression to destroy artists in the 500 years .
And if that &apos;s true , and I think it is , and what is , and now ?
Can we do it ?
You can go back to a more antic understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t get 500 years of thinking about 500 years .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience that sold would be paid to the scientific noticing on , you do , you do , you do , you do , you do the people are shopting on their projects .
It &apos;s probably not going to be convinced to all about that .
But the question I &apos;d like to take is -- why ?
Why don &apos;t I think about this way ?
Because it has more sense of anything that I &apos;ve ever heard to explain the exassuing imprevevehicing the process of creative process .
A process that , as anybody who ever attempt to do something -- so , it doesn &apos;t understand it .
And , in fact , it can sometimes seem to be completely paranorous .
I did this inherently with the amazing poean , which has now 90 years , but that it was a few years , but that was a few years , but that was a few years in the front of the Samples and said that in the Virginia , and it felt it was in the front of the landscaping .
He said that it was like a train of air .
And that was going to get out of her landscape .
I felt that I felt that , because it would be tremendous land under his feet .
He knew about having a single thing to do to do that point and was of , words , &quot; he would take a match . &quot;
And so correct it down to the house and it was the following this poetry , and a little bit of paper and a faster , and a pretty quickly quickly , and it would get it and get it on the page .
Sometimes I couldn &apos;t be enough to be enough , so correx and correx without able to get to home and the poetry and the poetry and the poetry and she would continued to continued to continued to continued to continued to go through the landscaping , trying to come through the landscaping , and she would be able to be a little bit .
Then there were times -- this piece of time , I &apos;ll never have a moments of the time that was almost lost , right ?
So , it was looking at home and it was trying to paper and the poetry and the poetry and sweet it , and then he said , which was like if you hallunged , and then he was like a leaving and the office .
And he was the poem from the code and remote the body and the transcated the body and the transcated on the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page , but the last word at the last word to the first word .
So when I felt -- it &apos;s pathesk , it &apos;s exactly the ugual process .
It doesn &apos;t all my creative process -- they &apos;re not a conducucucture .
I &apos;m a mud , and my way to work is ; I sweet my own own orary day and to get it and go up and go up and to the waste .
But I even , in my testestables , I &apos;ve strike against that thing , sometimes .
And I think that a lot of you the han made .
You know , even though the work and ideas came up to a certain way of you could not be a certain source .
And what is this ?
And how can we have to get out of how to do it , but , rather , which is a little bit of them ?
And so , I &apos;m about , the best example that I have the musician that I have the musician , which I &apos;ve interviewing different years ago .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the most life of life was the incarpeer of the artist of the same time , trying to control , and then then to control these species of obsesses .
But then I &apos;ll get up , and then he was driving , and a day he was driving on a Los Angeles , he changed everything for him .
It was going to go to fast and everything a little bit of a little frame of melodia , which is in his head of inspiration , which is a inspiration and falling , and you want , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and it &apos;s wonderful , but it doesn &apos;t know how to take it .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a little recorder .
So I started to feel this kind of old , you know , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to get to slow up , and it &apos;s going to get up ,
I &apos;m not enough enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to go into the panic , I &apos;ll stop .
I &apos;m going to put the whole process and made something completely new .
I &apos;m just just the sky and said , &quot; I &apos;m not going to see that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Ti looks like that could write a song ?
If you really want to be a more more more likely time when I can take me to care of you .
Altreme , you &apos;re going to be able to something else today .
I went to disturbing Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his process actually changed after this .
I don &apos;t work , the work was still hoscy as it always .
But the process , and the anthium process that was reported when the genius that was reported when the genius out of him , and it was the other that problems and I went back to where they were doing it back to where it was that it was not a thing to be a thing that it was not a thing to be a thing thing that was that it was a thing that they didn &apos;t have to be a thing that they had to be a thing that that they didn &apos;t have to be a reduced ,
but it &apos;s a lot of this peculiar , wonderful bizarre , and this struggle in Tom and this struggle , but it wasn &apos;t Tom .
So how the story that I felt that story to change a little way I work and I &apos;ve been able to save a time .
This idea , I was writing when I was writing , &quot; I &apos;m going to write , &quot; and fall in a of those cave of the cave of the cave of the cave that we &apos;re working on something and we can &apos;t start thinking that it &apos;s going to start thinking that that is the worst book .
Not just good , right , just the worst book .
And I started thinking about geps this project .
But then I remember to Tom that I talked to the air and I went .
So I get my face in the way to get my comments and and deped my comments to a vast angle of the room .
And I said to high , &quot; See , what , both of course , what if this book is not going to be any of my , right ?
Because I &apos;m going to see it , I &apos;m going to do that .
So if you want to be better , you have to presented and your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t you know what , I don &apos;t have any .
I &apos;ll write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I would like to please that it was recorded that I &apos;ve been presented to my part of the end is so , OK -- the end is so , OK -- the way , OK -- the way , and the sacred of the North and music that went on and sacred and sacred to the alba and and sacred to the alba .
And they were always magnifed because the ballerini were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every single , a little bit , something happened , and one of these artists became actually transcending .
And I know what I know about what I know , because I know that you have seen a certain point , a certain point , a performance .
It was like the time , you &apos;re stuck , and it was like a kind of portal and not was doing anything different from usually , like the 1,000 notice , but it all you get out of the 1,000 notice before , but it &apos;s all the halled .
And suddenly , a sudden that &apos;s a human .
But it &apos;s taken from the diggling in the well-luminate fire .
And when this happened , you know , the people knew what was , &quot; he called her &quot; .
They were the hands and started to bay , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curious notice -- when Mors invaser the south of Spagna , I was this abled with their and the ready to go from the Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , &quot; and the Ole , &quot; and I can still hear in corride or in the fairs of the fillended or in the famenco .
In Spages , when a artist did something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , and the Allah , and the Allah , and it &apos;s a fixable , &quot; However , it &apos;s a fastly reeply , &quot; it &apos;s a bunch of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need .
But the problem is the day , for the hallerin the same , when you see the 11-up in the morning of the morning of the morning of Martedday and foot God .
It &apos;s just a dead mortle to ginoctopus , and maybe it can never be more to each other to to the height .
And maybe nobody will be the name of God still as a gira , and what has to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most payers to do in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so angoscivent if you can &apos;t believe , advanced the most amazing aspect of your being being from you .
But it just makes you just that you have data in the prestired of this team of a source of the side of your life that you have to get a else else when you finish .
And you know , if we think about this way .
And so I started thinking about , and it &apos;s because I thought about a different months in the working of the book that I was going to think about , dangerous , which is dangerous , the dangerous dangerous , and it &apos;s very very successful .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I I feel electric .
Don &apos;t get you . It &apos;s just your work .
Continua presented you to your side , any can be .
If your work is balling , you can blow .
If the divine , you would get genius to get some kind of reported to some kind of wonderful , for a moment of wonderful time through the front of the forces , then &quot; Os ! &quot;
Altrouble , you do it the same .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot;
I think I think it &apos;s taught it .
&quot; Ole ! &quot; at you , even only only for having human love and testesty to have a textinctive love and testesty to you continuously .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I talked about some of these projects on the human genome , about what can to do and discovery of new genome .
We &apos;re starting a new perspective : we started to digalize biology and now now now to digital code , we &apos;re going to go into a new fase of biology , designing and synththththrow and synthththththrow life .
We always tried to take big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists I think they have to understand the librains .
We tried to different them , reducing the minimes .
We &apos;re looking at almost 20 years .
When we have sequenced the human genome was treat at the digital world of the digital world .
Now , we ask , we can regenerate life , or a new life of this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasm , which is the species from genome , which is the species from the smaller genome .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little little little bit more ,
We can get to eliminate a hundred genetic genes of about 500 than 500 than 500 than the genes of about 500 than 500 than that are here .
But when we look at its map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our own own .
It &apos;s simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can get to the time , it &apos;s very likely that this can bring a living cell cell .
So I decided that the only one on the only to design is synththesize this chromosome in a way that you could get the components to get some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the rumber of &quot; Can we synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Can you have the construggle to produce these big molecules that we &apos;ve never done ?
And in case , in case of a chromosome ?
A cromosome is just a piece of inerves .
The speed of which we can digalize life is growing to remote life is growing .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , which is a pretty lently , but it &apos;s better .
And our more recent results the results of a curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process has required , so many passes , start with a bioethic review before the first experiments .
But we &apos;ve discovered that synththeme DNA is very difficult .
There are thousands of machines of thousands of machines in the world that are producing little segment of 30 length , and it &apos;s a degenerative process , more mistake , more mistake , more mistake , more mimistakes , there are .
So we had to develop a new metod to assembling these framments and corregging the mistake .
And this was our first attempt , to start with digital information from digital genome of Phi 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that killes .
We designed the framments , effectively , the correction of the mix and get a molecule of DNA .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of inherheroes and we put it in the bacteria , the bacteria , bacteria have started read this genetic and to make the particles .
The viral particles are then you reported by cells , are come back and they destroy .
I &apos;ve talked about with members of the oil industry , say that they have certain certain of them that they have certain of this model .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build his own own own own own own own own own own own .
But we wanted to do things in big things .
We wanted to build the whole chromosome .
I &apos;m more than 580 mix lands .
So we thought we did it in cables of the viruses of the virus , so that we can change the casses of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the arms was of a mix for every 10 mid-mix .
We found out , resequence , 30 errors . If we used that sequence would never be able to do this .
One part of the process is to design segments that you &apos;re sovods to all other seged with all other segments of 50 lands to build a little little little bit that work together .
We try to do the untic elements here .
You can see you read that we put the ligrade .
Think about that : We have a genetic genetic code on four letter , C , GC , and T.
Three of those lands to put up about 20 amminoacids , and there &apos;s a specific specific specific specific specific to each amminoacious .
So we can use the gene code to write , fracy , thoughts .
What we did we have to the beginning was authograin .
Some of them have been delusers from fact that it wasn &apos;t poem .
We designed these segments to do for potential .
There are a lot of refairs and put them together .
And we started assembling of the parts , start with five to seven mix , and they &apos;re going to take it , unendles in a way to form of 24 mix , and we &apos;re going to get to 72 to the letter .
And every step , we &apos;ve been a little bit of these segments in above so powerful , we &apos;re trying to create a very very very little bit of foostog -- like you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatically the process .
So , this seems like the tabellon a glass of a basket .
When we get to these segments very long , more than 100 mid-based , more than 100 mix , they will not get any directly in the EU .
You can get to the modern limits of modern biology .
So we &apos;ve been looking at other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called the romologist , which in biology , which in biology , in biology , which is to reach DNA to reach DNA .
Here &apos;s a example .
This organism , called Deinoccurrics , it can be above three million rad rad of radiation .
You can see in the top of the root of as his chromosome came .
In 12 hours , 24 hours , it &apos;s just like before .
They &apos;re thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be completely completely .
They can live under the vast .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life in space , and you have to find new new reports .
And to say the true , NASA showed that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built using these processes , just using the lieveventually design with the design of segments of segments .
The lieved them assemble .
This image was not taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a very big molecule that we can see the little bit of a lawest .
These are pictures that code a period of six seconds .
This is the publishing publishing that we did a little time ago .
I &apos;m more than 580,000 lands of genetic code .
It &apos;s the biggest molecule of a defined structure ever created by man .
It has a weight molecular ular ular ular molecular .
If you &apos;re going to have a caracer 10 without spaces , you would like 142 paid to get this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ? How can we do it ?
Of course , you take a virus is a game .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria are .
It &apos;s more simple when it &apos;s about eucariess as our : you can just get the nuclear nuclear , and put another , which is basically the process of clonation .
In the bacteria , in the archaea is instead of integrated in the cell , but we &apos;ve been demonstrate that we are able to do a trapial trapial of a cell cell to another and active it .
We had a little bit of a partend of a little bit of a microbial species .
The two are different as the men from mouth .
We &apos;ve got some gene in more way that I could decide that you could decide to get this chromosome .
And then the bunch of the layer to hill all the protection .
And when we put it in the cell is studies -- and you &apos;ll open our graph , and you &apos;re going to fisticked -- the new cromosome is in the cell .
And we were thinking that we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to push us more in there .
This is one of the most mechanisms of evolution .
We found that tantissime , a second or a third chromosome from some part , add a few of the different different trouble of the species .
So who thinks about the evolution of how a gene is that it doesn &apos;t understand a lot of biology .
They have been called &quot; &quot; &quot; French &quot; &quot; retrip that adly say that it &apos;s a digital .
The cromosome was in the cell .
The phones of the phone , we put it .
It &apos;s expressed , and it has to recognized the other cromosome , the masticked , and we &apos;ve got to the cell and the new chromosome .
It became blue because of the genes of genes that we put .
And in a short short of time , all the characteristics of a species are going to perse , and it &apos;s transformed in the new species , based on the new species , based on the new species , which we put in the cell .
All the protection is changed , the members are changed , and when we read the genetic code de exactly what we have transfted .
Now , this could look like , this could look like the genetic software , but it &apos;s the DNA of DNA , we can change things in a very very very very well .
Now I &apos;ve already explained that here is not about genesis -- but progress of the world to start from three million years and a half million years and a half of evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the explosion that we &apos;re going to create a new species on this process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s enough when we think about our need .
We &apos;re going to go from six billions of people in the next 40 years .
Right to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each other in 1946 ; in 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re looking at food , we &apos;re going to find food , water and fresh , and welline for six and a half billions of people .
It &apos;s going to be more dar for for nine billion .
We &apos;re more than five billion bars , more than 30 billion bars , more than 30 billion bars .
That means 100 million barre-day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to reach them , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to get all of CO2 emission from these materials that finding in the atmosphere .
At the day of today , thank you very scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the components for the future .
The electronic industry has only a dozen about components , and think about some different things are solved out .
Our limits here is data from biological reality and from our imagination .
We now have some techniques , because of these metods of synththththization , which we call genomics .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a million chromoses a day .
Think of processing these 20 million genes of different genes or to try to make the drugs , new vaccines , new , new vaccines , we can change , and create more biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a selection selection .
We can choose to survival of survival , chemical production or fuel , production of vaccines .
This is a few antanea of some software programmed that we &apos;re working for being able to be able to sex ,
Well , we don &apos;t know how to be .
We know exactly what is their genetic code .
We are now looking at the fourth generation .
You can see that you can track trankle from the grain was a experiment .
We have a fuel of second and third generation that will use enough to be in the zuccher of the covering or different kinds of butanle ,
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increasing the cost of food and limited the food cost of food and limited the CO2 in matter , we &apos;re working for cells that we &apos;re working for cells that we &apos;re working in the reach of the fourth of the fourth generation in about 18 months .
The solar solar combined with CO2 is a metode -- but in our discoveries in all the world , we found different metods .
This is a organism that we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
It &apos;s going to be in the ocean , about 2,500 feet of the water of the water .
They think of meters using hydrogen molecular as a source of energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can incancaning CO2 , which can easily be transported by your own , converted that CO2 in the fuel , to drive this process .
So we think we could be able to be able to increase what is the question of what is life is &quot; We , we have the extreme of reaching the whole oil industry .
Right . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And so we &apos;re working for the same metods to create vaccines .
You saw this year with the influence , we &apos;re always back to a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s about the vaccine .
I think what you can change is building in the anticilittle .
And so , that &apos;s how the future could start to look at , now , the tree of evolution , accellating evolution with bacteria with the evolution of synthetic , and then cells .
We are so much of the way to improve people .
Our goal is to do in a way of living enough to make it . Thank you very long .
I &apos;m going to show you , the most quickly quickly as well as a few few times , some fundamental work , new technology that we took the Microsoft in the following one year . This is Seadragoned . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s a kind of a environment that you can interact is at the local level of data .
Here we &apos;re seeing a lot of different gigabyte of digital photos with a kind of weight and continue , for a fast panoramic , we have the images like .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big is the amount of information that we see , how big are these data data or images .
Most of the digital photos , but this for example is a scanning scanning from the Biary library of Congress , and reentry in the middle of 300 megapixel .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that limited the number of a system like this is the number of pixel in any time . It &apos;s also a very flessible architecture .
This is a whole book , is a whole book of data .
This is Casa desoled Dickens . Every colonna represents a caple .
And to show you that it &apos;s just about the text and not images , and we can do a thing like that , to see that it &apos;s a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a little artificial way to read electronic book .
I don &apos;t have a little bit .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s a number of The Guardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a seat .
And it really gives you a little bit of the experience of a review of a review or a waily review or a daily , which is to nature .
We also made something with the angle of this number of the Guardian .
We created a public bunch of high resolution that is -- much more high than that you use in a normal normal .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , even the specific specific fic fic fic fic .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to get the limits of space .
We hope that this means that this means to put up and other porters and other porcheries , I didn &apos;t have to be a more to be need .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this field , I don &apos;t want to say that we have to contribute to give you in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. Sovrapes on a geospective picture of NASA .
So now we &apos;re going to do something else .
This is actually from the web ; you can go to the web ; you can go to the web .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which fighting two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual search to the computer .
And it &apos;s from the web , to manage from Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from another image and have this kind of experience of resolution .
But the spacy of space , the images here has actually a meaning .
The algoritation of the computer recorded these images together , in a way that correspond to the places that the imagination that the imagined -- all the next next to the Grasks of Montagagues in Montagagne Roccies -- you see that in the elings of a department of a department of gorders of a department , and these are all of the spaces are all college .
I don &apos;t know if I have to show you some other other environment .
There are some more more space space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data of the original data from a remote prototype of Photosynth that we &apos;ve done to work for the first time the time the first time the summer , to show you what I think is the key to show you what I think is the key to see that technology , the Photynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily evidence that we have in the web .
We had to worry about the legal aspects and saying .
This is a reconstruction of the clower Nobody Dame images from Flickr . Bae . It &apos;s digit . It &apos;s a picture that &apos;s out of the Mounce , other of the campus , other of the campus and saying . Olicken of these arararge , and so on the picture that it &apos;s discovery .
So , they &apos;re all images from Flickr and have been all connected to space space .
And it &apos;s possible to be able to this simple way .
You know , I &apos;d never thought to end up to Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifically to get this kind of account here .
I think that &apos;s a lot of different kinds of different kinds of fotocaming , from those cell cell cell phone , a significant number of the number of effects , with a significant number , a significant number of different different kinds of photocaming , and it would be together in this environment .
And if I can , I try and look at the more struggle .
Many of you are blocked by faces , etc .
And somewhere there is a series of photographs -- and it &apos;s a series of photographs .
This is a poster of Nobody recorded .
We can go from the poster of the physics of this environment .
The point is that we can do things with social environment . This is to take data from the entire memory , from the whole collective memory of how to look at the land , from the visual point -- and connected all those data together .
All those pictures become connected together , more than the parts of the parts .
You have a model of the whole emerge of the land .
Think about this as a prolungment of Stephen Lawler on the Earth .
It &apos;s something that grown in complexity as the people are using it , and the wherever they &apos;re going to get it .
They &apos;re married with metaped with metaped by other people .
If you &apos;re the idea of contrast , you all these slow-to-race idea of Nobody , and I can use the notice of Nobody Dame sudden , and I can use the way to use of the data , and I can use the kind of ingress in that metaphor , using the picture of anybody else , and I can have a social experience of the guy , and to have a new new new and cross-mo-mo-mo-mo-mo-f-fit .
Of course , a consequence of all these are virtual models , very elaborated by every interesting part of the land , it doesn &apos;t just from the airplane and satellite images from satellite memory and similar , but from the collective memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized that ? What your software is your software to be able to do is that at a certain point , in the next few years , all the photographs and share from anyone in the world will be connected with ?
BAB : Yeah . What is doing is doing is actually discover .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , you want , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the images .
The thing is very interesting if you think about the weight of information search information that many of these images have .
As you do a research research research , you can see a frase and the text on the web has a lot about pictures of information to the pictures .
Now , what happens if that picture is connected to all your pictures ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of remarkable and the amount of remarkable . It &apos;s a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really amazing .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the main pleases when you travel and a deliver of the waste of the waste of the waste , which is the traditions , who have the traditions , who have the past in the wind , and touches it in the wind , you can get it in the wind , you can get it in the wind , you can get it in the wind , you know , you know , you know , the blocks .
Basti thinking that the slavery , and that the world &apos;s Lattea , or that the world &apos;s Lattea , or that the Himalaya , or that in Himalaya , which in Himalaya , and the idea of Dharm , to remember the world &apos;s exhip , and that the idea that the world that we have no one of the world that we have no longer in a sense of the way , but it &apos;s actually , it &apos;s actually , but it &apos;s actually ,
the result of a particular set of choices that our stires did , good or bad , a lot of generations .
And of course , we all share the extra trouble .
We all all kinds of proof .
We are soud to reward .
We need to deal with the death of , so we don &apos;t smile .
We all have a art art .
What the thing that hits is the particular particular of the song , the ritory of the dance of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that the Penan of Borneo , or the follow of the Voodoo , or the Haiti , or the guerriers of the desert Kaign Kenya , and Curander , Curandander , or a camp , or a camel , or a camp in .
He was my journey of my journey in desert a month ago , or a website of yak in the Human , the mother of Mest , the mother of Mest , the mother of the world .
All of these populations are teaching that there are other ways of existing ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And if you think you &apos;re a moment , is a concept that can give you hope .
Insively , the miriap of cultures are in the world creates a spiritual life and cultural that you want the planet and it &apos;s important for the well-being in the planet as a biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural race as a brain , and you can call the total sphere and you can call the total sphere , and inspired , ideas , inspired , inspired , and inspired , and inspired , intuitions , intuitions and inspired , intuition , and inspired , and inspired to the human imagination .
The etnososphere is the great patrimonium of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbols of what we are and what we can be in how species inquisitive .
And because the biosphere was gravely consumed by a very quickly has been a very quickly , and too much more quickly .
No biological , for example , would say that 50 percent of all the species was or about the orest of the summer of the summer , or in the most apprecise , or in the most apprecise of biological diversity -- and it doesn &apos;t get a little bit of biological diversity -- and it doesn &apos;t get a little bit of the most optimistic diversity -- that that that of cultural diversity .
The thing is , of course , the perspectrum of all of course , the perspectrum .
When you &apos;re born 6,000 lingue on this planet .
One is not compost by a fairly language or a series of grammaticks .
One of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle of the way that the soul of every culture is .
Every language is a forest of mind , a bunch of mind , a thought , a ecosystem of spiritual possibility .
And those 6,000 lingue , as we &apos;re here at Monterey , at least half half the soup in the oreer of the children .
They don &apos;t get to children , the resolder that means , less that I don &apos;t know something that they &apos;ve already died .
What is there more tristes of being a silent of the silent , of the one of the last to talk about a language , of the way of transmit , or of anticipate the promise or of anticipate the promise of children ?
This orring is a few weeks of the world in some of the world every two weeks : every two weeks , a old language and door with the hotter of a language language .
And I know somebody of you say , &quot; Why is it better ?
The world would not be a better place if you &apos;re going to look at the same language ? &quot;
We talk about kogs .
You can see a little bit of a thing that means that I can &apos;t talk about their language .
I &apos;d like to do a journey through the etnosh --
a little journey in the sphere to give you a little bit of what we &apos;re lost .
Many of us department that when I say , &quot; different ways of existing ways of existing .
We take for example , this bim Barasana , in Amazon , the populations of anaconda , which creatures in the middle of the East of the East in the panpanx of the front of the west in the panpanx of the wings of serious .
It &apos;s a populations that is not able to distinguish color from the green line because the birth time is identify in the time , from which you know the people who think of people .
They have a kind of phanantom , and a regard of the wild , &quot; exogy , &quot; You have to sect a different language that &apos;s about a different language language .
Everything is that roots in the past mitological , but the particularly particularly in these haired families , the haded particularly , or seven linger .
They can hear listen and then they start talking to .
We take one of the most interesting trials that I lived , Waoran Ecuador of the Ecuador , a populations that had the first contact in 1958 .
In 1957 , five measured measured to a little bit of a spike .
They did it get out of the top photographers that reported them in the top of the waste that they were reporting that this people in the forest of the forest of the forest forest .
They &apos;ve taken the pictures from the land , they have a shape or a shape or a shape or a shape , and they &apos;re not going to have to be a diavoid that was the diavoes , and they kill the five missionary measures with the lance .
But Waorani don &apos;t kill only kill the houders .
They &apos;re killed between them .
54 percent of mortality was caused by their own .
We &apos;re risaled to eight generations and we found two of natural death and when we have a life life to know , they have a incredible knowledge of them was going to have a dead invecting it , and then they kill it . They had a incredible knowledge of the forest .
The cover were able to recognize the animal animal from 40 pass and recognize the animal animal from 40 pass .
In the early &apos; 80 , I &apos;ve been assigned a task of Harvard , I was a very interesting task of Harvard , I wanted to go to Haiti in Haiti in the basic basic secret of Duvalier and Tonton Maces , and it imposes of Duver and Tonton Maces , and it imposes of the Maces .
And to give a sense of the miracy , I would have to understand the Voodoo is not magic .
It &apos;s pretty a complex view view of the world .
Many interesting interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you have to me ?
Cristian , Islam , Budweatheism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Sharian Africa has not faith . And instead , and Voodoo is not the other that the distilled to the other other than that religious .
What makes interesting is that it &apos;s the intense relationship between life and death .
So the bees are becoming out .
The spirites can be invocated by by the Grands , they respond to the race of the dance of the dance of the way that for a short short , and it &apos;s the widdance is .
And so that you &apos;re like to say , &quot; You &apos;re going to say , &quot; You &apos;re going to talk about God .
We dancy in the temple and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment that you &apos;re pat , is the spirit that you can do ?
So you see and they &apos;re seeing these incredible events : following voodoo in the state of trance that touch the well-flow demonstration of the body when it &apos;s a very strong extremely of the body when it &apos;s catalized in a very exciting of the body .
I have all the people with which I lived the most amazing is Kogi of Sierra Nevada , in Columbia in the Colombia in in Colombia sects .
I think of the ancient of the civilization that once they live on the plarch of the Colombia in the arch of the Colombia , the people who are ritional contained on the mess of the flying of the skills .
In a bunch of blood , this people who had never been conquisted by the spagnosed by the spagnosed .
And in fact , there are governance by a clero of them is so amazing .
The young following people are taken from families to three or four or four years , and live secrets in a world of good and nininch in the base of the glaciers of the glaciers ,
Two years of nine years , they choose to reproduce nine months of gestation that transform in the mother , now are metaphor in the mother , now are metaphor in the Grands of Mother .
For this time , they are accultured to the values of their society , values that are workers and only their prevenues and only their prevenues and the balance of the balance , or to say the balance .
And the term of this amazing initively started out and for the first time in life , at the age of 18 years , you see an alba . And that I think of a fixth of the first buttons of the first buttons , when the sun the sun , everything that have learned in his own own own own own own .
&quot; Do you know ? Proprice as I said .
It &apos;s amazing . Now it &apos;s a lot of you protect it . &quot;
They call the most people who are called the most and say that we , fratthers , we are the cold of the world .
This is extremely important .
When we think about indeed populations and the investment of the wild Roussearch and the old story of the well-selection , which is a concept of Those , maybe invited Those , maybe invited to Those , we have more neighborhood to the Earth of us .
The indeed , they &apos;re not noses are noses by noses .
There is no space for these things in the palude of Asmat the Asmat the ards of the Tibet , but thank you to the time and rites , they created a mystic of the Earth &apos;s Earth based on the world . It &apos;s a very much more substanding , but on a most subject , but with a reporter .
What does it mean ?
It means that a little bit of Anes that a little bit of the Anes that mountain is a spirit that you will get the outbreak of his dest will be a deeply different and it will have a different relationship to the mountain or that place a little bit different with the mountain or that a lot of the mountain of the Montana that has a massive massive massive .
That &apos;s the dimate of one spirit or a mineral of a mineral is irrid .
What is interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia , who would be cut .
And I have a human being different from my friends Kwakiutl that believe the forests are deeply of Hukukuk and the bunch of Hukukle and the bal bal balls that live in the world , the spirites that are in the world , the spirites that we live in the Hukkle .
If you start looking at that these cultures can create different , you can start to understand some of them discoveries .
I &apos;ve taken this photograph to open this picture to open the West .
Maybe some of you &apos;ve heard about the ayaaask , the most powerful psychoactive psychoactive .
What makes it fascinating the ayaaaaking is not the drugs of the basically , but its elaboration . It &apos;s reported by two elements .
On a side , this lian leavy of the side of a little bit of a coal of a coal of , harder , read a little bit of the leg .
I &apos;m going to take the only plant plant , it &apos;s a little bit of the consciousness , but it &apos;s mixed with the fourth of a arch of the family caffection is called Psychecererererer-bandwis .
This is a little bit of trippping , very similar to the seriotonin , dimethyltrypppping , methypppamine .
If you ever see the Yanomomoms to get the houses that they do a different set of species , anchy is a methylyppppamine .
I can take that dust the dust is a little bit like to be shown from a fuel caretic caretic fishing and land on a sea .
I &apos;ve got often often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has taken the pitch was the pitch , with his discovery of the fungi stallucinitious rying in Mexico .
I &apos;m my tar is not a classificate these triptamine as as you can &apos;t tell any of any of being hallucinogens because if you can &apos;t tell any of being hallucined .
It &apos;s possible to assuit , it &apos;s just if you get with other substances that denian MAO .
Now , it &apos;s the beautiful : the birth of the MAO that is ininjors of MAO , the same kind of need to potential tripping trips . The question survival , and the question is in a 80,000 species of plants , how these people do these people are in a refable version of a couple of species of gain , but that if you combined a chemistry that is a biochemistry that is a chemistry that
We use the great eufemism of the evidence and the mixed mixed .
But if we ask the Indian , they &apos;ll tell us . &quot;
What does it mean ?
This tribes , Cofan , Cofan , has 11-variety of ayahuask , which you can get in the forest , and that you would get our eyes in the same species .
If you ask them how to do it as they &apos;re going to say , &quot; I think I would think of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of you ? &quot;
The solution is : they take 111-various various in a night of a punch of pounds .
And you don &apos;t have a re-at Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting that content to the stapks .
Now , &#91; they open the problem is that even the problem is that even the people who have to heart heart people who have to heart people in the margines , but in some way to some way to reach our world , and it &apos;s going to get over .
In fact , the 20th century , in 300 years , it will not reminded for his guerre or its technology , but as the was where we stop and we stuck and we abbracing it and we used to have a passive accepted of biological diversity and cultural diversity and cultural diversity is not the change .
All the cultures through the sects of the cultures are involved in a dance for new possibility .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux , they don &apos;t stop to be Sioux when they put it in a part of Americans have to be American when they put it in the horse and heavy .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that minds the technology of etnosh . It &apos;s the power .
The wall of the domination of the domination .
And if you give a sat at the world , you &apos;ll see that these are not destined to get .
They &apos;re living and dynamics and dynamics out of the existence from the existence of the existence that go beyond their ability .
I think it &apos;s disbosing in the floup in the potential of the Penboses .
a nomade of Sarawak , in the sest suit , a populated people who lived lights in the forest to a generation , and now reduced to the generation , and then then reduced to the rights , where you can see the fairs , where you can see the fourth of the Mar , where the Mar Cour-Mar , where the Mar Mar Clim , where the Mar , where the Sar , and you can see the Mar Mar , and re-----Curuminuminuminuminate ,
You &apos;re ready to repair the path of the forest .
Or in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that have come with the discovery of the old .
If we put on the mountains of the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research research , you &apos;ll see the wall of the political domination .
How you know the genocide , the expedition of a populations , is a universal level , but the etnode , the destruction of a people , not only only remarkable to a populations , but it &apos;s a lot of a people , not only is a part of the development .
And you can &apos;t understand the Tibet until you &apos;re not part of the beginning .
I &apos;ve lost the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in China , the West in the West , coming to Lhasa young connected , but only came to Lhasa very young connected , but only came to Lhasks , and what we feel about .
6,000 monuments sacred redice and well-wwinding .
1,2 million people killed the military Rivolution in the Cultural Rivolution .
The father was ascritical at the Panchen Lama .
The Chinese means that it was killed to the time of the Chinese invasion .
And it &apos;s fat with Suo Santity in Santity in the diaspora that has taken the people in Nepal .
Sue mother was imprisoned and his houd was remote .
It was taken of the hidden cost to the age of two years , under his gonna bought her gonna &apos;t .
The sister , which has done it , it was med in field of reeducation .
A day has invertised a little bit of the hurant sexier , and it was a mitter to the sesthed , and it was a sandwns for seven years .
The pain of Tibet can be insopportraits , but it the spirit of the people is from tener .
And then you &apos;re going to get to a choice .
We want to live in the world of the monotony or we want to accept the world of the diversity of the diversity ?
The big anthrologist Margaret Mead , before he died , before he died that his biggest was that , in our our vision of the world , not only we &apos;ll see the whole whole gamma of the world , not only we &apos;ll see the whole gamma of thinking , but a day day day day we &apos;re going to give us a certain certain certain certain certain way that there were other possibilities .
And it &apos;s a billion to remember that our species is exist for 600,000 years .
The French Neolithic , which has given us us us , which has made it socking out of the seed , replacing the poetry of the sevening of the soup , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world industrialized has to be 300 years .
And that is a story not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we &apos;re going to get to go .
When these miriades of cultures are asked what you want to say to be human , they say , with 10,000 vices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all refed the chance of being what we are : a kind of conscious species , which is that we have to have all the people and all the gift can fill .
I &apos;ve taken this on the end of Baffin the island of Baffin , and this man , and this man , and this man , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya story of his grandmother .
The government government is not always been gentile with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50 to push our premate , and we have to them in colonies .
The grandmother of this man refed to go .
The family , I would take the life , and I took all my life , and all his actual attractions .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t get the cold ,
The skins of the slites in origin in origin in in the rows of of caribes .
The grandmother of this man did not intimix by the night or the byelded of the byard that was suffered .
It &apos;s sgaps , it &apos;s housed the pantalons in the pantalons of the pantaled in your hand . When the did it , they have been congeled , and they work with a lama .
It has been salive on the punishment of this cold cold , and when it became a dog .
It &apos;s soud the dog and created a briddaughter , with the clower , has a slitta , and it &apos;s sat , and it &apos;s sat , and it &apos;s sat , the bank , and it &apos;s setting it .
We want to talk about horse with anything ? &#91; Ris&#93; And this , in different ways , &#91; Applauses &#93; is the symbols of the Inuit and of all the people of the Inuit and all the indees of the world .
In the coral 1999 , the government government reminded to Inuit the total control of an territory of California and Texas ,
It &apos;s their new patria . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a independent territory . They &apos;re all the mineral resources .
One splendit example of how a natione-state could rerereed with his people .
And , to end , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious to the who of us was in these remote remote of the planet , you realize that they don &apos;t have any remote .
For somebody &apos;s home .
They open the human imagination that they &apos;re going to get the alba of the time . And for us all of these children , as the sun of our children , they become part of the well-geography of hope .
And to end , we have to National Geographic , we have to have to be any .
We believe that the polemics --
&#91; Applauses are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we have the better institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month our website , we have 35 million visited .
156 country , we put our dog television .
Our results are layers from millions of people .
Our work is travel in the hetsphere to bring our public public in places of wonderful and cultural , which is to be able to be in the central of the world , and you hope , to get the central reveal in the central exist of the exist in the exist of the exist in life , and we have to find a style of life in a world , and the covering of the world , and we have we have to find a style in life of the world .
where the saggee of all people can contribute to our well-being .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope you &apos;ve heard and I &apos;ll find out of evidence , in case not notice .
I want to start what I call &quot; the &quot; dogram . &quot;
The dogram official ?
The dogram official society . The West is the west of West , &quot; the official official society . &quot; If we want to massive the well-being . &quot; The way to do it is massive . &quot;
The reason is , from a side side side , in fact that the freedom is in the value , useful , and exexist for human beings .
On the other one is in fact that if we are lifeed , each of us can be able to do everything that massive our well-being , without no one that decide in our name .
The way to massimize freedom is massive to choice .
The more choices , more are more libing , and more is their freedom , more is their freedom , is their well-being .
This is so deeply rown in in society that nobody would have drew it in the society that nobody would be a drew in .
And it &apos;s also deeply rown in our lives .
I &apos;ll show you some examples of what progress is to be possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not big .
I hope I put a simple notice on the minds for injumped .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without contact the 10 variety of olium extreme of the whom of the wherever you can buy to make you a huge number of people who you can buy to make you a huge number of people in the incess of 175 .
Here &apos;s the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic store : they put a cumb , houses , the CD , radio , plastra , fairly .
And in this single store , there &apos;s a big number of audio .
We can make six million different combinations using the components that there are a store .
You have to put that there is a very much choice .
Altri camps : the world of communications .
once I was a child , they could get all the phone phone phone phone , and the pat that they were supposed to be dayed by mom Bell .
They were nurch the phone , it didn &apos;t buy it .
One of that , in the other , was that the phone never made .
These times are time .
We now now have a almost observed of phone phone , especially between phones .
Here &apos;s the future .
My favorite is in a middle , and MP3 , coveres MP3 , coveres of the hidden , and forces for the cryppping .
If you don &apos;t have seen in the store under the store , you &apos;re very certain that I &apos;ll get it .
And what is the end of the end is that people get in the store and does this question , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the same explosial of choices .
And it &apos;s healthcare : not going to happen in the U.S. that you &apos;re going to go from the doctor and the doctor and the doctor .
Instead , you know , you know , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do a , or B , &quot; A , &quot; A B &quot; A , &quot; B , &quot; B has these benefits and these benefits . &quot; You know , what you want to do you ? &quot;
Tu : &quot; Dr. &quot; &quot; Dr. , what would I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A has these benefits and these risks , and B has these benefits and these benefits . &quot;
What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebits , &quot; Dr. if she was me , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor : &quot; But I &apos;m not . &quot;
The result of the result of the maled , expression that it does like a good thing .
But it &apos;s not that one of moving fish and the responsibility of the ability to take decisions from somebody who knows something , and it &apos;s the doctor , to something that doesn &apos;t know , and it &apos;s not about about it , and it doesn &apos;t know , and it doesn &apos;t know , and it doesn &apos;t have a certain way of the patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing of products , directly in people like me and you , which if you think you think about it , you think it &apos;s not , because that if you think you can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why they advert them ?
The answer is that they want to ask the doctor to ask the doctor to ask them .
Something that is the one of what is our identity is a question of choice , as you see in this vignant , &quot; We don &apos;t want to forget the kids .
And we can reinventing us .
The means that every morning , you have to get to the guy that you want to be .
I &apos;m going to the family and the matrimonium , a long time the common perspective , it almost for anyone , was that was that you setting up the most preserve to get the more preserve .
The only real choice was with who , not when and it &apos;s not when and it &apos;s doing after .
Oat , everything is really to play .
I write about students very smart , and I &apos;m going to be 20 percent in a long job .
And it &apos;s not not because they are less brilliant , because they &apos;re not not because they are less diligents .
but why are I &apos;m imposed to ask you , &quot; I should be going to get it ? I would say , &quot; I do it ? &quot;
&quot; I should I get to spost ? I think before children or the career ? &quot;
I &apos;m interrogative logorants .
And they &apos;re trying to answer these questions , even if this implica doesn &apos;t have a good voice and not get a good voice to get a nice voice .
And they have to do that .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , as Carl subject , because technology is it allows us to work every minute , every day , from every day , from every angle of the planet , except from Hotel Randolph .
I have a parentesesesesesesesesesesesesesesesesesesestimate .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want I want to use it .
What means , this amazing is of the reason that we have about the work ? It &apos;s that we have to continuously decide , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our child play with the phone , with the cell cell phone in a pack , the Blackberry , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the note .
And even if I &apos;m all spend , every minute that we see our child roving , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; I &apos;m going to answer this ? &quot;
&quot; I want to answer this email ? I got this letter ? &quot;
And when the answer is &quot; no , &quot; No , &quot; that makes the experience of your son &apos;s partnership .
So , from any of all you look at , little things and the life is a question of choices .
And once the world was this : Yeah , there were some possibilities , but it wasn &apos;t a question of choice .
The world of today is what &apos;s about this : The world &apos;s a good thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Seply .
The positive colcold , we all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative .
All of this is two negative of two negative negative negative in people .
The first , paradoxically , is that produced paralysis that it &apos;s going .
And with a lot of options that choose , becomes very difficult to do it .
I give you a significance example : a significance study of the fairly pushing .
A my colleague has been in the data of Vanangigantic society , the gigantic society of a million clients in 2,000 different companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offering in more , the percentage of two percent .
With 50 percent of offering , there &apos;s 10 percent in less than adesions when they are available to it . Why ?
Because with 50 source of which is choose , is bad hard to decide , and the choice is reported to the intimate , and the choice is .
And in the orders , and still in the ororders , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , and they &apos;re still going to get .
You know that it doesn &apos;t only means that these old people are going to be enough money , you &apos;re going to say that the decision is so so that they &apos;re going to say that the decision is so so that they lose the source of the dator .
They &apos;re not going to participating , they &apos;re going to be a year from the dator of work , which would be very disposted to it .
So the paraliis a consequence of the way .
And I think that &apos;s the world .
&quot; And to end , for the eternity : ketchup , or the heternity , or the maionese ? &quot;
You want to take the right decision , if it &apos;s for the eternity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and yet the wrong .
So that &apos;s the first effect . The second is that if we can evooke the way , we &apos;re less soud , we &apos;re less soud in fact , we &apos;re less sation-on the result of how we would choose .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of people who choose choose , and it &apos;s not perfect , is easy to imagine that you could do a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us to the housex , and the filled to the deminds of choice , and the filled deeping the depth , and the filled demination of the demonstring , and the fastest deaths of these is that it &apos;s going to be able .
even when it was a good decision .
The more choices there are , more is easy to unhappy .
And so there is what economists call a cost-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has been very good stamine as the value that we get to the things that we get the things that we are .
And so , when there are a lot of options , it &apos;s easy to representing the characteristic characteristic of alternative and being less sweden .
Here &apos;s a example . I use it with all those that are not in New York .
But it &apos;s what you probably think you &apos;re probably thinking .
There is this copy of Hamptons .
A place of luser .
Spip splendida . Ottttttles . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not a way . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , &quot; Well , it &apos;s Agust . &quot;
&quot; Everybody in Manhattan are . &quot;
&quot; I could parking up . &quot;
And it &apos;s two weeks on the idea that is lost -- every day -- the ability to be a chance of parking where you want .
The costo-opportunity deminds the sweaf for what we have , even when the choice was ecuck .
And more options that we have to look at , more the most options that we &apos;re going to be a containing of the cos-opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
It &apos;s about the moment , and maybe of the living .
But the most important point is that anything you choose , you can &apos;t do the other .
The things that we don &apos;t choose to do a lot of actual actual acacaent what we do .
I think about the point : spiral to grow .
I tried to my skin bought a new new jeans .
I &apos;m almost always jeans .
And you know , the jeans were just a kind of like , they bought them , they were scomode , only after they had them to go to a life and he had a lot of times , they started to go to good .
So I went to buy a couple of new when the old who were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
The commit said , &quot; I want to give you a fit , simple fit , relaxed ? &quot;
You want to do with the certain certain of the cles ? &quot;
&quot; Li want to struggle ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m going to take them or stretch ? BBBe , &quot; Continule &quot;
I was slower , and after a little bit I could say , &quot; I want the guy that -- which was the one of &quot; He had no idea what was , so for a now I tried to all the people who were sick , and then out of the store , and then it out of the jeans that I &apos;ve ever had .
It was the very very . With the whole choice .
But I felt worst .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse that I was that with all of that choice , my jeans had to be perfect .
I was the beginning of minime . I didn &apos;t expected any except when it was a kind of time , but when you saw 100 different , a kind of a few , at least a kind of a perfect thing .
What I had to get was good , but not perfect .
And then I started the chososed that I was insodly to the waiting for expectations .
The adding options in life of people don &apos;t do that increase the expectations that these have to the options of the same options .
And this is going to make less sweaf , even when the results are good .
No one in the world of marketing is to it .
Because if they knew , you don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more about that .
&quot; Yes , &quot; he was better when you were worst , &quot; The reason he was better when it was worse that when you were worst to meet the surprised of the surprising .
Other , in the world where we live -- opultimate , industrialized adines with the expectative of the perfeedition that we can hope is that things are in the althetic of expectations .
You can &apos;t have to pleased because your expectations , my expectations , you &apos;re ingigantite .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Bosososes . &quot;
I mean , I mean , little authographic author -- which I really sposted and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t get me .
But it &apos;s not always a good thing .
And then , a consequence of a couple of jeans , and you know , it &apos;s just that kind of jeans is that when you &apos;re not sweet , and you ask , &quot; Why ? &quot; Why ? &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is a responsible ? &quot;
The world is the responsible . What could you do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a insodly , and you ask you who is the responsible , and you ask the response , is so that the responsible .
You could do better .
And with hundreds of variety , there are no suse for the insuccess .
So when people get decisions , even though the result is , if you get the result is , they feel insweden , and they &apos;re going to get the cold of them .
In the last years , the depression is exploded in the world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this willing is that people have experiences in the standard , because the standard standard are too alty .
And when they have to explain this that the cold is their own .
So the final result is that in general , but we feel worse .
Let me remember that .
This is the official dogram , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely four-. It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no double of a little bit of choice is better than a little choice is better than a little choice is better than a little choice .
There is a critical value , magic value . I don &apos;t know what .
But I &apos;m sure we have to a piece of level where the choices are going to make our life .
Now , from the political point -- I &apos;ve been finished -- from the political point of view , the nocle is the following .
What it allows all this to the industrial society is the weight .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not there there there .
The problem is that there are too paid .
So the thing I &apos;m talking about is a bad bad bad to be in modern n n n society , rerequired that society society .
And what makes you depressing and array is this : Steve Levitt talked about how those expensive and comods are . It &apos;s a spapes of money .
I mean , I mean , I mean , it &apos;s not that they are just just initional .
I &apos;m a deleterie .
They do they make worst .
If a little bit of what in our society allows , it was revered in those where people are too few possibilities , it would not only be their life to improve but our .
This is what economists call a better better better .
One of the income of income , right to all of the poor -- because of this choice in exception that we go .
And to end , &quot; Fille , you can become everything that you want to get everything you . &quot;
You know , people , you think , &quot; But what do you think about what ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t get anything in a glass of glass . &quot;
&quot; A imagination of a very limited vision of the world -- &quot;
I &apos;ve been in the beginning .
But then I think about , instead , I realized that that fish can be what the long .
Because the reality of the reality of the fact is that if you &apos;re loud , so that &quot; everything is possible . &quot; You don &apos;t good . &quot;
If you take the bocol in a way that everything divents can dimines the sweden dying .
You want to get the paralysis , and you get the well-being .
They all need a sphere .
This is almost almost almost almost almost almost almost for the fish , even for us .
