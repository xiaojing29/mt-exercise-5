Last year , I showed these slide slide to prove that the glacial ice ice , which is almost three million years had the size of the 48 United States , the size of 48 United States , it &apos;s retrofit of 40 percent .
But this underneath the gravity of the problem because it &apos;s not showing the ice ice of the ice .
The arctic calf is , in a sense , the heart of the global climate system .
It &apos;s expanded up and you &apos;re going to be expanded .
The next slide is going to be a carled with the last 25 years .
The glaces have been signed in red .
As you see , they go to the blue dark blue blue .
That &apos;s the ice ice in the winter , which is a summer ice .
You can see that the cosiddle , five or more , is like a blood , which is like a blood , which is here I was in the body .
In 25 years , it was like this ,
This is a problem because the interests interests the interests that are the land land around the arctic ocean where there are enormous amount of fuel fuel , they &apos;re transformed into meters .
I &apos;m going to be able to the total atmospheric pollution , that amount could be doubling , through this point of not return .
In some of the well-founding lagues in Alaska metan is already relief from the water .
The Katey professor Katey Walter University of Alaska has been a team , at the bottom of the Alaska team last winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Wow . The question is if we &apos;re also .
And that &apos;s a reason that this termal exchange the Greenland from North .
This is a river to regime glacial .
The ported the brains never had like that .
This is the Kangerlussuaiming , in the southest of Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea level for the melting of the glaces on on land , here is where the sea .
These currents are increasing rapidly .
On the other side of the planet : Antarctica , the biggest block of ice on the planet .
Last month , the scientists have been depths that the ice is in negative , and the Western Antarctica , which is a particularly hit on some underwater islands , is particularly required to the melt .
It &apos;s six feet of the five feet of the water , like in Greenland .
Sulil Himalayas , the third largest block of ice , you see new lakes , which a few years ago were glaciers .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population revened half of the power of that .
Sulle Any de : this glacier is the source of the power of this city .
The ported is up .
But when it decrees , the same is the same accounts to water .
In California , the snow on the Sierra Nevada has been decrew .
The hyriries are in the crisis .
The predictions , as you read , they &apos;re grave .
The increasing safe in the world leads to a remarkable increasing inceness .
The environmental disaster disaster the environmental disaster and unprecedented .
Four times over many many times , in the last 30 years I was like the 75 years of the time .
This is a kind of unsustainable ,
If you look in the historical context , you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at carefully the area of the Pacific , the Americans , to the West , and on both both parts of the Indian subcontinent , where there is a radical impoverment of oxygen in the ocean .
The highest cause of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossil fuels .
The oil is a problem , and the coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two with most emissions , together to China .
And it was proponates to build lots of other central central centers .
But we &apos;re seeing a change of direction .
These are the annullated projects in the last years and some alternative ways .
At any way , there &apos;s a political struggle in our country .
The industrial industrial and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the fuel , which is a hossymptoms .
That image was reminded me to something --
Verice , in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a loss of 3.8 billion litri waste .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen it on news .
This is the second largest flow of the last flow of America .
It &apos;s happened around Christmas .
The advertising advertising one of the coal industrial .
Video : Happy the carbon is a kind of allegry and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and grow our economy .
Frosty the carbon and it &apos;s more clean .
It &apos;s good , adorable and worthy workers tend to be willing the wild .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest mineral society is Massey Coal . This is his administrator . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I &apos;m going to be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelososy , Harry Reid -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima Protection of Clima .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Attore : At the Woman : At the next thing , we see the climate change as a weightlessly threat our business .
And so for this priorities is to invest a lot of money in a public public and make public public and confused the truth on the coal truth .
In fact , coal is not sports .
We think it &apos;s pulied -- it &apos;s also a good profumo .
So you don &apos;t prefer of climate change .
Let me do with us .
Video : Counce Carbone : Count -- you &apos;ve heard about it .
So we &apos;re going to do a turn into a structure at the avanguard as it &apos;s about pulied .
Straordinarily ! The machines are a little noisy , but this is the sound of the puzzle technology .
The fuel consumption is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology that you see changes everything .
You have a look at this : this is the puzzle technology .
Al Gore : So , the positive alternative is connected to economic question and the economic security .
Video : America is in the crisis ; national security , national security , climate crisis .
The filter that the connection : our dependence from fossil fuels , like the witnessed fuel and oil imported .
Now , though , there &apos;s a new , audences for circles .
Repower : 100 percent cleaned energy , in 10 years .
A plan to re-put America work , make a safe , and help stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that I drink to solve our problems .
Repower .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It &apos;s about re-energy to America .
One of the faster ways of brings to the dependence from the fuel that killing our planet .
Comparsa : The future is here . Very , sun , a new energy network .
Comparsa : two : New aging aging for good job .
Complplplan : Repower . It &apos;s time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old African lunch , say , &quot; If you want to go fast , you go from the fast .
If you want to go away , you go together . &quot;
We have to go far , fast .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I introduction in the LHC .
And you can get back to the back to you how the car works .
So I &apos;m doing here . And for those that the other time there were not , LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever attempt -- 27 kilometers of circumconference .
His task is to rear the conditions that were there less than a billionth of a second at the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
This is just environmental .
This is the car under Ginevra .
And I photographs these mini-Big Bang in the detector .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLATLATLATLATLATLEO .
This is an ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLAS in building so you can see the proportions .
The 10 secret of the last year , we have a car for the first time .
And this is taken from ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLAS
It was because of immense flew in in the control waste .
It &apos;s a picture of particles that had done all over the LHC , and getting into the LHC , deliberately , with a part of the LHC , and spreading particles inside the detector .
In other words , when we saw that 10 secember September , we realized that the machine worked , which is a great vittory .
I don &apos;t know if it was this was going to be exulating more or this , when somebody went to Google and saw that the initial page was this .
That means we had a cultural impact beyond that scientific impact on the scientific way .
About a week later , there was a problem with the car , had to be a problem with the car , and they &apos;re doing this .
These files 13,000 ampampampbs when the car works at the very most power .
Now , the technical between you will look at the filters and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . They &apos;re films too good . &quot;
And they can do it because when they &apos;re very cold of become the deaths of the files .
So , at least 271 degrees , at least , at the lower temperature of the space between stars , these filters can bring that current .
In one of the giuntures between the most new magnets in the LHC , there was a defect of fabrication .
So the files surrise files , and 13,000 ampamparized a sudden met a electronic resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think these magnets fish are more than 20 tons , and that they moved about 30 centimeters .
They &apos;re damaged about 50 magnets .
We had to take them , what we did .
We repristed them and wounded them .
They &apos;re now coming back to their place underground .
I finally got the sea LHC will be a new integrity .
We &apos;re going to be accounting , and we expect to juice or dly , and keep our adventure so we can find out what the morning is the universe .
Now , of course , in some ways , these crashes reaching the debate about the value of science and the frontier engineering . It &apos;s easy to confuture .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so difficult , the fact to go beyond the limits , I think , is this value of things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of a scientist Inglese , Humphrey Davy , who , I guess , in the defense experiments of his cleaner , his pupllo was Michael Faraday , he said , &quot; Nothing is so dangerous for the progress of human mind as well as the reritenheres , that not mysters in nature , which our triumps are complete , and that they &apos;re not a consequent , and that our trust are not mysters ,
Thank you .
I want to start asking about rethinking about when you , you &apos;re playing with children , you play with the morning .
While you were able to get them and grab them , and you know , you know , actually , you learn to think and by doing problems by by capting and manipulating relations .
Now , the spatial reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , by the useful informed by our own interaction with physical objects , together to my consulting objects , together to my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking , &quot; And if , when we &apos;re using a computer , instead of having the only curriculum as a digital polymer , that &apos;s going to be able to move on a desktop , we could say that , &quot; by both the hands ,
and fix it ?
The question was so interesting question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftool , a great interactive computer like a biscope .
In a few words , a Siftool , a great interactive computer like a biscope .
You can move with the hand , they can see them , &quot; they can see their movement and they have a screen and a radio wireless radio .
But most of all , they &apos;re physical objects , like the morning , you can just move into the morning , you can just move it .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physicists , aware of their movement , some of the other , as they become more physicists , as they become more physicists , of the movement , of the other , of how we can explore new and interaction , we can explore new interaction .
I &apos;m going to try to start with some simple example .
This Sifounded is configured to show video : if you &apos;ll get the video : if you start on the other hand , it will rotate on the other side back .
These interactive portraits of interactive portraits .
If I rich them , you &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re going around .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can be agited a little bit .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can be agited a little bit .
They also give their movement and clination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications was the interaction was that we can use common gestures on data , to just put a color on the data , to say , &quot; you &apos;re a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configured like a versus bleap and I can use them to the pour in the central color , where they missing .
and I can use them to pour color in that central , where they mischip .
And we can put it too , we can put a little bit .
There are also beautiful possibilities for learning , like languages , like languages , the mathematics and logic games where people can try things fast , and see the results that immediately .
I &apos;m --
This is a sequence of Fibonacci that I do with a equations program .
Here we have a words that is in the middle of Scarabeo and Boggle .
Basically , at every Turn , you get a letter on every Siftoss , you get a letter to reach a letter on every Siftall , and as you &apos;re trying to compose words , he &apos;s check it on a dictionary .
And then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the children came up to the Media Lab , I &apos;ve been made in a way that I came up and I went a video .
They were very much pleased .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of applied is that you don &apos;t have to give people many instructions .
You just say , &quot; You know , &quot; Compons of words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s the other people who try it .
This is our beta young , the younger test tester , there on the right .
It only wanted to be standing them .
They only were in the morning morning for him .
Now , this is an applied of an interactive charge .
We wanted to build a tool for learning . He &apos;s called the Felix . He &apos;s Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , lifting the Sifmonet------like characters .
It can put new characters in the scene , lifting the Sifmonet------like characters .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : The sun is surprising .
David Merrill : Now he took a treatment in the scene .
Video : The aranancium treatment .
Bobs ! Yeah ! Yeah !
So you sheling the Siftable and put close them can make the characters --
Video : Bau !
by inventing your story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a open story with open , and it can decide him like it .
DM : It &apos;s a open story with open , and it can decide him like it .
Video : Vice , cat it .
DM : The last example that I have time to show you is a tool , to make a recent , to sample and performing music .
it &apos;s a tool , I made of recent , to sample and performing music .
The Siftable here are ags from sounds , the battery .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also put these sounds on a sequence that you can compose to your pleasure .
And it just by doing it by by doing a sound and a sequence .
These are actually you can control from alive , like the reverse and the filter .
The attacks to a particular particular sound and then incline for the foot .
And then there are general effects as time and volume , that you apply to the whole sequence .
Let &apos;s look at how it works .
DM : DM : We &apos;re going to start a very much in two Siftool &quot; sequence , &quot; We put it in a series , we put it in a series , we add on , we add another base .
I &apos;m going to put a line of low .
DM : DM : I &apos;m now adding percussions --
DM : DM : And now I &apos;m going to put the battery , so I can control the effect from alive .
DM : DM : I can reveiling the whole sequence of the whole sequence of time , or from the other .
DM : DM : And now I &apos;m going to add the bottom of the bottom to give more expression .
DM : DM : I can reach the sequence &quot; to the flying flight .
So I didn &apos;t have to plan this first , but I can suddenly , make it a long or more correct .
And now , finally , I can smoking the whole sequence of inclining on the left Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new human-car interfacing interfacing as our brain and more kind of how do it work and a body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some possibilities that we &apos;re trying to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that &apos;s coming up this new generation of objects that we &apos;re going to bring up with digital media , which will bring information in our world that we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time to talk to all of you .
I &apos;m a writer .
I &apos;m going to be a profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the love of my life .
And I don &apos;t look like it .
But , I said , something that was that , especially happened in my life and my career , which led me to get to report the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called &quot; Mangia , &quot; Prega , &quot; which , diversely from my previous books , for some reason came out in the world and became a great feeling , a sweet , interational , for interational .
And the result is that everywhere now , people treat me like I was convicted .
It &apos;s true --
They come from me now and say , &quot; Do you have no fear to do you not feed than ?
You don &apos;t fear to keep write all of life without being able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can matter ? &quot;
what can you care about someone ? &quot;
It &apos;s reassuring , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember that I remember that over 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was a adolescent -- I was a little bit -- I wanted to be a writer .
I would go to the same reaction based on the fear .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t I &apos;m not afraid to be able to success ?
You don &apos;t afraid that the billionlililililililife-fted refer you ?
You have no fear to do this mestimates all of life without anything that you &apos;ve ever come out and to die on a cumb of setting it with the mouth package of failures ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is : &quot; Yeah . &quot;
Yeah , I &apos;m afraid of all of those things .
I always had afraid .
And I also have afraid of many other things that people can &apos;t ininate .
How the algae and other things that are very friendly .
But , as I was write what I thought and I was asking myself myself , why is it ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s rational that anyone should expect to be afraid of being afraid by a job that you had to do .
But what is that special in the creative companies that have to be nervous about the mental health as a way that other careers don &apos;t do ?
How my father was a father , he was an engineer and I don &apos;t remember one time in his 40 years of activity in which was asked if he was an engineer ?
There was never -- that stuck of the engineer John , how does it go ?
It didn &apos;t work that , you know ?
Onestly , chemical engineers don &apos;t have certainly , in the centuries , in the reputation of being alcohit .
We have a writers , we have a little bit of this reputation , and not just creative writers , but we have this reputation of being enormous instables .
And it doesn &apos;t remaining that look for the sad of the magnifts of creative magnifts that only in the 20th century , died , they &apos;re going to die , and often in their hand .
And the ones that don &apos;t have suicked to be really disconnected by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , &quot; Each of my book has been killed me a little more . &quot; A remarkable to the work of your life .
But we don &apos;t throw it when we feel saying why we &apos;ve heard these things so long that somehow we completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and the suffering are in some ways , and that argue are always at the corner , at the end , will always constrained to the corner .
And the question I want to ask everybody here today is : you agree with this idea ?
It &apos;s good for you , because it also looking at a centimeter to me , it &apos;s not good for anything to me .
I think it &apos;s hdious .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous , and I don &apos;t want to see it in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our great creative minds to live .
And certainly I know that , in my case -- in my case -- in my situation -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous , and you give the circumstances in which I &apos;m in my career .
That -- you know , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m kind of like 40 years old .
I &apos;ve still got about four job of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that everything I &apos;m going to write about now in the world as the work that came out after the world as the work that came out after the last book .
I &apos;m going to be schied , because we &apos;re all more or less friends here -- it &apos;s likely to my own own own own own spread .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that &apos;s leads to a person to start drink in the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would keep going to keep doing this work that we love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it seems to me , after many reflections , that the way to work to continue write is to create a real psychological , OK ?
I have to some way to find a security distance between me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxiety of which is going to be , as I was going to look for all over time , trying to find other societies , to look for other societies , to see if they could have some of the best ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthy ideas .
how to help people manage to manage the emotional reverse of creativity .
And that research brought me to the ancient Great and ancient Rome .
I do do it because I come back to a circle and then it back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
They thought creativity was this spirit look at the divine and that came to men from a few distinct and unknown for men somewhere disdisorder and unknown .
The Great us call these spirits divine creativity .
Socrate , wonderful , he believed to have a demon that elargive ,
Romani were the same idea , but they call that kind of a spirit without a genius .
which is great , because the Romans didn &apos;t really think a genius were kind of smart particularly intelligent .
They believed that a genius was this kind of divine that was living in literally in the walls of an artist , a little bit like the artist , a little like the elsewhere , you know , the elevening the work of the artist and modeling the outcome of that work .
Here &apos;s a big eye--------of-building that is , that psychological construct that you protect from your work .
And everybody knew it was so that it worked , right ?
So the antic artists were protected from certain things , like the too narcies , like , you know , not ?
If your job was exceptional you couldn &apos;t take it all the deserves , everybody knew that you were helped by this genius .
If your failure job , it was not all your fault work , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a unable .
And so people have the creed creativity in the West for a long time .
And then the Rended Rended and everything changed , and it was born this great idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe on the center of the universe on the top of the mitics and no longer to let the mitched detached space .
This was the principle of the rational humanity and people started to think that creativity came out of idivided .
And for the first time in history , you start this one or that artist as a kind of genius as a kind of genius , rather than a person with the genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big error .
I think that allow someone , a simple person to believe that you can be as a recipient , like the source and the source of all the divine mysteries , creative , unknown and unknown , unknown and unknown and etheless and a real responsibility for human fragile peable to give the fragile pic to human psyc .
It &apos;s like to ask someone to enjoy the sun .
It &apos;s a pretty distores and completely distores and it &apos;s a lot of these ingestiestible expectations on performance .
And I think it was a pressure to have destroyed artists in the passed 500 years .
And , if that &apos;s true , and I think that is , the question is , and now ?
Can we do it diversity ?
Maybe you go back to a more ancient human relationship between humans and mystery creative .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t take 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience who would be legitimate scientific suspects on the notion of , so you do , do they follow their own their own projects .
I &apos;m probably not going to convince you all about this thing .
But the question I want to ask is -- why isn &apos;t it ?
Why don &apos;t you think of it ?
Because it has more sense of everything that I &apos;ve ever heard to explain the explanation of the creative process .
A process that , as anyone ever tried to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- you know , you don &apos;t understand rationally .
And in fact , it can sometimes seem completely paranormatic .
I &apos;ve been this unmeeting recently with the extraordinary Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years old , but it was a very poetry for all life and told me that during his own childhood in the rural Virginia , working in the camps , and it felt in if when a poetry came from the landscape .
He told me that it was like a fragorous train .
And that was going to round to be round of her landscape .
It was to be , because it was to make the land under his feet .
He knew that you had one thing to do at that point and it was , words , &quot; run like a matta . &quot;
And it was going to go to home and he was going to be followed by this poetry , and not have to take a piece of paper and a match enough enough , as the transplant , and it would collect it and grab it on the page .
Other time you couldn &apos;t be fast enough , so correct and correcrect and he had to be able to get into home and her poetry and get the rolling , and she would continued to rolling through the landscape , trying to , as she said , &quot; another poet . &quot;
And then there were those times -- this piece I don &apos;t forforget -- there were moments where it was almost lost , right ?
So , he was running home and he was trying to paper and paper and poetry to get through , and he said , he was going to go , and then he said , he was like you hit with the other hand and the hand .
It was the poetry from the tail and reported it in his body and transmitted on the page .
And in these cases , poetry would be presented on the perfect page , but the contrary , from the last word to the first .
So when I was thinking -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly the same as I was thinking .
Not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conduction !
I &apos;m a mulo , and my way to work is ; I &apos;m wake up to the same orary every day and go and go and go over the himself and work and move on on the himself .
But even , in my testardaggin my testablished against that thing , sometimes .
And I guess a lot of you are the han made .
You know , even if the work and ideas came to me from a certain source , you can &apos;t be honestly .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it in a way to not have the head , but rather , what do we do with healthy ?
As I &apos;m about , the best example I have is the best example of the music that I have is a musician of a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life was the incarnation of the artist tormented , trying to control , management , to be able to control , to be able to be able to be completely interestingly interacted .
But then I was invecked , he hot , and one day he was driving on a highway in Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
He was going to be fast and all of a very good trawling this little framment of melody , coming in in in his head like inspiration , and hallecutilize and halleckle , and the desider , but it doesn &apos;t know how to get it .
It doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a pencil .
So it starts to feel this kind of old anxiety , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to go and I &apos;m going to go on from this very even .
I &apos;m not good enough , and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to the panic , it stopped .
And he put the whole whole mental process and made something completely new .
He just looked at the sky and said , &quot; Sorry , don &apos;t you see what I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; You know , &quot; Do you think that can write a song ?
If you really want to exist , it &apos;s coming back at a more hurt when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , you &apos;re going to be able to bring somebody else today .
You can disturbing Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his work process changed after this .
Not the job , the job was still dark as always always .
But the process , and the fish anxiety that was released to the genius , the genius out of him , the genius that came out of him , and liberated it back from where the problems , and liberated it back from where , they came to realize that it wasn &apos;t interorized and hurt .
but it &apos;s not a peculiar , wonderful bizarre , collaboration with a Tom and this strange thing that was not Tom .
So , how I felt that story started to change a little bit as I was working on and already saved me once .
This idea , I was saved to me when &quot; Mangation , &quot; Prega , &quot; and fall into one of those despair of the despair where we &apos;re all working on and we &apos;re working on something and we don &apos;t have , and you start thinking that will be a disaster , which is the worst book .
Not just good , just the worst book writing .
And I began to think of of how to throw this project .
But I was reminded of Tom that was talking to the air and I tried .
So I got up to my face on the manoscritical and I was getting my comments to a vacuum on the room .
And I said to high voices , &quot; See , what we know , both know , if this book is not going to be right , not going to be good , not ?
Because I &apos;m going to see , I &apos;m putting all I have , I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to present you and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , you don &apos;t do it , you know , I don &apos;t do it , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know what , you know , you know , you know , you don &apos;t .
I &apos;m going to talk to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I would please be recorded that I was today to do my part . &quot; Because -- finally , it &apos;s like this , OK -- -- centuries ago in North Africa people had rown together for the dances of moon , dances and music that were going on to go on hours and until the high .
And they were always magnifts because the dancers were professional and were wonderful .
But every very much , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became really transmitted .
And I know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know what you &apos;re all , to a certain point , a performance like this .
It was like the time stopped , and the dancing walks through a kind of portal and not been doing anything else else , usually , like the 1,000 noticed , but it was all of them in .
And suddenly , not just as a human .
But it turns out to divinity and below in the lighting fire .
And when this was successful , at the time , people knew what was , they called him called him .
They had their hands and start singing , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , God , &quot; God , &quot; God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
I &apos;m not a historical notes -- when the invest Moring Southern Southern , there was this habits with them and the ready to change in the centuries from &quot; Allah , Allah , &quot; Allah , &quot; which you can still hear in the corride or in the corride or flarenco .
In Spain , when a artist has made something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , the guy , Allah , I &apos;m a great good , &quot; uncomprehensible , &quot; unable , &quot; uncomprehensive , &quot; unable . &quot;
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes up day after , for the dancer itself , when you wake up and you see that are the 11 in the morning of Martedday and the God &apos;s not there .
It &apos;s just a very bad , with very bad to the ginocnees , and maybe it &apos;s not going to each one to that altitude .
And maybe no one will dog the name of God still while it , and what &apos;s going to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most sweet rere-pining reconciliations to do in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so correct if you don &apos;t believe , you know , the most extraordinary aspects of your being being being being .
But it just credit you are in soon a very unimaginable source of this team of your life that team you have to go to someone else when you &apos;re finished .
And , you know , if we think of this way it changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s certainly like I thought about it for several months during the working working on on the book that I &apos;m going to be soon , the dangerous , which is very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel electrized from this is , not to be afraid .
Not last you . It &apos;s just your job .
And it goes on to you presented for your side , whatever it can be .
If your job is dance , you &apos;re dancing , it &apos;s dancing .
If the divine , absurd genius , it &apos;s a decide to leave some of wonderful wonderful , for just a moment through your effort , then &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Otherwise , you do the same dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to you the same .
I think , and I think you have to teach it .
&quot; Ole ! &quot; &quot; &quot; to you know the same , even for having human love and testables to do so so that you will present a continuously .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
You know I &apos;ve talked about some of these of the human genome projects on what it can mean and the discovery of new genes .
We &apos;re starting a new process : we started digitize biology and now starting from that digital code , we &apos;re coming in in a new biology phase , we &apos;re coming in a new biology , designing and synthesizing life .
We always tried to ask big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; is something that many biologists do I think have trying to figure out to see various levels .
We tried different approaches , and we had a lot of different approaches .
We &apos;re digitize for almost 20 years ever .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the analogy world &apos;s biology in the digital world .
Now , we ask , we can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome between those who can self-self-oreplicated lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit more small .
We can actually eliminate a hundred genes of the 500 of the genes of the 500 that are here .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our .
I think , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it &apos;s very unlikely to bring to a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to design was synthesize this chromosome in a way that we could change the components to ask some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of &quot; &quot; can we synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Can you have the chemical chemical consensus that we never have been able to create before ?
And in case , we can do a chromosome , can we make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of inherent chemical material .
The speed with which we are able to digitize life is growing up to exponential rhythm .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , design , rather slowly , but it &apos;s improving .
And our most recent results the results on a exponential curve .
We went to 15 years ago .
The process has required a lot of passages , starting with a bioethic review before experiments .
But we found that that synthesize DNA is is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that produce small segments of DNA , the long length of 30 to 50 letters and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the most errors are .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these fragments and correct the errors .
And this was our first trial , starting from the digital information from the genome of Phi 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , we &apos;ve got the fragments of the errors and get a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of inherent inert and we put it into bacteria , and we put it into the bacteria , they &apos;re starting to read this genetic code and make viral particles .
The viral particles have been released by cells , come back and they &apos;ve been back and they &apos;re destroying the Ecoli .
I talked about recently with the members of the oil industry to say they &apos;re certainly understood that model .
They have been on the one of you .
We think this is a situation where the software can actually actually build its own hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in the largest things .
We wanted to build the whole chromosome of the bacteria .
They &apos;re more than 580 mila letters .
So we thought we &apos;re going to build it in the cassette of the virus , so that we can change the cassette to understand what the components of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the first time in 1995 , it was a mistake for every 10 mies .
We found , resequencing it , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence we never have been able to work .
One part of the process is to design segments 50 letters that overwhelming with all the other segments of 50 letters to build smaller than small subunits .
We &apos;re going to take together together here .
You &apos;ve probably read that we put the pyeline .
Think of it , we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters together code about 20 amminds , and there &apos;s a specific order to letters for each ammining for each ammers .
So we can use the genetic code to write , frasass , thoughts .
What we did at the beginning was self-roughly repair .
Some people have been delused by the fact that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
We designed these segments to be able to just join with enzymes .
There are some of the four-stopped , and they put them together .
And we started assembling parts , starting with the parts , starting with the window , starting with a half a letters , so that we can make a segments of 24 mila letters to them to the time to get to 72 mila letters .
At each step , we made these segments in abundance so we could sequence it because we &apos;re trying to create a very very robust process -- as you &apos;re going to see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this looks like the tellon a baskin a baskin .
When we get to these very long segments , over 100 mies , more than 100 mies , no longer will grow directly in the E.
You get to the modern molecular biology .
So we &apos;ve seen other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called the ination homological rewards , which in biology has been using to repair DNA that can join the DNA that can unit .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus , can absorb three million rad of radiation .
You can see in the upper riquitoes like his chromosome is destroyed .
In 12 , 24 hours it &apos;s reassembled exactly like it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do this .
These organisms you can be completely completely .
They can live under vacuum .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life exist in space , and you can find new environments of water .
Actually , NASA showed that this is happening .
This is a molecule image that we built using these processes , just using the yeast with design appropriate design appropriate with the design appropriate design appropriate .
The yeast , hit it it up .
This image was not taken with a electric microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It &apos;s a so big molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that coprone period of about six seconds .
This is the publishing that we did a little time ago .
They &apos;re more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the biggest molecule molecule that &apos;s ever made by man .
It has a very high high-speed molecular weight .
If we &apos;re going to be a package 10 without spacecraft , you want to be 142 pages only to transform this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ? How can we attract it ?
Of course , you &apos;re going to be a game .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s easier even when it is eucarily cells like our : you can just get the nuclear , and put another , which is basically the process of cloning .
In the archaea bacterium , but we &apos;ve been recently demonstrated that we &apos;re able to do a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another and to activate it .
We cleaned a chromosome from a kind of microbial species .
The two are different than men from mice .
We added some gene more in way we can decide what to choose for this chromosome .
And then it melted with the enzymes so that it &apos;s made it by killing all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was astonishing -- and you &apos;re open our graph graph , the new chromosome is -- the new chromosome is gone into the cell .
And we thought we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to get us over there .
This is one of the majority mechanisms .
We found that a lot of these species have added up a second or a third chromosome somewhere , I &apos;m going to add in a second thousands of new traits to that species .
So those who think about evolution as one gene once you change doesn &apos;t really understand much biology .
There are enzymes called the remarkable restriction enzymes that even digest DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell not possible one .
The phone -- the chromosome that we put it it up .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other chromosome as a material , the mastyle , and we found us with only the cell and the new chromosome .
it &apos;s gone blue because of the genes that we put .
And in a short time , all of all the characteristics of a species , they have gone so , and it turned around a new species , based on the new software that we put into a cell .
All the proteins have changed , members have changed , and when we read the genetic code exactly what we &apos;ve moved to the genetic code exactly what we transffed you .
Now , this might seem genetic alchemy , but by allowing the DNA can we change the stuff in a very substitute .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that here is not about genesis -- but progress from three million years and a half years of evolution , and I said , maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion this digital process .
Why do you do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty obvious when we think about our necessity .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
I was born for example : I was born in 1946 .
There are three people on the planet for each other in the existing one in 1946 ; 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medicine and well-like , medical and well-like , six billion and a half billion people .
It will be even more hard to do it for nine billion .
We &apos;re going to use more than 30 billion barrels , more than 30 billion barrels .
That means 100 million barrels a day .
When I &apos;m trying to find biological processes , or whatever kind of process to replace them , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to realize all the CO2 emission from these materials that end up in the atmosphere .
At the day , because of the scientific discovery in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think , that are designed for the future .
The electronic industry , only only only one dozen about the dozen things that came out .
Our limits here are principle data from the biological reality and from the reality of our imagination .
Now we have techniques , because of these methods methods of synthesizing , that we call a combinatory genomics .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think of the processing these 20 million different genes or to try to optimize the processes to produce optimize processes , new vaccines , we can change , because of a little team , and create more molecular biology now that in the last 20 years .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemical production or chemical vaccines ,
This is an instantanetic of some software programmed that we &apos;re working to be able to sit and design species on the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know necessarily , we don &apos;t know how they &apos;ll be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
We &apos;re focusing on the fourth generation .
You also seen you that extract ethanol from the grain was a final experiment .
We have depending on the third generation that will be used enough to be soon soon soon by the zuccher , like the opping or different kinds of butanol .
But the only way biology can have a great impact without increasing the cost of food and limlimestone of the cost of food and just the available available , so we &apos;re working to design cells that can achieve this purpose , and we think we can have the early coal impact quarter in about 18 months .
The solar light combined with CO2 is a metodo--- but in our discoveries around the world , we found different metods .
This is a organism that we described in 1996 .
It &apos;s in the deep ocean , about 2,500 feet deep deep to the ebulllizes of water .
It creates meters from CO2 using using molecular hydrogen as energy source .
We &apos;re trying to understand whether we can incanaling the CO2 , which can easily be transported through the CO2 in fuel , to drive this process .
So , short , we might be able to increase what the question of &quot; what life is , &quot; is we have a real real , we have the right goal to replace the whole oil industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can &apos;t do it from TED ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working on to use the same methods to create instantanem vaccines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with the influence , we &apos;re always forth of a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s about find the right .
I think that you can change by building combinable vaccines in anticipe .
Here &apos;s how the future might start seem to change , now , the tree of evolution , accelling evolution with synthetic bacteria , arches , and finally cells .
We &apos;re so much like we have to improve people .
Our purpose is to do in a way to try to make it . Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the faster , some fundamental work , in the new technology that we brought to the Microsoft in the purchase , nearly a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s a environment where you can interact with is local level that remoited with a huge amount of visual data .
Here we &apos;re seeing a lot of digital shiring of digital pictures with a kind of a kind of continuous , for a very quickly , for a very quickly , in the images as we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much the amount of information that we see , how big they &apos;re collected of data or the images .
Most of the are common photographs , but this is for example is a scan that is a kind of a scan from the Library of Congress , and it comes into the gamma of 300 megapiel .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that limits the presents of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen at any moment . It &apos;s also a very flexible architecture .
This is a whole , example of the data doesn &apos;t have images .
This is the Dickens &apos;s desolate of Dickens . Every colonna represents a chapter .
To prove that it &apos;s just about the textbook and not of images , we can do something like that , to actually see that it &apos;s a real representation of the heads , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a little artificial way to read a electronic book .
I don &apos;t recommend it .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s a number of The Guardian .
Every big image is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading the real caracy version of a magazine or a everyday , which is for a midst of a mid-pler , which is for a midst of a mixed ,
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the Guardian .
We created a well-resolution advertising -- much higher than what you use in a normal publishing one that you use in a normal publishing .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate space limits of space on the screen .
And I hope that this means that you put the people and to bring together with some similar , not to be necessary .
Of course , mapapapart is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say that we have contributed to give you even in this field .
These are all the roads in the United States overwhelming geospace image of NASA .
So now we spend something else .
This is actually from living on the Web ; you can go and see it .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which is a project that &apos;s about two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research that &apos;s very interesting computer made by Noah Snavely , a student at the University of Washington , with Steve Seitz of Microsoft Rick Szeliski &apos;s Microsoft Research . It &apos;s great collaboration .
And it &apos;s from the living on the web , I was running from Seadragon .
You can see this when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from one image to the other and have this kind of experience to multiple it .
But the spacecraft of images here actually a meaning .
The algorithms of the computer visualization has these images together , so that correspond to these pictures together , so that the imagination -- all over to the lakes -- all over the neighborhood lakes -- they &apos;re taken . Here are some of the element of a slides , and these things are all connected . So , here you see the element of the slides a little bit of a slides or a film , and these things are all connected .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more spacecraft .
I want to spend directly directly to one of Noah-original data set , and this is from a very early prototype of Photosynthrowth -- to show you what I think is the key behind this technology , Photosynthynthes . And it &apos;s not necessarily obviously by looking at the environments that we put in in the website . And it &apos;s not necessarily obvious by looking at the environments that we have put in the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and said .
This is a reconstruction of Nothrethreat Dame Tell images from Flickr Flickr . Bauct , and you get images of these kinds of maggeters , and you get images of these samounts , and he said . You have a picture that was discovered that it was that it was that it was discovered to appeared to this model .
So they &apos;re all images taken from Flickr and they &apos;ve been all connected to spatial level in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to igate this very simple way .
You know , I would never have thought of fining working for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifying to receive this kind of accounts here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s about a lot of different kinds of phones of phones : from the ones of those cell cell phone professional SLR , a significant , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to try and try those more strange .
Many blocks from the faces , etc .
Somewhere you have a series of photographs -- it &apos;s a number of photographs -- it .
This is a poster of Nothree Dame poster .
We can go from the verter physics to this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is taking place by still -- from the whole collective memory of how to appear the land , from visual standpoint -- and connected all of those data together .
All those pictures become connected together , larger than the sum of the parts .
You have a model of the whole land that emerge .
Think about this as a prolder of Stephen Lawler &apos;s work on virtual Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as people use it , and the people who use it , and the advantages to get the use .
Their pictures are married with metadvered advertised by other people .
If you have a person is the idea of contrast all these sants to say the name , my picture of the Cathlel of Nothing three Dsuddenly visly enries of all that data , and I can use it as ingress in that space , in that metaphor , using the pictures of others , and having a social experience of cross-user , using anyone else , and have a social experience of a cross-mood and cross-user .
Of course , a consequence of all of this are virtual models of all the interesting virtual models of the earth , not only collective planes and from satellite images and from the memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What your software is going to be doing is that at some point , in the next years , all the pictures that we have been with with anyone in the entire world will be connected with ?
BAA : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is doing in practice is to find .
It &apos;s making hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the images .
What &apos;s very interesting if you think about the richness of seanments of seant information that many of these images have .
As you do a research of images on the Web , you get a sentence and the headline on the web page , it &apos;s a lot of information about the pictures .
Now , what happens if that picture is connected to all your pictures ?
So the amount of seasant interconnection and the amount of wealth that comes out of it is really enormous . It &apos;s a classic network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the main pleases when you travel and one of the ethnographical research is the way to live in the wind , and the ancient search , between the housing green , the hits the past in the wind , the hit , the guuck in the rained , the trouble by rain , the however , the guuck in the wind , and the plants .
I think that the Jagua Jague travel still over the Via Lattea , or that the old old Inuit &apos;s still the subject of the Inuit &apos;s known , or in Himalayas , the distinct of the Dharm , the myric importance of anthropology , and the idea that the world we live in which we don &apos;t live in a sense , but it &apos;s just a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of adaptations that our stirp-made , well or many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of essential search .
We all procream . We all procream .
We are subjects of initiation .
We have to face the inesorability of death , so we don &apos;t surrounding if we &apos;re singing and we &apos;re --
We all have an art .
What it hits is the particular rhythm of song , the dance of all culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that they &apos;re the forests in the Borneo &apos;s the Borneo &apos;s Go &apos;s Borneo , or the desert Kaisert warriers in Kenya , the Curander in Kenya , or a camp in Ande , or a cammellier in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my company company , or a month ago , or a yak hallelder in Qomolangma , in Qomolangma , on the Mount of the world .
All of these populations teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And , if you think of a moment , it &apos;s a concept that it can give you hope .
Togen , the miriades of the world create a spiritual , cultural life , which is a spiritual life that you want the planet , and it &apos;s important for the planet as biosphere .
And you can think of this cultural spider as a ethnosphere and you can define the etnosphere , the total view of all the concepts , subject , mites , with ideas , inspired intuition , brings , for ideas , by being from being the human imagination of the alba .
etnosphere is the great potripped of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be as a kind of inquisitive .
And because biosphere was very very much as it has been very much as it happened to the ethnosphere and unfortunately much faster .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species is , or is the one of the extinction simply because it is flipping , or -- in the highest hypothesis -- in the most optional hypothesis -- in the most optional hypothesis -- that cultural diversity --
The surgery of all of that is , of course , the language loss .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just composed by a vocabulary or a series of rules .
One language is the spraked of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle with which the animous of every culture comes in in the material world .
Every language is a forest , a kissing , a thought , a very spiritual of spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re sitting in Monterey , at least half not being subsurrounded in the ears of the children .
They &apos;re not taught to children , which means , unless I have a lot of a lot of death .
What is more sad than the one of the things that you have been silence , of being the last to talk about a language , the way to talk about a language , the wisdom of the good or to anticipate the promise of the children ?
This is a few of some of the world in some of the world every two weeks . every two weeks , every two weeks , every two weeks , every old language , and it &apos;s a ancient language .
And I know somebody who will say , &quot; Is it better ?
The world wouldn &apos;t be a better place if we were all the same language ? &quot; Welderly , we &apos;re all yoruba .
We talk about kogi .
You &apos;re going to get a sudden what it means you can &apos;t talk to their language .
I &apos;d like to do a journey through the ethnosphere --
a little journey in the ethnosphere to give you a bit of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I say &quot; different ways of existing ways of existing truly different ways of existing .
Let &apos;s take for example this Barasana , in the Amazon sector , the people of anaconda , who crees the mit of anaconda , who creds on the latest the west the safest panish packs .
It &apos;s a people who can &apos;t distinguish the blue blue color from the green because the time celests , and the celests has identified in the forest , where the people are going to depends the people .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rule , called &quot; exogammed language : You have to move a person who is talking different language .
All of this has roots in the mitological past , though the particularity is that in these families in the summarriage where you &apos;re talking about six or seven ingons because of the marriage of mystery a language .
They &apos;re limited to listen and then start talking about .
We take one of the most interesting tribe with which I lived , the Waorani of Ecuador , a incredible people that had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionar-missioned a very contact error .
They had gone down down the top photographs that react them to make them into a lot of plug , forest that this people who were not seen anything two-dimensional forest .
They collected the photograph , they turned the research , they turned to research for a form or a figure and not out , they &apos;re not able to be able to be able to be killed , and they killed the five missionaries with lance .
But Waorani didn &apos;t kill only the foreigers .
They killed between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by their own .
We were gone to eight generations and we found two of natural death , and when we &apos;ve got a lot of them had to be invited that one of them was invecked , and then they killed him , and then they killed him .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine animal urine , and recognize the species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned a really interesting job when my Harvard professor , asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti my employees to inquirring between Duvalier and Tonton Mriout-mains of Duvalier and Tonton Man , and I stopped out of the poison for the poison .
To give a sense of the miraculous , I should have understand Vodn culture and that Voodoo is not magic .
It &apos;s pretty much about a meadoptions of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christianity , Islam , Ebraism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no faith religious . And instead , and the Voodoo is not religious distilled with these religious concepts of religious concepts of nati religious concepts .
What &apos;s interesting is that voodoo is the intense report between life and death .
So , the living is going to be hidden the spirites .
The spirits can be invited by the Great Act , they respond to the dance . They replace temporary animation and replace place place it , so that for a short activity , so that for a short moment .
For this voodooists like , &quot; You go to talk to God .
We give the theme , and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re ownership , is the spirit that drives you , how can you do it ?
So you see these incredible events : follow voodoo voodoo in the state of trance that touch impunishes a rather strong demonstration of the body when it &apos;s catalyzed in a state of extremely exciting exciting .
I &apos;m just a lot of people with which I lived the most extraordinary are Kogi Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta Colombia , in the entrional Santa Marta Colombia .
They have to be a very ancient civilization that once they lived on the charge of the Colombia on the coat the Colombia , the people retreat the volcanic masses that you would be on the vital masses that you would get to the charge plan .
In a macartwork of blood , this people had never been conquered spage-flew from spagnolls .
But I &apos;m actually governments from a cler , but their formation is very extraordinary .
The young people come away from the families to three or four years , and they live secret in a good world , and they live in a good world , like , shading the base of the glaciers for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years choices of the way to reproduce the nine months of gestation that spend into the US of the mother , now are metaphor in the US of Mother .
For all of this time , they &apos;re acculturing the values of their society , values that they predict that their prayers and only their prayers keep the cosmic balance -- or to say the balance -- or to say the balance .
At the end of this incredible initiation , it suddenly brought up and for the first time in life , at 18 years , see a dass . And in that moment , when the sun kiss , when the sun kiss , when the sun kiss the beautiful landscape , everything that they &apos;ve learned in theory comes to all his splendor . The pret is a step back , it , it &apos;s saying , &quot;
&quot; Did you tell ? Right ? I said .
It &apos;s amazing . It &apos;s now now now to you have to protect it . &quot;
They call the highest brothers and say that we , rings , are the colpful colpounds , we &apos;re the hit of the destruction of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the indigenous populations and the aging environment and the old investment of the wild , which is a race concealing concept in its its simplicity or maybe invog Thoreau and we say these people are closer to the Earth .
The Indies people are not sentimental nostaly , unless , or unrelated by nostaly .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the Asman Asmat the Asmat the em of the Tibet , but because of time and the rhyththththththrows , they created a mystical of the notion of the notion of it , but on a very , very , very , very , very good intuition , but on a very good time , because it &apos;s infected by human consciousness .
What does that say ?
It means that a kid in Ande that a kid in Ande that the mountain is a fairly different with the mountain is a very different human being being deeply different , and it will have a very different relationship with the mountain or that place like a Mounder that mountain is a rock or that if you &apos;re going to be a mountain is a rock of rock , which is a rock of rock , which is a rock of rock is a rock of a rock of the ready to be ,
which is the dimmora is a mineral or a mineral cat is irrelevant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that define the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia Britannica , creating that the forests served for being cut .
And that has made me a different human being different from my friends Kwakiutl , who believe that the forests are the dimmoning is the debmasses of heaven and the downnnn-the-world , who live on the north of the Hukukidnal initiation .
If you start to consider that these cultures can actually create different reality , you can start to understand some of them feeling . We make this plan .
I took this picture to open up in the Amazon ninch Amazon .
Maybe some of you have heard about the ayahuasca , the most powerful psychophical submelting .
What makes the elaboration is not the potential is not the potential of substance , but its elaboration . It &apos;s composed by two elaboration . It &apos;s composed by two element .
On one side , this lian lian liana , which is a series of beta-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-harmoline , slightly hallucinogen .
And by trying to take the only plant , it has a smoke that alter a little bit of the consciousness of the family of a coffee family , but it mix with the leaving of the family of the coffee Psychotry is .
This plant contains powerful powerful , very similar to the seriotonin , dimethylyptamine , methyptamine .
If you ever see the Yanomami thyllyptamine . It &apos;s basically a different set of species , it is methyllyptamine .
Tiring that dust on the nose is a little bit like being gone from a little bit of a beat , and land on a sea of the power of electricity .
I often have to do with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who had a scatened the age age of the hallucinogens in Mexico .
And I think my thesis cannot classiftamins as hallucinogens because if you did you &apos;re done , you can &apos;t tell any of being hallucined . And you can &apos;t be hallucined . But you can &apos;t be bad because you dency , of course , in the intestine , which is , of course , in the intestine , which is , of course in the intestine ,
It &apos;s possible to be absorpy if abunts with chemicals that would be denial MAO .
Now it &apos;s the nice , the Tier , the fuel &apos;s Sinininbitors of MAO , the same guy needs to be able to be able to be trouble with the tripped . The question of the smile : in a four-species flip , like these people can find two defologically not similar , but if you combine in this way , create a biochemical version that is the extra ,
We use the great euuuuusial and the error , which can be infruted .
But if we ask Indian , they &apos;ll tell us , we have to say , &quot; The plants talk about . &quot;
What does that say ?
This tribes , the Copan , has 17 variety of ayahuasca , which distinguishes neply in the forest , and that we would come into the same species .
If you ask them how they stopped their toxes will say , &quot; I thought , &quot; I thought , &quot; I &apos;d be able to do that ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take 17 variety in a night of moon , and each other will be with a different tone .
And with this is not graduate at Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than counting the stami .
Now , &#91; applausers &#93; the problem is that even those of us who have to heart people who have in the heart that are painting but somehow reduced to the sea of the world &apos;s history than our real world , and it &apos;s passes over .
In fact , the 21st century , in 300 years , it will not remember to his own own technology , but rather like the era where we &apos;re stopped and we abbraced , and we abbracely , and we abbrace , the passive mass destruction of biological diversity and cultural diversity , cultural diversity , cultural diversity ,
All the cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibilities .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux have no stop being Sioux when they put away from arco and frecovered .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that threatening the integrity of ethnosphere . It &apos;s power .
The hard hard hard to domination .
And if you give a look at the world , I &apos;m going to find that these are not cultures desappear to disappear .
They &apos;re living creatures and dynamics are very spinout of identical forces that go beyond their adaptation capability of .
It &apos;s a disboscampaign in the Penan of Penman --
a peel nomads nomads , in the Asian , a people who lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now I reduced to the generation , and now I &apos;m going to the reduced rivers , where you can see the river river river , where you can see the river river of the lim , where the nurse of the horizon , where the narrow the west , where the countries are reuminating wellar , where the nomes are witure the horizoning roulands , and and the horizerwise of the horizernapdom , you can look at , where you can look look at the ride of the
It &apos;s ready to fill the wooden wooden .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that came with the discovery of the gold .
If we move on the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you will see the tough of the political domination .
As you know the genocide , the extinction physics of a people , is convicted to universal level , but the ethnocience , the destruction of the style of a people , not only is announced , but I also also celebrated in certain environments , because it &apos;s part of the development strategy .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of the Tibet until you part of the beginning .
I &apos;ve been the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in the West through the West Tibet , coming to Lhasa with a young connection , but only came to Lhasa with a young connection , but only came to Lhasa with the statistics that we were talking about .
6,000 sacries sacries reduced in the powder and centers .
1.2 million people killed by the military during the Cultural Revolution .
The dad of this guy was ascriteria to Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed to be killed in the Chinese invasion .
Her uncle is I was car with Sua Santity during the diaspora that brought people in Nepal .
His mother was imprisoned and his fault fault was rich .
It was brought to hide in caring at the age of two hidden birth , because he couldn &apos;t have a living without him .
The sister , who did the same , was mitted in reduced field .
A day , he had a hot hot hot a button , and for this transgression , was put to the forced to seven years .
The Tibet can be insopportaable , but the spirit of the people of the people of the people of the people of the people of the ones are tener .
And it turns out to a choice .
We want to live in the world &apos;s monocromatic monoton or we want to get the policements of diversity ?
The great anthropologist in Margaret Mead , before he died said that his biggest fear was that , in our whole vision of the world , not only we &apos;ll see the whole gamm of human imagination , but the whole day we &apos;re going to see the whole gamma of thinking , but a day we will wake up with a sleep foragers to be other possibilities .
And it &apos;s humiliating that our species is existed for 600,000 years .
The SRevolution Revolution evolution , which has given us agriculture , which has been made us to take us to take the crash of the seed , by by by by having the artment of the skier , by making the artment of specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has to be 300 years old .
That sharp story doesn &apos;t suggests me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to deal with in millennia .
When to these miriades of the world is asked what they want to say to be human , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all reflies to the ability to be what we are : a kind of a unable species , which has to be what we are , a very good kind of optimism .
I took this picture on the north of the Baffin the north of Baffin , when I went to the whale clock with Inuit , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya story of his grandfather .
The Canadese government has not always been gentile with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to stabilire our sopremacy , we have rhinely required in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refused to go .
The family , I had to be a lifetime , and all of his equipment .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t have the cold , they do it .
The pieces of the origin origin were made of weighs made of weightuned weighs .
The grandfather of this man didn &apos;t intimidst from the night or the bylizard that suffering .
It &apos;s been disgacted , it &apos;s hot the pitch in the skin in , and they were deflied in their own hand . When I did it frozen , he &apos;s working with a lama .
It &apos;s got a salive on the top of this clock , and when I became solid , he killed a dog .
He sheled the dog and created a shell , with the toacy clothes , has been stunning another dog , and it &apos;s disappeared to the banking , and it &apos;s gone to the banking , and it &apos;s got a bank , and it &apos;s got a bright .
We want to talk about horse with nothing ?
In the aprile 1999 , the Canadese government reduced to the total control area of a larger area of California and Texmits together .
It &apos;s their new pathria . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s an independent land . They &apos;re going to take all the minerary resources .
One beautiful example of how a natione-state can re-re-re-up with his people .
And , to end , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious to the people of us have been in these remote areas of the planet , realize that they &apos;re not remote .
For someone is home .
They opened sections of human imagination that go back to the time . And for us all , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our kids , become part of the geography of hope .
And finally , we have National Geographic , we are convinced that politicians will never come to anything .
We believe that polemics --
&#91; Applausers &#93; not not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month our website has 35 million visits .
156 countries transmit our television channel .
Our magazines are luts from millions of people .
Our work is traveling into the ethnosphere to bring our audience in the ethnosphere to bring our audience in a pleasant , for the central reveal , abbracing year , abbracing the censored revealing in the exist of the anthropology : the world deserve ve ve ve ve in a pluralyle world , and multiculticultural world , multiculticultural world , and multickles , and multural inch , and multicultural a life in a life in a life in a life in
where the wisdom of all the people can contribute to our collective well-being well-being well-being .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope to call a few other things that you &apos;ve heard and try to see some connections , in case you don &apos;t notice .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the official dogma . &quot;
The dogma official what ?
The dogma &apos;s official dogma all Western industrial society . The dogma official dogma : &quot; If we want to massure the well-being of our citizens . &quot;
The reason is , on one side , in fact that liberty is itself itself a value , is precious , is premious , to be for humans .
On the other one of us , if we are free , each of us can act to do everything that massized our well-being , no one that &apos;s not decide in our name .
The way to male freedom is massizing choice .
The more choices are people , the more free , and the more is their freedom , the highest is their well-being .
This , I think , is so deeply radicated in society in society that no one would be dreaming with the dubio .
And it &apos;s also very radicated in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m going to allow me a simple note about the conditions for the winds .
In my supermarket is 175 conditions , without contact the 10 variety of oil , and the 12 halls that you can buy a huge number of whales and 12 hale whale that you can buy a huge number of conditions that no 175 , already ready is that of your degree of the degrees of the deal .
Here &apos;s what the supermarket .
And then you go to the electronic store to buy a stereo : cast , CD lector , radio , plastra , light , and a bunch , light bulletter .
And in this single single store , there &apos;s a great number of audio components .
We can make six million different combinations using the components that there are in one store in one store .
You have to admit that there &apos;s a lot of choice .
Other fields : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the telephone services , at the sheet that were provides from mom Bell .
They noleged the phone , you didn &apos;t buy it .
A consequence of that , in the other , was that the phone never break .
These times they went .
We have a very limited variety of the phones , especially between cell cell phones .
Here &apos;s the cell cell phone .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , cuts , and I &apos;m caught in the middle of the birth , and forb for the brulelield .
If you don &apos;t have this still seen in the store under home , you &apos;re very well certain that I &apos;ll soon get to .
And what happens is that people come into the store and does this question . And it &apos;s what the answer ? The answer is &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell cell phone that doesn &apos;t make too much .
So , in other ways of life that are much more important aquatic aunts the same explosion of choices .
Assistence : It doesn &apos;t happen more in the United States that you go from the doctor and doctor you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do it , or B &quot; &quot; &quot; You can do this , or you know , &quot; Bric &quot; and these risks . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Doctor , what should I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A has these benefits , and the rescue , and B has these benefits and B . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; Dr. you say , &quot; Dr. you were , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result we call it &quot; self-self-expression of the malated &quot; , &quot; expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not that you move the weight and the responsibility of making decisions that somebody knows something , which is the doctor , to someone else that you know -- and almost certainly not anything -- and it &apos;s not about the prefer -- and therefore not in the ideal condition to make the real patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing of products of drugs , direct to people like me and you , who you think about it , if you think about it doesn &apos;t make any sense , because we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why do we advertising them ?
The answer is that it takes to ask the doctor to ask him to ask him to get them .
Something that is , as our identity ever is a question of choice , as you see in this wet , &quot; We don &apos;t want to force children . Sorech their sex at at the right moment , &quot; we don &apos;t have to be able to invent .
And we can reinventing us how many times we get to be .
which means that every morning , at the wake up , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I &apos;m going to the family and the marriage , a long time time , the common perspective for everybody , was that you married the most soon as soon as you can , and you start to get kids the most early possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not when , and even what to do after .
So , it &apos;s really to play .
I teach to be very smart students , and I &apos;m going to be able to be able to be than a time .
And not because they &apos;re not very brilliant , not because they &apos;re not very brilliant .
but why are they imthoughts , you mean to ask , &quot; I should be married or not ? &quot;
&quot; I should be married later ? I have to think before children or career ? &quot;
They &apos;re rogative interrogative .
And they &apos;re trying to answer these questions , even if this implica don &apos;t complete the homework that I teach and not a beautiful voice to my exam .
And they really have to do that . They &apos;re important questions .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , like Carl underway , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from every day , from every day , from the Hotel Randolph .
And in the parentesesession , there &apos;s a corner , and I don &apos;t tell no one where , the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use me .
What does this incredible freedom of choice that we have about the work ? It &apos;s that we have to continually decide , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing hot , with the cell phone in a pocket , Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the knees .
And even if they &apos;re all spending , every minute that we see our son roving , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; I have to answer this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? I have to email this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is &quot; no , &quot; all of this makes the experience of your son very different than that would be in other conditions .
So , any of the look at small things , things like , life is a question of choices , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : White , there were some possibilities , but it wasn &apos;t all of a choice .
The world of today is like this : The world &apos;s a good thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is . It &apos;s a lot of it .
The positive laypositions we know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative .
All of this is a choice that is two negative effects of people .
The first , paradoxically , it &apos;s that produced paralysis that .
With many options between which choose , becomes very difficult to do it .
I give you a significant example : a study of the volunteer plans .
A colleague access to the Vanguard data , the giant society of pension , with about a million customers in 2,000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of adhesion two percent .
With 50 sources , there &apos;s 10 percent in less than adhesions when they &apos;re only five . Why ?
Because with 50 sources of which choose , is sick to decide , and the choice came remained to indomain .
And tomorrow , and tomorrow , tomorrow , tomorrow , and of course tomorrow .
You know , not just mean that these guys will keep food for the dog because they &apos;re not going to have enough money , you also want to say that the decision is so lostica that are loses also .
Not participating , they &apos;re lost to five dollars for a year from the work dator , which would be well disposed to be able to be able to versary them .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think that makes the world like this .
&quot; And to end , for the ethernity : ketchup , maionese send ? &quot;
Would you like to make the right decision , if it &apos;s for ethernity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong wrong , and yet yet the condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can avoid the paralysis and make a choice , at the end , we &apos;re less satisfacts of how we would have been with less options between which choosing .
And that &apos;s why .
One of these is that with many conditions that choose , if you buy one and you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have a better choice that would be better . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us to pump the choice , and the reporting reported the sodisplaced by the decision ,
even when it was a very good decision .
The choices are , the easier of the option that is inssatisfaction of the option .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert clarified very well as we value
So , when there are many options , there are many options , it &apos;s easy to represent the alternative features of the option that you have a choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m sorry with all those that are not New York .
But that &apos;s what you probably need .
There &apos;s this couple to the Hamptons .
A lury .
It &apos;s about beautiful . Otday . It &apos;s all day day . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not missing . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , dust , it &apos;s Agust . &quot;
&quot; My neighborhood in Manhattan is away . &quot;
&quot; I could park in front of home . &quot;
And it goes to two weeks assilce from the idea that &apos;s losing -- every day -- the ability to park where it wants .
the costs of opportunities decrease the sodness for what we have , even when choice was excellent .
And the options that we have to consider , the most attractive characteristics will be refer to how you will be re-like .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things that .
It &apos;s about living at the moment , and maybe of living slowly .
But the most important point is that everything you choose , you choose to not do the other .
The things that we don &apos;t choose so much attractive that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : : the growing spiral of expectations .
I tried to my skin bought a new pair of jeans .
I &apos;m almost always nearly jeans .
Once jeans were just just like , bureather them , they were sweet , just after they brought them a life and they used a lot of times , they &apos;re going to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple new when those old were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
The beat committed me , &quot; Will you slim , you &apos;re relaxed , fit ? &quot;
Will with it with the cernic or with the button ? &quot; Stonewashed &quot; or &quot; ?
&quot; Will you do it ? &quot;
&quot; You &apos;re going to take it or stretch ? Bla , &quot; Continupright , &quot;
I was unfortunate , and after a little bit I could say , &quot; I want the guy that was the only guy . &quot; It was the only guy . &quot; He had no idea what it was , so I tried to all sick &apos;s called &quot; jeans , &quot; I came out of jeans , and I came out of jeans who I had ever had .
It was the very very well . I had the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse is that with all of that choice , my jeans had to be perfect .
I had to be minimum . I didn &apos;t expect anything that exceptional when there was one , there was a kind of a different , but when I saw 100 different , at least one guy had to be perfect .
What I had to be bubble , but not perfect .
After I was paragoned to what I was trying to be unsatisfacfaced .
The addition of options in the life of people don &apos;t do that to increase the expectations that are about the expostions of the options of the options of the options of the options of the other people who are not to get to the excellence of the options of the people who are not to increasing the excellence of the options of the
And this will produce less satisfying , even when the results are good .
No one in the world of marketing if it &apos;s made it .
Because if they knew that , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more like this .
&quot; It was better when you were worse , &quot; The reason I was better when you were worse when you were worse , you could even meet pleased .
In the world that we live in -- opulent , the world that we live in -- opulents with the expectations -- the most of the perfeition -- the very , we can hope is that things are at the altitude .
You &apos;ve never surprised because your expectations , my expectations , I &apos;m ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you are here -- is , &quot; Besearlier . &quot;
I mean -- small authographical moment -- which I really really married and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t have any better .
But it &apos;s not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of the bought a couple of jeans when there is only that kind of jeans is that when you &apos;re not satisfacfacts , and you say , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot; The answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What would I be able . What would I do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a unsatisfaction , and you ask who is the responsible , it &apos;s just so far .
You could have done better .
With hundreds of variety available , there are no excuse for insuccess .
So when people do decisions , even if the result is valid , you feel unsatisfacfacfaced and give the cold .
In the last years , depression is explored in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this honest wave of depression is just that people have been too high .
And when they have to explain this that the cold is .
So the end result is that we &apos;re better , in the general , we &apos;re better at the time .
Let me remember .
This is the official dogma , what we all get to good and it &apos;s completely fake .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little choice is better than I have no deal with it , but from this doesn &apos;t have a lot better .
There &apos;s a critical value , magical value . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve overcome from a piece of the level where the choices improvement our life .
Now , from political view of -- I &apos;ve got nearly finished -- from the political view , the following point of political view , the following .
What it allows all this in industrial society is wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know about it , where the problem is not too much choice .
The problem is that they have too bad .
So the facceness I &apos;m talking about is a bad bad bad exclusive of modern society , re-rich society .
And what it does depressing and roll is this : Steve Levitt spoken you &apos;re talking about how the expensive and the car seats are useful . It &apos;s a money spread .
I mean , these choices , complicated and dispensive , it &apos;s not just useful .
I &apos;m even deleterie .
They &apos;re worse .
If a little bit of what we have in our society allows a lot of choice , in those where people have too few people too too much possibly , it wouldn &apos;t just be life to improve but also .
This is what economists call a parthyan improvement .
A redistribution of income redistribution of income , not only to poor -- because of this choice in excess ,
To conclude , &quot; You can become everything you want to be --
You , people of culture , you &apos;re going to think , &quot; What does that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious you can &apos;t do anything in a glass . &quot;
&quot; A covered imagination , a limited vision of the world --
and I &apos;m interpreted with this , so at the beginning .
But then , I think , instead , I realized that that that fish the long knows the long knows that that the fish knows the long .
Because the reality is that if you missing into the mouth , so that , &quot; everything you can &apos;t . &quot; You don &apos;t get freedom . You don &apos;t get freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you break the mouth so that everything divents can decrease the satisfation .
You &apos;re excited about it , and you reduced the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too strange , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of some sphere , it &apos;s a recipe for inhappiness and , I &apos;m going to be a recipe for the rovine .
Thank you very much .
