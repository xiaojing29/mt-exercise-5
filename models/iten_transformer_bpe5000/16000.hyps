Last year I showed these slides to demonstrate that the glacial calculus , which for almost three million years had the size of the 48 of the continental 48 of the continental 48 of the continent , it has been restretch of 40 percent .
But it &apos;s going to underneath this underneath the gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show it the spessor of ice .
The artica glacial calculus is , in a sense , the clean of global climate system .
It &apos;s expanded up in the world and summer ritier .
The next slide is going to be a carrelied carrying the last 25 years .
The glaces are signed in red .
As you see , they go down to the blue skills .
That &apos;s the winter ice in the winter , which is the summer ,
You can see that the costs of the costs , five years or more , is like blood , that , here fuorial , that here was like a blood .
In 25 years , it was so , in 25 years , so .
This is a problem because the interests of interests the land of glacied the land , where there are huge amounts of fuel that , skip , they come into the middle of the microbes , they become into the microbes .
I &apos;m going to be a total of the atmospheric income from global warming , that amount of the amount of amount of , it could not return this .
In some deeper lagues in Alaska metan is already ribuling from the water .
The professored Katey Walter of University of Alaska team , and a team a lack team a lack of the last winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You know , that &apos;s what we will be .
And this is that this exchange termal , the Groenland from the northermal .
This is a river at the glacial river .
The ported never reached the lights like that .
This is the Kangerlussuaimal river , in the Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea level of the sea , on the glasses of the sea level .
These currents are increasing .
On the other side of the planet : Antarties , the largest blockable of the planet .
The last month of the scientists have deciccclared that the ice of ice is in negative , and the Antarcttle , which is particularly on some islands , is particularly himself , and it &apos;s particularly hoth in the sun .
It &apos;s about six feet of the ocean , like in Groenland .
Suli Himalaya , the third largest block of ice , you see new lagues , which a few years ago , they were glacious .
The 40 percent of the world &apos;s population of the power of the power of the weline of the world &apos;s population of the weline of the world &apos;s population of the pool .
Sulle Ande : this glacier &apos;s the source of the power of this city .
The ported it increased .
But when he demining , the same happens to the same happens to the water .
In California , the snow on Sierra Nevada is deminuit of 40 percent .
The hyriririries are in the crisis .
The predictions , like you read , they &apos;re grave .
The growing sure in the world leads to a remarkable increasing inceness .
The environmental disaster are increasing out of the normal and without previous .
Four times more more than the last 30 years I think about 75 .
This is a lot of insustainable .
If you look at it in the storyteller , you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the actual Pacific Gacific , the Americans , from the Americans , to the west of the subcontinent of Indian continent , where there is a radical impoverment of oxygen in the ocean .
The greater cause of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , it &apos;s the use of fossil fuel fuel .
The oil is a problem , and fuel is even worse .
The United States is one of the two of the more emissions , together to China .
And he was proponed to build a lot of other central central other .
But we &apos;re seeing a change of direction .
These are the annullated projects in the last years and some alternative of green .
In the way , there &apos;s a politics in our country .
The industrial industrial and oil has spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote fuel fuel , which is a unlike .
That &apos;s what I thought was --
Veras Natale , in Tennessee , where I saw , there was a loss of 3.8 billion litri loss .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the second big flow of the flow in America .
It &apos;s happened around Natale .
The public advertising of coal industrial industrial .
Video : Heewer the carbon is a kind of allegro and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and grow our economy .
Frosty the carbon is increasing .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and the work are the depend .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The largest minerary society in the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : It &apos;s clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelososis , Harry Repuzzy -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima Protection of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is one of them , a part .
Video : Attore : Attore : We see the climate change as a sery threat at our business .
So , this is to invest a huge amount of money in a public effort to make public and confused the truth on the fuel .
In fact , fuel , it &apos;s not sports .
We think it &apos;s clean -- it &apos;s also a good profumo .
So , you don &apos;t prehocuption of climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Attore : Human , you &apos;ve heard a lot of you heard a lot of it .
So we do a turn around a turn in a structure at the avanwide , and it &apos;s about pulit fuel .
Strordinarily ! Souordinarily . It &apos;s the sound of the pulit fuel technology .
The fuel consumon the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology , but the remarkable technology that you see it changes everything .
You take a look at : this is the odiern technology odiern fuel .
Al Gore : Inventually , the positive alternative , you know , and at that national security .
Video : Complplant : The America is in the crisis , the national security crisis .
The filter that the connects all : our dependence from fossil fuels , like fuel fuel fuel and oil imported .
Now , though , there &apos;s a new , audace solution for use circles .
Real America : 100 percent clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to remate America to make us more sure , and help us stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that basts to solve our problems .
Real America . Scoprite more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : You know , it &apos;s about reaims energy at America .
One of the faster ways of getting to the end of dependence from the combustible that killing our planet .
Comparsa : The future is here . Vent , a new energy .
Compitarian : New New New investments for jobs to well well well well , tributed .
Complplplant : Real America . It &apos;s time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old lunch , &quot; You know , if you want to go fast , go from soles .
If you want to go away , you go back , you go together . &quot;
We have to go far , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I did a introduction on the LHC .
And promises to come back to you back to you on how the car works .
So , we have it . And for the other time , there were not , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment that we &apos;ve ever tried -- 27 miles of circles .
His task is to reach the conditions that were at least of a billion ardespite of a second from the beginning of the universe -- until 600s , and at 600 million times a second .
It &apos;s just ambitious .
This is the car under Ginevra .
We have a photographs these mini-Big Bang in the remarkable Big Bang in the remarkable .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- is largo to a diameter of 2222 feet .
This is a show of ATLAS in building that you can see the proportions .
The 10 secember of last year we &apos;ve got the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was because of immense festhate in control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first fascinating particles that had done everything around the LHC , entring in collision , deliberately , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles inside the relevator .
In other words , when we see that the 10 secret secrets , which was a big vitty .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to make us more or this , when somebody went on Google and saw that the front of the beginning was this .
That means we have a cultural impact beyond that scientific impact on the scientific .
About a week later , there was a problem with the car , had just to these films here -- these dored files .
These files bring 13,000 ampampwhen the car works at the most of the power of power .
Now , the technical between you will look at the files and they say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . They &apos;re too much wild . &quot;
And instead can do it because they &apos;re very cold to become the deaths of the superbition of the superbition .
So , at least 271 degrees , at least 271 degrees , in the space between stars , these files can bring that current .
In one of the giunture between the most novemila in LHC , there was a defect of facbringing .
So the files are going to be slightly , and the 13,000 hamp suddenly meet a electronic resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic , and they moved about 30 centimeters .
It &apos;s danthrown about 50 magnetic magnetic .
We had to take them , what we did .
We have reduced them and wouseholds .
They &apos;re now coming back all of them underground .
I end the LHC LHC is going to be new integrous .
We will go it , and we expect to get the data , or the right , and continue so our adventure to see what the morning is the morning that we have the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these crashes reaches the debate about the value of science and the engineering of frontier . It &apos;s easy to confuture .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s so hard , I think it &apos;s the value of things like LHC .
I want to conclude with words of a Inglory scientist Inglese Davy , which , I guess , in the defense of his pupillo , and he was Michael Faday , his clean was Michael Faraday , and he said , &quot; Nothing is so dangerous for the human mind as the reritenenenening that the ideas of science is defines , that we don &apos;t have mythical , and that doesn &apos;t have any way to be complete in nature , and that are not in the refairs , and that there are not , and that there is a quick , and that we don &apos;t have any any any any any of our our our our our our tradadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadad
Thank you .
I want to start asking asking for rethink when you , you play with children , playing with the morning .
As you get to how to reach them and say , and you know , and you know , actually , and you know , and you know , and to make it by by making the space .
The space argument is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , by the useful information that is the useful useful objects , with physical objects , together to my consultant , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking asking , &quot; I started asking asking , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of having the only mouse as a a computer , but you can have the only slowly , a depend on a desktop , we can actually have a determine sure that it &apos;s just a few hundred of the same same same as a deaf ,
and fix it to our please ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable , is a big interactive computer as a biscankcomputer .
In a few words , a Siftable , is a big interactive computer as a biscankcomputer .
You can move with your hand , they can see , &quot; you can see , &quot; they feel the right movement and they have a screen and a radio wireless .
But nurtly , they &apos;re physicists , like the morning , you can move it by just sweet .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosyystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physicists , aware of the same movement , of the other movement , of the other things , and as they become more physicists , aware of the movement , of the other people like we can move , we can explore new fun of interaction .
I &apos;m going to try with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show the video : if you &apos;re in a direction , the video rotin a direction , the rotin the other side .
These interactive remarkable is aware of the other people .
If it &apos;s going to be interested in what they &apos;re going to be around .
If they &apos;re surrounded , and they can agitate a little bit .
If they &apos;re surrounded , and they can agitate a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was that we can use common gestures on data , at example , &quot; if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Sifaily configured like you to see it for the skin in that central color in that central , where they missing .
and I can use them to hit in that central color in that central , where they mischive .
You can see it too , we can put it a little bit .
And I &apos;m also beautiful , you know , the languages , the mathematics and games of logic , where people can try and make things quickly , and see the results immediately .
Now , I &apos;m --
This is a sequence of the Fibonacks that I do with a program .
Here we have a game of words that it &apos;s in half between Scarabeous and Boggle .
It &apos;s basically , at every turnal turnal in case on every Siftle , at every turnatuan , and you know , as you know , and you know , while you &apos;re trying to understand him to understand him on a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you get a new set of letter and new set of letter and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the children came in the Media Lab , I made it out of it and I made a video .
They liked up very much .
And one of the interesting things that kind of apply it is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
You just say , &quot; You know , &quot; How words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s other people who try it .
This is our moa dester , there on the right .
It was actually wanted to be impllars .
They were just morning , they were just morning , for him .
Now , this is an interactive cartoon interactive .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of the languages . He &apos;s Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , solving the Sifaily , they associated with it .
It can put new characters in the scene , solving the Sifaily , they associated with it .
So , it &apos;s doing it to go out the sun .
Video : The sun is surprising .
David Merrill : Now he took a treatment in the scene .
Video : The arange treatment .
Bel work ! Yes ! Yes !
So , you shake the Siftill and put close them close to the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- by by inventing their story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide him as a smoke .
DM : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide him as a smoke .
Video : Vola , gat .
DM : The last example I &apos;ve got time to show is a tool , and I realized that I was doing a recent , to do it .
It &apos;s a recent , and it &apos;s a recent , to sample and make music .
The Siftable here are sound like basic , and bacteria .
Every one of these has four different variations , and you can choose which use .
You can also also also put these sound in a sequence to comport your pleased sequence .
And it just just touch a sound and a sequence . &quot;
These are actually that you can control from alive , like the revers and the filter .
It &apos;s acks it to a particular sound and then incline for them .
And then there are general effects as time and volume , that you &apos;re appapply to the whole sequence .
Let &apos;s look at how it works .
Video : We will we put a base in two Siftool , &quot; sequence , &quot; We have it in a series , we we add it in a series , we add another base .
Now I put a line of low .
Video : I &apos;m going to add on the percussions --
Video : And now I &apos;m going to put the glass on the bacterial effect from alive .
Video : DM : I can reach the whole sequence of inclining the sequence of the sequence of the other side or the other .
Video : I &apos;m going to add the bottom of the bottom to the bottom to give more expression .
Video : DM : I can reach the sequence of the sequence . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to plan it before , but I can improvissues , make it more , and it &apos;s a long or more correct .
And now , finally , I can smoking the whole sequence of inclining the whole sequence of the volume . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new interfaces , more more resembling reserves to how they work our brain work .
And today , I had time to show one of the results of this path , and also some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that coming this new generation of design objects to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the hour of talking to everybody .
I &apos;m a writer .
I &apos;m sorry books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the fashion and the fashion of my life .
And I don &apos;t look like that can change .
But , I said this , something particular happened in my life and in my life and in my career , which has brought me to report the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is I &apos;ve been written this book , this biography called &quot; Mangia , Prega , Am , &quot; which , diversously , by some reason he was a great sensational sensational sensational senational sensational sensational book .
And the result is that everywhere , right now , people treatment like I was conducted .
It &apos;s true -- conducted , conducted !
They were all about me , and they &apos;re all worried and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t have fear to do that ?
You don &apos;t fear to continue to write all the life without that we can actually be able to create a book that can matter ? &quot;
How can you matter to someone ? &quot;
It &apos;s rassurant , you know .
But it could go worse , at that I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started saying -- I was a adolescent -- I was a round -- I was a writer .
I went to the same reaction at the same reaction .
And people say , &quot; Don &apos;t you have successful ?
You don &apos;t fear that the ulililights ?
You don &apos;t fear to make this mousehold for all life without anything that you ever came out and to die on a cumb of every violating deaths with the mouth of failure ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I fear of all those things .
I &apos;ve always had fear .
And I also fear of many other things that people can &apos;t ininate .
As the algae and other things very frightening .
But , as I think about write what I thought and ask me about it , and I was , why ?
Is it rational rational ?
It &apos;s logical that anybody who should wait to be frightened by a job that you have sent to do .
But what is there are so special in the imposition of the health and so much of the mental health as you can &apos;t do it ?
As my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don &apos;t remember once once in his 40 years of activity in which he was asked if he fear to be engineer ?
It was never -- that blockable of the John , as it goes ?
It didn &apos;t work so , you know ?
Onnestly , chemicals are not certainly , in the centuries , in the centuries , in the centuries ,
We have a writers , we have this reputation , and not just creative writers , but creatives of all these things , we have this reputation of being huge instable .
And it doesn &apos;t take the other that you can see the tristes of the magnifies of creative minminds that , only in the 21st century , dead young and often by their hand .
And the ones that are not suicked to be really disappeared by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , &quot; Every book book has killed me a little bit more . A wonderful fashion on work .
But we don &apos;t throw out when we feel it to say , because we &apos;ve heard these things so long that we have completely interiorized and accepted the noticed that creativity and the suffering are in a few ways legal way and the art , at the end , and the end , and then , constraint to the correct .
And the question I want to ask to ask everybody here today is : you agree with this idea ?
It &apos;s good for this -- because it &apos;s also looking at it from a centimeter to me not good for this support .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous and I don &apos;t want to see the perpepepepepepepepepepepepepepeoples in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better encourage our big creative minds to live .
And I know that , in my case -- in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start to fight on that I felt that I was in my career .
It &apos;s true -- I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m quite young , I &apos;m quite a young man , I &apos;m quite a young , I &apos;m pretty young ,
I &apos;ve still got about four work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything that I write about this right now , and then it &apos;s going to be judicted by the world , like the work that after my last book .
It &apos;s going to be slict , because we all the more or less friends here -- is likely that my greatest success is my own beddroom .
Oh , Gesus , that thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to blow in the nine of the morning and I don &apos;t want it to do it .
I &apos;m going to continue to do this work that we do this work that we do .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it looks like , after a lot of reflective , which way to work to continue to write is that to create a protective psychological construct , right ?
I have to find a bit of security between me , I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxiety of what I do is written , and I was trying to do this . And as I started looking for all the past , trying to find other societies and more and more and more and more and more and more and more to see if they could have have better ideas and more safety distance between me , and I &apos;m trying to see if they could have some more and more societies of the best ideas and
about how to help people people manage the creative people to manage the emotional inerents of creativity .
And that research me to the ancient Great and ancient Rome .
You go because I go back in circle and then go back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity selvenivers creativity selvenivers by men , OK ?
It was thinking that creativity was this spirit look at the divin and that they sell them to a few distant and unknown , for reasons and unknown , for distant and unknown .
The great-called these spirits of the creativity of demons of creativity . &quot;
Socrate , wonderful , believed to have a demand that elargive wisdom from far .
The Romans were in the same idea , but they called that kind of spirit without a genius .
The great , because the Romans didn &apos;t think that a genius were a genius of them were smart particularly intelligent .
They believed that a genius was this kind of divin that , literally lived in the walls of a neighborhood , a little bit like elevent , and it sell it to the hidden work and sell the outcome of the artist of the artist and model the outcome of that work .
Here , the east -- here , that &apos;s the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological constructed , which protected you from your work .
And everybody knew it was so that it worked , right ?
So , the ancient artists were protected by certain things , like the too narcisism , not ?
If your job was exceptional , you couldn &apos;t take it all the mermerished , everybody knew that you were helped by this genius .
If your job failing , it was not all your hit , it was not all your hit , right ?
Everybody knew it was your genius to be a inhasn .
And so people have conceived creativity in the Western for a long time .
Then the Rinhaaissance came and everything , and nacaaaque this great idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe on the minds and mysties and without even even even left space to the mitic creatures that write from divinity .
This was the principle of the rational principle and people started thinking that creativity came out of the idivided .
And for the first time in history , you start to referring this or that artist , like a genius that artist , as a person with the genius .
And I have to say that I think was a big mistake .
I think I allow someone , a simple person to believe that you can create a recient recient as a source , the essence and the surrounded of all the mysters , creative , unknown and etherns , unknown and etherns of the human .
It &apos;s like to ask someone to enjoy the sun .
It &apos;s details completely the ego and creates all these things that are expectations on performance .
And I think it was the pressure of the artists in passed 500 years .
And if that &apos;s true , and I think it &apos;s , the question is , and now ?
Can we do it differently ?
You can do a more ancient understanding of human relationship between humans and mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t get 500 years of thinking in a 18 minutes of a 18 minutes .
And it &apos;s probably people in the audience that would only have legitimate scientific suspects on the notion of the notion of , you do that people are going on on their own projects .
It &apos;s probably not going to convince you all of this .
But the question I would like to ask is -- why not ?
Why not think it &apos;s the way ?
Because it has more sense of anything that ever heard about how to explain the imprevealability of the creative process .
One process that , as anyone ever tried to do something -- so , basically , all here -- you don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t understand rationally .
And , in fact , it can sometimes look completely paranororous .
I did this inherent against recent poeived the wonderful poetic Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but it was a poem for all life and said that during his childhood in rural rural rural Virginia , and he felt it , in the field , and I felt it , in the field , and he felt it , in the middle , and he was coming from landscape .
He said it was like a frageous train .
And that came to the round of her landscape .
It was going to be , because he was tremendous to her land below .
He knew that I had one thing to do at that point and he was , words , &quot; to run like a match . &quot;
And he was going to hang up to this poem , and it didn &apos;t have to take another one piece of paper and a math faster enough , as the trapart , and then he was going to collect it , collected it and claim it on the page .
Sometimes I couldn &apos;t be fast , so correcal , so correcal and correcal , and correcal , and he was going to be able to get into the house and she was going to continued to rotate through the landscape , trying to , as she said , &quot; An , &quot; another poeet . &quot;
Then there were those times -- this piece I won &apos;t dimentional moments that I never dimentional moments that was almost losing , right ?
So , he was running home and was trying to paper and poetry and paper it was going through , and he was going through , and then he was like it , and then he was like hallungotten halled with the other hand and the office .
Accioffice the poetry from and the coda and he was going to be in his body and transcator on the page .
And in these cases , poetry would be presented on the perfect page and intact , but at the contrary , from the last word to the first .
So when I was thinking -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly the same as my creative process .
It &apos;s not all my creative process -- it &apos;s not a conducucucucucture .
I &apos;m a mulo , and my way to work is ; wake me at the same time every day and sweet and to go on it .
But even I &apos;m even in my guns , I strisciate against that thing , sometimes .
And I guess that also a lot of you the han made .
You know , even if the work and ideas came to me to give you a certain source of money , I could not honestly know it .
And what is this ?
And how can we relate to it in the way we don &apos;t do it losing the head , but , rather , that makes us us us us us to stay ?
As I am about , the best example I have the best example I have is the musician musician , which I interviewed different years ago for a journal .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life is the incarnation of the contemporary artist of the contemporary artist of the contemporary creative impulses .
But then invecked , he was hot , and he was driving on a hot , and he was driving on a self-building in Los Angeles , he changes everything for him .
It was going to be fast and all of a sudden this little framework of melodia , which comes in his head as inspiration , and it &apos;s halling , and the desider , and the desider , but it doesn &apos;t know how to take it .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a bunch .
So it starts to hear this species of old , and grow up in him like , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose it , and I &apos;m going to lose it from the way .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to the panic , he stopped .
It was going to put the whole mental process and made something completely new .
And he just looked at the sky and he said , &quot; I don &apos;t see that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; How do you look like that can write a song now ?
If you really want to exist , you get a more hurt , when I can take care of you .
Altrain , you go to importantly something else today .
It &apos;s going to disturbing Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his work work after this .
Not the work , the work , still was obcure as always .
But the process , and the anxiety , and the fish that was reduced when he was genius , the genius that came out of him , and he was going to go back from the same , and he was going to be a interiorized thing that was not to be a interorized thing , and the mentally .
but it &apos;s not a peculiar , wonderful bizarre , collaboration a conversation between Tom and this thing that stran and the outside that , but it was not Tom .
So , as the story I was actually actually actually , how to change a little bit , even the way I worked and I was saved .
This idea , I saved when I was writing , &quot; Prega , &quot; Am , &quot; and fall in a one of those cave of the dispersation that we &apos;re all working on something and we don &apos;t have , and you start thinking that will be a disaster , which is going to be a disaster , which is going to be the worst book .
Not just good , the worst book wrote .
And I started thinking about gecting this project .
But then I remember Tom I was talking about the air and I tried .
So I got my face on the manoscritical and deployed my comments to a vacuum angle of the room .
And I said to high voices , &quot; Somebody , what we know , if this book is not going to be brilliant , it &apos;s not going to be unless than my , right ?
Because I &apos;m seeing here , I &apos;m putting everything I have , I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to do your side .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what I don &apos;t do it .
I &apos;ll go to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I would like to be recorded that I was recorded to do my side . &quot; Because -- at the end is so , OK -- the end is so , OK -- centuries ago in the deserts of the North of the North of the North of the North of lone , dance and the hot of the North of the dances of the North of the North of the North of the North of the North Africa .
And they were always magnifies , because the dancy were professionists and were fantastic .
But every while , I got a lot of these artists became actually transcendent .
And I know what I &apos;m talking about what I know , because I know you all , at a point , a point , a performance .
It was like the time , you stopped , and the dancy housing , and it was not doing anything different from the usual , like 1,000 notes before , but it was all halling .
And suddenly , you don &apos;t just look like a human .
But it comes from the divinity and in the divinity of divinity .
And when this happened , you know , people knew what was , they called it by , they called it .
They said , &quot; Allah , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , God , &quot; God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Cuh notes that -- when the Moretic Morders , I was going to be on the Southern , I was this abitude with them and ready to change in the centuries . &quot;
In Sain , when a artist did something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , I hadn , I &apos;m like , Allah , I &apos;m going to be a scan of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes after the dancing day , for the dancy , when you wake up and you see that the 11 of the morning of God , there &apos;s not no longer .
It &apos;s just a lot of bad ginocaque , and maybe it can &apos;t never be able to each one to that althetic .
And maybe no one will get the name of God still while , and what should you do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most sweapon reconciliations to make in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so angosciant if you can &apos;t believe , advanced , the most amazing aspects of your being being from you .
But it just credest you come up with a inimaginable inimaginable source of this team of the inimaginable inimaginable to your life that you have to get something else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think in this way it changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s certainly like I thought about it for different months during the working of the book that I &apos;m going to have a dangerous , and I &apos;m going to be done , the dangerous , and I follow following my great success .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel electrized by this is , not having fear .
Not tight you . It &apos;s just your job .
You get on the presentation of your side , any one can be .
If your job is dancing , you dancing .
If the divin , you get genius to make a little bit of a wonderful time , for a few wonderful time , for a only time through your effort , then , &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Otherwise , you do the same dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot; to you the same .
I think it &apos;s weak to teach it it .
&quot; Ole ! &quot; to you the same , even only for having the human and testestard , to be a tough tool to make you introduce you to it .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As I &apos;ve talked about some of these things about the human genome , on what can significant and discovery of new genes .
We now are beginning to digitize the biology and now we started digitize biology and now we &apos;re going to start with that digitic code , we &apos;re going in a new phase of biology , designing and synthesizing life .
We always tried to ask big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists , I think we have tried to understand a variety of free levels .
We tried different approaches , reducing it to the minimi terms .
We &apos;re digitizing by almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the world analogical world of biology in the digital world .
Now , we ask : can we do we can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome that can authoreplication in the lab .
And we tried to reduce that the genome to create a still more small .
We can eliminate a hundred genes of genes of the genes of the 500 that are here .
But when we take a look at his metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our .
Credemic , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this can bring to a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to move on this , and we decided that the only way to move this cromosome in a way that we could change the components to ask some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of &quot; Can we synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Can you have the chemistry consend these big molecules that we never had to create before ?
And , in case , we can do a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemistry of inerte chemical material .
The speed with which we can digitize life is growing up to exponential .
Our capacity to write the genetic code , instead , and rather slowly , but it &apos;s improving .
And our most recent results the results coming on a curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process has required a lot of passes , beginning with a bioethical review before the experiments .
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that produce small segments , of the long DNA , the long length of DNA , the long-to-lets , the more mistakes there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments and correct the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , to start from digital information of the genome of Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the frammments , actually , by actual correction correction and get a molecule of DNA molecule .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material inerte and we put it in bacteria , bacteria , and they started reading this genetic code and make it genetic particles .
The viral particles were then left by cells , they were back and they destroyed .
I talked about recently with the oil industry , say about the oil industry , say that they have certainly compupublicly compute this model .
They have more than you have .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build his same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in big .
We wanted to build the whole chromosome of the bacteria .
They &apos;re more than 580 mila letter code .
So we thought we did it in cassasses of viruses , so that we can change the cassassets to understand what they are the components of a living .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard of a mid-based mid-based mid-based mid-based mid-basis .
We found it , resequenced , 30 . If we used that original sequence we could never have been able to do it .
One part of the process is designing long , it &apos;s designed long , and you know , the sovrape with all the other segments of 50 letter to build smaller underounce that work together .
We have unic elements together here .
You &apos;ve probably read that we &apos;ve got to put the ligrgrade .
Think about it this : We have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , C , G and T.
Three of those letters together codified about 20 amminoacids , and there &apos;s a specific order to letter them .
So we can use the genetic code for words , frankly , thoughts .
What we did in the beginning was self-done .
Some people have been delused by fact that it wasn &apos;t poem .
We designed these segments to potential them just just join with enzymes .
There are some of them , and they put them together .
And we started assembling parts of the parts , beginning with five to seven thousand to seven thousand to seven thousand letter , unendles in a way to form of 24 mila letter to them , and then then to get to 72 , letter .
We &apos;ve done this , we made these segments in abundance , so that we could have have given us that we &apos;re trying to create a very much robbbbleg -- like you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this looks like the tabellon a player of basket .
When we get these very long segments , more than 100 mila basis , they won &apos;t grow more directly in the E.
You get to the modern biology tools of molecular biology .
So we &apos;ve looked at other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called the reomologist called the romologist , which in biology , we use DNA to unting the DNA that can be able to unting the seat .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinoccurred Deinoccurs , can absorb three million radiation .
You can see in the upper right-riquick rise of the chromosome is destroome .
In 12 -- 24 hours it is reassembled exactly as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be completely completely .
They can live under vacuum .
It &apos;s absolutely sure that life in space , and you feel to find new remarkable to find new remarkable environments of water .
In fact , NASA showed that this is .
This is a molecule picture of molecule that we built using these processes , just using the lieventually with the segments that we &apos;ve built .
The lievated it assemble .
This image was not taken taken with a microscope microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It &apos;s a very large molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that coherself a period of six seconds .
This is the publisher that we &apos;ve done a little time ago .
They &apos;re more than 580,000 letter code .
It &apos;s the largest molecule structure ever created by the man .
It has a higher molecular weight at 300 million .
If you &apos;re going to be a little bit of a 10 without spaces , you want to be 142 page only to transmit this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ? How can we do it ? How can we do it ?
Of course , you take a virus is a game by kids .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria .
It &apos;s easier to do when it is eucarian cells like our : you just just pull the nuclear and put one other , which is basically the clonation of clonation .
In bacteria , the archaea bacteria , but we &apos;ve recently recently demonstrate that we have recently demonstrate that we can do a a trapion a chromosome from a cell to another and to accomplished it .
We clean a chromosome from a microbial cromosome .
The two are different as men from tops .
We add some gene in the more way that we could decide what you choose to chromosome for cromosome .
And then it &apos;s skip with the enzymes in a way to kill all the protein .
And when we put it in the cell , it &apos;s been amazing -- and open our graph , sophisticated graphic , the new chromosome is gone inside the cell .
And we thought that we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried it anymore , but we tried it anymore there .
This is one of the most mechanisms of evolution .
We found that tantissim species have added a second or a third chromosome from some part , and I add in a second thousands of new traits to that species .
So those thinks evolution as a single gene at the time that it doesn &apos;t understand a lot of biology .
There is the enzymes called &quot; restriction of restriction that actually digit the DNA .
The cromosome that was in the cell , you didn &apos;t have one .
The cell cell cell -- the phone phone that we have put it .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other chromosome as a material extraneum , and it has been in the only cell and the new chromosome .
It became blue because of the genes that we have put .
And in a short short time , all the characteristics of a species are gone , and you turn around into a new species , based on the new software that we put in the new software that we put in the cell .
All the proteins are changes , the membrane are changes , and when we read the genetic code exactly what we have we moved to .
Now , this could look like , genetic alchemy , but by by the software we can change things in a very substantial way .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that it doesn &apos;t talk about genesis -- but progress from three million years and a half of evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion Cambrian explosion in which they will be new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s obvious enough when we think about our need .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right for an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one in the existing 1946 ; there will be four .
We &apos;re having problems now at the problems at find food , fresh and clean , medicine and welline , for six billion and a half of people .
It &apos;s going to be even more daily dancing it .
We use more than five billion fuel band more than 30 billion bars .
That means percent million barle a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replace them , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to understand the whole CO2 emission from these materials that finished in the atmosphere .
In today , because of the scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that they are designed components for the future .
The electronic industry has only a dozen about components , and you think about how many different things came out .
Our limits here is data data from biological reality and from our imagination .
Now we have techniques , because of these methods of synthesization , able to create what we call a genomic genomic combinatory .
We can build a big robot that can produce a big robot that can produce a million crumbits a day .
Think about processing these 20 million different genes of genes or to try to make it optimize the processes to produce optimistic , we can change , we can change , we can change , and create more biology molecular biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemical production or fuel , or fuel , vaccines of vaccines .
This is an instantanea of some software programmed that we &apos;re working on to be able to seat and design species at the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how they &apos;re going to be .
We know exactly what they &apos;re their genetic code .
Now we &apos;re focusing on the fuel of quarter generation .
You also saw that extract ethanol from the grain was a hurt experiment .
We have depend of second and third generation that will use enough to be very soon soon by the zuccher , like the ophs or different butanle , or different butanle .
But the only way biology can have a big impact without increasing the cost of food and limb the cost of food and limbs the available of food and limbs the available of food and we think we can actually have the first fuel of food that can achieve the first fuel of fourth generation in about 18 months .
The solar light combined CO2 is a metododownnn-todownn-discoveries in our world , we found different metods .
This is a organism that we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
It &apos;s going to be in the ocean , at about 2,500 feet of deep at the ocean temperature .
It &apos;s created metan by using hydrogen molecular hydrogen as energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can ing CO2 , which can easily be transported by toubbees , convert that CO2 in fuel , to drive this process .
So , we think we could be able to increase what the question of the basic question of what life is life is , &quot; is , &quot; is , we have the fashion goal .
Except . If you can &apos;t do it by TED , where you can ?
It would be a main source source of energy .
And we &apos;re working on the same metods to create instantanetic vaccines .
You saw this year with influence , we &apos;ve always been back to a year and with a dollar in less when it is to find the vaccine right .
I think that you can change building combinable vaccines in anticius .
So , the future could start to look at the time , the tree of evolution , accell-evolution , accell-evolution with synthic bacteria , and finally eucarium cells .
We are so much as we have to improve people .
Our purpose is to make it a long enough to try to make it . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the most quickly possible , some fundamental job , the new technology that we brought to the Microsoft in follow at a year . This is exactly Seadron .
It &apos;s a environment in which you can interact is local level that remoon with a huge amount of data data .
We &apos;re seeing a lot of digital photograph of digital photograph with a kind of a kind of weather and continuous , for a fast breadic , despite images like we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these data are collecting of data or images .
Most people are common photographs , but this for example is a provening scanning scanning on the Big of Congress , and reentry in the gamma of 300 megamma .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that the only thing that the edge of a system like this is the number of plan on your screen at any time . It &apos;s also very flexel architecture .
This is a whole book , not images of that doesn &apos;t have images .
This is the Casa desolate of Dickens . Every colonna represents a chapter .
To demonstrate that it &apos;s just about the text and not of images , we can do something like that , to see that it &apos;s a real representation of the tissue , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a little artificial book .
I don &apos;t give you a joke .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s a number of The Guardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really enjoy and the beautiful experience of reading the real version of a magazine , or a everyday , which is a multiplplot of a kind of a half of a kind of a half .
We have something with the corner of this particular number of Guardian .
We created a fashion adolder -- much higher than that you use in a normal publishers -- and we put you in a normal publishers -- and we put you in the content .
If you want to see the feature of this automobile , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even specific patterns .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the space of space on the screen .
We hope that this means that it means to put people in the people , and to some kind of reports that , not have to be the most to be necessary .
Of course , the mapapaps is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say we have to contribute you to give you this field .
These are all the streets in the United States overcome over a geospace picture of NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually from the alive on the Web ; you can go and see it .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which fight two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research at very interesting computer made by Noah Snavely , a student of the University of Washington , with the help of Steve Seadring Se &apos;s An Sea Rick . It &apos;s a very good collaboration .
And it &apos;s from the vivive on the web , I was in Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from a picture of the other and having this kind of experience of the multipacking experience .
But the space of the space of images here has actually meaningful meaningful .
The algorithms of computer have recorded these images together , so that correspond to these images together , so that the imagination -- all the close to the lagues of the Grasis on the Montagne Rocciose dog -- they &apos;re shown . So here &apos;s the elements of a slightly stable or phoric by phoric demonstration , and these things are all connected to space level .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show some other environment .
There are some more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data set of Noademic data data from a previent Photosynth that we did work for the first time the summer -- to show you what I think is really the key behind this technology , Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily evidence in the website . And it &apos;s not necessarily evident that we put in the website .
We had to worry about the legal aspects and so on .
This is a rebuild of the Nobody &apos;s coat the Sorange of Nobody Dame images made by Flickr . Bauctor , and you get images of these kinds of guns and you get images of these things in the maglit and saying . So , you can see a picture that &apos;s discovery that is discovery to be keeps .
So , they &apos;re all taken by Flickr and they were all connected to space level this .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this very simple way .
You know , I would never think of fining working for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifically , to get this kind of access .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of photocaming : from those phones of the mobile phones in the professional SLonals , a significant number , and it together in this environment .
And if I can , I try and try and try to look at the more strike .
Many of them are blocked by faces , etc .
Somewhere you &apos;re a series of photographs -- and you see .
This is a poster of Nothing Dame recorded correctly .
We can go from the physical poster of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is taking data from the whole whole collective memory , as the whole mitter memory of view -- and connected all of that data together .
All those photos become connected , the more of the parts of the parts .
You have a model of the entire land that emerge .
Think about this as the prolungent of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity , as people use it , and the people use , and the people are using it .
Their photos are marked with metad-up meadow other people .
If somebody is the idea of contrast all these undending , the name of the name of the Cajathdry in the Nobody &apos;s picture of the Nothing , and I can use it as a point of ingress , and I can use it as a place of ingress in that space , in that way , in that metaphor , and having a social experience of the kind of cross-moon cross-cross-mo-cross-modity experience .
Of course , a consequence of all this is virtual , extremely , of all the interesting land , collected by every interesting part of the land , and satellite images and satellite images and satellite images and similar , but from the collective memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I do you understand ? What your software will be going to do is that at a certain point , in the next few years , all the photographs that you can see in the entire world will be going to be just connected with anyone in the entire world will be just just just just the one in the world will be practically connected with them ?
BAA : Yes . What is doing is actually actually discover .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , you know , in images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the requires of seant information that many of these images have .
As you do a research research on the Web , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s a lot of information about images .
Now , what happens if you do this picture is connecting all your photograph ?
So the amount of seanch interconnection and the amount of wealth that would be really huge . It &apos;s a classic network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really amazing .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the main pleases when you travels and one of the hamnogical research is that you can live in who don &apos;t forgotten the traditions , between who you can have the past in the wind , and you touch in the wind , it is the way in the wind , and you can see it in the wind , and you can see it in the wind , and you know , the leaves in the wind , and one of the wild of the plants .
And the thinking that the sciamani Jaguar , Jaguar , or the Lattea , or that the old old Inuit &apos;s still colories . I still have significant the sub-results , or the distinct buders , and the idea that the world in which we don &apos;t extra any sense of the Dharm , but to remember the idea of the world that we have not exist in sense , but it &apos;s just a reality , it &apos;s just a reality , of reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stirpe has done , good or not , many generations ago , very well , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential straint .
We all all come . We all all of the procreation .
We are initiation to the beginning .
We have to deal with the inexorability of death , so we don &apos;t surprised it , if we &apos;re not surprising it .
We all have an art .
What hits is the particular rhythm of song , the rhythm of the dance of the dance of the culture of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that the Penan of Borneo , or the following of the Voododoo &apos;s Sahara , or the desert warriers of the desert Kaisus in Kenya , the Curander &apos;s heart in the Sahara .
And he was my journey of journey in the desert a month ago , or a yak haller in Qomolangma , on the east of the world .
All these populations are teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And if you think a moment , it &apos;s a concept that it can give you hope .
Insisides , the miriades of cultures the world create a spiritual roughly the planet , and it &apos;s important for the planet , and it &apos;s important for the planet as biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural race as a ethnosphere and you can defining the ethnosphere , the whole whole whole whole , mites , dreams , mful , , ideas , inspired , intuitions , inspired by the human imagination .
The ethnosphere is the great patriage of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how we can be as as initial species .
And because biosphere was very , very , very , as a biosphere and very much more , very quickly .
No biologist , for example , would say that 50 percent of all the species is , or it &apos;s the ord of the extinction just because it &apos;s fense , or -- in the most apocalittical diversity -- and you don &apos;t even get close to hypothesis -- that , in the most mystic diversity -- that &apos;s the cultural diversity .
The one of all this is , of course , the language loss .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not compost just by a vocabulary or a series of grammatic rules .
One language is the springing of human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle of the world that the animum of every culture is in the world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a gentleman , a thought , a phosystem of spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re sitting in Monterey , at least half not the sub-surred in the ears of children .
They don &apos;t come more taught , the one that means , unless I don &apos;t have any camps something that they &apos;ve already died .
What is the more tristes of being the deaths of being the last to talk about a language , the last to talk about a language , the way to be the last of the children , or to be anticipate the promise of children ?
This is the state of somebody in some part of the world every two weeks of the world every two weeks , a old old language , and door with themselves in the toms , the last last silver language .
And I know somebody who will say , &quot; Isn &apos;t it better .
The world wouldn &apos;t it be a better place if we were all the same language ? &quot; Benian , we all all yoruba . We all talk about the dogs .
We talk about kogs .
You &apos;re going to have a trap what it means you can &apos;t talk to their language .
I would like to do a journey through the etnosphere --
a little journey in the ethnosphere to give you a bit of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , &quot; different ways of existing exist . &quot; I mean , very different ways of existing .
Let &apos;s take for example this bimbe Barasana , in Amazon Sentrional Sentrional Southern , the people of anaconda , which creal mit to the river of the rights in the seven-greatest bread in the serpens .
It &apos;s a people that can &apos;t be able to distinguish the blue color from green because the celests of the blue color from the green because the time birth of the people .
They have a strike , and a matriage rule , deaths called &quot; exogy language , &quot; You have to marriage a person that talks a different language .
All this has root in the past mitological , yet the particularly the particolarity is that in these families , and then you talk about six or seven lets because of the matrirists .
They have a lot of listening and then start talking about .
Let &apos;s take one of the most interesting tribe that I lived , the Waorani of Ecuador , a amazing people that had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionary missionary , they tried a kind of mistake .
They made down from the upper photographs that they were removed to the roughly photographs , forgotten that people were going to have a living , and they forest that people were never seen anything about the bi-dimensional forest .
They collected the photograph , they &apos;ve been taken on the ground , and they were not going to be anything , they have conclused that it was the diavily , they killed the five missionary missionary with lance .
But the Waorani didn &apos;t kill the same as the foreign .
They kill between them .
54 percent of mortality was caused by themselves .
We were saved at eight generations and we found two natural death cases and when we &apos;ve insisted that one of them was invited that one of them was invited by the same .
The citizens were able to recognize the animal urine 40 pass and recognize the species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned a very interesting job when my professor of Harvard professor , if I wanted to go to Haiti to Haiti in the basic power of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes , and Tonton Macoutes , and Tonton Macoutes .
To make a sense of the miraculous , I had to understand Vodoun culture and Vododoo is not magic .
It &apos;s pretty much about a metaphical vision of the world .
It &apos;s interesting .
If I ask you to tell me about the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianity , Islam , Buddhism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has no faith faith . And instead , and Voododoo is not the other distilled to the tragic , very profound of these religious concepts of nets .
What makes interesting is the intense voodoo is the intense relationship between life and life and death .
So , the vives are going to hide the spirits .
The spirits can be invocated by the Great Accord , they respond to the race of the dance and replace time time , it &apos;s so that for a short active active active active active , the following following the folder becomes .
So , this is the woodooists to say , &quot; You go to church to talk about God .
We dancy in the temple and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re post , is the spirit that you can do , how do you do you do that ?
So you see these amazing events : following voodoo in state of trance that touches in state of trance that touches impunishes a demonstration of power in the body when it &apos;s catalyzed in a state of extremely excitement .
In all the people that I &apos;ve been living in the most extraordinary people who have been living in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta , in the Columbia security of the Santa Marta .
They have to be on the ancient civilization that once they were living on the aid carriers in the aid of the Colombia in the commodities , the people retreatment on the volcanic masses , the people were going to be on the volcanic massure .
In a continent of blood , this people have never been conquisted by the spagnoled by the spagage-to-sheets .
It &apos;s actually been governance from a clam , but they formed their formation is so extraordinary .
The young following people from families to three or four years , and they live secret in a good world and roughly shouseholds in a world made of the stones of the glaciers for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years , by the way to produce the nine months of gestation that transmate in the modities of the mom , now they &apos;re metaphor in the Grande Maaathesis .
All of this time , they &apos;re accultured to their society , values that are predictors that their prayers and just their prayers and just their prayers , they keep the balance of the cosmic balance .
In the term of this amazing initiation , they &apos;re all all all of the time in life , at the age of 18 , they see an alba . And in that moment of the first time in life , and you see a lot of bedded , when the sun kidnun , everything that they &apos;ve learned in the theory is all that they &apos;ve learned in the theory is all of his splendor . The prevent is a step , and he &apos;s going to be a step back and it , and he &apos;s going to say ,
&quot; Vison ? Proprid as I said .
It &apos;s amazing . Now it &apos;s now at the same time . &quot;
They call the largest brothers and say that we , the minors , we are the colpping colpping of the world &apos;s destruction .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the Indigene &apos;s population and the environment we call Rousseau and the old history of the selselection , which is a race in his simplicity or maybe invode Thoreau and we say that these people are more neighborhood to Earth of us .
The Indigenes are not nor the same initial sentimental sentimental people .
There is no space for these things in the evil Asmat , or in the Asmat the eyem of the Tibet , but because of the time and the rituals , they created a mystic mystic of the Earth is not about a very much much more , but on a very much more , the idea that Earth can live just because it &apos;s infected by human knowledge .
What does that mean ?
It means that a kid of Ande that Ande you can create a lot of the mountain is an Apu spirit will bring his dest to be a deeply different , and it &apos;s going to have a very different relationship with the mountain or that place that you can create a lot of the mountain or that mountain is a amounts of rocks that a mountain is a amounts of rocks to be scan .
which is the dimmora of a spirit or a mineral himself .
What is interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between individuals and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia Britannica , and they were widers , and they were going to be cut .
And that I got a different human being different from my friends Kwakiutl that people are believe that the forests are the dimora of Hukukukukukukuknibal , which are living in the world , which are going to extrnorthern world , spirits that live in the Hamsa .
If you start to consider that these cultures can actually create different , you can start to understand some of them , you can start to understand some of them sensational discoveries .
I took this picture to open this picture to open the Amazon ninin-theorony .
Maybe some of you &apos;ve heard about the ayahuask , the most powerful psychoactive substance psychoptional repertorial .
What makes it fascinating by the ayahuask is not the drugs of the substance , but his elaboration . It &apos;s compost by two elements .
On one side , this liana legning , that has a series of bird , hardly and hardly , hardly hallucinogene .
You know , by trying to the only plant , it has a smoke that alter a little bit of the consciousness , but it &apos;s mixed with the leaving leaving leaving leaving leaving leaving .
This plant contains powerful powerful , very similar to the serotonin , dimethyppptamine , dimethyptamine .
If you ever see the Yanomami pull on the hip of the hidden , which is a different set of species , anchy , it &apos;s a methyptamine .
Thirating that dust on the bird is a bit like to be shown by a little bit like a bulb bar and lasts on a sea sea of electricity . &#91; Risate &#93; Not a distortion of reality .
I got often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has taken the pissssnawarm , with his discovery of the hallucinogens in the 1930 in Mexico .
In my taps , you can &apos;t have a classification of these triptamine as hallucinated handed . And if you can &apos;t tell no one of being hallucinated .
It &apos;s possible to assume , if they &apos;re abunte with chemicals that would denian MAO .
Now , it &apos;s great : the bird bird that you &apos;re in this liana is inininjewiters , the same kind of need to be able to be a trtrtrtrtrouble . The question is spontaneous in a 80,000 species of plants , like these people are doing these people in there , which are two defologically not similar , but that if you can make these people have to be a chemical deeper per sum of the parts of the way ?
We use the great eufemism of the evidence and the mistake , which can revealgar .
But if we ask the Indians , they say , &quot; We &apos;ll say , &quot; We talk about it . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuasmarks , which you know , they can tell neply in the forest , and that they would come in in the same species .
If you ask them how they stick their tasses say , &quot; I thought , &quot; I thought , &quot; I think of the plants , of the rest of it ? &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : You take 17 variety in a dinner , and each other will be a different tone .
With this not graduate Harvard at Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than contact the stami .
Now , &#91; applausers &#93; the problem is that also the ones of us that have to the heart people who have to be painted , but somehow reducts to the margins of history than our real world , and it &apos;s passes over .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it &apos;s not going to remember his wars or its technological innovations , but rather like the one was in which we stopped and we abbraced it , and we used acted actively , or a lot of biological diversity and cultural diversity of the planet . Now , the problem is not the change .
All the cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibility of life .
And the problem is not technology .
Indians Sioux , they don &apos;t stop to be Sioux when they put it from arco and freceived as Americans have no stop stop being American when they put from the horse and hot .
It &apos;s not change or technology , or technology that mines the etnosphere . It &apos;s power .
The hard hard hard to domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you &apos;ll find that these are not destined to disappear .
They &apos;re living creatures and dynamic in the existence from existence from the existence of identifable things that go beyond their adaptation .
It &apos;s what it is disbosament in Penan --
a nomads of Sarawak , in the West , in the asian , a people who lived in the forest to a generation , and now reduced to a generation , and now reduction on the rivers of the rivers , where you can see the river of the rivers that looks like to take a half of Bornewsplit , where you can see the river , where the smoon , and the horizon , and now ,
ready to reempire the welling of the woom on the forest .
or , in the Yanomami , are the diseases that came with the discovery of the gold .
If we put us on the mountains of the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research research , you &apos;ll see the hard hard hard to see the dominant of policy .
As you know the genocide , the extinction of a people , is conducted at universal level , but the ethnic destroyle , the destroyle of life , not only is constyle , but I also dealth in certain certain environments , because it &apos;s part of development .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of the Tibet until you go from the beginning .
I spent the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in China , Western Tibet , coming in Lhasa with a young connected , but only came to Lhasa with a young connectank , but only came to Lhasa young , and I realized what we &apos;re talking about .
6,000 monuments sacries reduces in dust and centered .
1.2 million people killed from the military during Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical at Panchen Lama .
The one means that it was killed at the time of Chinese invasion .
Hopo uncle , in Sainity during the diaspora that has brought the people in Nepal .
Has mother was imprisoned and her her her hit was to be rich .
It was brought to birth to be born in two birth birth to be born by two bird bird , because it couldn &apos;t live without him .
The sister , which made the same , it was mitted in reeducation .
One day has inverted a day hot , a fascion , and , for this transgrsion , was mitted at the time , it was mitted to seven years .
The Tibet of the Tibet can be insopposable , but the spirit of the people is from the present .
At the end , all it reduces to a choice .
We want to live in the world monocromatic world , or we want to take the policy world &apos;s policy ?
The great anthropologist at Margaret Mead , before we die said that his biggest landscape was that , in our going to go to this view of the world , not only we can see the whole gamma of human imagination to a limited bit of thinking , but a day we &apos;ll wake up by a lay , and a day we &apos;ll see it up to the lay that there were other possibilities .
And it &apos;s equipment to remember that our species is exist for 600,000 years .
The Neolitica Neolitica , which has given us agriculture , which has done us to socking on the seed , replace the poetry of the skin with the prosclero , by making the prosclero , by making the hierarchy of specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has been 300 years .
That &apos;s what we don &apos;t suggests me that we have answers to all the challenges that we have to deal with the challenges that we have to deal with the militlennia .
When you do these miriades of cultures the world is asked what they want to say to be human , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all all referred the possibility of being what we are : a kind of conscious species , that has to make all the people and the gardens can fire .
I took this on the northern extremity of Baffin , when I went to cover the coat bank with the Inuit , and this man , Olayers , and this man , Olaya , and he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The government government doesn &apos;t always be gentile with the Inuit and in the 1950s to stab our southern , we have them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refused to go .
The family , I &apos;m going to take it all my life , and he took them all the bedroom .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t have the cold , they do it .
The pieces of the sliters in origin were made of fish flying in skin skin .
The grandfather of this man didn &apos;t put it up from the artica or the bylizard that was suffering .
It &apos;s gacted the panteem , and it &apos;s hot the panteage in your hand . When I did it . When I did it frozen , and they work by creating a lama .
It &apos;s got salive on the punishes of this clock , and when it &apos;s solid , he killed a dog .
It has a bright shelter and created a bridly daughter , and he has a snap , has a samp , and it &apos;s disappear to the bang , and it &apos;s gone on the flap .
We want to talk about horries with nothing ? &#91; Risate &#93; And this , in different ways , &#91; Applausi &#93; is the symbol of the people of the Inuit and of all the Indians and the world .
In fact , in 1999 , the government reduced to Inuit , the total control of a larger territory area of the largest area of California and Texas mitted .
It &apos;s their new paint . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a independent territory . They all the minerary resources .
One of the snatione-state can reconcilized by a state can reconcilie with his people .
And , finally , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious to the people who of us in these remote areas of us , and realized that they don &apos;t remote engage .
It &apos;s for somebody .
They open seat the human imagination that they &apos;re going to the alba of time . And for us all of these children , as dreams , the dreams of our children , they become part of the geography of the hope .
To finish , we of National Geographic , we have convince that politicians will never come to anything .
We believe that polemc --
&#91; Applausers &#93; not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best institution to tell stories about the world &apos;s stories . Every month our site . Every month our site .
556 countries transmitted our dog television .
Our magazines are loud of millions .
Our work is traveling in the ethnosphere to bring our public public in places of wonderful cultural and the way they saw and , hopefully , it will be abled by how they saw and , hopes , they will be able to find a central revealist in a world , and we have to find a lifetime in a pluralist and multiculticulticulticultural in a pluralist and multiculticulticulticultural in a world , and mal ,
where the wisdom of all the people can contribute to our well-being .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope you &apos;ve heard and take some of the things that you &apos;ve heard and try to evidence some connections , in case you don &apos;t notice .
I would like to start with what I call &quot; the dogma official dogma . &quot;
The dogma official dogma official what ?
The dogma official official society . The dogma official dogma official dogma official , &quot; If we want to the maximize of our citizens . &quot;
The reason , from one side , in fact that the freedom is in itself , in fact that the liberty , essential , for human beings .
On the other one of us , in fact that if we are free , each of us can agree to do everything that that massive our well-being , no one that &apos;s not a decide in our well-being , no one of us decision in our .
The way of massize liberty is massize the choice .
The more choices people , they &apos;re libing , and the more is their freedom , the largest freedom , is their well-being .
This is so depth in society that no one of the society that no one would dream of going to be a doubt .
And it &apos;s also deeply rown in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has been possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m going to put a simple notes on conditions for injumped .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditional olium , no contact of olium extrant oliio and the 12 hacets you can buy a huge number of conditional condition of the in-in-in-surrounded round of the 175 depend of your degree .
That &apos;s what the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic store , to buy a stereum : cast , lettor CD , radio , lifer , light ,
And in this single store , there &apos;s a big number of audio components .
We can make six million different combinations using the components that there are in a only store .
You have to admit that there &apos;s tangry .
Other fields : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all the phones that were wired by mobile phones that were provided by mothered Bell .
They were nolegant the phone , you didn &apos;t buy it .
One of that , in the other , was that the phone never publicict .
These days , they went .
We now have a lot of phones , especially between phones , especially between cell phones .
Here &apos;s the cell phones .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , MP3 , cutting the birds of birds , and forgotten cropped .
If you didn &apos;t see it still seen in the store under house , you &apos;re very much , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , if you didn &apos;t see it in the store , you know , you know , if you didn &apos;t see it in the house , you know , you know , if you didn &apos;t see it .
And what &apos;s going to the end is that people get in the store and that question . And you know what is the answer ? The answer is &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t make too many things .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the acquissues of the acquired , the same explosion of choices .
Holden healthcare : not that happens in the United States that you go from doctor and the doctor you &apos;re going to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do it , or good , we could do it ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Dr. &quot; Dr. , what should I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; You have these benefit and these risks , and B has these benefits and these risks . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you reach , &quot; Dr. if she was me , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor : &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result we call it &quot; self-self-self-self-self-self-self-assume that it does seem to be a beautiful thing .
But it &apos;s not that you can move the fish and responsibility to make decisions that you know something , which is the doctor , or you know , which is the doctor , in someone else that doesn &apos;t know -- and it &apos;s not in the ideal condition -- and so not in the patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing of products of drugs , direct people like me and you , if you think about it doesn &apos;t make any sense , because if you think you don &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why they public them ?
The answer is that they want to ask them to ask them to ask them to ask them to change the round .
Something about this fundamental as our identity is our identity issue , is a question of choice , as you can &apos;t want to forced children . They &apos;ll not want to forced children . They &apos;ll be the right now , &quot; We have to invent it .
And we can reinvented it .
The one that means that every morning , at the risis , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I got the most preserved and matriage , a long time , the common perspective , almost for anyone , was that you marriage , and it started to make the more preserved possible , and they started to make the more preserved possible .
The only real choice was in who , not when , and not even what to do after .
I do it , it &apos;s really playing .
I teach students very smart students , and I &apos;m going to be able to work than a time .
And not because they &apos;re not very brilliant , because they &apos;re not not because they &apos;re not less diligent .
but why are they immense , you know , &quot; Do I mean , I should say , &quot; I sposes or not ? I should do it now ? &quot;
&quot; I should be worried later ? I got to think before the children or to career ? &quot;
They &apos;re interrogative interrogation .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this implica not to complete the hibits that I don &apos;t get a good voice to my exame .
And they have to do it . They &apos;re important .
Now , the job : we &apos;re lucky , as Carl underlying , because technology allows us to work every day , from every day , from every day , from the Hotel Randolph .
It &apos;s a parentesesesthetic coroline , and I won &apos;t tell no one where the Within , where the Wisti is working .
I don &apos;t say that , because I want to use me .
What does this amazing freedom of choice that we have about work ? Is it going to continuously decide , continuously , if we have to work or not .
We can go to the gain of the gyard , with cell cell cell in a pocket , Blackberry in the other , and the notebsite , and the noteba bynthrog .
And even if they &apos;re all spending , every minute we see our son , we &apos;re asking , we &apos;re asking , &quot; I said , &quot; I said , &quot; I said , &quot; I said to that call it ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? I got to email this letter ? &quot;
And also when the answer is &quot; no , &quot; No , &quot; that makes the experience of your son very different than what would would be in other conditions .
So , anywhere we look at , small things and big , things and things , life is a choose of choices .
Once the world was this : That &apos;s that there were some possibilities , but it wasn &apos;t a question of choice .
The world of today is looking at this : The dilemma is , &quot; Is it something positive , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Solder .
The positive laws we all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative .
All this choice is two negative effects on people .
The first , paradoxally , is that makes paralysis that makes paralyssis .
With many options between which choose , becomes very difficult to do it .
You give you a significant example : a significant study of the volunteer of voluntarily .
And my colleague had access to Vanguard data , the gigantic company of pension , with about a million climate climate , with about a million climate climate ,
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in the more , the percentage of adesion two percent .
With 50 sourds , there &apos;s 10 percent in less than adhesions that you have only only five . Why ?
Because with 50 sourds of which choose , is sick hard decide , and the choice is reduced to the intomorrow .
And in domans , and still domans , domans , and of course , tomorrow , and of course , tomorrow , and of course , tomorrow , and of course , tomorrow , and of course , tomorrow , and of course , tomorrow , and of course , tomorrow , and , of course , tomorrow , and , of course , tomorrow ,
You know it doesn &apos;t only mean that these old work from old people who are lgering food for dog because they &apos;re not going to have enough money , you know , even the decision is so that they lose the complementary of work .
They &apos;re not going to be losing , they &apos;re losing up to five dollars for a year from dator of work , which would be very displace to versaries .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think it makes the world .
&quot; And to finish , for the ethernity : ketchup , or hurgonese ? &quot;
You would like to take the right decision , if it &apos;s for the ethernity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong wrong , and yet the condition .
So this is the first effect . The second one is that even if we can avoid the parallee and make a choice , at the end , we are less satissssssatisssssssatissssssent with less options .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of condition of which you choose , if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that would have been better . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us to the hamamong the option of choice , and the remarkable reduction demining the demining , declined by the decision , and the remarket-demining , and the remarkable reavated decreation ,
And also when it was a very good decision .
The more choices there are , more , it &apos;s easy to be unfortune than any detail that is insoddisplease .
And , there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunities .
Dan Gilbert has clearly good stamp as the value we are on the value of the depends on what we can compare .
From the rest , when there are many options of possible possible , it &apos;s easy to represent the alternative of the option of alternative shot and be less sation-in option that you have choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I use with all the ones that are not New York .
But that &apos;s what you &apos;re probably going to think .
There &apos;s this copy to Hamptons .
A place of lense .
It &apos;s all for them . Ottttle . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not miss . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , no builder , it &apos;s Agust . &quot;
&quot; All my neighborhood in Manhattan is on . &quot;
&quot; I could parking right in front of home . &quot;
And it &apos;s going to move from the idea that it &apos;s losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The costo-opportunities demining the soddisfation for what we have , even when the choice is excellent .
And the more are the options that we have to consider , the more the actual features will be going to be able to be a costo-opportunity .
Here &apos;s another one .
This is a living there is a lot of things .
It &apos;s about the moment , and maybe of living it .
But the most important point is that anything you choose , you choose to not do the other .
The things that we don &apos;t choose many attractive attractive that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : the growing sters of the expectations of the expectations .
I tried to my skin bought a new new jeans .
It &apos;s almost always jeans .
Once jeans were just like , you bought and wwire them and dress a lot of times , just after they brought them a whole lot of times , they started going to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple of new when those old people were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Li &apos;s going to be fit , and fit ? &quot;
You want to be in the cernier or with the bottons ? &quot; Stonejjjjjejjejjejjejejejejejejejejejejejejjejejejejejobs ? &quot;
&quot; Li you want to be struggle ? &quot;
&quot; You know , &quot; Suck them , &quot; Continubla , &quot; Continugly .
I was saleans , and after a little bit I could say , &quot; I want the guy , that was the only guy , &quot; I mean , &quot; I mean , &quot; I &apos;m just like , &quot; I did jeans , then I went out from the store , and then I went out from the store , I had .
It was the very good . With all that I had the best .
But I was worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse or is that with all that choice my expectations were altising , jeans had to be perfect .
I was minimes . I didn &apos;t expected anything that I was not expected to be a kind of , but when you saw 100 different , but when you saw 100 different , steps , at least a kind of thing .
What I had to buy was good , but not perfect .
After I paragoned that I was insodly , I was insodly in the expectations .
The added options in life of the people do not do that increasing the expectations that these have respect to the options of the same options .
And this will make less swarming , even when the results are good .
No one in the world of marketing , and it &apos;s not a place in the marketing ,
Because if they knew , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more like this .
&quot; It was better when he was worse , &quot; The reason why he was better when it was worse , or it was worse that when you were worse , you can meet the surprise .
We &apos;re living in the world in which we live -- opulent , industrialized citizens with the expectancy -- the most we can hope is that things are at the althetic alalalthids .
You never surprised to pleasant because your waiting and waiting , my waiting waiting , and I &apos;m ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Blulue waiting it . &quot;
I mean -- I &apos;m a little authographic moment -- that I &apos;m really married and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t have any junk .
But it doesn &apos;t always be a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of the bought a couple of jeans , when there &apos;s only that kind of jeans is that when you &apos;re not ssationfffed , and you ask , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot; The answer is clearly .
The world is the responsible . What could I do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a unddisfacing , and you ask you who is the responsible , is the obvious , it &apos;s just just clear that the responsible you are .
You could have done better .
With hundreds of varieties , there are not excuse for the insuccessful .
So when people make decisions , even though the result is valid , they feel inssatisssssatisssssatissssssssed .
In the last years , the depression is explained in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this honest depression is just that people have deludent experiences because the standard are too allowed .
And when they have to explain this that the cold is their hoth .
So the final outcome is that we &apos;re better better , and we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it is completely fake .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than having it . It didn &apos;t have any doubt , but it didn &apos;t have a lot better .
There is a critical value , magical value . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve overed by a piece of the level where the choices are going to improve our life .
Now , from the political point of view -- I &apos;ve almost finished -- from the political point of view , the nocy is the following .
What allows all this in the industrial society is the wealth of the material .
There are many places in the world , and you know about it , where the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too paired .
So the factory I &apos;m talking about is a malleaving of modern , rich , the Western society .
And what it does depressing and angry is this : Steve Levitt told you yesterday about how those expensive and seats for biapes are useful . It &apos;s a split of money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and dispendiose , it &apos;s not that they are just useful .
I &apos;m very deleterie .
They do it worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows , you to have a lot of choice , not just that we could not just do their life to improve , but also our .
This is what economists call a department .
A redistribution of income re-income redistribution of this , not only to poor -- because of this choice in this excess .
To conclude , &quot; Filla , you can become everything you want . &quot;
You know , people of culture , you think , &quot; What does that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t do anything in a glass of glass . &quot;
&quot; A sense of castrated , a limited view of the world --
and I interpret it , I interpret it .
But then , I realized , instead , I realized that that that fish knows the long knows the long .
Because the reality of the fact of the fact is that if you &apos;re missing the boccia , so that you can &apos;t get the freedom . You don &apos;t get the freedom . You can &apos;t get the paralysis .
If you break the boccia in the way that everything you can diminds the soddisfation .
You get the paralge , and you reducing the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too stretch , maybe even for fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of some symbolic , is a round for the inhappiness and , I &apos;m going to hang out of the rovine .
Thank you .
