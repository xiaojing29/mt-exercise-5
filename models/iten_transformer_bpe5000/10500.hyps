So last year I showed these slides to show that the calculus that the calculus , which is a three million years of the United States continent , the size of the 48 United States continent , is restruggle of 40 percent .
But that &apos;s the gravity of the problem because it &apos;s not exhip the problem because it &apos;s not exhip of ice .
The calculus of the artics of the climate system .
It &apos;s expanded up and you get summit .
The next slide will be a remarkable re-up , the next time is the last 25 years .
The glasses are sheep , are signed in red .
You can see , you get to the blue skills .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter , which you &apos;re required .
You can see that the cosidice will lose , five years or more , is like the blood , that &apos;s like the blood , which is the body , which is that &apos;s going to be .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been from so ,
This is a problem because the rewarming interestingly , the land of the ocean , where there are huge amount of coal coal that , sounds are , sounds , they &apos;re going to be transformed in metan .
I &apos;m going to the totalities of the inquination atmospheric , that can be double , that &apos;s very double , that &apos;s very much of not return .
In some four-foot lagues in Alaska metan is already already in the water .
The professordered Katey Walter of the University of Alaska is a team print .
Video : Wow ! Gore : Wow ! The question is if we &apos;re going to be it .
A reason is that this scary scary scary surring the Groenland .
This is a rule at regime .
And the portation has never reached the levels .
This is the Kangerlussuaimics , in the southern ovest of the Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea level of the sea payers on the ground , here is where the sea .
These current current currently .
On the other part of the planet : Antartide , the largest block of ice the planet .
The last month , the scientists have diclared that the ice of the ice is in negative , and the Antarccccy , which is particularly relief , is particularly relief in the sun .
It &apos;s about six feet of the actual level of actual actual , like in Groenland .
Sulle Himalaya , the third largest block of ice , you see new lagues , which few years ago were glasses .
The 40 percent of the world &apos;s replaced half of the water water .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of water .
The ported is increased .
But when it deminds , the same happens to water .
In California , the nnow of the Nevada is deminuity of 40 percent .
The hysics are crisis .
The previous , like you read , are grant .
The growing certainly in the world door to a reach of the inceness of the inceness .
Masers are increasing a roling out of the normal and without previous .
Four times more of the last 30 years I was the previous .
This is a remarkable witness .
If you look in the historical context , you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day .
Look at the middle of the Pacific area , the United States of the United States , and on both both of the subcontinent , where there &apos;s a radical radical impoversed in the oceans .
The greatest cause of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the 20 percent , is the use of fuel .
The oil is a problem , and the coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two of the world with the more emissions , together to China .
And he proponed to build a lot of other central central .
But we &apos;re seeing a change .
These are the annullayers in the last years and some of the alternative .
At every way , there &apos;s a politics in our country .
The industrial and oil have speso 250 million dollars in the last year for promote the last year for promote the fuel , which is a symbol .
And that was reminded me to something --
I &apos;ve been a 3.8 billion liers , where I live , there &apos;s been a loss of 3.8 billion liers of the coal fasters .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen it about the news .
This is the second largest flow of the flow of the deepest in America .
It &apos;s happened around Natal .
The advertising one of the coal industrial industrial .
Video : His , you know , the carbon carbon is a kind of allegro and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it &apos;s grow our economy .
Frosrosium the carbon is always more pulit .
It &apos;s good at the price , adorable and the workers are the workers .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The largest society is Massey Coal . This is the Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Mr. Blankenship : I &apos;m going to be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Peloses , Harry Reid -- don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Allem &apos;s the Poth of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is a one of them , a part .
Video : Think : The ALergy we see climate change as a sweet .
For this our priority is to invest a big amount of money in a confused to make public public and confused to make it .
In fact , the fuel is not sports .
We think it &apos;s pulit -- it &apos;s also a good profumo .
So you don &apos;t prerate about climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Those Carbone : Those Carbone -- you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
So let &apos;s do a lot of a structure at the avanating structure for how to fuel fuel .
Straordinarian ! The machines are a little rumorous , but this is the sound of the technology of fuel .
The consumption is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology , but the remarkable technology of fuel that you see changed everything .
You have a look at this is the odiern technology of the fuel .
Al Gore : Inend , the positive alternative is connected to the economic security and the national security .
Video : The America is in the crisis ; the national security , the national security , the climate crisis .
The philo that connected to all : our dependence of fossil fuel , like the fuel and oil .
But , there &apos;s a new , audacy solution to use it .
Rey America : 100 percent of the energy , in 10 years .
A plan to put America in the work , to make us more safe , and help stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that basts to solve our problems .
It &apos;s going to America . It &apos;s more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It &apos;s about rere-energy energy energy in America .
One of the faster ways of brains of the dependence of the fuel that kills our planet .
Comparsa : The future is here . Very , a new energy .
Comparty : Negi investimate for jobs .
PPurture : Rey America . It &apos;s time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old old proverbio African says , &quot; If you want to go to the speed , go to the way .
If you want to go away , you go back . &quot;
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
last year at TED , I did a introduction on the LHC .
And promise to reach you to reach you to get to the car .
So , the other time , and for the other time , there were no , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment that I &apos;ve ever tried -- 27 miles of circles .
His is to rereach the conditions that were less than a billion times at the beginning of the universe -- until the beginning of the universe -- until we have 600 million times a second .
All that &apos;s simply environmental .
This is the car under Ginevra .
And in the rying these threi-Big Bang inside the relevators .
This is what work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- is largo , 44 feet and has a diameter of 22 feet .
This is a picture of AS picture of AS in building that you can see the proportions .
The 10 security of last year we have access to the car .
And this photograph was taken by AS .
It was because of immense of the crising of control .
It &apos;s a picture of particle that he had done all the around the LHC , entring in the collision , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles in the wellow .
In other words , when we see that the 10 secember , the ember that the car worked , the car worked , which is a great vitory .
I don &apos;t know if it was to do that , he &apos;s going to do that , when somebody went on Google and vide that the page was this .
That means we have a cultural impact beyond that scientific .
About a week later , there was a problem with the car , had to these films here -- these films dorders .
These files take 13,000 ampches when the car works at the very very much of the power .
Now , the technical of you will look at the philes and they &apos;re going to say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . They &apos;re very much . &quot;
And instead of it can do it because when they &apos;re very cold to become the superconducted .
So , at least 271 degrees , at a nururer temperature in the stars , these files can bring that current .
In one of the giunture between the most of the magnetic of the LHC , there was a defest of factory .
So the films re-up lap , and the 13,000 buling bits suddenly met a electrical resilience .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think that these magnetic magnetic fish , and that they moved about 30 centimeters , and that they &apos;re moving about 30 centimeters .
It &apos;s damage about 50 magnetic .
We had to tall , what we did .
We have repressed and reports .
Now they &apos;re going back to their place underneath them .
The end of the end of the LHC will will be again .
We &apos;re going to take it , and we expect to get the data to juice or the lie , and continue so our adventure to find what are the morning that we &apos;re going to find the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these crying crying the value of the human human engineering and the engineering of frontier . It &apos;s easy to confront .
I think that &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s so hard , I think that &apos;s the value of things like LHC .
I &apos;d like to conclude with the words of a Inglory , Humphrey , which , I guess , in the defense of inutionary inutionary , his own , and he was Michael Faraday , and he said , &quot; No is a dangerous , that the human mind , which is not so dangerous for the progress of the human mind is , that we have no sters in nature , which is not to be a consters of the way of the monkeys are not .
Thank you .
I want to start asking you about when , you know , you &apos;re going to do when , you &apos;re playing the morning .
Whereas you &apos;re reaching them , and take them , and you get them , and you learn to think and solve problems and re-resulting .
The space is deeply connected to the way we understand the world around us .
So , by the usual inspired by usual usual , with the physical objects , together to my consequent Pacts , and the collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of the mouse as a computer , you can have the only one of the mouse that we move on a digit , we can get a lot of errage , we can get the hands of the hands ,
and fix it to our pleasure ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the Siftable .
In words , a Siftable is a computer interactive computer like a biscan .
In words , a Siftable is a computer interactive computer like a biscan .
You can move with the hand , they can move with the hand , they can see the movement and they have a screen and have a radio .
But especially , they &apos;re physical objects , like the morning , you can move it .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physical , you know about the other movement , the other , and they &apos;re going to be more physical , and they &apos;re going to be more physical , the other , of how we move them , we can explore new and fun of interaction .
I &apos;m going to try to do with some simple example .
This is configured to show video : if you &apos;re going to show video : if you &apos;re going to reach it , if you &apos;re going to get it , if you &apos;re going to get back .
These interactive reactive are awful of the other people .
If you do them , you &apos;re interested in what &apos;s about their own around .
If they &apos;re circles , you see it and they can agitate it .
If they &apos;re circles , you see it and they can agitate it .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting interesting interesting is that one of the interaction was the able to use of the data , to say , &quot; a color like , &quot; a color like if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configured like the sounds of green , and I can use them to the color , where they &apos;re going to get .
and I can use them to the color of the central , where they &apos;re going to get it .
If we &apos;re too , we can get it a little bit about place .
I &apos;m also beings the possibility of apprint , like the languages , the mathematics and games where people can try to try things , and see the results .
I &apos;m going to --
This is a Fibonacks that I do a a program of equations .
Here we have a words that &apos;s half a play of the Scarabean and Boggle .
It &apos;s basically , at every turnal time on every Sifty , in every Sifty , in every Sifair , and while you &apos;re trying to do it . And while you &apos;re trying to understand him .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you get a new set of letter and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the kids came in the Media Lab , I did it in a way that I tried them and I went and turned a video .
They &apos;re like to do .
And one of the interesting things of this is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
You just say , &quot; You know , &quot; You know , &quot; How of words , and they know what to do .
Here &apos;s the other people provide it .
This is our own newest tester , there &apos;s the most young people there , there .
It &apos;s actually wanted to be impilary .
They were only the morning , for him .
Now , this is an applied of a cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool for the apse of the languages of the languages .
It can put new characters in the scene , solating the Sifty , they &apos;re going to do it .
It can put new characters in the scene , solating the Sifty , they &apos;re going to do it .
Here &apos;s , it &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : The sun is sister .
David Merrill : Now he took a treatment in the scene .
Video : The treatment treatment .
Bel work ! Yeah ! Yeah !
So you shelting the Siftable and put them neighborhood ,
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing your story .
Video : Have !
DM : It &apos;s a very opened story , and it can decide him like to go .
DM : It &apos;s a very opened story , and it can decide him like to go .
Video : Vola , gat .
DM : The last example that I have the time to show you is a tool , to do a recent , to take it .
It &apos;s a tool , it &apos;s a tool , to take music .
The Siftable here are the suones like the basic , the bottom and the bacteria .
And you have four different variations , and you can pick what to use .
You can ininate these suons in a sequence of your pleasure .
And it just just touch a sound , &quot; and a sequence . &quot;
These are actually you can control from vivious , like the revers and the filter .
The acks to a particular particular sound and then incline to reach it .
And then there are general in the general of time and volume , which is apping to the whole sequence .
Let &apos;s look like .
Video : DM : We &apos;re going to do we &apos;re going to put a series of sequence , &quot; We &apos;re going to put it in a series , we add it , we add another basic .
I &apos;m going to put a bottom line .
Video : Now , I &apos;m going to adadded the percussions --
Video : And now I &apos;ll put the philer to the bacteria , so I can control the effect of the vious .
Video : DM : I can revelocize the whole whole sequence of inclining time from one side or the other .
Video : And now I &apos;m going to added the bottom for the bottom to give more expression .
Video : DM : I can rereflect the RRing . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to be planning , but I can suddenly make it more , and make it more , and it &apos;s a long ,
And now , I can smoking the whole sequence of inclining the whole whole sequence of the left . &quot;
Thank you .
So , you can see , my passion is to build new interface with human human human human human being works .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the results of this perspective , and also some possibilities that we &apos;re going to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that we get this new generation of design design to interact with digital media , that will bring information in our world .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the right now of you all .
I &apos;m a scritice .
See books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the fascinating of my life .
And I don &apos;t know that it can change .
But , he said this , something particular happened in my life and in my career , and I &apos;ve got to reach the entire relationship of this work .
The particular thing is that I &apos;ve recently recently written this book , this biography called &quot; Mangia , Prega , Am , &quot; which , the diversity , for some reason to come out of the world and become a great , and he became a big sensational , .
And the result is that everywhere , you &apos;re going to do now , people treating how if I was going to reach .
It &apos;s true -- I &apos;m going to do .
They &apos;re all about me now , and they &apos;re all worried and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t have a fair to do ?
You don &apos;t have afraid to write for all life without life without able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can importance ? &quot;
that can importantly what can you think about someone ? &quot;
It &apos;s ruring , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember that I remember that I remember that I &apos;m 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a scriter .
I was going to be based on the landscape .
And people say , &quot; Don &apos;t you have to have success ?
You don &apos;t have afraid that the ulights ?
You don &apos;t have painting this to make this whole whole life without anything that &apos;s going to come out and to die on a cumb of a cumb of the sets of the wild of failure ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer is -- the short answer all of these questions is , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
Yeah , I &apos;m afraid of all of those things .
I &apos;ve always had painting .
And I also have a lot of other things that people can &apos;t ininate .
As the algae and other things are spaving .
But , what I think about it , what I thought and I would ask me , why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logical that anyone would expect to be spaving from a work that you &apos;re born .
But what &apos;s so particular in the implant entry to make us nervous about the mental health . And so that the other career don &apos;t they ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and not remember one time in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was engineering ?
There was never -- that block of the engineering of John , how do it ?
It wasn &apos;t working like this , you know ?
Onestly , the engineers like a group don &apos;t have any of course , in the centuries , reputing the reputing of being alolized .
We have enough this reputation , we have enough this reputers , but creativity of all this , we have this reputation of a very unable unable .
And it &apos;s not going to look at the triste of the magnificent of the magnificent people , only in the 20th century , they &apos;re going to die and often often .
And the ones that don &apos;t have suicked to be really disappeared by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , &quot; Each book has killed me a little more . A extraordinary business about life .
But we don &apos;t take it because we &apos;ve heard of this stuff , because we &apos;ve heard these things so much of the way we &apos;ve been interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and the sufference are in a way of the way of the edition that the ideas and that art , at the end , and the art , at the end , will always be at the angosence .
And the question I want to take all here today is : you agree with this idea ?
It &apos;s good for that -- because it &apos;s also looking at a little bit of a distance to me .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s dangerous and I don &apos;t want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better encouraging our big creative creative creative people to live .
And I know that , in my case -- in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start to be able to start out to the circumstances , especially you get the circumstances where I &apos;m in my career .
That &apos;s true -- you look , are a young young , I have about 40 years .
I &apos;ve still got about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything I &apos;m going to write about now , and it will be jured from the world as the work that he came after it .
I &apos;m going to be skills , because we &apos;re all more or less friends here -- is likely that my big success is to my spread .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that the person &apos;s kind of a person to start blow in the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would continue to do this work we do this work that we do this work we do .
So , the question is , how do it ?
And so I think , after a lot of thinking , that the way to work to continue to write is to create a protective psychological psychological psychological , OK ?
I have to find a distance of security between me , which I &apos;m writing , and the natural natural thing about what he &apos;s written can get it . And while I was trying to look through the time , trying to find other society to see if they could have have to have the best ideas and more sane ideas and more sane ideas and more sane and more sane ideas and more sane ideas .
How to help people people who are constantly to manage the inherent of creativity .
And that research has brought me to the ancient Grex and ancient Rome .
You &apos;re going to go to the circle and then go back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people don &apos;t seem to believe that creativity sell creativity sell ?
It was thinking that the creativity was this spirit is looking at the divine and that sell men from a few surprising and unknown .
The great-called these divini spirits of the demons of creativity . &quot;
Socpitely , he believed to have a demone that elargive to have a deeper .
The Romani were the same idea , but they called the the kind of spirit without the genius .
The one is great , because the Romani didn &apos;t think that a genius was somebody who were in particularly intelligent .
They believe that a genius was this kind of divine that he believed in the walls of a neighborhood of a artist , a little bit like the elsewhere the element is , and that it &apos;s going to be a bunch of the work and models the outbreak of the work of that work .
Here &apos;s eastonishing -- here is the distance of what I talk -- that is the distance of your work .
And all of the ones that was so that he worked , right ?
So the artists were protected by certain things , like the too narcism , not ?
If your work was excited , you couldn &apos;t get it and everything to deserve , all of the way , all they were helped by this genium encoureum .
If your work failed , it wasn &apos;t all your hit , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a inable .
And so the people are concept creativity in the West for a long time .
Then the Rince came and everything is going to change , and they &apos;re going to be in the middle of the universe on the universe over all of the and the mysters and no more and the mysters and no more to leave space in the divinity .
This was the principle of human human human . And people started thinking that creativity came out of the ishment .
And for the first time , in the story , you start to reference this or that artist as a very much person with the genius of genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big error .
I think it &apos;s going to allow someone , a simple person to believe that you can be like a recipe , the essence and the sistence and the sisters of all the mysters , creative , unknown and eternation is a responsibility for a phililillion that human .
It &apos;s like to ask someone of ingoating the sun .
It &apos;s completely details the ego and believe all these ingestible ingestures .
And I think it was that pressure to destroyed artists in the mid-500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think that &apos;s , the question is , and now ?
Can we do it diversity ?
And the most ancient understanding of the most ancient of the relationship of the human relationship between human human relationship .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can &apos;t get 500 years of thinking in a speaking of a minute .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience that solgers would read the noticed of the notion of , initially , you do people are filled to do the people , and they &apos;re going to do their projects .
It &apos;s probably not convinced you all about this thing .
But the question I want to take is -- why not it ?
Why don &apos;t you think about this way ?
Because it has more sense of anything that I &apos;ve ever heard to explain the experating imprevedability of the creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever attempt to do something -- so , basically , all here -- you know , you don &apos;t understand .
And , in fact , it can sometimes seem completely paranororous .
I did this against recent , with the extraordinary poean . Ruth Stone , which has now 90 years , but he was a very few years , but he was a very very few , and said that I was in the front of the Virginia , and he felt it , in the front of the front of the Virginia , and he was a poetry to be .
She said that it was like a fragorous .
And that came up to her to go from the landscape .
It felt it , because he was going to do the ground under its feet .
He knew a one thing to do to do that point and was , his words , &quot; to go to a match . &quot;
And he was going to go back to the house and he was follow this poetry , and it would not have to get another piece of paper and a math , and it &apos;s going to be a piece of paper and sweet it .
At three times I couldn &apos;t be fast , so correal , so correal and correal and correal without able to get the house and she would continued to roled through and she would continued to roled through the landscape , trying to reach through the landscape , trying to go to the house , trying to be a little bit , like she said , &quot; another few few . &quot;
Then there were those times -- this is not the size of the time I &apos;m going to -- there were moments where the was almost perdating , OK ?
So , he was going to go home and the poetry and poetry and poetry and poetry and he was going to go , and he said , that he was going to hell with the other hand and the hand .
It was offered the poetry from the coda and the carry . And he went to the page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be presented on the perfect page , but at the last word at the first word .
So when I felt -- it &apos;s afraid , it &apos;s exactly the same same same as a creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conducucucucucture .
I &apos;m a moving , and my way of work is ; I &apos;m going to wake up to the same orar every day and get us over the same orar orar , and to go up and go on .
But even I was in my testesty , I &apos;ve struck against that thing , sometimes .
And I think that a lot of you the han did .
You know , even though the work and ideas came to me to be a certain source of it , I could not be honestly .
And what &apos;s this thing ?
And how can we relate to it in a way to do not get the head , but , rather , what do do is going to be healthy ?
For me , the best example that I have the best example that I have the music music Tom Waits , which I interviewed was different years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life is the incarnation of the artist of the neighborhood of the neighborhood , trying to control , re-enabled these species of impulse .
But then I &apos;m going to invecked , and a day he was driving on a Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
It was going to be fast and everything about a little bit of a melodia of melodia , which is going to be in his head of inspiration , and you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the desyer , but it &apos;s not to know how to do it .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a math , it doesn &apos;t have a recorder .
So , he starts to hear this old old ange is growing in him like , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to slow , and I &apos;m going to get a soup .
I &apos;m not enough enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to go in the panic , you stop .
It &apos;s going to be the mental process and made something completely new .
He just looked at the sky and said , &quot; Sweet , don &apos;t see that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Ti seems to write a song now ?
If you really want to exist , you &apos;re more more more than you can get me .
Altrain , you &apos;re going to importantly like something else today .
I &apos;m going to disturbing Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And the work of the work of this is going to change after that .
Not the work , the work was still oscure as always .
But the process , and the fish of the fish that was that attordered the genius that was reduced when he took the genius out of him , and I went back to the other than problems and the problems and I went back to where they came back , and he was going to be a thing interorized .
but it &apos;s very well-like , wonderful , wonderful bizarre bizarre , a conversation between Tom and this straight and the outside that there was not Tom .
So , how the story that I was going to change a little bit , the way I was working and I was going to save a time .
This idea , I &apos;ll save me when I was writing , &quot; Many , Prega , Am , and fall in a one of the cave of the disperation that we &apos;re all working on something and we can &apos;t think that it &apos;s worst the worst of that is going to be the worst of the book .
Not just good , just the worst book written .
And I started thinking about geps this project .
But then I remember of Tom that I was talking about the air and I tried to get it .
So I get my face on the manoscritical and diress my head to a vacuum of the room .
And I said to a high vices , &quot; See , what if this book is not going to be happy , if this book will not be good , not going to be good , not going to be good ,
Because I &apos;m going to see , I &apos;m going to do that , I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want to be better , you have to presentation and do your part .
Okay . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , I don &apos;t do it .
I &apos;m going to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I would like to please that was recorded that I was presented to do my part , &quot; Because the end is so , OK -- the end is so , OK -- let &apos;s do the North Africa of people were dance to the dance of the North of people were dance and the lap and until the alba .
And they were always magnificent , because the ballerers were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every single , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became actually transcending .
And I know what I think about what , because I know , you &apos;ve all , to a point , a point , a performance .
It was like the time , you &apos;re stuned , and the ballerin a kind of portal and it wasn &apos;t different from the usual , like the 1,000 noticed , but it &apos;s all going to be .
And suddenly , you don &apos;t look like a human .
But it &apos;s accounted by the divinity of the divinity of the divinity .
And when this happened , the time , people know what was , they called it .
They were going to bunch , and they were starting to bleg , Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curious notes -- when the Main invaded Mors , I was the south of the Synal , I was going to do it , and the ready of it . &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , &quot; Allah , &quot; that you can still hear in the cord or in the flamenco .
In Spagna , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , I &apos;m magic , &quot; Allah , I &apos;m going to understand , &quot; uncomable , &quot; unable , &quot; uncomable , &quot;
And it &apos;s great because we need .
But , the problem comes the day , for the ballerine , when you &apos;re waiting and find that are the 11 of the morning of Martedday , and I &apos;m going to go out of God , there &apos;s no more .
It &apos;s just a dead dead with a lot of bad ginocnees , and maybe it &apos;s going to each of the althetic .
And maybe no one will be the name of God &apos;s still while , and so it has to do with his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most payers to do in a creative life .
But maybe it &apos;s not to be so angoscivy if you can &apos;t believe , advanced , which the most extraordinary of your being being ,
But it just just you get up to the data in prestired by a source of this team of your life that &apos;s part of your life that you have to get something else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think about this way .
And so I started thinking about , and it &apos;s certainly like the time , I thought about a different time in the work of the book that I &apos;m going to do , the dangerous , the dangerous , and I &apos;m going to think about my great success .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I I feel electric that is , not to have painting .
Not at the end . It &apos;s just your work .
It &apos;s about you , you &apos;re going to present for your hand , any can be .
If your work is balling , you &apos;re bleaving ,
If the divine , you &apos;re going to get a decide of you &apos;ll leave a few of wonderful , for a little bit of a wonderful time through your forces , then , then &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Otrain , you do the same dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot;
I think it &apos;s about it .
&quot; Ole ! &quot; to you know the same , even only for the testesty of the testesty to you get to reach .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
And as you know , I &apos;ve talked about some of the human genome , about what can significant and discovery of genes .
We &apos;re starting a new perspective : we have started to digitize the biology and now we &apos;re going to start out in a new phase of biology , we &apos;re going to do it .
We always tried to take big questions .
&quot; What is the life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists I think they have to try to understand vary varities .
We &apos;ve tried different approaches , reducing the minimi terms .
We &apos;re digitizing by almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the analogical world of the computer world .
Now , we ask , we can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species of the smallest genome that can authority in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome for crearch a little more .
We &apos;re able to eliminary a hundred genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of
But when we take a look at his map , metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our .
It &apos;s simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can get back , one of the genes that can bring a living in the living cell .
So we decided that the only one on to design is synthesize this cromosome in a way to get out of the components to take some of these questions .
And so we started the adventure of &quot; can synthesize a cromosome ? &quot;
Can we have the chemical chemical convictions that we never could do it ?
And , in case , we can make a cromosome ?
A cromosome is just a piece of chemical material .
The speed that we &apos;re able to digitize life is growing to rethink about life is growing .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , of designers , but it &apos;s going to be improving .
And our most recent results the results the take on a curve .
We &apos;re going to have over 15 years ago .
The process has required a lot of passages , starting with a review of the first experiments .
But we discovered that synthesize DNA is very hard .
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that producing little little segment , of the long of 30 to 50 letter to 50 letter and is a degenerating process : the most errors are .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these framments and correct the errors .
And this is our first attempt , to start from the digital genome of Phi 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
We have designed the frament fragments , actually , by the midance of the errors and get a molecule of about 5,000 letter .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material and we put it in bacteria , the bacteria , bacteria have inerte , bacteria have inerte to read that genetic code and make them viral particles .
The virals then they &apos;re reed by cells , they &apos;re back and they destroy the Eles .
I &apos;ve talked about a recent with members of the oil industry , say that they have certainly composed to this model .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build his same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in the big things .
We wanted to build the entire cromosome .
They &apos;re more than 580 mile letter code .
So we thought we &apos;re building it in casses of the size of the viruses of the virus , so that we can change the casses of a cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the actual acacy was a mid-basis .
We found , resequence , 30 errors . If we used that sequence . If we used that original sequence we &apos;ve never been able to do it .
A part of the process is designing ble-50 letter that you &apos;re repeating with all the other segers of 50 letter to build a little little bit of 50 letter to build a little little bit of the little bit of the time that work together .
We take a lot of unics here .
You &apos;ve probably read that we put it in the fire .
Think it , we have a genetic code on four letter : A , C , C , C and T.
Three of those letter would mate together , and they have a lot of acds , and there &apos;s a lot of letter , and there &apos;s a lot of letter .
So we can use the genetic code for words , frass , thoughts .
What we did at the beginning is authograin .
Some of them have been deluser than it was not poetry .
We &apos;ve been designed these segments to do just unire it with enzyme .
There are a enzyme that repair them .
And we started to assembling of the parts , starting with the size of seven midres , unendles in a way to form to form segers of 24 mila letter , and they &apos;re going to 72 mile letter .
For every step , we &apos;ve done these segments in abundents so that we can try to create a very much extremely roble-bustog -- like you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatically the process .
So , this seems like the tabellon a player of a basket .
When we get these segments very long , more than 100 wars , more than 100 basis , not going to grow more directly in E.
It &apos;s going to the limit of the modern biology .
So we &apos;ve considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called the Womologist , which in biology is that we use to repair the DNA to repair the DNA to unire the DNA to unquire the segers .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , we call the organism , called Deinoccurred three million rad of radiation .
You can see in the high path as his cromosome is destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly like that .
There &apos;s thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be struggle .
They can live under the vacuum .
They &apos;re absolutely absolutely that life exist in space , and you get to find new remarkable of water .
In fact , NASA showed that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built this , just using these processes , just using the lievil with the design appropriate .
The assemble them assemble .
This image is not been taken with a electronic microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a very big molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are photo that coprint a period of about six seconds .
This is the publishing that we did a little time ago .
They &apos;re more than 580,000 letter code .
It &apos;s the largest molecule of a defined structure that I &apos;ve ever created by the man .
It &apos;s a high molecular molecular weight .
If you &apos;re going to do it with a career , you want to take a career , we want to take 142 pages only to transtranslate this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ?
Of course , you have a virus .
It &apos;s a little more complicated when they use bacteria .
It &apos;s more simple when it &apos;s about eucariit &apos;s like our : you can just get nuclear nuclear and put another , which is basically the clonation of clonation .
In the archaea , the chromosome is , but we &apos;ve recently recently recently recently that we &apos;re able to do a trapial trapial of a cell to a cell to one and active .
We can clean a cromosome from a micbial species .
The two are different than men from mice .
We add some gene in the more way we could decide what to choose for this cromosome .
And then , he &apos;s sheled with the enzyme in a way to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell is studipendoes -- and open our graphic graphic graphic graphic sophicks -- the new cromosome is go inside the cell .
And we were thought we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to get more , but we tried to get more in there .
This is one of the majority of evolution .
We found that tantissim species have added a second or a third chromosome from some part , added of a second thousands of trillion new trust .
So who think about evolution as a gene of the time that it doesn &apos;t understand a lot of biology .
There &apos;s a enzyme called the enzyme of retrial that you can tell the DNA .
The cromosome was in the cell , not a one .
The cell phone at the phone that we have a pay-up .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other cromosome , and he recognized the other , has masticked , and we have been out with only the cell and the new cromosome .
It &apos;s become blue because of the genes we have added .
And in a short time , all the characteristics of a species are going to be lost , and it &apos;s transformed in a new species , based on the new software that we have pushed in the new software that we put in the cell .
All the proteins are changed , the memane , memane are change , and when we read the genetic code exactly what we have transfered .
Now , this may seem like genetics , but it &apos;s going to change things in a very very substantial .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that there is no genesis -- but progress to start from three million years and a half million years and a half of evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the explosion Cambrian where they &apos;re going to create new species .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s enough when we think about our necessity .
We &apos;re going to spend six billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
There are three people on the planet for each one existing in 1946 , in 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re getting problems now to find food , water , and clean , medical medical and wealth for six and a half billion people .
It &apos;s going to be more dair for a billion .
We use more than five billion bargate , more than 30 billion bars , more than 30 billion bars .
That means percent million barre-day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process of replacing them , it will be a huge challenge .
We need to understand the whole emission of CO2 emission from these materials that fins in the atmosphere .
And in today , because of the scientific discoveries that all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I love to think that are the design components for the future .
The electronics industry has only a dozen about components , and think about how many different things came out .
Our limits here are principles from the biological reality and from our imagination .
We have a techniques , because of these methods of synththththids , able to create what we call genomics .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can produce a million cromosomes a million cromes a day .
Think about processing these 20 million genes of different genes or try to optimize the processes to make it , new vaccines , we can change , because of a little team , and create more biology molecular than in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a selection .
We can choose for survival , the chemical production or fuel , production of ethc vaccines .
This is an ancient istic of some software programmed that we &apos;re working to be able to sederch and design species .
Well , we don &apos;t necessarily know how to be .
We know exactly what it &apos;s their genetic code .
We &apos;re focusing on the fuel of the quarter generation .
You also have seen you that extract act anol from the grain was a hurt experiment .
We have a second generation of the third generation that they &apos;re going to use enough to zuccher than the birth of the highest value of the highest value like the doctor or different types of butanish .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increase the cost of food and limlimits of food and limlimits would be transforming the CO2 in matter , which we &apos;re working for designing cells that can reach this purpose , and we think we could reach the first coal of the quarter generation in about 18 months .
The combined light with the CO2 is a metodo--- but in our discoveries in the world , we have found different metods .
This is a organism that we have described in 1996 .
It &apos;s a long time , at about 2,500 feet of the wollition of the water .
They create metan electricity as a molecular carbon as source as source of energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can incanary the CO2 , which can easily be transported by the cubbbbbes , to drive this process .
So we think we could be able to increase what the basic question of &quot; which is what life is life . &quot; And we have the destruction of the world &apos;s chemistry .
So , if you can &apos;t do it by TED , where you can it ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And we &apos;re working for the same methods to create vaccines .
You &apos;ve been seen this year with influence , we &apos;re always back of a year and a dollar in less when it &apos;s about the vaccine .
I think what you can change is building combinable .
Here &apos;s how the future could start seem to look at , now , the tree of evolution , accellyating evolution with synthetic bacteria , and inend cells .
We &apos;re so much of the improving people .
Our purpose is to do a long enough way to try to make it . Thank you very much . Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
Before all I &apos;m going to show you , the faster , some of the new technology that we took the Microsoft in the follow of a year ago . This is Seadragon . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s a place that you can interact is at the local level that remote with a huge amount of data .
We &apos;re seeing a lot of the gigabyte of digital photo with a kind of a cosite , and continue , for a very fast panoring , and continue , for a very fast panoramic , we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these are these collecting data or images .
Most of the most common photographs , but this for example is a scanning scanning from the Big of Congress , and it &apos;s going to go into the gamma , and it &apos;s about 300 megaps .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the one thing that limits the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time . It &apos;s also a very flessible architecture .
This is a whole whole , example of data not .
This is Casa &apos;s Chickens &apos;s Dickens . Every colonna represents a capture .
So to show you that it &apos;s just about the skills and not images , we can do something like that , to see that it &apos;s about a real representation of the text , not a photograph .
It could be a artificial way to read a electronic book .
I don &apos;t get it .
This is a more realistic example . This is a number of the War Guardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a seat .
And it really gives you a pleasure and the beautiful experience of read the real version of a view or a everyday , which is a lot of a half , which is a multiple kind of a half .
We have done something with the corner of this number in particular number of the Guardian .
We have created a high high resolution -- much more than that that you use in a normal publisher -- and we have a very high .
If you want to see the characteristics of this car , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the technical models .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that this means that it &apos;s going to put up to people , and to other porcheries , not to have to be necessary .
Of course , the maps is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don &apos;t want to lose time , if we have to contribute to give you to this field .
These are all the streets in the United States of the United States of NASA .
So now we &apos;re going to do something else .
This is actually in the web ; you can go to the web ; you can go to see it .
This is a project called Photosynth , which fight two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research that we have a very interesting thing that we have to the University of Washington , with the help of Steve Seitz Seitz .
And it &apos;s from the web , I &apos;m going to go to Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from a picture of the other and have this kind of experience of resolution .
But the space of the space of the images here has actually a meaning .
The algoritems of the computer have recorded these images together , so that I &apos;m going to correspond to the re-place that the imagining of the world that you imagine all -- all the next lagues -- they &apos;re going to be taken .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more space .
I want to spend directly to one of the Noah--- and this is that &apos;s a previous prototype of the first time the summer time the summer time the summer time the summer time , I &apos;ll show you what I think is really the key to show you what I think is really the key to show you what I think about the environments that we have to do in the web .
We had to worry about the legal aspects and and so on .
This is a reconstruction of Nobody clock three Dame images , from Flickr . Bae &apos;s about the Nothing Dame in Flickr and you get images of types in magnic , and you get some kinds of things in magnic magnic .
So , they &apos;re all images from Flickr and they &apos;re all linked to space in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this very simple way .
You know , I never thought of finish work for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very free to receiving this kind of accounting here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s about a lot of different types of different types of photocaming : from those of the mobile phone , a significant number , mit together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to try to look at the more strongest .
Many of them are blocked by , etc .
On a few of the here is a series of photographs -- the skuls .
This is a Nothing of Nothing .
We can go from the poster physics of this environment .
The essential is that we can do things with the social environment . This is taking data from the whole memory collective data , like the whole memory , of the point of view -- and connected all those data together .
All of those photo become connected together , more of the parts of the parts of the parts .
You have a model of the whole thing that emerge .
Think about this as the prolungation of Stephen Lawler on Earth virtual .
It &apos;s something that grow in complexity , as the people use it , and the whose people use it , and the advantages to get it .
Those are marked with methads to put it from other people .
If you have a contrast idea of contrast all these subs , you know , my photh of Nobody , my photh of Nobody three Dame . And you can use it all those data , and I can use it for me to immerse in that space , in that metaphor , using pictures of anyone , and have a social experience of the kind of a cross-like , and have a human experience of the kind of a cross-like .
Of course , a consequence of all the things are very interesting models of every interesting part of the land , collective of the land , collective of the land , and satellite images and satellite images and satellite images and similar , but the memory collective .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized that what your software will have to do is that you have to do is that at a point , in the next years , all the photographs and share from anyone in the world will be print ?
BAA : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is doing is practice .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , you to , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the remarkable of information searching that many of these images .
As you do a little bit of images on the web , you take a frase and the page on the web has a lot of information about images .
Now , what happens if you can do that picture of all your photo ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of reconnection and the amount of reconnection that it &apos;s really huge . It &apos;s a classic .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure when you travel and one of the ornogs of the etnogs is the able to live between who who have no forged the antic of the world , who have the past in the wind , the past in the wind , the way , you can get it in the wind , the payayers .
Basti thinking that the sciamani Jaguar travel , even beyond the Via , or the mites of the subject of the subject of the subject of the Dharer , or that in Himalaya , the distinct of the Dharm , but you can remind the central of the Dharm of the world we live in the sense of the world we live in the way we live in the sense , but it &apos;s just a model of reality , but it &apos;s a model of the way we live ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stirpe has done , well or bad , many generations .
And , of course , we all share of the essential strongs .
We all all of the proof . We all all of the proof .
We &apos;re very challenges to the initiation of the initiation .
We need to deal with death , so we have to go and we &apos;re not surprising if we &apos;re going to do it .
We have an art .
What it &apos;s the particular one of the song , the ritory of the song , the ritory of the culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that the Penan of the Borneo , or the follow of the Voodoo of Haiti , or the guerriers of the desert Kaign in Kenya , the Curge , the Curander &apos;s heart , or a Curge , or a Curge .
He was my journey of the desert of the desert a month ago , or a website in Qomolangma in Qomolangma , the mother of the world .
All these populations are teaching us that there are other ways of existing ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And , if you think a moment , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
Insides , the miriap of cultures in the world creates a spiritual life and cultural that &apos;s going to have the planet and it &apos;s important for the planet , so it &apos;s the well-being in the planet so , like biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural race , like a ethnosphere and you can call the etnosphere , the total of all the concepts , and inspiration , ideas , inspired , that we &apos;ve been from the human imagination of the awareness of the aims .
The etnosphere is the great paint of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how inquisitive species .
And it &apos;s just been very quickly consumed by the same way , it &apos;s happened to the ethnosphere and much more quickly .
No biologist , for example , would say that 50 percent of all the species is about the orest the clog , because it &apos;s not , or -- in the most apocalite -- in the field of biological diversity -- and you don &apos;t get to the most optic diversity -- that &apos;s the most optimistic -- that of the cultural diversity .
The whole thing is , of course , the loss language .
When you &apos;re born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just composure by a vocabolary or a series of rules .
A language is the spraking of human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle of the way that the animation of every culture comes in the world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a kick , a thought , a thought , a ecosystem .
And of those 6,000 languages , while we &apos;re sitting in Monterey , at least half the time , at least half the orders of the kids .
They don &apos;t get more taught to kids , the less that you don &apos;t know something , that &apos;s already death .
What is more tristes of being the most trister of being the last one language , of being the last to talk about a language , of the last to be the wisdom of the kids ?
This is a few years , is the state of somebody in some of the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks of the last few weeks , and the door with their last last last silver language .
And I know somebody to say , &quot; Is it better ?
The world would not be a better place if we were all the same language ? &quot; Benisate , then we &apos;re all yoruba . We &apos;re talking about the tool . We &apos;re talking about the cancers .
We talk about kogs .
You &apos;re going to have a sudden what it means to say we can &apos;t talk about their language .
I &apos;d like to do you do a journey through the etnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a covering of what we &apos;re lost .
Many of us forget that when I say , &quot; different ways of existing existing .
So let &apos;s take for example , this bimbo Barasana , in Amazon entry , the people of the anaconda , which creates the midance of the milest in the front of of the milest in the front of the size of the pay-pair .
It &apos;s a people that &apos;s not able to distinguish the color of the blue blue , because the celests is identified in the time of the forest , which is that it &apos;s identified in the time , which is the people .
They have a language and a clock , and a matriage , called &quot; exogy language , &quot; exogy , &quot; and you have to sposite a different language .
Everything has been radical in the past , yet , yet the particular particular , is that in these families , extincese is that in these families , because of the math matririric .
They &apos;re limited to listen and then they start to talk .
We take one of the most interesting tribes with the most interesting tribes that I lived , the Waorani of Ecuador , a incredible people that had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 five measure have been trying to a spider .
They &apos;ve done it down on the top of the top of the top of the willing to repair , forest that this people &apos;s forest that this people &apos;s forest that they &apos;ve never seen anything of bi-dimensional forest .
They &apos;ve been collected the photograph , they &apos;ve been taken the research of a shape or a figure and , not find nothing , they have to the diavy , and they killed the five missionary missionary missionary missionary .
But the Waorani don &apos;t kill only bleg the foreign of the Waorani .
They kill the one of them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by their own .
We &apos;re saved at eight generations and we found two natural cases and we &apos;ve been found two natural times , they &apos;ve got a lot of them was inveced , and then they killed it , and then they killed it .
The caught were able to recognize the animal urine for 40 pass and recognize the species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned a very interesting job when my Harvard professor of Harvard , I was going to go to Haiti , I was going to Haiti of Duvalier and Tonton Macocococules , and the Tonton Macoutes , and I was a little bit of the wild of the powers of the poorest .
For a sense of the miraculous , I should understand the Voodoo , and that Voodoo is not magic .
It &apos;s pretty a complete view of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to tell me about the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianity , Islam , Buddhism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has not faith . And it &apos;s not any other than the distilled . And it &apos;s not the other than the distilled of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of slavery .
What &apos;s interesting is that it &apos;s the intense is the intense to the report between life and death .
So the vights are doing the beekeeps .
The spirits can be invocated by the Grands Actually , they respond to the roling of the dance of the vious way to the vious way that for a short short active .
So , for this voodooists like , &quot; You &apos;re white who go to the closer of God .
We say , we go into the theme and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re posite , is the spirit that you can do it ?
So you see these incredible events : follow voodoo in state of trance that touch is that touch , and you &apos;re going to have a very strong strong demonstration of the power of mind , the body when it &apos;s catalyzed one state .
I &apos;ve all the people with which I lived in the most extraordinary people are the Kogi of Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta , in Colombia .
I think of the ancient civilization that once once they live on the carry cart of the Colombia in the carders of the Colombia , the people have a conquist , the people have the volcanic comic that you &apos;re going to the plain that you get on the plain of the plain of the plain of the plain of the actual actual actual .
In a blood continent of blood , this people have never been conquisted by the spagers .
At the one of the government government is a cler , but their formation is very extraordinary .
The young people are taking from families to three or four or four , and they live secret in a world , and they &apos;re going to get in the world of the stone of the glaciers .
Two years of the nine years choices to reduce the nine months of gestation that translation in the mother , now are metaphor , now are metaphor of the Grands Maaathe-Mather .
For all of this time , they &apos;re accultured to their values , which are seeing their preayers and only their preayers and only their preayers . They &apos;re going to keep the balance .
And the term of this incredible initiation , they &apos;re suddenly taken out and for the first time in life , at the age of 18 years , see a very high . And in that moment of the first bleg , when the sun sun kitch , the whole thing that they &apos;ve learned in a talk about it . It &apos;s going to be a step and says , &quot; Pending a step and says , &quot;
&quot; Vist ? Proprice , how I said to you .
It &apos;s amazing . Now it &apos;s about you protect it . &quot;
They call a majority and say that we , fratthers , we are the colpful of the world .
This is extremely important .
When we think about Indigene populations and the old history of the most of the notion of the noble history of the wild , which is a conceiver in his simplicity or maybe invoid Thoreau and we say that these people are more neighborhood to the Earth of us .
The Indies are not nor any any of Indies are not nor wealthy .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the Asmat the Asmat or in the Tibet , but because of the time and the rolids of the Earth &apos;s based on the ground , they have created a mystic of the Earth &apos;s not about the concept , but it &apos;s a very much more unless , but the concept that Earth can live because it &apos;s infected by the human .
What does that mean ?
It means that a boat at Ande that a boy of the mountain is a Mr. that &apos;s a Apu that will will be a depest of the destate that &apos;s going to be deply different and it will have a very depest and a lot of rock , or that &apos;s a mountain of rock of rock that a mountain is a massive rock of rock of rock to be scaving .
That &apos;s the dimer of a mineral or a mineral is irrilever .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individuals and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the forests of the forests of the forests of the forests of being cut .
And that has been a human being different from my friends Kwakiutl that the forests are the dimal of Hukukukuk and the bunch of paradise and the bees of the world , which we live in the world , the world , the world , the spirits that we &apos;re going to extrain of the world , spirits .
If you start to consider that these cultures can create reality , you can start to understand some of them feeling . We take this plant . We take this plant .
I &apos;ve taken this photograph of the Amazon the Amazon nurs .
Maybe some of you &apos;ve heard about the ayahuash , the most powerful psychophical psychoactive .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuash is not the potential drugs of the substance , but the elaboration . It &apos;s composite . It &apos;s composite .
On one hand , this lian lessly , that &apos;s a series of charcoal , harder and hardly , hardly hallucinogen , and hardly hurt ,
And by taking the only plan has a smoke that &apos;s a smoke that allows a little bit , but it &apos;s a consticked with the leaving of a caffection of the caffection is .
This plant contains , very similar to the sweet , very similar to the sounds , dimethyptamine .
If you &apos;re going to see the Yanomami pulling on for the hidden nap of a different set of species , you &apos;re going to have a methyptamine .
You can get that dust about the nose is a little bit like being shot from a career of dipints and land on a sea .
I &apos;m going to be a lot of my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who wrote the picher was pitch , with his discovery of the fungi .
And I &apos;m going to be a classification these triptamine as alleg as alucinogens , because if you &apos;re actually , you can tell no one of being halled .
It &apos;s possible to assuit , just if they abunte with other chemicals that denian MAO .
Now , it &apos;s the beautiful : the Ti-coin that lian injors of MAO , the same kind of need to potential to potential triptamine . The question is smop of this is expensive . The question is spontaneous . And if you combined it in this way , but if you combined in this way , but if you combined in this way , they create a chemical version of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the size of the size ?
We use the great eufemism of the evidence and the error , that can reveal initipheric .
But if we ask the Indians , we say , &quot; The plants talk about . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahead , which distinguish neply in the forest , and that we would get in the same species .
If you ask , how they &apos;re going to say , &quot; I think there are going to say , &quot; I think of the rest of plants , the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of it ? &quot;
The solution is : you take the 17 variety in a night of a sun and each other .
With this is not graduate Harvard , but it &apos;s very more interesting than the stami .
Now , we have to applausers the problem is that even the ones of us who have to the Indies have peaces them in the world , and they &apos;re going to get margine in our real world , and passes beyond our real world , and passes beyond .
In fact , the 20th century , not going to remind for its own own own own own technology , but it &apos;s not the technology , but it &apos;s quite like the world we stop and we used and have abbracked and accepted the mass of the planet . Now the problem is not the biological diversity of the planet . Now , the problem is not the change .
All through cultures are the various circles are involved in a dance for life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux have not stop being Sioux when they put it from the arco and filled as American American when they put it from the horse and calm .
It &apos;s not the change or the technology that mines of the etnosphere . It &apos;s the power .
The wall of domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you &apos;ll find that these are not destined to disappear .
They &apos;re living in the living and dynamics are living in the existence of the existence that go beyond their adaptment .
It &apos;s the disbosssament in the Penan --
a nomads of Sarawak , in the ground of the size of the asian , a people who lived in the forest to a generation , and now reduction on the forest and the next titution of the wild , where you can see the river and the next next thing to the ride of the witer that seems to take a half of the Mar Cary , where the Mar Cary , where the slow Mar Cary , where the nine , where the nine is going to be a lot of the witure ,
You &apos;re going to reempie the bits with the forest .
Or , in the case of the Yanomami , are the diseases that have come with the discovery of the ones of the people .
If we go on the mountain of the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the whole whole whole thing .
As you know the genocide , the extinction of a people , is conducted at universal level , but the etnocium , the destruction of life of a people , not only is to admit , but it &apos;s not only unbelieved , but it &apos;s part of the development of the development of the development of the development of the development .
And you can &apos;t understand the Tibet , because you &apos;re not part of the Tibet until you go from the beginning .
I &apos;ve lost 6,000 miles from Chengdu in China in the Western of the Western China through the Tibet , coming to the Lhasa with a young connected , but only came to the statistics that we feel about .
6,000 uments sacred rebleg in dust and slowers .
1.2 million people kills in the military in the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical at the Panchen Lama .
The one means that it &apos;s been killed to the Chinese invasion .
Suo guy &apos;s fit with Sua Santity in the diaspora that has brought the people in Nepal .
Heir mother was imprisoned and his cold was being replaced .
It &apos;s been taken of birth in carcers at the age of two birth of the gonna bird because he couldn &apos;t live without him .
The sister , which has done the same , it was med in reeducation .
A day has inessentially calpested a fashion , and this transgration , and this transgrsion , was med to the sets of seven years .
The pain of the Tibet can be insopportrait , but the spirit of the people is from tener .
And finally , all you get to a choice .
We want to live in the world monoton the world of the monotony or we want to take the world .
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he died that his largest bear was that , in our our world , we &apos;re going to see the whole gamorful of the world , we &apos;re not just going to see the whole gamorderly , but a day day we &apos;re going to give us a sleep to a sleep of thinking , but we &apos;re going to say that the whole gamoring of the world ,
And it &apos;s uliant that our species is exist for 60,000 years .
The From Neolitics , which has given us us us us us us to the cult of seed , which has done us to replace the poetry of the seed , with the next cler , creating the next cler , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has to be 300 years .
That &apos;s a story I don &apos;t suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges we &apos;re going to have to get in the millense .
When to these miriap of cultures in the world is asked what human , respond to 10,000 vices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all reflights the possibility of being what we are : a kind of awful , that it has to make all the people and the gizes can fire . And there are big . And there are big moments of optimism .
I &apos;ve taken this picture on the end of the island of Baffin , when I went to cook with the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and I &apos;ve told the wonderful story of his grandgrandfather .
The government is not always been gentile with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to stay our supremate , we have to have them in colonies .
The grandfather &apos;s the grandmother &apos;s refuted to go .
The family , I &apos;m going to tempted to all the beings , and all his attreous attract .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t have the cold , you know , the sweet .
The pets of the slitte in origins were made of fish in the skin in skin skin there .
The grandmother of this man didn &apos;t have intimidded by the night or the blizer that he was suffering .
It &apos;s gaps , you &apos;re hot the pair the pair in the skin in skin skin and defecting in their hand . When the I did it , they have been conzable , the work work with a moon .
It &apos;s salive on the punishment of this clock of clock and when it became solid , he killed a dog .
He sheled the dog and created a bridly hurt , with the clog , has been embranch , has imbrief another dog , is sat on the bang , and it &apos;s sat the bang , he &apos;s got a sat .
We want to talk about horse with nothing ? &#91; &#91; Ris&#93; And this , in different ways , &#91; Applausers &#93; is the symbol of the resilience of the world .
In the middle of 1999 , the government of the canadese government recivil of the total control of a largest land of California and Texas mit .
It &apos;s their new painting . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a independent land . They &apos;re all the minerary resources .
One splendiest example of how a natione-state can rererererecilie with his people .
And , to finish , I think it &apos;s quite obvious to least as you have been in these remote areas of the planet , and they &apos;re not remote .
For somebody &apos;s home .
They &apos;re presenting sections of human imagination that they &apos;re going to get the alba of time . And for us all of these kids , like the dreams of our kids , become part of the geography of hope .
So , we &apos;re going to end , we have to convince that politicians will never get anything .
We believe that polemics --
&#91; &#91; Applausers &#93; are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and perhaps we are the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month , we have 35 million visits .
156 countries transmit &apos;s transmit .
Our rescustoms are lets from millions of people .
Our work is travel in the etnosphere to bring our public places in the wonderful places that they &apos;re going to have been on , and you &apos;re going to get away and , hopefully , abbranthroughout the middle of the anthropology : the world to be a life in a world of life in a world of life in a world of life in a world , and we have to find a life in a world of life in a plural world in a world of life in a world ,
where the saggees can contribute to our wisdom to contributing our wising collective .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope to call it other things that you &apos;ve heard and try to look at some links , in case , you don &apos;t notice .
I &apos;d like to start with what I call &quot; the dogma official .
The dogma official ?
The dogma official society of all the Western industrial society . The dogma official . The recite is , &quot; If we want to massize the well-being of our ads . &quot;
The reason is , from a hand , in fact that freedom is in itself , it &apos;s predicous , it &apos;s predictable , for human beings .
On the other one is in fact that if we are free , each of us can agree to do everything that that massive our well-being , no one that we have no one that decide in our well-being , no one that we &apos;re free to name .
The way to massize the freedom is massive the choice .
The most choices are the most liber , and more is their freedom , and more is their well-being .
This is so much , it &apos;s so much , it &apos;s so much doublew in society that nobody would have dream of the doubt .
And it &apos;s also deeply radical in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has been resist .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly great .
I &apos;m going to put a simple note about the conducted conducted .
In my supermarket there are 175 conducted , without contact the 10 variety of olium extrain of olished and the 12 acets whom you can buy for a huge number of conducting people in the inner reserve that nobody of the 175 , you &apos;re already ready to be .
Here &apos;s what the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic store , to buy a stereum : cases , the CD , radio , plastra , radio amplificer .
And in this single store store , there &apos;s a big number of audio .
We can make six million different combinations using the components that there are a only store .
Bisogn to put that there is a lot of choice .
Other camps : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all the phone services , to the skills that they proved by mom that they have to mit .
It was born the phone , you didn &apos;t buy it .
One of that , one of that , one is that the phone never romantic .
These days are gone .
We have a variety of the phone , especially between phones , especially between cell .
Here &apos;s the cell phone .
My favorite is in a middle , MP3 , cuts , and I &apos;m going to be born , and forcing for the chromance , and forced for the crye .
If you don &apos;t have seen it in the store , you &apos;re very much of the house , you &apos;re going to get .
And what happens is that people get to the store and does this question , and it &apos;s what &apos;s the answer ? The answer is &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too too much .
So , in other expectation of life that are more important than the acquists , you &apos;re going to be the same explosion of choices .
It &apos;s healthcare : not going to happen in the United States that you &apos;re going to go from the doctor and the doctor you have to do .
Instead , you &apos;re going to the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; Okay , we could do A , or B , &quot; A has these benefits of the risks and these risks . &quot; And what do you do ? &quot;
You know , &quot; Dr. &quot; Dr. , what would I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A has these benefits , and these risks , and B has these benefits and these risks . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you get to say , &quot; Dr. if she was me , what would do ? &quot;
And the doctor : &quot; But I &apos;m not . &quot;
The result of the result of the mality of the mality of the mality of the &quot; , expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not that one move the fish and the responsibility of the decisions of the decisions of somebody knows that knows that , and it &apos;s the doctor , to something that doesn &apos;t know -- and almost certainly , and it &apos;s not in the ideal condition to take the patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing products , drugs , direct to people like me and you , if you think it &apos;s not no sense , because we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why do you get them , why do you get them ?
The answer is that they want to ask the doctor to ask them to ask us to ask the recipe .
Something that &apos;s the most fundamental thing is our identity ever is a choice of choice , like you see in this vignity , we don &apos;t want to forcure the kids . They &apos;re going to go to the right time . &quot; We need to have to invent .
And we can reinventing us how many times we do it .
The one means that every morning , you have to decide that you have to decide that kind of person person want to be .
I &apos;m going to the family and the matriage , a long time the perspective , satisssssounds for anyone , was that there was a lot of time , and they were going to get the most pressive .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not when , and even what do after .
So , it &apos;s really to play .
I &apos;m going to be smart , and I &apos;m going to their 20 percent in least of work at a time .
And not because they &apos;re not because they &apos;re not because they &apos;re less diligenes .
but why are they imposite , you ask , &quot; I should be going to ask , &quot; I would be going to do it now ? &quot;
&quot; Do I have to get back ? I think about the kids or the career ? &quot;
They &apos;re interrogs .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this implic implic , not complete the company that assemble and not to get a good voice .
And they really have to do it . They &apos;re important .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , like Carl underneath , because the technology allows us to work every minute , every day , every day , from the planet , tranne that Hotel Randolph .
And there &apos;s a parentesesesis , and I &apos;m not going to say any of any , where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t tell you , why I want to use it .
What does , this incredible freedom of choice that we have to continually decide , to continuously , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing church , with the cell cell cell in a pocket , the Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the notebook .
And even though they &apos;re all spend , every minute we see our son , we see the partnership , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; I have to answer this ? &quot;
&quot; I want to answer this email ? I have to abboy this letter ? &quot;
And also when the answer is &quot; no , &quot; no , this makes the experience of your son &apos;s own own own own own own own .
So , any of any of the little things , and big things , the things and great , life is a choose .
And once the world was this : That &apos;s obviously , there were some possibilities , but it wasn &apos;t a question of choice .
The world &apos;s about this : The dilemma is , &quot; Is it a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Scicipe .
We &apos;re all talking about the negative , we all do , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative .
All of this is two negative effects of people .
The first , paradooootherwise , is that it &apos;s going to think that freedom .
And so you &apos;re going to choose , it becomes very hard to do it .
I &apos;ll give you a significant example : a remarkable study .
A connected to the Vanguard of the Vantee , the giant society of pension , with about a million customers .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offering in the most , the percentage of adesion two percent .
With 50 source of offering , there &apos;s 10 percent of less than adesions when they &apos;re available only five . Why ?
Because with 50 source of which choose , it &apos;s sick to decide , and the choice is reduced to the injeckle .
And in the domans , and still in domans , domans , and of course , the domans , and of course , the domans are never .
You know that it doesn &apos;t only mean that these old work who are in the old people will have no money , it will say that the decision is so dostical that allow the complementary .
Not in the way , they &apos;re lying up to five dollars a year from the dator of work , which would be very displace to be .
So the paralallee is a consequence of having troppes .
And I think that &apos;s like that .
&quot; And to finish , for the eternity : ketchup , you &apos;re going to be , or the hurt ? &quot;
Would you take the right decision , if it &apos;s for the eternity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to pick the wrong , and yet the condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that , if we can avoid the parallee and make a choice , at the end , we &apos;re less sation-in which they choose .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of people who choose , if you &apos;re picked a , and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you would have been better . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us to have a different amount of choice , and the plant results to the soft of the decision , and the deaths , and the demining of the decision ,
And it &apos;s a good decision .
The most choices there are , more easy to be unfortune than any detail that is inso-insatisfaction .
And , there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has clared very well as the value that we &apos;re going to the dipends on the things we can do .
And the rest , when there are a lot of possible possible , it &apos;s easy to represent the alternative of alternative alternative .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m going to do with all the ones that are not in New York .
But that &apos;s what you probably think .
There &apos;s this copy to Hamptons .
A place of luser .
Spip splendida . Otttma . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not lack . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , maledition , is Agust . &quot;
&quot; Everybody my neighborhood in Manhattan are . &quot;
&quot; I could parking out of the home . &quot;
And it &apos;s going to have two weeks from the idea that &apos;s perdating -- every day -- the ability to park where it wants .
The costo-opportunities demining the soddisfation for what we have , even when the choice was excellent .
And more are the options we have to consider , more the features we have to think about it , we &apos;re going to think about it &apos;s going to be a costo-opportunities .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
There &apos;s about the time , and maybe of the living life .
But the most important point is that anything you choose , you choose to do it .
The things that we don &apos;t choices that we can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : it &apos;s increase to expect .
I tried to my skin in bought a new new jeans .
I &apos;m almost always jeans .
And the jeans were just a one , they buy them and vest and vast they were sat , they were sat , just after they took them a life and jeans a lot of times , they were going to go .
So , I went to buy a couple of jeans , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
The committed me , &quot; Li wants to be a fit , simple , relaxed , relaxed ? &quot;
What do you want to do with the cernic ? &quot; Stonewashhing ? &quot;
&quot; Li wants to straight ? &quot;
&quot; Same them want to strongs ? Bla &apos;s bla , &quot; Continule .
I was salean , and after a little bit I could say , &quot; I want the guy that -- that was the only one one . &quot; It was not what , so that I was , so that I was , so that I was going to have all the people who had .
It was the very very much . With the whole choice .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for it .
The reason I was worse that I was that with all of that choice my expectations were altissue , the jeans had to be perfect .
And I was expectation . I didn &apos;t expectation to me anything except when there was a kind of , but when it was 100 different , stead , at least one guy had to be perfect .
What I had to buy was good , but not perfect .
After I started to be a chose to the chose to be insatissssatisssssnaked .
The added of options in life of people don &apos;t do that increase the expectations of the excellence of the options of the excellence of the options .
And this will make less satisfation , even when the results are good .
No in the world of marketing , if you understand it .
Because if they knew it , you don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more to that .
&quot; It was better when it was worse , &quot; The reason that he was better when it was worse that when it was worse that when you was worse .
In fact , in the world where we live -- opulents , industrialized citizens with the expectancy of the perspective -- the very very much that we can hope is that things are at the althetic of expectations .
You &apos;ve never surprised to love to be pleasure because your expectations , you &apos;re ingiant , you &apos;re ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- it &apos;s , &quot; Bwawaiting . &quot; Yeah , you want to it . &quot;
I mean , I mean , little authographic -- that really sposite and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I don &apos;t have to do better ,
But it &apos;s not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of the buy a couple of jeans , when there is only that kind of jeans is that when you &apos;re not sdisappeared , and you say , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot;
The world is the responsible . What could do you do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a inssatisfacing , and you ask who is the responsible , is the responsible , is the responsible , you &apos;re going to .
You could do better .
And with hundreds of variety , you don &apos;t have a sweet .
So when people take decisions , even though the result is , you &apos;re valido , you feel inssatisssssweet .
In the last years , the depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this honest depression is just that people have been deludent .
And when they have to explain this that the cold is their own .
So the final result is that we &apos;re better , but we &apos;re better , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the dogma official , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely flip . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little choice of the best choice is better than a lot of choice is better than a lot of choice is better than a little bit .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic value . I don &apos;t know what .
But I &apos;m sure we have overed with a piece of the level where the choices are going to be .
Now , from the political point -- I &apos;ve got almost finished -- I &apos;ve been almost finished -- the notion is the follow .
What it allows all this to the industrial choice in the industrial society is the remarkable .
There are many places in the world , and you know , where the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too page .
So the cencentery I &apos;m talking about is a sick of modern modern , remarkable society .
And what makes depressing and angry is this : Steve Levitt talked about how much the expensive and seats are ineful . It &apos;s a splier . It &apos;s a splier . It &apos;s a split of money .
I mean , the way these choices , and dispendiose , it &apos;s not that they &apos;re just useful .
I &apos;m going to tell you .
We have worse .
If a little bit of what we in our society allows a lot of choice , in the people have too few few chance , it &apos;s not only their life to improve , but also our own life .
This is what economists call a very much better .
A redistribution of income ago , not only to the poor -- not only to poor -- because of this choice in excess that we go .
To conclude , &quot; Fille , you can become everything you want to be . &quot;
You have , people of culture , you think , &quot; What do you think about ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t get anything in a glass . &quot;
&quot; A uncovered , a limited view of the world --
and I &apos;m interpreted it so , at the beginning .
But then , think , I &apos;m going to think , I realized that the fish knows that the long fish knows .
Because the reality of the fact of the fact that if you &apos;re manda in frankle , so that it &apos;s possible . &quot; It &apos;s going to be good . You can get the freedom . It &apos;s going to be the paralysis .
If you get the bocking out of the way that everything diminuum can diminuum .
You get the paralysis , and you reduce the well-being .
Everybody need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too struggle , maybe even even for fish , and certainly for us .
But the above some symbolic sphere is a recipe for the inhappiness and , theme , for the rovina .
Thank you .
