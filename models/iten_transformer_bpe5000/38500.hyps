Last year I showed these slides to show that the glacial calculus , which for almost three million years , had the size of 48 , the United States has 48 size , the United States has retrofit of 40 percent .
But this subtle the gravity of the problem because it shows it &apos;s not the ice spextense of the ice of the ice of the problem because it &apos;s not the ice spexectively because it &apos;s not the ice of the ice of the problem because it &apos;s not the expanded of the ice , because it &apos;s not showing the ice of the ice of the problem because it shows the gravity of the problem because
The arctic calculus is , in a sense , the heart of the global climate system .
It &apos;s invern expanded .
The next slide is going to be a carrying reid to be a carrying required of the last 25 years .
The glaces have been signed in red .
As you see , they &apos;re expanding to the dark blue .
That &apos;s the winter ice , which is reverse ice to summer .
You can see that the so-called ice perenne , of five years or more , is like blood , which is like blood , which is the blood here I was expressed by the body .
In 25 years , it was gone from this , so .
This is a problem because the heat the heavy soil around the arctic ocean where there are huge amount of frozen coaled that , they &apos;re transform from the microbes .
I &apos;m going to be the totaling of the pollution to global warming , that amount could double , that amount could double , overwhelmed this one of the non-back of the non-rewardship .
In some of the Alaska little , profound lakes in Alaska the metane is already ribuling out of the water .
The Katey Walter at Alaska University of Alaska has been on a team at a low-to-winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Wow ! â™« She &apos;s good . The question is if we &apos;re also going to be it .
One reason is that this termal exchange termal , Groenland from north .
This is a river at the glacial River .
The ported never had ever ever ever ever ever ever achieve that .
This is the Kangerlussuadic Riviver , in the southwest of the Greenland of Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level to be shrimp for the shelter , and it &apos;s where it &apos;s the sea level .
These currents are increasing rapidly .
On the other side of the planet : Antarctica , the biggest block of the planet .
Last month , scientists have told that the ice balance of ice is in negative , and the Western Antartide , which pogate on some subarms , is particularly quitous quick in the skiest .
It &apos;s 16 feet at the foot of the water , like in Groenland .
Sulla Himalaya , the third largest block of ice , you see new lakes , that few years ago , which a few years ago .
40 percent of the world population is being being half of the world &apos;s population in the shelter .
Sulle Ande : this glacier &apos;s the source of the water .
The ported is increased .
But when it decreates the same thing happens to water .
In California snow on the Sierra Nevada is decrediminuity of 40 percent .
The hyries are crisis .
Again , as you read , they &apos;re grasses .
The safe growing safe in the world &apos;s leads to a remarkable increasing incended .
The environmental disaster disaster , the environmental disaster , and unpreceded .
Four times more of the last 30 years I was before 75 .
This is an unsustainable andering .
If you look at it in the historical context that can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 -- 25 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the world &apos;s Pacific Gacific , from the Americans , to the West , and on both of the parts of the Indian subcontinent , where there &apos;s a radical roal impacts in the ocean .
The greatest cause of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , it &apos;s the fossil fuels use use use .
oil is a problem , and coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the more emissions , together to China .
And it was actually proponed to build a lot of other coal-coal .
But we &apos;re seeing a change of direction .
These are the projects annullated projects in the last few years and some vers alternative .
At any way , there &apos;s a politics fight in our country .
The coal industrial and the coal-p-up industrial and the oil industries to promote coal , which is a hossymsymptoms .
That image would remind me something --
Verso Natal , in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a loss of 3.8 billion litri litri litri waste .
You may have seen it on the news .
This is the second largest fllow flows in America .
It &apos;s happened around the Natal .
Ninalidation of one of the coal industrial .
Video : However , &quot; Happing the carbon is a happy and .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it &apos;s growing our economy .
Frosing the carbon is increasingly clean .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and workers keep the workers tend to be the waste .
Al Gore : From the most coal-like .
The biggest minerary society on mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I &apos;m going to be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosy , Harry Reid -- they don &apos;t know what they are talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alliance for the Clima Protection of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : The next one : At the next ALergy : The climate change as a business threat to our business .
So for our priority is to invest a lot of money in a public effort to make public and confused the coal truth of coal .
In fact , coal is not spork .
We think it &apos;s clean -- it also has a good profumo .
So not preuption of climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Attore : Cold clean -- you &apos;ve heard about it .
So let &apos;s do a turn into a structure at the avanguard of the coal as as much as it &apos;s about the coal .
Straordinarily ! I cars are a little noise , but this is the sound of the fuel technology .
The coal consumption is between the major causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology of that you see changes everything .
You look at this : this is the clean technology odial odial .
Al Gore : Well , the good alternative is connected to the economic issue and the national security of security .
Video : America is in crisis ; America is the economy , national security , climate crisis .
The files that connects all : our dependence from fossil fuels , like coal and the oil imported .
Now , though , there &apos;s a new , auduty solution to go .
Repower : 100 percent clean energy , in a 10 years .
A plan to repel America to make us more safe , and help stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that I stopped to solve our problems .
Repower America . You find more .
Al Gore : That &apos;s the last .
Video : It &apos;s about re-energy to America .
One of the faster ways of bringing to addiction by the fuel that killing our planet .
Comparsa : The future is here . Vent , a new energy network .
Comparsa : Novovers investment for jobs .
Complement : Repower . It &apos;s time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old African-boy , they say , &quot; If you want to go speed , go to the faster , go to the faster .
If you want to go away , go together . &quot;
We have to go far , fast .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I made a introduction on LHC .
And promised to return to reach you to how the machine works .
So here I am . And for those that the other time , the LHC is the greatest scientific experiment ever tried -- 27 kilometers of circumconference .
His task for reating the conditions that were there less than a billionth of the universe -- until 600 million times a second in the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
That &apos;s just ambitious .
This is the machine under Ginevra .
We &apos;d be a little bit of these mini-Big Bang in the back .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLATLATLAS -- it &apos;s 12-meter diameter diameter diameter of 22 meters .
This is an ATLATLATLAS in construction so you can see the proportions .
The 10 September 10 , we have the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLS .
It was because of immense fits in control room .
It &apos;s a picture of particles that had the first band the LHC , and by the LHC , and by the LHC , and he &apos;s spread particles inside the detector .
In other words , when we saw that the image 10 , we realized that the machine was a great victory .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to do more or this , when somebody went to Google and saw that the initial page was this .
That means we had a cultural impact on beyond the scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , we had to do this files here -- these dored files .
These files 13,000 ampbs when the machine works at the car works at the most of the power .
Now , the technical of you will look at the files and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . They &apos;re too subject . &quot;
And instead they can do it because when they &apos;re very cold of becoming the so-called files .
So , at least 271 degrees , at lower temperature at the space of the stars , these files can bring that current .
In one of the giunture between the most of the magnetets in LHC , there was a defect of fabrication .
So , the files surprise files , and the 13,000 ampits suddenly met a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think of these magnetes fish are more than 20 tons , and they moved about 30 inches .
They &apos;re actually damaged about 50 magnetes .
We had to take them , what we did .
We re-pristinted and wearing them .
Now , they &apos;re going back to the sub-war .
I got the end of the LHC LHC is going to be new integrity .
We will accend it , and we expect to get data to judgment of July , and we keep our adventure to find out what the universe is .
Now , of course , in some way , these accidents are account the debate about the value of science and science and comparison engineering . It &apos;s easy to confutuation . It &apos;s easy to confutuation .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so difficult , the fact that it &apos;s so difficult , I think this is the value of things like LHC .
I would like to end with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey Davy Davy , which , I guess , in inutilize in the defense of his clean , his clean up was chael Faday , he said , &quot; No , it &apos;s not so much for the progress of human mind as the ideas of science , that we can &apos;t get any any any any such mystery in nature , which our trionfi mons are complete in the case that our trionds . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start with asking for rethinking about when , you know , you &apos;d play with the morning .
As you get to get them and get them and get them , take them and get them and move them , you learn in the problems and by capting and by the space relationships .
Now , space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , by the useful information of our interaction with physical objects , together to my physical objects , together to my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , and I started asking me , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of having a computer , instead of having the only computer , instead of having the only role of the mouse that &apos;s going on a desktop , we could have to get the same information with both hands ,
and fix it to fix that ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , and building Sifmong .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big interactive computer like a cookie .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big interactive computer like a cookie .
You can move with them , they can see them , they can see , &quot; you know , &quot; they have a screen and they have a screen and a wireless radio .
But most of all , they are physicists , like the morning , you can just move out .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physics , as they get more physics , of other , and as they become more physicists , and as they become more physicists , of the movement , of others , how we can explore and fun styles of interaction .
I &apos;m going to try with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show video : if you include it in one direction , it &apos;s going to rotate the video so , if you go back .
These interactive portrait are awful of the other people .
If I rely them , they &apos;re interested in what &apos;s around them .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can act a little bit .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can act a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was to use communal gestures on data , for example , &quot; to put a color like if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Sifounded configured as versus as versus the centers in that central , where they mix .
And I can use them to use them to poulder in that central , where they get .
We can put it too , we can put a little bit of it .
There &apos;s also beautiful possibilities of learning , like languages , like languages , the mathematics and joyful logic where people can try to try things fast , and see the results right out .
Now I &apos;m --
This is a Fibonacks that I do with a equations program .
Here we have a words of words that &apos;s in the middle of Scarabeers and Boggle .
Basically , to every Siftable , to get a letter on every Siftable on every Siftable on every Siftable on every Siftable on any Siftable on Siftable , and while you try to compose you &apos;re looking for words on a dictionary .
And then , about 30 seconds , you have a new set of letters and new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the children came up to the Media Lab , I did so that I tried them and went and went a video .
They were very much pleased .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people many instructions .
You just say , &quot; Specience of words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s some other people who try it .
This is our beta textent on the youngsters on the right .
It actually wanted to do , actually , it was just to stick them .
They were only cover for him .
Now , this is an interactive cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool for learning languages . He &apos;s Felix . He &apos;s Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , you can relify the Sifmonkle , they associate .
It can put new characters in the scene , you can relify the Sifmonkle , they associate .
So , it &apos;s going to go out the sun .
Video : The sun is sun .
David Merrill : Now he took a treor the scene .
Video : The orange treor the orange .
Well , good job ! Yeah ! Yeah .
So , you shake the Siftable and put close them together , can make the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing your story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide him as it is going to decide him as it .
DM : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide him as it is going to decide him as it .
Video : Vola , cat .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , I made to show you is a tool , to sample and performing music .
It &apos;s a tool that we did , to sample and performing music .
The Siftable here are sounds here like the bottom and the battery .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose .
You can also put these sounds on a sequence to your pleasure .
And then we just just touch a sound and a sequence .
These are actually you can control the vise , as the reverse and the filter .
The acks to a particular sound and then cline for a bunch of sound and then cline to the way .
And then there are general effects as time and volume , which is applied to the whole sequence .
Let &apos;s look at how it works .
Video : We &apos;ll try to put one base in two Siftool &quot; sequence , &quot; sequence , &quot; we put them in a series , we extended it in a series , we extended another base .
I &apos;m going to put a bottom line .
Video : Now I added some percussions --
Video : And I &apos;m going to put the stretch to the battery , so I can control the effect of the visive effect .
Video : I can &apos;t know , I can repeated the entire sequence , then the time on one side or the other .
Video : I &apos;m going to add the bottom to the bottom to give more expression .
Video : I can rebinary the sequence of the flying to the sequence .
So I don &apos;t have to plan this first , but I can suddenly make it longer or more puts .
And now , I can finally smoking the entire sequence , I can smoking the entire sequence on the left Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new interfaces , more like how they work our brain work and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some possibilities that we &apos;re trying to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to transmit is that &apos;s coming this new generation of objects to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world to our world that we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time to talk to all of you .
I &apos;m a writer .
I &apos;m going to write books is my profession , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the fascinating of my life .
And I don &apos;t expect that to change .
But , I said , something particular , it was recently in my life and my career , which led me to get to get the whole relationship to this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called &quot; Mangia , Prega , &quot; which , unprecedented by my previous books , for some reason came out in the world and became a great , sensational bestseller .
And the result is that the way now , people treat me treating as if I was convicted .
It &apos;s true -- convicted , conducted !
They come up with me , and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t fear to do you not fear to do better than that ?
You don &apos;t fear to go and write for all life without being able to create a book that can matter to someone &apos;s supposed to be able to make a book that can matter ? &quot;
What can you care about someone ? &quot;
It &apos;s reassuring , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember more than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a teenager -- I wanted to be a writer .
I would go to the same reaction that was based on the fear .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t I feel like he couldn &apos;t success ?
You don &apos;t afraid the humiliation of the refigured killed ?
You don &apos;t fear to do this mesh for all life without anything that &apos;s ever out and to die on a cumle of dream with the mouth of dry to love cumle cables ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
Yeah , I &apos;m afraid of all those things .
I &apos;ve always had fear .
And I also have many other things that people could not inherent .
Like the algae and other things .
But , as I think about writing what I thought and I was asking me , why is it ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logical that anybody should expect to be frightened by a job that you feel like to do .
But what &apos;s there so particular in the creative companies to make us nervous about mental health mental health as as a way that other careers do not do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemicals and I don &apos;t remember one time in his 40 years of activities that he was asked if he would have fear to be engineer ?
There was never -- that block of the engineer John , how do it ?
It wasn &apos;t working like that , you know ?
Onestly , chemicals like group have not certainly , in centuries , in centuries , earlier the reputation of being alcaught .
We &apos;ve been enough to do enough this reputation , and not only writers but creative , all of all kinds of things , we have this reputation of being enormous mement .
And it &apos;s not about that , looking at sad , and you can see the sad dead of the magnificent , only in the 21st century , they die , they &apos;re going to young and often .
And the ones that don &apos;t have suicked to be really disdisdisappeared by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , &quot; Each book book has killed me a little more &quot; A remarkable statement about his life &apos;s work .
But we don &apos;t throw it when we feel like to say , because we &apos;ve heard these things so long that we &apos;ve completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are in some way that art and the suffering are in some way of and that art , at the end , and it will always constraints to angosts .
And the question I want to ask everybody to ask to everybody here today is : Who are you agree with this idea ?
It &apos;s good for you -- because it also looking at a centimeter to me doesn &apos;t well for anything that I &apos;m not good for this supposing .
I think it &apos;s hated .
And I think it &apos;s dangerous , and I don &apos;t want to see it perpetuated in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our great creative minds to live .
And certainly I know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start to the way to the way of support of support , and the circumstances that I &apos;m in my career .
That &apos;s -- I &apos;m just a young , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m about 40 years old .
I still have about four jobs in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that whatever I &apos;m going to write about the world as the work that came out after the world as the work that after the success of my last book .
I &apos;m going to be suck , because we &apos;re all more or less friends here -- it &apos;s likely that my greatest success is in my shoulder .
Oh , Gesu , what thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to get a nine in the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would keep keep on doing this work that we work .
So , the question becomes , how do you get , how do you get ?
And so it looks like , after many thinking , after many thinking thinking , that the way to work to continue to write is to create a real psychological , OK ?
I have to find a security distance between me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxiety that I &apos;m going to write , and I was trying to get to look for the other things I started looking for the other societies , I was trying to see if they could have better ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthy ,
how to help people creative risks to deal with creative people in creativity .
And that research took me to the ancient and old Great and old Great and old Rome .
Secting me because I come up and then comes back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity came creativity solved by men , OK ?
They thought , creativity was this spirit looks like this , and that came to men somewhat distant and men somewhere sell from some distant and unknown , for distant reasons .
The Greeks called these spirits divine divine the design of the &quot; demons . &quot;
Socrate , wonderful , unbelievably , he thought he had a wisdom dealing from far .
Romans were the same idea , but they called the spirit species without a body genius .
That &apos;s great , because the Romans didn &apos;t really think a genius was someone really smart genius was a particularly intelligent .
They thought a genius was this kind of divine that was created in the walls of a little bit of an artist , a little bit like the electric of a little bit like the elected work of the artist , and it came out of the work of the artist and model that was in the outcome of that work .
Here &apos;s eastern distance of which I talk about -- that &apos;s the distance of which I talk about -- that &apos;s psychological construction that you can do the output of your work .
And everybody knew it was so that he worked , right ?
So antic artists were protected by certain things , as a smooth , right ?
If your work was exceptional you couldn &apos;t take all the merge , you &apos;d all know that you had been helped by this encourters .
If your failed job , it was not your entire fail , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be an incapable .
And so people have the creativity in the West for a long time .
And then the Renaissance came and everything , and it changed , and it was born this big idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe on top of all of the universe on the top of the universe on the divinity .
This was the rational principle and people started thinking that creativity came out of the way .
And for the first time in history , you start to referring to this or that artist as a genius , rather than a person with the genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think that allow someone , a simple person to believe to be like a recipient as the source , the essence and the source and the surrounds of all the divine mystery , creative , unknown and unknown and a responsibility for too big to give to the fragile ptic and a lot of human pace .
It &apos;s like to ask someone to enjoy the sun .
It &apos;s deaps and distores completely ego and creates all of these expectations on performance .
And I think it was this pressed for the artists in the past 500 years .
And if that &apos;s true , and I think that &apos;s , the question is , and I think , and I think it &apos;s now ?
Can we do it , we do it diversity ?
Maybe go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t erase 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience who would be legitimate scientific suspects on the notion of , so you do that follow people are going to be fused to do their projects .
I &apos;m not going to convince you all of this thing .
But the question I would ask to ask is -- why isn &apos;t it ?
Why don &apos;t you be this way ?
Because it makes sense of anything that has ever heard to explain the exassive imprevedibility of the process .
A process that , as anybody who has ever tried to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- you know , you don &apos;t comfortable .
And , in fact , it can look like paranormal .
I did this meeting recently recently with the extraordinary poem Ruth Stone , who &apos;s now 90 years , but that was a poem for all life and said to me that during his childhood in the rural Virginia , working in the fields , and he felt it , in if when a poetry came out of the landscape .
He said to me that it was like a train of air .
And he was rolling to come up with her landscape .
He felt it , because he could make the land under his feet .
He knew it was to do at that point and was , his words , &quot; run as a match . &quot;
And he was going to the house and he was going to be followed by this poem , and it wouldn &apos;t have to take a piece of paper and a match enough , as the page .
Other time he couldn &apos;t be enough , so corrective and corrective and corrective without going to be able to come to the house and the rolling her through and she was kept rolling through the landscape , and she would continue to rolling through the landscape , trying , as she said , &quot; another poet . &quot;
And then there were these times -- this piece I won &apos;t forget -- there were some moments when there were almost losing , right ?
So , he was running home and he was trying to paper and poetry and paper passed it through , and he was going to go through , and then he said , &quot; It was like to halling with the other hand and the office .
And he was the poetry from the tail and he was standing in his body and transmitted it on the page .
And in these cases , poetry would be presented on the perfect page , but the contrary , from the last word to the first word .
So when I heard it -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly the same as it is exactly the same as my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conduction !
I &apos;m a mulo , and my way to work is ; I can see them up to the same orary every day and work and go over and go and go over the himself and work and go over .
But even I , in my tuned tuned meant , I strike against that thing , sometimes .
And I guess many of you the han did of you .
You know , even though the work and ideas came to me from a certain source , I could not be honestly known .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it in a way to do not get to lose your head , but rather , what do we do we have to do healthy healthy ?
As as much as I am about , the best example of me , I have is Tom Waits musician . I interviewed several years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life was the incarnation of the artist that tormented the contemporary artist that &apos;s totally interacting these species of impulses creativity .
But then I was invecked , he hot , and one day he was driving on a highway in Los Angeles , he changed everything for him .
He was going fast and all of a very very very small framment of melodia , which comes in in his head as inspiration , and the hair , and the hosts , and the desidera , and it wants , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the desidera , but it doesn &apos;t know how to take it .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a match , it &apos;s not a match .
So it starts to hear this kind of old anxiety in the way , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to go on with this even even even .
I &apos;m not enough , I can &apos;t do enough , I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to go to the panic , he stopped .
And he would make the whole process and made something completely new .
He just looked at the sky and he said , &quot; Sorry , don &apos;t see what I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Do you look like it can write a song now ?
If you really want to be , you get a more hurt , when I can take care of you .
Althertherwise , you go to the other today .
You go to Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his work process changed after this .
Not the job , the work was still dark as always always .
But the process , and the anxiety , the heavy was left when the genius out the genius out of him -- the genius out of the problems and liberated it back to where it was , he was not going back to where it was , by making that it didn &apos;t have to be a interized thing and mented .
But yes , this peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this straight , and that straight thing that was not Tom .
So what I felt like that story started to change a little bit of the way I worked on and already saved me once .
This idea , I &apos;m saved when I was writing , &quot; Prega , &quot; Ama , &quot; and fall in one of the despair of those despair that we &apos;re all working on something and we can &apos;t get to be a disaster , which is going to be a disaster , which is the worst book ever written .
Not just bad , the worst book .
And I started thinking about how to throw this project .
But then I remember Tom who was talking to the air and tried .
So I got my face on the task on the task and I got my comments to a room of the room .
And I said high-vetables , &quot; Sit , what we know , if this book is not going to be brilliant , it &apos;s not going to be a blame , right ?
Because as I &apos;m seeing on this stuff I &apos;m doing , I &apos;m not going to do that .
So if you want to be better , you have to present you and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , I don &apos;t do anything .
I &apos;m going to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I would like to be recorded that I was going to do my part . &quot; Because it &apos;s like -- at the end is like , OK -- -- centuries ago in the North Africa people people were actually joined for the forth of lone , dance and I would like to go on and hours to the dance and until alalwn it was dancy and until the damage .
And they were always magnification , because the dancers were always professionals .
But every once , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became actually transcender .
And I know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know that you &apos;ve seen all , at a certain point , a performance like this .
It was as if the time stopped , and the dancer walks through a kind of portal and it wasn &apos;t different from the usually , like 1,000 noticed before , but it was all standing up .
And suddenly , it &apos;s not just as a human .
But he accurate from the divinity , and the lightened in the fire of the divinity .
And when this was going on , in the days , people knew what he was , called him .
They were like to sing their hands and started to sing , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , God , &quot; God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
I &apos;m noticed historic -- when the Mori invaser the south of Spain , preserved this habits with them and the ready to change in the centuries from Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , &quot; which you can still hear in the cords or in the cords or flamenc .
In Spagna , when an artist did something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , and they &apos;re a magic , &quot; Allah , &quot; Man , &quot; Huncomprehensive , &quot; Happy , &quot; unable , &quot; I &apos;m going to be a magic of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes next day , for the dancer , when you wake up and find out that are the 11 in the morning of Martedesday and the last last one is not more .
It &apos;s just a great mortal to the ginocrates , and maybe it &apos;s not going to be able to get any more to that altitude .
And maybe no one is going to sing the name of God as a gira , and what is going to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s difficult .
This is one of the most painting reconciliations to do in a creative life .
But it may not have to be so correct if you can &apos;t believe , you know , the most extraordinary aspects of your being being being from yourself .
But it just credit that you are actually given from a unimaginable source of this team of your life that team of your life that you have to go to someone else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think of this way it changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s certainly like I thought of it for several months during the working of the book that I &apos;m going to present on , the dangerous , I &apos;m attached , the dangerous , I attempted to my great success .
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel electrized from this is , I don &apos;t fear .
Don &apos;t flow you . It just do your job .
It &apos;s got to introduce you for your side , any one can be .
If your job is dancing , you dancing ,
If the divine , I &apos;m enabsurd you decide to let you just get some kinds of wonderful , for one moment , for just time through your efforts , then &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Otherwise , you do the same dance .
And &quot; Oh , &quot; to yourself .
I think it &apos;s got to teach it .
&quot; Oh , &quot; to yourself , even for having the love of human and testabligine testabligine to make you present .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Oh !
As you know , I &apos;ve already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , about what can mean and discovery of new set of genes .
Now we &apos;re starting a new path : we started digital biology and now starting to digital the biology and now we &apos;re coming up in a new phase of biology , designing and synthizing life .
We always tried to ask big questions .
&quot; What &apos;s life ? &quot; is something that many biologists , I think they tried to understand various levels .
We tried different approaches , reducing it to the minimum terms .
We &apos;re digitizing by about 20 years ever .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the analog world of the computer digital world .
Now , we can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome genome that can authoretic in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create one more small .
We can get a hundred genes of the genes of the about 500 that are here .
But when we look at its metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our way .
You believe me , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this can bring to a cell .
So we decided that the only way to design was synthesize this chromosome so that we could actually change the components to ask some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of &quot; Can we synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Can we have the chemical constantly producing these big molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create before ?
And in case , we can do that , we can make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemicals .
The speed with which we are able to digitize life is growing at exponential rhythm .
Our ability to write the gene code , instead , who &apos;s moving fairly , but it &apos;s getting better .
And our most recent results are carrying it on a exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process required a lot of passages , starting with a bioethic review before we started the first experiments .
But we found that we synthesize of DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that produce small segments of DNA , and the long length of 30 to 50 letters , and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the more mistakes there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments and corgging the errors .
And this was our first attempt , starting with digital information from the digital genome of Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a small virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , we did the mistakes and actually got a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemicals and we put it in the bacteria , the bacteria have started reading this in the bacteria , they started reading this genetic code and produce viral particles .
The viral particles were released by cells , they come back and they have destroyed .
I &apos;ve been talking about recently with members of the oil industry , I said that they certainly understand this model .
They have rice more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where software can actually build its same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in the big .
We wanted to build the entire chromosome of the bacteria .
I &apos;m more than 580 mila letters of genetic code .
So we thought we built it in the cassette of the viruses , so that we can change cassette cassette to understand what the components of a living cell .
It &apos;s critical , and we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard accuracy was a mistakes for every 10 mies .
We found out , we sequencing it , 30 errors . If we had the same sequence that we never would be able to work .
One part of the process is to design segments that are overwhelmers over-sovereign with all the other segments of 50 letters to build smaller sub-working together .
We take unic elements here .
You &apos;ve probably read that we put in the side of the flyle .
Think of it , we have a gene code on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters have to code about 20 amminoacids , and there &apos;s a specific order of letters for every amminoacids .
So we can use the gene code for writing , fraskles .
What we did at the beginning was autograin it .
Some people have been delused to the fact that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
We designed these segments to be able to just one with enzyme .
There are , there there are that they put together .
And we started to assembly some parts , starting with the parts of the side , starting with the 15-mi-thousand-mi-a-letter , and they were able to form segment of 24 mila letters to get to 72 to put letters to them .
At each step , we made these databables so that we could sequence it because we &apos;re trying to create a very very good process that we can see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems the towns of a basketball game .
When we get these very long segments , more than 100 thousand basis , over 100 thousand basis , they &apos;re not going to grow directly in E.
You get to the limit of modern molecular biology .
So we &apos;ve considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called the homological recurromological repair to repair DNA to repair the DNA that can put together .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , can absorbed three million rad rad of radiation .
You can see in high riquick as the chromosome is destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s actually assembled as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely security .
They can live under empty .
I &apos;m absolutely sure life is that life exist in space , and it &apos;s a new rich of water .
And to say , NASA shown that this is happening .
This is a molecule image that we built , we &apos;ve built , just using the lieven-appropriate design with appropriate design of the segments that are to put .
The yeast , haking them .
This image was not taken with a picture microscope , but with a regular microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It &apos;s a such a molecule that we can see it with a little little little microscope .
These are pictures that they cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the publication that we did a little time ago .
They are over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the greatest molecule of a defined structure that &apos;s ever created by man .
It has a 3-high weight weight .
If we &apos;re going to do it with a 10 without spaces , we would like 142 page , we would like 142 to transform this gene code .
Now , how do we work ?
Of course , you take a virus is a boy .
It &apos;s a little more complicated when they use bacteria .
It &apos;s simpler even when it &apos;s eucarial cells as our : you just get the nuclear and put one more , which is basically the clonation process .
In the bacterium that &apos;s chromosome is instead integrated inside the cell , but we &apos;ve been demonstrate that we are able to do a complete transplant of a cell transplant from one cell to another and activer .
We clean a chromosome parent from a microbial species .
The two of them are different than the tops .
We &apos;ve added some gene in a way that we could decide which to choose for this chromosome .
And then , the flew with the enzymes so that they would kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell is raped -- and you &apos;re open our graph -- and you &apos;re open our graph -- the new chromosome has gone into the cell .
And we started thinking that we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to try to get us beyond .
This is one of the major evolution of evolution .
We found that that many species have added a second or a third chromosome , somewhere , I add in a second thousands of new traits to that species .
So those who thinks about evolution as one gene at the time that you can actually get a lot of biology .
There are some enzyme called &quot; restriction enzyme , &quot; which even digital the DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell , you can &apos;t do one .
The mobile phones -- the mobile phones that we put it up --
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other chromosome as exhtraneous , and we found with only the cell and the new chromosome .
It &apos;s become blue because of the genes that we put in .
And in a short time , all the characteristic of a species went lost , and it turned around the new software that we put into a new species , based on the new software that we put in the cell .
All the proteins have changed , members have changed , and when we read the gene code that we &apos;ve moved .
Now , this may seem like a genetic alchemy , but by DNA alter , we can change things in a very substantial way .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that there is not the genesis -- but progress from three and a half million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the Cambriana in which they &apos;re going to create new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s kind of obvious when we think about our need .
We &apos;re going to go from six and a half billion people to 9 billion in the next 40 years .
Just for example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there &apos;s three people on the planet for each one of them in 1946 ; in 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medicine , blin-and-a-half billion and a half billion people .
It &apos;s going to be more hard to do it for nine billion .
We &apos;re going to use more than five billion coal-coal , over 30 billion barrels of oil .
That means a hundred million barrels a day .
When we try to find biological processes , whatever process to replace , to be a huge challenge .
And in the more we have to realize the CO2 emission from these materials that end up in the atmosphere .
In the day , because of the scientific discoveries around the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the design of the future .
The electronic industry has only about a dozen about components , and think about how many different things have come out .
Our limits here are data , principle from reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , because of these methods of synthesization , able to create what we call a combinatory genomics .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think of the 20 million genes of the 20-year processing to produce the processes to produce or drugs , or pharmaceums , we can change , because of a small team , and create more molecular biology that in the last 20 years .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemicals or fuel production , or chemicals ,
This is an instantaneous of some software programmed that we &apos;re working on to be able to sit and design a computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know necessarily as they &apos;re going to be .
We know exactly what their gene code is their gene code .
Now , we &apos;re focusing on the fourth generation .
You also saw you that extranol from the grain was a hurt experiment .
We have coal-second , third generation that will be used enough to be on the sugar to higher coal than like the eight-p-like butanol .
But the only way biology to have a big impact without increasing the cost of food and limestone cost of the available food and limb that would be transfer CO2 in the first , so we &apos;re working to design cells that can achieve this purpose , and we think we can have the first fourth of generation in about 18 months .
Solar A.C. . The solar light combined metodo--- but in our discoveries around the world , we &apos;ve found different metods .
This is an organism that we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , about 2,500 feet of depth to the ebollitemperature .
It creates by CO2 using molecular hydrogen by using molecular hydrogen as a source .
We &apos;re trying to figure out that we can incanaling CO2 , which can easily be carried through tubes , converting that CO2 in fuel , to lead this process .
So , short we think we could be able to increase what the question of &quot; what life is &quot; is , &quot; What is &quot; we are , versus &quot; what life is &quot; we have the modest goal to replace to replace the entire chemical industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do this from TED , where can you do it ?
It would be a major energy source source .
Also , we &apos;re working to use the same metods to create instantanecher vaccine .
You saw this year with flu , we &apos;re always back of one year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s about the right thing to find the right vaccine .
I think you can change change by making combinable vaccine in anticipe .
And this is how the future may start to look at the time , the tree of evolution , accelling evolution with synthetic bacteria , arches , archadei , and thereucariote .
We &apos;re so much like we improve people .
Our purpose is to do so enough to try to make it . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the most quickly possible , some fundamental work , the new technology that we took Microsoft in the purchasing a almost a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s an environment in which you can interact with is local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data .
Here we are seeing here , many gigabyte of digital photos with a kind of zoom , and continuous for a fast panoramic , desting images as we want to .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much the amount of information that we see , how big these collections that we see , how big these data is .
Most of the digital photographs , but this for example is a scan from the Library of Congress , and it &apos;s going to be in the gamma of the Congress , and it &apos;s going to the gamma of the 3megapiel .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that the only thing that &apos;s the one thing that &apos;s the number of pocket as the number of pocket in any time . It &apos;s also very flessible architecture .
This is a book whole , example of not data .
This is the Dickens . Every column . Every column is a chapter .
To show you that it &apos;s really about textent and not of images , we can do something like this , to really see that it &apos;s a real representation of the textbook , not of a photos .
It may be a little artificial way to read a little artificial way to read a piece of electronic book .
I don &apos;t recommend it .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s a number of The Guardian .
Each picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the good experience of reading the real carracea , or of a everyday , which is for nature a multi-type of half .
We also did something with the angle of this number in particular number of The Guardian .
We created a high-resolution advertising -- much higher than what you use in a normal public-the-one advertising content .
If you want to see the characteristic of this automobile , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even even the specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the space limits of space on the screen .
And I hope that this means to put people up and other similar , and other similar porcheries , not have to be necessary .
Of course , mapklie is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say that we have to help you also in this field .
These are all streets in the United States overwheel-to-sovereign image of NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually alive on the Web ; you can go to see it .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which fight two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research at Steve Snavely , a student at Steve Seitz of Washington , with the help of Steve Seitz of Microsoft Rick Szeliski Rick Szeliski Rick Szeliski Rick Szeliski &apos;s Szeliski Rick .
And it &apos;s live on the Web , managed by Seadround .
You can see when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from one image to another and have this kind of experience to be multiple it .
But the space spacal images here actually have a meaning .
The visualization algorithms of the computer algorithms have these images together , so that correspond to the real places that the imagination -- all the little shot to the Grasks on the Roccies -- they were taken . So here you see the elements of a sli-show , and these things have .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more spacal .
I want to go directly to one of the original data set of Noahnaked -- and this is from a previous prototynth that we did work for the first time the summer -- to show you what I think is really the key behind this technology , Photosynth technology . And it &apos;s not necessarily obviously as much by looking at the environments that we put in the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of Nothree-Dame images , he took from Flickr . Baucuch . Baucuch Nothree Dame in Flickr and you get images of types and so on . You get one of these bounts , and so on . You get one of these arancient , which was discovered to hold to this model .
So , they &apos;re all images from Flickr and they were all connected to the spacal level in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to igate this very simple way .
You know , I would never have thought of finish on Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratification to receive this kind of accurate .
I think you can see that this is a lot of different kinds of photos of phones that SLR , a significant , which is a significant number , put together in this environment .
And if I can do it , I try to try those more strange .
Many blocks from faces , etc .
Somewhere there &apos;s a series of photographs -- this is a series of photos --
This is a poster of Nothree-Dame , correctly .
We can go from the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with the social environment . This is now taking from the susuit -- the collective memory of how it looks like the earth , from visual point of visual view -- and connects that data together .
All those pictures get connected together , greater than the parts .
You have a model of the entire that emerge .
Think about this as the prolungment of Stephen Lawler &apos;s work on the virtual Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as people who use it , and the advantages that are the advantages to get it with the use .
Their photos are marked with metaphor to other people .
If someone comes to the idea of contrast all these sets , say , my name , my picture of the Cathedral picture of Nothing three Dimprovisisisisisdom , you can use it as ingress for diving to immersed in that space , in that metaphor , using the pictures of other , and have a social experience of the kind of cross-moot-cross-and cross-user .
Of course , a consequence of all of this are virtual models of all interesting virtual patterns and collected from not only seen airplane and planes and satellite images and similar , but from the collective .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I got that ? What &apos;s your software is going to be that at some point in the next years , all the pictures that we have been doing is , in the entire world are going to be practically connected with anybody in the entire world will be practically connected together ?
BAA : Yeah . What &apos;s doing in practice is doing in practice is doing .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it &apos;s going to be on the baskets .
And what &apos;s really interesting if you think about the seanti-height of seanti-up information that many of these images have been possible .
As you do a images of the web , you have a sentence and the text on the Web page is a lot of information about the pictures .
Now , what happens if that picture is connecting all your photos ?
So , the amount of semanantic interconnection and the amount of wealth that comes out is really huge . It &apos;s a classic network of it .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible . Compoundary .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the most pleasures when you travel and one of the etnograinfall is the way to live between who didn &apos;t forget the antic traditions , between the verses , the hits the hits of the hits , the hits in the wind , it is the rain in , the leaves of plants .
Basti Jaguar , the Samani Jaguar Lattea , or that the old mites of the old Inuit are still colummites of the Designore , the distinctive budget still breath of the Dharma , to remember the central of the DDDDDharma , to remember the central of anthropology , and the idea that the world that we live in which we live in no solid solved in sense , but it &apos;s just a reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that we have made , well or bad , or many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of essential trawils .
We all all of them . We all procrease .
We are subjects to start with rhythic .
We have to face the inexorability of death , so we don &apos;t surprise , if we &apos;re leap ,
We all have an art .
What &apos;s the point is the particular race of song , the dance of any culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that the Penan of Borneo &apos;s forests , or the follow of the Voodoo &apos;s warrior or the desert warrior in the Kaisut in Kenya , Curander , or a camp in the Sahara .
He was my journey of journey in the desert a month ago , or a yak haller in Qomolangma , Everest dea mother of the world .
All of these populations are teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And , if you reflect a moment , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
Together , the peoples of the world are creating a spiritual , spiritual life that has the planet and cultural life that has the planet and it &apos;s important to the planet , as biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural spider as a nososphere and you can call the etnososphere and you can call the etnosh of all concepts , dreams , mitted , ideas , inspirations , intuition , and inspiration from the human imagination of awareness .
The etnososphere is the great potential of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be as the pollution is .
And because biosphere was very much more , it &apos;s been very much more quickly .
No biologist , for example , would say that 50 percent of all species is on the bear or is the extinction simply because it &apos;s fake , or -- in the most apocalyptic diversity -- and you don &apos;t even get closer to hypothesis -- and you don &apos;t even get to the most optimistic -- that of cultural diversity .
The surfer of all of this is , of course , the language loss .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not a vocabulary or a vocabulary or a series of rules .
One language is the language of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle that the animous of every culture comes in in the material world .
Every language is a forest , a kiss , a thought , a thought of a spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re sitting in Monterey , at least half not being subsurred in the children .
It &apos;s not the children , which means , unless than the children , the one that means , not campaign something that has already died .
What &apos;s the most sad than the way of being had the silence , the last one speaking to a language , the way to be the last one of the way to be able to transmit wisdom of the children ?
This becoming from a fenthuded , some of the world every two weeks . every two weeks -- every two weeks , every two weeks , every old sillabor of a language .
And I know someone to say , &quot; Don &apos;t it better ?
The world wouldn &apos;t it be a better place if we were talking all the same language ? &quot; Well , we &apos;re all talking about yoruba .
We talk about kogi .
You &apos;ll find a sudden what it means to be able to be able to talk about their language .
I would like to do you do a journey through the etnosphere --
a small journey in the etnososphere to give you a assumption of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , &quot; different ways of exist , &quot; I mean , &quot; different ways of existing .
So let &apos;s take for example , this Barasana bee in Sentrional Amazon , the people of the anaconda &apos;s River &apos;s peanaconda &apos;s river of the latte panish &apos;s river in the poured panish &apos;s .
It &apos;s a people who can &apos;t tell the blue color from the green because the black black black black black from the green because the time cell , which is identified in the forest , that people depends the people .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rule , called &quot; exogamlinguistic : You have to marry a person who talks a different language .
This is all has roots in the mythological past , though the particularity is that in these families in the past , and the year , and they &apos;re talking about six or seven languages because of the matririril-income .
They &apos;re limb to listen and then they start talking about .
We take one of the most interesting tribe with which I lived , the Waorans of the Ecuador , an incredible people that had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionary had tried to take a fatal mistake .
They made up the top photographs that were retracting them in the audience that was very loving , forest that this rainforest people had never seen anything two-dimensional .
They &apos;ve taken the pictures of the earth , they turned to the research of a form or a figure , and not out , they have the five missionary , and they killed the five missionary with the lance .
But Waorani didn &apos;t kill only the foreigers .
They killed between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We were saved to eight generations and we found two natural death , and when we sent to know , they had to say , they admitted that one of them had invecked , and then killed him , and then killed it . &#91; Risked &#93; Ad every way , they had an incredible knowledge of the forest .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine for 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned to me a really interesting task when my Harvard professor , I asked if I wanted to go to Haiti in infolds between the secret secret of Duvalier and Tonton Macout-maizes , and I imposes of the poison .
To make sense of the miraculous , I should have to understand Voodoo culture and the Voodoo is not magic .
It &apos;s pretty much about a complete metaphor view of the world .
Many interesting .
If I ask you to tell me about the world &apos;s great religions , what would you say ?
Christianity , Islam , Buddhism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no faith . And instead , and the Voodoo , is not the other than the distilled of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious concepts in slaveies .
What makes a interesting thing that makes the voodoo is the intense relationship between life and death .
So , you saw the spirits are going to be .
Agi spirits can be invocated by the Great Acqua , they respond to the race of the dance and they replace temporary to live as a brief way that for a short brief the folds of the folds get the god .
So , for this voodooists like , &quot; You &apos;re going to go to the church to talk about God .
We give up in the temple , and we become God . &quot;
And from the time that you &apos;re posing , is the spirit that drives you , how can you get your bad ?
So you see these incredible events : So , you &apos;re following voodoo in state state of trance that touch infueled , a pretty strong demonstration of the body when it &apos;s catalyzed ,
And I give you all the people that I had the most extraordinary , are Kogi SSanta Marta City City , in the Santa Marta Colombia .
They have to be the ancient civilization that once were living on the carrying on the charge of the Colombia on waiting for the conquician , the people would retreat on the volcanic mamains that eries would be done on the carrying plant plant plant .
In a continent of blood , this populated populated , this people was never conquered by the spagnoles .
But I &apos;m today , they &apos;re actually actually , they have a clero , but their formation formation is very extraordinary .
The young people are taken by families to three or four years , and they live secreted in a dark and shadows in a world &apos;s good and shadows at the bottom of the 18 ice ice for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years of the proposal to produce the nine months of gestation that they &apos;re in the user of mother , now they are metaphor in the user Grande Mather .
For all this time , they &apos;re accultured to values of their society , values that are predicting that their prayers and just their prayers and keep the cosmic balance -- or to say the best ecological balance -- or to say the ecological balance .
And the term of this incredible initiation , they &apos;re suddenly brought out and for the first time to be , at 18 years , see an alba alb . And that &apos;s the actual awareness , when the sun kiss the beautiful valuable valuable valuable , when the sun comes up with the beautiful valuable valuable . The pret does a step of the readed up and says ,
&quot; Visto me as ? I said .
It &apos;s wonderful . Now it &apos;s now to you can protect it . &quot;
They call a greater brothers and say that we , brothers , minors , we are the cold of the destruction of the world &apos;s destruction .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the indigenous popular populations and the environment we call Rousseau and the old story of the selling seldom , which is a racist concept of it , or maybe we invoke Thoreau and we say that these people are closer to the Earth of us .
Indies , people are not feelings nor feelings from nostaly .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the malarial paluds of the Tibet , but because it &apos;s frozen in the skydives , but because it &apos;s created a mystical of the Earth based on the concept of being confident , but on a lot more intuition of it -- the concept that the Earth can live only because it &apos;s infused by human awareness .
What does that mean ?
It means that a child in the Ande that Ande who &apos;s increasing the mountain is a spirit of the Apu that will be a human being deeply different and will have a very different relationship with the mountain or that place with a Montana that increasingly , a mountain or that place with Montana , who &apos;s increased .
That &apos;s the dimora of a spirit or a mineral caught is irrelevant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that &apos;s called the metaphor that &apos;s natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia Britannica , believing forests that they were used to be cut .
And that was a different human being different from my friends Kwakiutl , who believe that forests are the forests of Hukuk and the bor the bar of the heaven and the cannias that live in the world , I &apos;ll be able to the extreme of the world , and the canopy that we will face in the Hukukuk .
If you start to consider that these cultures can actually create different reality , you can start to understand some of them senational discoveries . We take this plant .
I took this picture to open in the ninkle Amazon the ninety Amazon .
Maybe some of you have heard about the ayahuasca , the most powerful psychoactive substantial psychoactive repertory .
What makes the fascinating ayahuasks is not the potential of the substance , but the processing elaboration . It &apos;s made from two elements .
On one hand , this lian legning lious , which is a beta-coal series , harm and harm , slightly hallucinogen , slightly hallucinogen , slightly hallucinogen , slightly hallucinogen , slightly and harm , slightly henly and harmoline , slightly hallucinogen , slightly hallucinogen and hardly , slightly hallucinogen , slightly housing .
And by trying to take the only plant , you know , a smoke , and it &apos;s a little bluring , but it &apos;s mixed with the leaves of a candthrooms of the family &apos;s called Poptry and .
This plant has triptamine , very similar to the serotonin , dimethyptamine , dimethyptamine .
If you ever see the Yanomami thypppyllyptamine . It &apos;s also methydimethypppyyyyppppylyppppylyptamine .
Tiring that dust for the nose is a little bit like being shot from a pinch to the barrassy of lighttime and land on a sea of electricity . &#91; Risate &#93; Not creates a distortion of reality .
I would often say to my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who was shown with the psycheeeeechen , with his discovery of hallucinogens in Mexico .
Second my thesis not going to class these tripamine as as hallucinogens because if you did not tell any being hallucinated . &#91; Risen . &#93; trtrramatic . They can &apos;t be abunte because they &apos;re denial , because they &apos;re obviously in a enzyme that &apos;s obviously in the entire intestine , decathin , decades .
It &apos;s just as possible to be the horrible with other chemicals that would be MAO .
Now it &apos;s the beautiful : the beta-coal-coal that are injelled of MAO , the same guy needs to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the tripamine . The question is spontaneous : in a 80,000 species of plants , how do these people have to find two defological version of them , but that if you combine deeper , we create a biochemical version that are upset of parts ?
We use the great eugal of evidence and error , which can be infruttifer .
But if we ask Indians , they will tell us , &quot; The plants talk about the Indians .
What does that mean ?
This tribes , Cofan has 17 variety of ayhuasks , which distinguishal variety of the forest , and that at our eyes would come to the same species .
If we ask them how they stbiin their toonomy will tell us , &quot; I thought , &quot; I thought , &quot; Well , I thought , &quot; No , I said , &quot; No .
The solution is : you take 17 variety in a night of moon full night , and they &apos;re going to be a different tone .
With this is not graduate at Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than to contact the stami .
Now , &#91; applausers , the problem is that even those of us that have to heart people who have in the heart of the history of respectables , but in some way , and it &apos;s going to go beyond .
In fact , the 20th century , in 300 years , it &apos;s not going to remember his technological innovations , but rather like the age we were stopped and and we abbracked actively or passionally accepted the mass destruction of the biological diversity and cultural diversity destruction of the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All cultures through the small-dropped people in a dance for new possibilities .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux have no being Sioux when they put away from the arco and frecked as Americans have no stop being American when they put on the horse and hot .
It &apos;s not change or technology that threatening the integrity of etnostle . It &apos;s the power .
The hard hard hard to domination .
And if you look at the world , I &apos;ll find that these are not destined to disappear .
They &apos;re living creatures and dynamics , and they &apos;re being being out of forces that go beyond their adaptation capacity .
It &apos;s about the Penan --
a nomad in Sarawak , in the Southeast Asian , a people who lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now I reduced to the servitery and the prostitution on the ridge , where you can see the river river river Rived Rived by the day-like , the Rived Rived Curdional Merional Merional , where the nable round of the horizon ,
It &apos;s ready to fill the fashion the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that have come with the discovery of the gold .
If we &apos;re going to go on the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you see the hard dry of the domination .
As you know the genocide , the extinction of a popular level , is convicted to universal level , but the etnocium , the destruction of the lifetime of a people , not only is constyle , but I also also also celebrated in certain environments .
And you can &apos;t understand the Tibet until you go from the beginning .
I &apos;ve been pushed by Chengdu in the West , I got the West Tibet , coming to Lhasa with a young connection , but only came to Lhasa with a young man , but only came to Lhasa with a young , but only came to the statistics that we were hearing about .
6,000 sacred worlds sacred reduced monuments in the dust and centered .
1.2 million people killed the military in the Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascriticized to the Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed to the time of the Chinese invasion .
His , Sue Santiity , in Santiity during the diaspora that has brought the people in Nepal .
Her mother was imprisoned and her blame was rich .
It was taken to hidden in the age of two birth was hidden in his gonna because he couldn &apos;t have him .
Ssister , who did the same , was put in reeducation in reeducation .
One day , he was inavily hot a cooled fascient Mao and , for this transgression , was put to the forced jobs for seven years .
The Tibet can be insopportaable , but the spirit insopposite , but the people of the people of the people is from tener present .
And it flies , all it reduces to a choice .
We want to live in the world of monocromatic monocromatic , or we want to account the world of diversity ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before we died said that his greatest fear was that , in our view of the world is , we &apos;re not only going to see the whole gamma of the human imagination is remarkable to a limited thinking of a limited thinking of a limited thinking of a limb of thinking , but one day we &apos;ll see us a sleep sleeping way to have other possibilities .
And it &apos;s humiliating that we have been on for 600,000 years .
The Neolithic Revolution , who gave us agriculture , who gave us the agriculture , which has done us with the seed , by by by by by having the poetry of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has stent at 300 years .
That shared history doesn &apos;t suggests that we have to all the challenges that we have to deal with the military in the millennia that we &apos;re going to deal with the millennia .
When to these miriades of the world is asked what it wants to say to be human , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we will all refer the chance of being what we are : a kind of a kind of a kind of way that all the people and the gardens can be confers .
I took this picture on the north of Baffin the end of Baffin , when I went to the code of the whales with Inuit , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and the Olaya , and this guy , Olaya , and this man , Olaya story of his grandfather .
The Chanadese government has been not always gentile with the Inuit and the 1950s to set our supremise , we have them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refused to go .
Huing , I tempt for his life , he took all the weapons , and all of his towns .
You know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t feel the cold , they do it .
The skattin the slites were made of fish in the hits of carries .
The grandfather didn &apos;t reach out to the night or the hardly bonylililightica or the lililife-off .
It &apos;s shattempted away , he hot the panked in the peline of foca depted and defected in your hand . When I did the pen were frozen , and worked a lama .
He sprayed up on the end of this cat , and when I became solid , he killed a dog .
He sheled the dog and created a bright , with the toacc , and the dog , he stunned a slict , he stunned on the banks , and it &apos;s disappeared .
We want to talk about horrible with anything ? &#91; Risate &#93; And this , in different ways , &#91; Applausi &#93; is the symbol of the Inuit &apos;s the symbol of the world .
In aprile 1999 , the Canadian government reated , the total control of a greater area of California and Texas .
It &apos;s their new pathids . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s an independent land . They &apos;re all mineral resources .
One beautiful example of how a natione-state can reconcile with his people .
And , to finish , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious to the people who was in these remote areas of the planet , I realize they &apos;re not remote at all .
For someone is home .
They represent the human imagination that they go to the dawn of the time . And for us all of these children , are part of our children , are part of the geography of the hope .
Finally , we of National Geographic , we are convinced that politicians will never come to anything .
We believe that polements --
&#91; Applusi &#93; not be persusive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month , we have to 35 million visits .
156 countries transmit our television channel .
Our magazines are figures from millions of people .
Our work is traveling in the ethnic sphere to bring our audience in places of cultural wonderful , from which they will go away from what they &apos;ve seen and , hopes , they will embracing as a time as the central revealing for the central revealing in a world of diversity , and we have to find a life in a world of life in a world pluralist and multiculticular world , and we have to find a life in a world of life in a world of life in a variety of the world in a life in a life in a life in a life in a life in a world
where all the people of the wisdom of all people can contribute to our collective well-being well-being .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things I wrote about some things I &apos;m going to call this book that I hope you &apos;ve already heard and try to highlightables , in case you don &apos;t notice them .
I would like to start with what I call &quot; the official dogma . &quot;
Dogma official what ?
The dogma official and all Western industrial social social society . The dogma official , &quot; If we want to maximiety of our citizens . &quot;
The reason is , on the side , in the fact that liberty is itself a value , it &apos;s precious , useful , essential for humans .
On the other hand is that if we are free , each of us can act for what masses our well-being , no one that we have no one that decide in our well-being , without any deciding in our name .
The way to male freedom is male for choice .
The more choices , the more of people are libing , and the greater is their well-being .
This , I think , it &apos;s so deeply roomed in society that no one would be dreamed to put it in a question .
And it &apos;s also deeply roomed in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m going to allow me to be a simple notable conditions for the windows .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without contact 10 variety of olive oil , and the 12 actions of whales that you can buy to make you a number of conductive number of conditions in the circumstances that no one of the 175 of your degree already that is saying about your degree .
This is what the supermarket is .
And then you go to the store of electronic to buy a stereo : cases , radio , plash , radio , plash , radio , plasks ,
And in this single piece of electronic store , there &apos;s a great audio number of audio components .
We can do six and a half million different combinations using the components that there are one only store .
You have to admit that there &apos;s a lot of choice .
Other fields : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all the telephone services , at all telephones , to the melt phones that were able to have Bell .
He was noleggiant the phone , you didn &apos;t buy it .
One consequence of that , between the other , was that the phone would never break .
These days , they went .
Now we have a nearly illimited phones , especially between phones .
Here &apos;s cell phones .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , cut them off MP3 , cut them off the brulan-hildlife chrolling for the brulgrade chasing for the brulan-chololeric chasks .
If you don &apos;t have this yet seen in the house , you &apos;re very soon that &apos;s going to get you .
And what happens is that people come in the stores and ask that question . And what &apos;s the answer ? The answer is &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t too much .
So , in other ways of life that are much more important aquicians than the same explosion of choices .
Assistence : it doesn &apos;t happen in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor tell you what you have to do to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do it , we could do it , or B , and these risks &quot; Be and these risks &quot; Be benefits and those risks . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Doctor , what would I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; Well , &quot; Well , these benefits , and B has these benefits and risks . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebats , &quot; Dr. if she was me , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result , we call it &quot; autonomy of the malate , &quot; expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But it &apos;s not that that you can move the weight and responsibility to make decision from someone knows something , which is the doctor , to someone else that knows -- and almost certainly , the dumb is not that , and it &apos;s not that in the design of making .
There &apos;s a huge marketing of products of drugs , direct to people like me and you , that if you think about it doesn &apos;t make sense , because we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why do we advertising them ?
The answer is that they want to ask them to ask them to ask them to change the receiver .
Something like this is the horrific identity is a question of choice , as you see in this vignity . &quot; We don &apos;t want to forced children . I &apos;m going to do their sex at the right moment . &quot; We have to invent .
And we can reinventing how many times you go .
That means that every morning , at the riskkko , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
I &apos;m going to the family and the matrimony , a time time I got the common perspective , was that there was a married one was that there was a stuck to the most soon possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and even what to do after .
I did do this , it &apos;s really to play .
I teach students to very smart students , and I &apos;m going to be 20 percent of work than a time .
And not because they &apos;re not not because they &apos;re not not because they &apos;re less diligent .
But why are they impend , I mean , what do you know is , should I do do it or not ? Is it ? &quot;
&quot; Should I get up later ? I got to think before , or the career ? &quot;
They are logooooth-s-down interrogation .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this is not complete the homework that I teach and not get a good voice to my own hesam .
And they really have to do that . They &apos;re important .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky as Carl subyielated , because technology allows us to work every minute , from every day , from the Hotel Randolph .
In the parentesesesescape , there &apos;s an angle , and I &apos;m not going to tell anybody where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t say that , because I want to use me .
What does this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work ? It &apos;s that we have to continuously deciding , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing calcium , with your mobile phone in the other pocket , Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the notebook .
And even though they &apos;re all spending , every minute that we see our son rovine , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; Do you answer this call ? &quot;
&quot; Do I have to answer this email ? I have to email this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is no , it makes the experience of your son very different from what would be in other conditions .
So , anywhere we look , small and things , small , things , and it &apos;s lifestyle , life is a question of choices .
And once the world was this : Whereas there were some possibilities , but it wasn &apos;t all about it .
The world of today is like this : The world is , &quot; Is it good , &quot; or negative ? &quot;
The answer is . It &apos;s a lot of it .
The good good ones we know , we all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative .
All this is this really really really comment two negative of people .
The first , paradoxically , is that it products paradoooooooooox .
With many options between which choosing , it becomes very difficult .
I give you a significant example : a study of volunteer plans .
And my colleague has been accessed at Vanguard data , the gigantic society , with about a million customers of pension , with about a million customers .
What she found out is that for every 10 solutions that are offer in the more , the percentage of adhhhhhot of two percent .
With 50 sources , there &apos;s 10 percent in less than adhhesions when they &apos;re available . Why are they available ?
Because with 50 sources of which choices , is sick hard to decide , and the choice is rerereturned to the indomans .
And tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course tomorrow .
You know , it doesn &apos;t mean only that these old working working on their dat-fairly , because they &apos;re not going to have enough money , even wants to say that the decision is so persuade the complementary of work .
Not participating , they &apos;re losing until five dollars a year from the work dator , which would be very disposed to versarli .
So the paralysis a consequence of the tropes .
And I think that makes the world .
&quot; And to end , for the ethernity : ketchup , maionesesis ? &quot;
Would you like to make the right decision , if it &apos;s for the eternity , isn &apos;t it ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and even the condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even though we can avoid the parallel and do choice , at the end we are fewer , we &apos;re less satisfied with less options between which they choose .
And this is different reasons .
One of them is that with a lot of conditions between which choose , if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you &apos;d have to do a different choice that would be better . And what &apos;s happening is that the alternative . It &apos;s going to be better . And what happens is that the alternative to the decision ,
even when it was a good decision .
And the choices there are , the easier of any detail that &apos;s uncutting down that it &apos;s uncaught of option .
Also , there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert : It &apos;s very good it is very good it , as the value that we give things to things that we can compare .
So , when there are many options , there are many options , it &apos;s easy to represent the characteristics of the option that has choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m sorry with all of the ones that are not New York .
But that &apos;s what you would probably think .
There &apos;s this couple of the Hamptons .
A place of luxury .
It &apos;s fearing shshaking . Otttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttima . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not going to be . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , eventually , it &apos;s Agust . &quot;
&quot; Everybody &apos;s my neighbor in Manhattan are away . &quot;
&quot; I could parked right in front of the house . &quot;
And it passes to two weeks on the idea that &apos;s losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
costo-concosto-decrease , for what we have , even when choice was excellent .
And the more are the options that we have to consider , the more attractive characteristic features are will be going to be costo-opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This vignity says many things .
It &apos;s about the time , and maybe of living slowly .
But the most important point is that whatever you choose , you can &apos;t do the other .
The things that we don &apos;t choose many attractive attractive that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : spiral of expectations .
I tried it on my skin buying a new couple of jeans .
I &apos;m almost always a jeans .
Once jeans were just like , bought and drinking out of the bestye , were uncomcomfortable , only after they brought them to a life and washed a lot of times , they started going to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple of new when the old ones were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
The committed me , &quot; You want to slim fits , you know , fit ? &quot;
Was you want to be a cernial or with the buttons ? &quot; Stonewashed &quot; or &quot;
&quot; Was you want to be ? &quot;
&quot; Sotto li wants or striking or stretched ? Bla , &quot; Continuclaimed .
I was swhaled , and after a while I was able to say , &quot; I want the guy that was the only guy , &quot; he was the only guy , &quot; I got to get all sick people in the jeans that I had to come out of jeans , and then the best couple of jeans I had ever .
It was the most . With all that choice had the best choice .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse about is that I was my own expectations were altissue , jeans had to be perfect .
I had to minimum expectations . I didn &apos;t expect anything exceptional when there was a kind of , but when I saw 100 different steps , at least one had to be perfect .
What I had to buy was good , but not perfect .
After I was compared to the choices to what I was trying to do , I was just going to get to the expectations .
The adding options in the life of people don &apos;t do that to increasing the excellence of the options themselves .
And that will produce less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
No one in the marketing world .
Because if they knew it , you would not know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more like this .
&quot; It was better when you were worse , &quot; The reason he was better when you were worse is that when you were worse was even possible to meet pleasant .
Offer , the world we live in , in the world that we live , opulent citizens with the expectation of perfeition -- the most we can hope is that things are at the altitude of expectations .
You never surprise liked because your expectations , my expectations , I had to have been ingigantic .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Besearlier &quot; Yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Baxis . &quot; You want it . &quot;
I mean -- small authographical moment -- which I &apos;m really married and my wife is really wonderful .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t have to do better , I didn &apos;t have to do better , I couldn &apos;t do that I could do not do better , I could not have to do better , I couldn &apos;t do that I could do not have to do better , I not have to do better , I couldn &apos;t do that I could do better , I not have to do better , I could &apos;t have
But it &apos;s not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of buying a couple of jeans when there &apos;s just that you have that when you &apos;re not satisfied , and you ask , &quot; Why ? &quot;
Who &apos;s responsible ? &quot; , the answer is clear .
The world is the responsible . What would I do ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of jeans , and you buy a inssatisfaction , and you ask , who is the responsible , it &apos;s just close that responsible , it &apos;s the responsible , it &apos;s you .
You could have done better .
With hundreds of variety , there are no excuse for the insuccess .
So when people make decisions , even though the result is valid , you feel insatisfaction and give the blame to them .
In the last few years , depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only , but important -- of this wave of depression is just that people have deludent experience because standards are too much .
And when they have to explain this situation , they think the blame is them .
So the end result is that we &apos;re better , in fact , we &apos;re better better , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely fake .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little choice better choice than having any better deal , but it from this doesn &apos;t go from much better .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic value . I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve been overcome from a piece of level where the choices are improvements to our life .
Now , from a politician -- I almost finished -- I &apos;ve got nearly the political point of view , the peanuts is the following .
What it allows all of this in industrial society is wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know pareks , where the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too bad .
So the faccenda that I &apos;m talking about is a malit that I &apos;m talking about is a dry Western society .
And what it does depressing and angry is : Steve Levitt spoke to you yesterday how those expensive and seats for a child . It &apos;s a money push . It &apos;s a money .
I mean these choices , complicated and dependious , it &apos;s not just as they are just inutile .
I &apos;m even deleteries .
They &apos;re doing worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows so much choice to be reversed in those where people are too much possibilities , it wouldn &apos;t just be the life to improve but our own .
This is what economists call are a good improvement .
A redistribution of income redistribution of income , not only to poor -- because of this choice that &apos;s so much about it .
So to conclude , &quot; You can become everything you want . &quot;
You know , people of culture , you think , &quot; What do you think , &quot; What does it believe that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t do anything in a glass of glass . &quot;
&quot; One of the imagination , a limited view of the world --
and I &apos;m really interpreted it as , at the beginning .
But then , I realized , I got that that the fish knows the long knows the fish .
Because the reality is that if you &apos;re missing the reality is that if you &apos;re missing the bleaks , so that you can &apos;t get freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you break the bold way that everything is divents that everything you can decrecrease satisfaction .
You get the paralysis , and you reduce the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too strange , maybe even for fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of some sphere is a recipe for inhappiness and I &apos;m afraid for the rovine .
Thank you very much .
