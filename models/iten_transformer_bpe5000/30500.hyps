Last year I showed these slides to show that the arttic ice , which for almost three million years had the size of the 48 of the United States .
However , this subjected the gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice ice of ice .
The arttic ice is , in a sense , in a sense , the clean heart of global climate system .
It expands in the winter and you retreat .
The next slide slide is going to be a carrelied revenue of the last 25 years .
The glacts are reached in red .
And as you see , they go down to the blue dark dark .
That &apos;s the winter ice in the winter , which is going to be summer .
You can see that the so-called ice perenabled , five years or more , is like a blood , which here was from the body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s gone from that , so .
This is a problem because the interests that are the land land , the glacious land where there are huge amount of fuel , which is a huge amount of fuel that , they &apos;re transformed in metal .
I &apos;m going to be a total of the atmospheric pollution , that amount could be doubling , that amount could be doubling , super-up this point of not return .
And some deep deep lagues in Alaska metan , the metan is already ribullying from water .
The professority Katey Walter at the University of Alaska team was a team , a Last team was a Last Linvern .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Wow ! The question is if we &apos;re also going to be .
One reason is this exchange termal surround from the northermal .
This is a river at the glacial regime .
The door had never ever ever reached that .
This is the Kangerlussuaimal , in the southest of the Greenland .
If you want to know how to look at the sea level to the shelf of the glasses on the ground , here is where the sea .
These currents are rapidly increasing .
On the other side of the planet : Antarctica , the greatest block of ice on the planet .
Last month , the scientists have said that the balance of ice is in the negative , and the Western Antarctica , which rain on some submarine islands , is particularly quick with some underwater issues .
It &apos;s about six meters than the five feet of the water , like in Greenland .
Sulil Himalaya , the third largest block of ice , you see new lagues , which a few years ago .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population received half of the welsewhere .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the water of this city .
The ported is increased .
But when it deminds , the same happens to the same in the potable water .
In California , snow on the Sierra Nevada is demined 40 percent .
The hyririries are in the crisis .
The predictions , as you &apos;ve read , they &apos;re grasses .
The safety growing safety in the world , and it &apos;s increasing incended .
The environmental disaster is increasing a rhythm and unprecedented .
Four times more numerous in the last 30 years I was respect to the previous 75 .
This is an unsustainable gap .
If you look at the historical context , they can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the point of the East Pacific , the Americans , the Americans , to the Americans , and both both parts of the subcontinent , where there &apos;s a radical royal oxygen in the ocean .
The greater cause of global warming , and together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the fossil fuels use use .
The oil is a problem , and the coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with more emissions , together to China .
And he proponates to build a lot of other central central center-to-the-the-the-and-a-a-central .
But we &apos;re seeing a change of direction .
These are the projects annullate projects in the last few years and some versus alternative .
In the way , there &apos;s a politics cave in our country .
The industrial and coal and oil has spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote to clean fuel fuel , which is a bone .
That picture me reminded me something --
Verso , in the Tennessee , where I live , where I live , there was a loss of 3.8 billion lions .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen it on the news .
This is the second largest flows in America .
It &apos;s happened around the Christmas .
The Chalog advertising one of the industrial industrial .
Video : Surry carbon . ♫ ♫ Frosty the carbon is a very happy ,
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it &apos;s growing our economy .
Frosty the carbon is more and more and more clean .
It &apos;s a good price , adorable and the workers keeps the workers tend to be wider .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The greatest society on the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Back , I &apos;ll be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosis , Nancy Pelosy , Harry Reid -- they &apos;re not talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima Protection of Clima has launched two campaiged .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Attore : At the CALergy : At the time , we see climate change as a threat our business .
So , for this priority is to invest a huge amount of money in a public effort to make public and confused the coal truth .
In fact , coal is not spork .
We think it &apos;s clean -- it also has a good profumo .
So you don &apos;t pretend to be about climate change .
Let me do .
Video : Carbon -- you &apos;ve heard a lot of them .
So let &apos;s take a turn into a look at the avanguard for how clean fuel is .
Straordinarily ! The machines are a little noised , but this is the sound of the fuel technology .
The coal consumption is between the major causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology of the fuel that you see change everything .
You &apos;re looking at : this is the puzzle hate fuel technology .
Al Gore : The good good alternative is connected to economic question and the national security .
Video : America is in the crisis ; Africa is the economy , national security , climate crisis .
The threads all : our dependence from fossil fuels , like the fossil and oil , like the coal and oil .
Now , though , there &apos;s a new , auduty solution to use .
Really , 100 percent clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to report for America , to make us more safe , and help stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that drinking solution that drinking our problems .
Real . Scoprite more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It &apos;s about re-energy to America .
One of the faster ways of bringing to dependence by the fuel that kills our planet .
Comparsa : The future is here . Go , a new energy network .
Comparsa : Nurry number two : New aging for jobs well-retributed jobs .
Complplant : Really . It &apos;s time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old African lunch says , &quot; If you want to go fast , go to the faster , go .
If you want to go far , go together . &quot;
We have to go far far , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I made a introduction on the LHC .
And you can get back to go back to you back to how the car works .
So here I am here . And for the ones that the other time there was , the LHHC is the greatest scientific experiment ever attempt -- 27 kilometers of surrounding .
His task the conditions that were there , less than a billionth of a second since the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
It &apos;s just ambitious .
This is the car under Ginevra .
We would take a little bit of these mini-Big Bang in the relevators .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- it &apos;s a fourd diameter and it &apos;s a 22 diameter of 22 meters .
This is an ATLALAS in construction so you can see proportions .
The 10 September of the last year we have packed the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLALAS .
It was because of immense fits in the control room .
It &apos;s an image of particles that had done all the around the LHC , and he walked into the collision , deliberately , with a part of LHC , and spread particles within the remarkable lever .
In other words , when we saw that picture the 10 section , we realized that the car was going to work , which is a great vicuum .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to do more or this , when somebody went on Google and saw that the initial page was this .
That means we had a cultural impact beyond that science .
About a week later , there was a problem with the car , we had to these files here -- these dorate files .
These films take 13,000 ampampals when the car works at the most of the power .
Now , the technicians between you will look at the files and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . They &apos;re too throws . &quot;
And they can do it because when they &apos;re very cold , they &apos;re called the the so-called the throws .
So , at less 271 degrees , at a lower temperature than space between stars , these files can bring that current .
In one of the gigunture between the most novel magnets in the LHC , there was a defect of factory .
So the films surfed up slightly , and the 13,000 ampfigured out a electrical resistance .
This was the outcome .
Now , this is even more impressionate , if you think these magnets fish are about 20 tons , and they moved about 30 inches .
They have a call about 50 magnets .
We had to take them , what we did .
We repristinted and wandsters .
They are now coming back to the place .
I &apos;m going to be the march the LHC is going to be again integrate .
We will accuse it , and we expect to get data or July , and continue so our adventure to find out what the morning is the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these crashes reach the debate about the value of science and science and the frontier engineering and the frontier .
I think the fact that &apos;s so hard , the fact that &apos;s so hard , I think , I think it &apos;s the value of things like LHHC .
I &apos;d like to end with the words of an Inglese scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , I guess , in the defense of experiments of his clean . Humphhot &apos;s Michael Faraday , he said , &quot; No is so dangerous for the human mind as the ideas of science is definitely , not mysters in nature , which is definitely not mysters in nature , and there are no mysters in the case of conquurous monds . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start asking about rethink about when you , you play with children , play with the morning .
And as you could get them and get them and get them and and move them , and you learn , and you learn in reality , and you learn about problems , and by by by capting and by the space relationships .
The space argument is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , by the usual usual usual of our interaction with physical objects , together to my Patch , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , and I started asking me , &quot; And if , when we use a computer , instead of having the only songs of mouse as a TTTTTal , which is a deskpolytrel , we could have to have some information with both hands , hands , and both hands , and hands ,
and fix it ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big interactive computer as a biscope .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big interactive computer as a biscope .
You can see them with your hand , they can see , &quot; they can see their movement and they have a screen and they have a screen and a wireless radio .
But nevertheless , they &apos;re physical physical objects , like the morning , you can just move it to just get out .
The Sifmonetly , an example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physical , as they &apos;re constantly moving , and other , and as as they become more physical , and as they &apos;re conwardly , of the movement , of the other , how we can we explore new and interaction style .
I &apos;m going to start with some simple example .
This Siftool , this is configured to show video : if you start to the video : if you start on the other way , if you start on the other side .
These interactive portraits are aware of the other .
If you rely them , they &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re around them .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they notice and they can agitate a little bit .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they notice and they can agitate a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was able to use communities , in fact , in fact , in fact , if it &apos;s a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurate like a real frame of painting and I can use it to go into the central color , where they mischip .
and I can use it to go into the central color , where they missing .
And we can get too , we can put a little bit about it .
And there are also beautiful possibilities of learning , like languages , like languages , the mathematics and logic games where people can try things things quickly , and see the results the results right now .
Now , I &apos;m --
This is a Fibonacci that I do with a equations program .
So we have a words that is in half of Scarabeer and Boggle .
Basically , to every Turn you get a letter in every Siftool , basically , at every Siftis , at every Siftears , and when you &apos;re looking for him , and when you &apos;re looking for him , I &apos;m looking for him , he &apos;s looking for him , you know , by the way , and when you &apos;re looking for him , you know , in a dictionary
Then , after about 30 seconds , they get a new set of letters and new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the children came up to the Media Lab , I did so that I tried them and went and turned it and turned a video .
They were very much liked .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of applied is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
You just have to say , &quot; You know , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s other people who are proving it .
This is our beta younger tester , there on the right .
It really wanted to impllaries .
They were only morning for him .
Now , this is an appliance of an interactive cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool for learning . He &apos;s called &quot; Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , lifted the Siftable .
It can put new characters in the scene , lifted the Siftable .
So , it &apos;s going to get the sun .
Video : The sun is surprised .
David Merrill : Now , he took a treatment in the scene .
Video : The arancic treatment .
Well , I &apos;m doing it ! Yes !
So you shake Siftool and put in the neighbors can be interacts with the characters --
Video : Bau !
by inventing your story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a open story with open final , and it can decide him as he gets .
DM : It &apos;s a open story with open final , and it can decide him as he gets .
Video : Good , so , cat it .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , which is made of a recent , to sample and do music .
It &apos;s a tool , which is a recent tool , to shoulder and performing music .
The Siftable here are sounds like the basis , and the battery .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose to use .
You can also also put these sounds in a sequence of your pleasure .
And it just by making it just by touching a sound and a sequence .
These are actually you can control from alive , like the reverse and the filter .
The attacks to a particular sound and then incline for the way .
And then there are general effects as time and volume , which you &apos;re applied to the whole sequence .
Let &apos;s look like , how it works .
Video : DM : We &apos;re going to put a base on two Siftool &quot; sequence , we fix it in a series , we extend , we add it in a series , we add another base .
I &apos;m going to put a low line .
DM : Now I added percussions --
DM : And now I &apos;m going to put the battery , so I can control the vivivive .
DM : DM : I can reveal the whole sequence of time , by one side or the other .
DM : DM : And now I &apos;m going to add the bottom to the bottom to give more expression .
DM : DM : I can reach the sequence &quot; to the flying flight .
So I didn &apos;t have to plan it before , but I can suddenly make it a long way or more straight .
And now , finally , I can smoking the whole sequence of the inclining the left Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new human interfaces more and more resemble as we work and more resembled like our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show one of the results of this , and also some possibilities that we try to get out of the laboratory .
The concept I want to transmit is that &apos;s coming this new generation of things that we &apos;re going to bring this new generation of the media , which will lead information in our world .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time to talk to everybody .
I &apos;m a writer .
I &apos;m going to write books is my profession , but it &apos;s more of this , obviously .
It &apos;s also love and the fascinating of my life .
And I don &apos;t look like to change .
But , I said , something particular happened in my life and in my career , which led me to reeiver the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called &quot; Mangia , Prega , Ama , &quot; What &apos;s diversously , from my previous books , for some reason came out in the world and became a great sensational , interventions .
And the result is that everywhere , now , people treat me , as if I was convicted .
Really -- conducted , conducted .
They are all been all concerned and they &apos;re all worried and say , &quot; Do you don &apos;t fear to do better ?
You don &apos;t fear to continue write all life without being able to create a book that can matter to someone ? &quot;
What can you care about someone ? &quot;
It &apos;s rassuring , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was an adolescent -- I was a writer .
I would go back to the same reaction based by fear .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t I feel like to have successful ?
You don &apos;t fear that the humiliation of refers kills you ?
You don &apos;t fear to do this mestimated all life without anything that &apos;s ever out and to die on a cumb of dreams ?
Those , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I &apos;m afraid of all the things .
I always had fear .
And I also have fear of many other things that people would not have to be ininary .
Like the algae and other things like .
But , as I think about write what I was , and I would ask me , and I wonder is why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logic that anybody has to expect to be frightened by a job that you &apos;ve been missed to do .
But what is there &apos;s all about so particular in the creative companies to make us nervous about mental health as as a mental health of so that other careers don &apos;t do ?
As my father , for example , he was an engineer and I don &apos;t remember one once in his 40 years of activity in his 40 years of activity in his 40 years of activity in his life ?
There was never -- that &apos;s that blockage of the engineer , how do it ?
It didn &apos;t work like this , you know ?
Onestally , chemicals like group are not certainly , in the centuries , the reputation of being alolized manipulate depressive maniacates .
We writers , we have this reputation , and not just creative writers , but creative , we have this reputation of being enormous unstable to mentally mentally .
And it &apos;s not about the other sad , and concrete of creative minds that , only in the 21st century , and they &apos;re often dent-young and often by hand .
And the ones that are not suicked to be really disdissed by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , &quot; Each book has killed me a little more , &quot; A really , a little bit more , &quot; A really , a fashion to work of your life .
But we don &apos;t throw when we feel it because we &apos;ve heard these things so long that we &apos;ve been completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and accepted the notion that creativity and the end , at the end , at the end , it will always constraints to the angosion .
And the question I want to ask everybody here today is : are you agree with this idea ?
It &apos;s going to do this -- because it also looks at a centimeter to me , it &apos;s not good for anything that &apos;s about this support .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous , and I don &apos;t want to see it in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our big creative creative minds to live .
And certainly I know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start fight into that I felt dark for a lighter support , overwhelmed the circumstances in my career .
And that &apos;s a look at , I &apos;m just a young , I &apos;m just a 40 years old .
I still have about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything I &apos;m going to write about the world , and then will be judged by the world as the work that came out after the world , as the last book .
I &apos;m going to be a suit , because we &apos;re all more or less friends here -- is likely that my greatest success is in my shoulder .
Oh , Geso , who thought !
You know , this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start dying in the morning , and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would keep doing this work that we work that we do .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it seems to me , after a lot of reflective , which the way to work to continue write is to create a protective psychological , right ?
I have to find a few ways of safety distance between me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural advance , which I &apos;m going to get it . And I was trying to get it . And I was trying to find some other societies , to see if they could have some better ideas and more healthier ideas and more healthcare .
how to help people manage creative to manage the emotional risks of creativity .
And that research took me to the ancient Great and ancient Rome .
Secties because I come up in circle and then go back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity selvenisse by men , OK ?
And they thought creativity was this spirit looks like , and that sell the men from some different smills and unknown , for distant and unknown , for distant and unknown and unknown .
The Greek called these spirits guardians of creativity .
Socrates , wonderful , believed to have a demon that elargive sets from a long way .
Romans were the same idea , but they called the the spirit without a genius .
The one is great , because the Romans didn &apos;t really think that a genius were somebody who was particularly claim .
They believed that a genius was this kind of a devictims that was believed in literally in the walls of an artist , a little bit like the elevevent , and it came out to the work of the artist and modeling the outcome of that work .
Exctitional -- here , that &apos;s the distance of which I talk about -- that &apos;s the psychological construct that you &apos;re protected from your work .
And everybody knew it was so that he worked , right ?
So , antians were protected by certain things , like , as the too narcies , for example , too narcism , right ?
If your job was exceptional , you didn &apos;t get it all the merit , everybody knew that you were helped by this genius .
If your failure failed , it wasn &apos;t your all your hildlife , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be an incapable .
And so people have han conceived creativity in the Western for a long time .
And then the Renaissance came and everything , and it changed this big idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe above all the mysties and without more to leave space creatures that they write from the divinity .
This was the rational principle and people started thinking about creativity , and people started thinking about creativity selling .
And for the first time in history , you start to referred to this or that artist as a genius that artist in a genius that at a person with the genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think that allow someone to believe that you can believe that they &apos;re like a recient as a source , as a source , and the surfounded , creative and unknown and unknown and the source of all the divins , and unknown and unknown and a very much of human packaging .
It &apos;s like to ask someone to enjoy the sun .
I &apos;m dealing and distors completely and believed all these ingestimatable expectations on the performance .
And I think it was a pressure to destroy the artists in the 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think it &apos;s , and I think it &apos;s now ?
Can we do it diversity ?
You can get to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery creative .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t take 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes of 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience that would be linked scientific suspicious suspects on the notion of , including people who are fused on their own own own projects .
I &apos;m not going to convince you all , I &apos;m going to convince you all about this .
But the question I &apos;d like to ask to ask is -- why not ?
Why wouldn &apos;t you think about this way ?
Because it has more sense of anything that has ever heard to explain exasperating the imprevedability of the creative process .
A process that , as anybody ever tried to do something -- so , basically , everybody here knows , you don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t understand rationally .
And in fact , it can be quite quite quite quite a lot of seven-flew .
I did this , recently recently , with the extraordinary Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but that was a poetly poetly for all life and said , in his his childhood in the rural Virginia , working out in the rural fields , and he felt , in if when a poetry came from the landscape .
He said he was like a train of air .
And she was roling to the landscape .
He felt it was , because he was tremendous to the land under his feet .
He knew that I had one thing to do to have one thing to do , and he was , &quot; run as a match . &quot;
And he was going to go home and he was going to go to this poetry , and have not to get another piece of paper and a match , and it would have to take a piece of paper and a match , and he would collect it and get it on the page .
Other time he couldn &apos;t be fast , so correct and correcrecrecent and he was going to have to go to the house and she was going to go to the house and she would continued to roll through and she would continued to roll through the landscape , trying , as she said , &quot; another poet . &quot;
And then there were those times -- this is not the size , I &apos;ll never forget -- there were some times when it was almost losing , right ?
So , she was running home and she was trying to paper and paper and the poetry and paper and paper a march , and he was going , and he said , &quot; He was going to go , and she was going to go .
And he was going to put poetry and put it into his body and transmitted it to the page .
And in these cases , poetry would be presented to the perfect page , but at the contrary , from the last word to the first word .
So when I was thinking -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly equal to my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conduction !
I &apos;m a mud mud , and my work is ; I wake up to the same orary every day and work and go and go and go and go and go through the himself and work and go through the himself .
But even I , in my summarized testared , I &apos;ve got license against that thing , sometimes .
And I guess a lot of you have the han done .
You know , even if the work and ideas came to me from a certain source , I wouldn &apos;t be honestly know .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it so that we don &apos;t have to lose your head , but rather , which , is that we remains healthy ?
As I think , the best contemporary example I have is the best Tom Waits , I have a different years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life has been the incarnation of the art contemporary , trying to control , management , to check , to control , management , to dominitized species .
But then he was going to come up , and he was driving on a highway in Los Angeles , he changed everything for him .
He was going to be fast and all of a slow , this little framment of melodia , coming in his head of how inspiration , elusiva and and the wants , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the desidera , but you don &apos;t know how to take it .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a mark , it doesn &apos;t have a recorder .
So he starts to hear this kind of old , and grow in him , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose song .
I &apos;m not good enough , and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to the panic , they stopped .
And he put the whole mental process and made something completely new .
He just looked at the sky and said , &quot; Sorry , don &apos;t you see what I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Do you look like , &quot; Do you think it can write a song now ?
If you really want to be there , you go back back to a more closely , when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , you go to unimportance somebody else today .
You go to Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his work process changed after this .
Not the work , the job was still dark .
But the process , and the fish that was the fisheries that was repair when the genius , the genius that was caused a nientle , and they would get it back to where it was going to have been doing , realizing that they didn &apos;t have to be a interior thing , and the turgotten .
But yeah , this peculiar , wonderful bizarre , a conversation between Tom and this thing stretch and the outside that , but it was not Tom .
So , how I felt that story started to change a little bit of the way I worked , and saved me once .
This idea , he saved me when I was writing , &quot; Prega , &quot; and fall in one of those despair , and fall in one of the despair that we cause we &apos;re all working on and we &apos;re all working on and we &apos;re not going to be a disaster , which is the worst book .
Not just bad , the worst book written .
And I started thinking about to throw this project .
But then I reminded me of Tom , who was talking about the air and tried .
So I got my face on the tough and I got my comments and to a vacuum angle of the room .
And I said to high vices , &quot; Sent , what we &apos;re both very brilliant , it &apos;s not going to be entirely , you know , if this book is not going to be a brilliant , no ?
Because as you see , I &apos;m putting all I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want to be better , you have to introduce you and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do , you know , you don &apos;t know anything .
And I &apos;m going to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to be recorded that I was recorded to me to do my part , &quot; because -- at the end is so , OK -- centuries ago in the deserts of the North Africa people were rooms together , dance and music that went on for hours and the dance and so until the dance .
And they were always magnifigured , because the dancy were great professionals .
But every time , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became actually transcendent .
And I know what I &apos;m going to talk about , because I know you &apos;ve all seen , at a point , a performance .
It was like the time you stops , and the dance would walk through a kind of laptop , and it was not different from the usual , like 1,000 noticed before , but all the time it was all the way .
And suddenly , it &apos;s just like a human .
But he accurate from the divinity and the enlightened in fire .
And when this happened , at the time , people knew what was , they called him .
They were Consider , and they started to sing , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , God , &quot; God , &quot; God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
I &apos;m noticed historic -- when the More invest the south of the Spagna , preservacuum , and the ready it changed in the centuries from &quot; Allah , Allah , &quot; which you can still hear in the corride or in the corride or in the corride or in the flamenco .
In Spain , when an artist has done something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , the box , &quot; Alah , and magnificent , &quot; uncomcomprehensible , a God .
And it &apos;s great because we need .
But , the problem comes next day , for the dance itself , when you wake up and find that are the 11 in the morning of Martedday and the last one in Martedday and the last God is there is no longer .
It &apos;s just a very bad dying to the ginoccurs , and maybe it will never be able to get to that height .
And maybe nobody will sing the name of God still while it &apos;s going to take , and so what &apos;s going to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most painting reconciliations to do in a creative life .
But maybe it &apos;s not to be so angosciant if you can &apos;t believe , advancement , you know , the most extraordinary aspects of your being from yourself .
But just believed that you have been data in a unimaginable source of this team in your life that you have to go to someone else when you &apos;ve done .
And , you know , if we think of it changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s certainly like I thought about several months in the work that I was a few months in the work that public public public public public , I &apos;ll be able to do it .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel applied with this is , I don &apos;t fear .
Don &apos;t just fit . It just your job .
Continua present----------------------------of------------the-hand , any can be .
If your job is dance , you know , dance .
If the divine , absurd genius , I &apos;m going to get some kind of wonderful , for a single time through your effort , then , &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Otherwise , you do the same dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot; to yourself .
I think it &apos;s got to teach it .
&quot; Ole ! &quot; to yourself , even for having the human love and testartal summit &apos;s tals to show you continuously introduced .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I &apos;ve been talking about some of these things about the human genome , what can mean and the discovery of new genes .
We &apos;re now starting a new path : we started digitize biology and now starting from that digital code , we &apos;re going in a new phase of biology , we &apos;re going to go into a new phase of biology , we &apos;re going to start with biology and synthesize .
We &apos;ve always tried to ask big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists , I think they &apos;ve been trying to figure out out in various levels .
We tried different approaches , reducing it to the minimum .
We &apos;re digitize for almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the analogtic world of biology in the digital world .
Now , we ask , : can we regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome between those that can authoreplicate in the laboratory .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit more small .
We can actually get a hundred genes of the about 500 that are here .
But when we take a look at his metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our .
You think , that &apos;s simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can get out , one at the time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this can bring to a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to move to be to synthesize this chromosome so we could change the components to take some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of &quot; Can we synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Can you have the chemical consensus to produce these big molecules that we never ever ever ever ever ever do this before ?
And in case , we can do a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemical material inherent .
The speed with which we are able to digitize life is growing up exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , design , rather slowly , but it &apos;s improving .
And our most recent results the results are exponential curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process required a lot of steps , starting with a bioethics before we started the first experiments .
But we found that synthesize DNA is very hard .
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that produces small segment of DNA , and 30 to 50 letters , and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the more mistakes there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these fragments and correct the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , starting by digital information from the genome of Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a little viruses that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , we designed the fragments , and we got a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material inherent and we put it into the bacteria , and they have started reading this genetic code and to make viral particles .
The viral particles have been released by cells , they come back and they have the Ecoli .
I &apos;ve been talking about recently with the members of the oil industry , and they were certainly understood this model .
They have been snap more than you .
We believe that &apos;s a situation where the software can actually build his own hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in big .
We wanted to build the whole chromosome of the bacteria .
They are more than 580 thousand genetic code .
So we thought we &apos;re going to be built it into the cables of viruses , so that we can change cassette to understand what the components are the living components of a living cell .
The design is critical , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the first time , was a mistake for every 10 midden .
We found out , resequenced it , 30 errors . If we had to use that original sequence we &apos;d never be able to do it .
A part of the process is to design segments for a long -to-overwhelmed with all the other segment of 50 letters to build smaller underounthirds to build smaller underounces that work together .
We &apos;re going to take unic elements together here .
You &apos;ve probably read that we put in the line .
Think it like this : we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters , put together about about 20 amminds , and there &apos;s a specific order of letters , for every amateurs .
So we can use the genetic code to write , frasks , thoughts .
What we did at the beginning was self-roughly .
Some have been delused by the fact that it wasn &apos;t .
We designed these segments to be able to just join them with enzymes .
There are me related them and they put them together .
And we started assembling about the parts , starting with the five to seven thousand letter , and unendles so to form segments that are so that we can form segment to them , and they get to 72 mila letters to them .
At every step we &apos;ve made these segments in abundance so that we could sequencing them because we &apos;re trying to create a very good procedure -- you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems like the tabeting of a baskon the baskon .
When we get these very long segments , more than 100 thousand basis , more than 100 thousand basis , it won &apos;t grow directly in the Ecles .
You get to the modern molecular biology .
So we looked at other mechanisms .
We knew another mechanism called the homological reverse , which in biology used to repair the DNA to repain DNA to unting to repain the DNA to unire the DNA .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism called Deinoccurs , can absorbed three million radiation of radiation .
You can see in the high romosome is destroy .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s just as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms are completely dry completely .
They can live under vacuum .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life exist in space , and you can find new environments of water .
In fact , NASA showed that this is happening .
This is a molecule picture that we built using these processes , just using the lieven-sample design .
The lieventually assemble them .
This is not taken with an electronic microscope , but with a regular microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It &apos;s a so big molecule that we can see it with a little red microscope .
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the publisher that we did a little time ago .
They &apos;re more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the greatest molecule of a defined structure that ever created by man .
It has a high molecular weight .
If we &apos;re going to be a 10-caraking , 10 without spaces , we &apos;d like 142 pages to move this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ? How do we do that ?
Of course , you take a virtually a game is a boy .
It &apos;s a little more complicated when they &apos;re using bacteria .
It &apos;s also simple as even when it is eucarial cells like our : you just can just get nuclear , and put another , which is practically the process of clonation .
In the archaea bacterium , the chromosome is integrated within the cell , but we recently demonstrate that we are able to do a complete trapion of a cell trapion from one cell to another .
We clean a chromosome parent from a microbial species .
The two are different as men from rats .
We add some gene in a way that we could decide to choose to decide what to choose for this chromosome .
And then it skied with the enzymes so that they would kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was astonishing -- and you &apos;re appreciation of our so-style graph -- the new chromosome is -- the new chromosome is is gone inside the cell .
And we started thinking that we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to get there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that tantissim , they have added a second or a third chromosome somewhere , add in a second thousands of new traits to that species .
So who think about evolution as one gene only is gene at the time that you can change has no matter of biology .
There are some enzymes called restriction enzymes of restriction that even digerate DNA .
The chromosome was in the cell , you didn &apos;t have one .
The cell phone -- the chromosome that we put it up .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other chromosome as extraneum , and they had the other chromosome . And we found with only the cell and the new chromosome .
It became blue because of the genes that we put .
And in a short lassed time , all the characteristics of a species , they went lost , and it turned around the new software in a new species , based on the new software that we put the cell .
All the proteins have changed , members have changed , and when we read the genetic code exactly equivalent to what we &apos;ve moved to .
Now , this may seem like genetics , but by alchemy , but by allowing the software , we can change things in a very substantial way .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that this is not about genesis -- but of progress from three and a half million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the Cambriana explosion .
Why do you do that ?
I think it &apos;s obvious , when we think about our necessity .
We &apos;re going to go from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Just to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now , there are three people on the planet for each one existing in the 46 ; in the 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , drugs and gas and gas for six and a half billion and a half billion people .
It will be even more hard to nine for nine billion .
We use more than five billion fuel , more than 30 billion bars , more than 30 billion bars .
That means 100 million barrels a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replace them , it will be a huge challenge .
And we have to account of all the CO2 emission from these materials that ends up in the atmosphere .
In the day today , because of the scientific discoveries around the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the designed for the future .
The electronic industry has only a dozen about the dozen components , and think about how many different things are come out .
Our limits here are data in the biological reality and from our imagination .
Now we have now , because of these methods of synthesization , able to create what we call combinatory , and able to create what we call combinatory genomics .
We can build a big robot that can produce a big chromosomes a day .
Think about the 20 million different genes or try to optimize processes to produce optimize processes , and new vaccines , we can change , because of a little team , and create more molecular biology biology molecular biology now that in the last 20 years .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemical production or fuel production , or fuel vaccines .
This is an instantanetic of some software programmed that we &apos;re working on to be able to sesex and design species at the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t necessarily know how they will be .
We know exactly what they &apos;re like their genetic code .
Now , we &apos;re focusing on the fourth generation of the fourth generation .
You also see you that extract ethanol from the grain was an experiment .
We have depending on the third generation and third generation that will be used enough to be on the sugar to the sugar of the sugar , or different kinds of butanol .
But the only way biology can have a big impact without increasing the cost of food and limestone of food and limlimestone that we have to turn CO2 into the first , so we &apos;re working to design cells that can achieve this purpose , and we think we can have the first fourth of about 18 months .
War solar light combined with CO2 is a metodo--- but in our discoveries around the world , we found different metods .
This is a organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , about 2,500 feet deep deep to the Jewish temperature .
It creates metane by using molecular CO2 using molecular as energy source .
We &apos;re trying to figure out if we can incanalate CO2 , which can easily be taken through tubes , convert that CO2 in fuel , to drive this process .
So , we think we might be able to increase what the question of what the question of what life is . We have , versus -- we have the one of the most chemical goal to report the entire oil industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can you do it ?
It would be a major source source of energy .
And we &apos;re working on to use the same metods to create instantanei .
You &apos;ve seen this year with flu , we &apos;re always back of a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s about find the right vaccine .
I think that you can change , combinable vaccines in anticipe .
And this is how the future may start to look , now , the tree of evolution , accell-up , evolution with synthetic bacteria , archei , and finally cells .
We are so much like that we have to improve people .
Our purpose is to do in a way to try to make it . Thank you very much . Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the most quickly possible , some fundamental work , the new technology that we took the Microsoft , following a almost a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s a environment where you can interact with a huge amount of visual level of data .
We &apos;re seeing a lot of digital gigabyte digital photos with a kind of tuned suit and continue , for a fast quick , for a breakthroughs , we have the images like .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much much much the amount of information that we see , how big they are these collected data , or the images .
Most of them are common photographs , but this is for example , is a scans from the Congress Library of Congress , and reentrance in the gamma gapixels .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that limits the prestations of a system like this is the number of pocket on your screen in any time . It &apos;s also a very flexible architecture .
This is a whole book , not data .
This is the Dickens of Dickens . Every column represents a chapter .
To show you that it &apos;s just about textbook and not about images , we can do something like that , to really show you that it &apos;s a real representation , not of a photo .
It may be a little artificial way to read an electronic book .
I don &apos;t recommend it .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s a number of The Guardian .
Every big picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the good experience of read the real carrying version of a magazine or a daily , which is for nature a multipler type of a half .
We also did something with the corner of this , in particular , the Guardian .
We made a high-resolution advertising -- much higher than what you use in a normal publishers -- and we put in the extra extra .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate space limits of space on the screen .
And we hope that this means to put people up and other similar brings and other similar similar , not to be necessary .
Of course , maps is one of the most obviously applied to this kind of technology .
And on this , I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say that we have a contribution to give you in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States , the sovraps above a NASA geospatial image .
So now we go to something else .
This is now now living on the Web ; you can go to the Web .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadron and the other is a visual research that &apos;s very interesting computer made by Noah Snavely , a student at Steve Seitz of the Seitz and Rick Szeliski and the other is great collaboration .
And it &apos;s from the live , the Seadround , the Seadround .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from one image to the other , and have this kind of experience of experience to multiple resolution .
But the space spacecraft of images here , actually , meaningful .
The algorithms of the computer have recorded these pictures together , so that they correspond to the real places that they &apos;re imagined -- all the next to the Great Montagne Montagne &apos;s Roccious Montagne &apos;s Montagne . So you see elements of a slides , and these things are all connected to the space level .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot of the more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original even-Noah-data set from a previous prototype of the original data that we &apos;ve made work for the first time , the summer -- to show you what I think is really the key behind behind this technology , Photosynth . And that &apos;s not necessarily evidence that we &apos;ve taken in the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of Nothree-Dame Cattedrals . Baucuction . Baucucuction Nobody Dame-Flickr and you get images of types in shirts , and you get images of these arancient arancient , represents a picture that &apos;s discovery of the arancient .
So they &apos;re all images taken from Flickr and they were all connected to the space level in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to be able to ign this simppption .
You know , I &apos;d never thought to finish work for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifying to receive this kind of accounting here .
I think you can see that this is a lot of different types of phones of photocamers : from those phones of SLR , a significant number , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to try and look at the most strange .
Many blocked by faces , etc .
Somewhere you have a series of photographs -- there &apos;s a series of photographs --
This is a Nobody , a poster Nobody Dame recorded .
We can go from the verter physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking from the susuit -- from the entire collective memory of how we &apos;re going to apply the land , from visual point of view -- and connects all that data together .
All those photos become connected together , larger than the sum of the parts .
You have a model of the land that emerges .
Think about this as a prolder of Stephen Lawler &apos;s work on virtual Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as people use it , and the people use it , and the people are useful .
Their photos are marked with metaphors put other people .
If somebody is the idea of contrast , if somebody is the idea of contrast , my cattle , my photograph of Nobody . Dsuddenly have to be remarkable to get all that data , and I can use it as a picture of injected , using the photos of the other , and having a social experience of the kind of cross-modset .
Of course , one consequence of all that are virtual models of all interesting virtual models of every interesting part of the land , collected by not just vivious vivious vious , but from the collective memory .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I &apos;m going to take ? What your software will be doing is that at some point , in the next few years , all the next few years , all the time all the world will be practically connected together ?
BAA : Yes . What &apos;s doing is basically to discover .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , in images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the remarkable information that many of these images have been possible .
As you do a picture of the web , you have a sentence and the text on the Web page is a lot of information to the images .
Now , what happens if that picture is connecting all your photo ?
So , the amount of semanti-connection and the amount of wealth of wealth that comes out of it is really huge . It &apos;s a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible .
BAA : thank you very much .
One of the most most people were going to travel and one of the ethnographic research is the way of the ethnographic research is the way in the wind , the person who &apos;s in the wind , the hits the husband , the hits the households .
I think , they think , the skiest Jaguar they still travel . The Lattea , or the old Inuit &apos;s still the subjects of Inuit are still column , the budget get get to the central of the Dharm , the central importance of anthropology , and the idea that the world we live in which we have not solved sense in a sense , but it &apos;s just a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of adaptive set that our stirpful sty is our own , well , or bad , many generations ago .
And , of course , all share of essential strongst .
We all procreates . We all procreate .
We are subjects .
We have to have a death way , so we don &apos;t surround and whale --
We all have an art .
What it hits is the particular rhythm of the song , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that are the Borneo &apos;s &apos;s the forests of Borneo , or the following of the Voodoo &apos;s desert , or the desert Borneo &apos;s desert in Kenya , the Curander &apos;s Curander &apos;s Glayer .
He was the journey of my journey in the desert a month , or an yak , or an yak in the Qomolangma values , on Mast , Mast mother &apos;s dea mother of the world .
All of these populations are teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And if you think , you &apos;re a moment , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
Together , the miriades of the world are a spiritual , cultural life that flying the planet , and cultural life that flying the planet , and it &apos;s important for the wealth of the planet as bioshere .
And you can think about this cultural spider as a ethnososphere and you can define the etosphere , the total sum of all the concepts , dreams , apart , ideas , inspired , intuitions , leads to the human imagination of evolutionary awareness .
The ethnosh is the great patrimonum of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be as as inquisitive species .
And because biosphere has been very very very quickly , as it happened to the ethnic sphere and unfortunately .
No biologist , for example , would say that 50 percent of all the species has been on the orlo of the summit just because it &apos;s fake , or -- in the most apocaly -- in the most apocaly of biological diversity -- and you don &apos;t even get closer to the most optimistic -- that &apos;s cultural diversity .
The survey is all of course , the language loss .
When you &apos;re born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not compost by a vocabulary or a series of rules , or a series of grammatical rules .
One language is the spraime of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle with which the soul of every culture comes in in the world .
Every language is a forest , a kiss , a thought , a spiritual of spiritual possibilities .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re sitting here in Monterey , at least half , it &apos;s not sweet in the ears of the children .
They &apos;re not taught to children , the which means , unless , less , the less one of the dying .
What is more sad than than being in flying from being the silence , of being the last last talking about a language , you don &apos;t have to transmit the wisdom of anticipate or anticipate the children ?
This is a horrying was the one of some world in the two weeks . every two weeks . Even two weeks . And every two weeks , every two weeks , a old language .
And I know somebody who will say , &quot; Is it better ?
The world would be not a better place if we were going to talk about all the same language ? &quot; Well , then we talk about all yoruba .
Let &apos;s talk about kogi .
You &apos;re going to get a sudden what it means you can &apos;t talk to your language .
I &apos;d like to do a journey through the etnoshere --
a little journey in the ethnosh to give you a taste of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , &quot; different ways of existing , I mean , very different ways of existing .
Let &apos;s take for example , this Barasana , in the Sentrional Scivil , the people of the anaconda , which creds in the mist of the west , which creds in the west breakthroughs the west the west breakers .
It &apos;s a people who can &apos;t be able to distinguish the blue blue blue from the green because the celests because the celests is identified in the forest of the forest , which depends the people .
They have a strange language and a matrix , called the &quot; exogamia . &quot; The language &quot; : You have to marry a person who talks a different language .
And all of that has roots in the mythological past , but the particularly , in these families , the extent , where you &apos;re talking about six or seven languages because of the marriages of mystical marriages .
They &apos;re limb to listen and then they start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribes with which I &apos;ve lived , the Waorans of Ecuador , a incredible people that had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionary , they tried a very mistake .
They &apos;ve been going to go down the photographs that they would react them in the case that they would have had never seen anything .
They collected the photos , they turned it to the form or a form or a shape , or or a shape , and they &apos;re not , they have concluse that they had the diavolds .
But Waorans didn &apos;t kill just foreign the foreign .
They killed between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We were saved at eight generations , and we found two natural death , and when we went to know , they admitted that one of them was invested that one of them was invecked , and then they killed him . And then they killed him .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine for 40 steps and recognize that species .
In the early 80s , I was assigned a really interesting task for me if I wanted to go to Haiti a professor to unfolded with the secret secret society between Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes , and impossessor to do the zomos .
To make sense of a miraculous , I should have understanding Vodoo culture and the Voodoo is not magic black .
It &apos;s a pretty much of a complex metaphorrified view of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to ask me to tell you about the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christianity , Islam , Buddisme , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no faith religious faith . And they won &apos;t religious , and the Voodoo is not the distillate distilled with the unbelievable concepts of the religious concepts .
What makes interesting voodoo is the intense relationship between life and death .
So , the vivividors are .
Are the spirits can be invested by the Great Acqua , they respond to the dance and replace temporary and replace temporary the liver of the living way so that for a short active active active active active .
So , this is the white voodooists like , you know , you go to church to talk about God .
We give God , we give God . &quot;
And from the time you &apos;re sitting , is the spirit that drives you , how can you get you wrong ?
So you &apos;re seeing these incredible events : following voodoo to the trance of trance trouble touch , infueled a rather strong demonstration of the body when it &apos;s catalyzed in a state of extritation .
In all the people I have the most amazing people who I &apos;ve had the most amazing Santa Nevada de Santa Marta RReman CCCs , in the Santa Marta .
And they had to be a tyrangement that once had lived on the charge of Colombia on the charge of Colombia in the waiting for the volcanic , that people would retreat the volcanic massics that you were going to take on the vulcancers .
In a macartment continent of blood , this people have never been conquered by the spage-and-shoulder .
But I &apos;m actually government government government government , but they &apos;re their formation is very extraordinary .
The young people are following families from families to three or four years , and they live secregate in a world of dark and shadow , stone world &apos;s fearlier for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years , by the way , to reproduce the nine months of gestation that transfer into the usual mother , now in metaphor the the Laten GMother .
All of this time , they &apos;re accululated to the values of their society , values that they predict that their prayers and just their prayers and keep the cosmic balance -- or to say the ecological balance --
And as a result of this incredible initiation , they suddenly brought up and for the first time , at the age of 18 , they see an alba . And in that moment of consciousness of the first bank , when the sun kiss , when the sun comes up the beautiful values , everything that they &apos;ve learned in theory . The prever is . The pret of the pregnant , it &apos;s a step back and says :
&quot; Visto me , as I said ,
It &apos;s wonderful . Now it &apos;s now to you . &quot;
They call them a major brothers and say that we , minors , are the colpacket of the world &apos;s destruction .
This is an extremely important level .
When we think about the indigenous populations and the environment we call Rousseau and the old story of the selvary , which is a racist conceiver notions , or maybe we invoke Thoreau and we say these people are closer to the Earth .
The Indies are not feelings , no sensitive sentimental nor indebate .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the malarial paluds or in the Asmat the Tibet , but thank you for the time and rituals , but because of time and rituals , they have created a mystical idea of the Earth is not about consciously , but it &apos;s concept that the Earth can live only live because it &apos;s infused by the human awareness .
What does it mean ?
It means that a kid of Ande who &apos;s grown up believing that the mountain is a mass-one mountain is a spirit of Apu that will lead his destiny will be a very different relationship , and it will have a very different amount of remarkable to be a lot of people who are growing up creating a mountain is a mass-by-rock is a mass-by-rocks are footed .
What &apos;s the dimon-mineral or a mineral caught is irrelevant .
What &apos;s interesting is metaphor that define the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia British believing that forests was going to be cut .
And that made me a different human being different from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the Hukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukuk-initiation .
If you start to consider that these cultures can actually create different reality , you can start to understand some of them sensational discoveries . We take this plant .
I took this picture to open the nordan Amazon the nordocoronia .
Maybe some of you &apos;ve heard about the ayahuasca , the most powerful psychoactive substance of the repertoire .
What makes the hatch ayahuasely , it &apos;s not the drug of the substance , but his elaboration . It &apos;s also a two elements .
On one side , this liana legning , a bunch of beta-coal , hardly and harmoline , slightly hallucinogen , slightly hallucinogen , slightly hallucinogen , slightly hallucinogen and harmoline , slightly hallucinogen and harmoline , slightly hallucinographic , slightly hics .
And by taking the only plant , you have a smoke , which alter a little bit of consciousness , but it &apos;s mix with the leaves of a family arcafed arrangements .
This plant contains powerful powerful , very similar to the serotonin , dimethyptamine , dithyptamine .
If you ever see Yanomami , you &apos;ll get on the hide of the nose of the substance that are doing from a different set of species , it contains methylllyptamine .
Tiring that dust on the nose is a little bit like being gone from a fire card on a barrfuel cartoon and land on a sea of electricity . &#91; Risk &#93; Not a distorsion of reality .
I often got to my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who had taken the psychedelic era , with his discovery of the hallucinogens in Mexico .
And so , Second my thesis , you can &apos;t get these tripptamines as as hallucinogens because if you &apos;re made , you can &apos;t tell anybody to be hallucinated . But they can &apos;t be abunt because they &apos;re in a enzyme , which is , of course , , monoonamine mons , which is the oxygen , called monoonna ,
It &apos;s as possible to the horse just absensus if they above with other chemicals that they deny MAO .
Now , it &apos;s the nice , the fuel , the fuel inhibitcher of MAO , the same kind of necessary to be able to potentially have triptamines . The question is source of plants , like these people find two deflian defologizically not similar , but that if you combine in this way , create a biochemical version that is the exter-sum in the sum of the parts ?
We use the great European female of evidence and mistake , which can be infruted .
But if we ask Indians , they will tell us , &quot; The plants talk about . &quot;
What does it mean ?
This tribes , Cofan , has 17 varieties of ayahuasca , which distinguished nicely in the forest , and that at our eyes would come into the same species .
If we ask them how they &apos;re going to be able to tell us , &quot; I thought , &quot; I thought , &quot; I thought , &quot; Do I think you don &apos;t know ? &quot; I said , &quot; No .
The solution is : you take 17 varieties in a finner night , and each other will be a different tone .
With this is not graduate at Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than to count the stami .
Now , &#91; Now , &#93; , the problem is that even the ones of us that have to the heart people who have in the heart people have painted but somehow reduced to the margins of history in our real world , and it &apos;s passed beyond .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it will not remind for his wars or or technological innovations , but rather like the one was where we stopped and , and we abbracked , or accepted , passively accepted , unbracked , cultural diversity of cultural diversity and cultural planet .
All the smallpoorers have been involved in a dance for new possibilities .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Six has no stop being Sioux when they put on the arm and freceived as Americans have no stop being American when they put on the horse and calculations .
It &apos;s not change or technology that threatening the integrity of ethnoshere . It &apos;s the power .
The hard hard to dominate .
And if you give a look at the world , you find that these are not destined to disappear .
They &apos;re living creatures and dynamics extreme emergence out of identifabeted forced the capacity of adaptation .
What &apos;s a disboscampaign in the Penan --
a nomad of Sarawak , in the Southeast East , a people who who lived in the forest , and now reduced to a generation , and now reduced to the servitems and the ridated prostitution on the rights of the lim that seems to take a half of the lim that seems to take Boro .
It &apos;s ready to fill the wooden soth with the forest .
Or in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that have come with the discovery of the golden .
If we marry on the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the hard dough of the political domination .
As you know the genocide , the extinction of a people , is convicted to the universal level , but the ethnocium , the style of a people , not only is not just convicted , but I also also also also celebrate in certain parts of the development strategy .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of Tibet until you go from the beginning .
I &apos;ve been path 6,000 miles from Chengdu in the Western China through the Western Tibet , coming in Lhasa with a young connection , but only came to Lhasa young person , but only came to Lhasa .
6,000 sacred worlds sacred reduced in powder and feels .
1.2 million people killed by the military Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical at Panchen Lama .
The Chinese means that it was killed to the Chinese invasion .
His uncle , in Sainity , in Sainity , in the diaspora that led led to Nepal .
His mother was imprisoned and her blame was rich .
It was taken up to a naked hidden at the age of two hidden under his gonna because he could have no live without him .
The sister , who did the same , has been put in reeducated field .
A day , he was inwarm a hot cheap a rupt , Mao and , for this transgression , has been put to the forced forced to seven years .
The pain of Tibet can be insopportable , but the spirit of the people is from tener tener .
And then , it turns out to a choice .
We want to live in the world &apos;s monoccurs or we want to account the policy world of diversity ?
The great anthropologist at Margaret Mead , before we die said that his greatest fear was that , in our greatest fear was that , we will not just see the whole gamma of human imagination , we will be a limited modality of thinking , but one day we will be looking at a forgotten en en en en en en en en en en minds to the other other people .
And it &apos;s humiliating that we have been on for 600,000 years .
The Neolitica Revolution , which has given us agriculture , which has made us to socks to take the suit of the seizure , by replacing the poetry of specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has to be 300 years .
That shared story , not suggests me , not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges we &apos;re going to have to deal with in the millennia .
When you have these mirihs of the world is asked what they want to say to be human , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all refer to the chance of being what we are : a conscious species , which is to make all the people and the gardens can train . And there are big moments of optimism .
I took this picture on the northern end of Baffin the island of Baffin , when I went to the dag with the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , and the Olaya , and she told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The Canadese government has not always been gentile with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to stabilize our supremix , we have to give them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refused to go there .
Hense , tempt for his life , he took them all the weapons , and all of his actual acts .
You have to know that the Inuit &apos;s not freeze , they do it .
The pieces of the sliters were made of fish fish flying in the skin .
The grandfather of this man didn &apos;t intimix to the arctic or the blightica , or the byplightica ,
It &apos;s been standing up , they hot the panthot in focused in the skin and defeclied in your hand . When I did frozen them , they &apos;ve been frozen , and they work with a lama .
He sprousehold on the downtown , and when I became solid , and when I sold solid , she killed a dog .
He shake the dog and created a shoulder , with the toracy clothed , has imbrired another dog , and it &apos;s uncomfortable .
We want to talk about horsane with anything ? &#91; Risk &#93; And this , in different ways , &#91; Applausers &#93; is the symbol of the Inuit and all the Indium people in the world .
In the aprile 1999 , the Chanads government reduced to the Inuit &apos;s total control area of the greater land of California and Texas .
It &apos;s their new patha . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s an independent land . They &apos;re all mineral resources .
A beautiful example of how a natione-state can re-conciliate with his people .
And , to finish , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious at least at least , who &apos;s been in these remote zones of the planet , to realize they &apos;re not remote .
And somebody is home .
They represent sections of human imagination that they go back to the time . And for us all , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our children , they become part of the geography .
And we &apos;re going to end , we of National Geographic , we are convinced that politicians will never come to anything .
We believe that polements --
&#91; Applausers &#93; are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and perhaps we are the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month , 35 million visits .
156 countries transmitted our television .
Our magazines are lected by millions of people .
Our work is traveling into the ethnososphere for bracing our public places in the places of cultural wonderful and what they &apos;re going to go away from how they have , and hopefully for , abbracing for time , for the central reveals of the central diversity , and we have to find a life in a world &apos;s pluralist and multicultural life in a world , and we have to find a life in a world of life in a world &apos;s pluralist and mundent and and multicular and multural and multural and multicular a life
where all people can help our collective wisdom can help to our collective wisdom .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things I wrote about some things I wrote about this book that I hope you &apos;ve heard and try to highlight some connects , in the case you don &apos;t notice .
I &apos;d like to start with what I call &quot; the official dogma .
The dogma official , what ?
The dogma official official society . The dogma official society . The dogma official , &quot; If we want to maximmize the well-being of our citizens . &quot;
The reason is , on one side , in fact that freedom is itself a value , is precious , useful , and useful for humans .
On the other hand is in fact that if we are free , each of us can actually act to do everything that massimize our well-being , no one that decided to be a name .
The way to massimize freedom is massized choice .
The more choices choices , the more people are free , and the greater is their well-being .
This is , I think , it &apos;s so deeply roadicted in society that nobody would have a doubt .
And it &apos;s also very very radicated in our lives .
And I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m going to allow me a simple note about the conditions for the windows .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without contacts 10 varieties of oil oil , and 12 of the extreme oil , and the 12 of the balloon whales you can buy to make a huge number of conditions in the circumstances that one of the 175 degree of your degree .
Here &apos;s what the supermarket .
Then you go to the electric store to buy a stereo : cast , CD letter , radio , flificer , light .
And in this single electronic store , there &apos;s a great number of audio components .
We can make six million of different combinations using the components that there are in a only store .
You have to put it that there &apos;s a lot of choice .
Other fields : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all the telephone services , at the shine that they were supposed to be supposed to be mammed .
He was nolegant the phone , you didn &apos;t buy it .
One of the consequence of that , in the other , was that the phone never turned .
These days , they went .
Now we have a almost illimited variety of phones , especially between cell phones .
Here &apos;s cell phones .
My favorite is , in the middle , MP3 , cutting the nose of the nose , and forth to the chromantic crone .
If you haven &apos;t seen that , you haven &apos;t seen in the house under the house , you &apos;re very much certain that will come .
And what happens is , what happens is that people go into the stores and ask this question . And what &apos;s the answer ? The answer is &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t make too much much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the acquissues , you know the same explosion of choices .
Assistence : It doesn &apos;t happen to the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor and the doctor , and the doctor , what you have to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do A , or B , and you can do A , or &quot; A has these benefits and these risks . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Dr. , what would I have to do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A has these benefits , and the laughed , and B has these benefits , and the risks . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebatch , &quot; Dr. if you were , what would do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result we call it &quot; self-assured , expression that makes it look like a good thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not to move the weight and responsibility for making making decisions from someone knows something , which is the doctor , to someone else that knows something , and almost certainly is sick -- and so it &apos;s not in the ideal condition , and so it doesn &apos;t have any ide-of-making decisions that there &apos;s no one patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing of products of drugs , direct to people like me and you , who think about it &apos;s not any sense , because we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we don &apos;t buy them , why are there ?
The answer is that , we call the doctor to ask them to ask them to change the recipe .
Something that is , as our horribly , is a matter of choice , as you see in this vignity . &quot; We don &apos;t want to forget kids . SSceeeign &apos;t want to be a moment . We don &apos;t want to get the right moment . We have to invent it .
And we can reinventing how many times you get to get up .
which means that every morning , at the riskly , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
I &apos;m going to the family and the marriage , a common time , the most contact of the perspective , almost for anybody , was that we married the most early possible possible , and you start to have the most early time .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not even what to do after .
So , all of the day , everything is really to play .
I teach very smart students , and I &apos;m going to be 20 percent in less of work than a time .
And not because they &apos;re not very brilliant , not because they &apos;re not so much less diligent .
but why are they impossessed , &quot; I should be asking , &quot; Should I be going to marry or not ? Should I now ? &quot;
&quot; Should I get married later ? I think before children or the career ? &quot;
They are logorant interrogative .
And they &apos;re trying to respond these questions , even if this implica not complete the homework that I teach and not get a nice voice to my exam .
And they really have to do that . They &apos;re important questions .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , as Carl underwater , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , by every day , by every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , every day , from every day , from every day , by every day , by every day ,
Listen , there &apos;s a corner , and I won &apos;t say to anybody which , where the WiFi Fi works .
I don &apos;t say , because I want to use me .
What does this mean , this incredible freedom of choice that we have to continually decision , continually at every time , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing hot , with your mobile phone in a pocket , Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , and the notebs ,
And even if they &apos;re all spending , every minute that we see our child rovared , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; Do we &apos;re asking , &quot; I have to answer this ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? Do I have to email this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , you know , all this makes the experience of your child very different than what &apos;s been in other conditions .
So , any of the look at all , things , small and big things and things and lifestyle , life is a matter of choices .
Once the world was this : White , there was some possibilities , but it wasn &apos;t a matter of choice .
The world of today is like this : The dilemma is , &quot; Is it a good thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is . It &apos;s a lot of it .
So the positive layers , we all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative .
All this is a choice , two negative effects of people .
The first paradoxally , is that produced paralysis that that makes paralysis .
With a lot of options between which chooses , it becomes very hard to do it .
I give you a significance example : a significance study of volunteer .
A connected , my colleagues at the data of the Vanguard data , the gigantic company , with about a million of pension , with about a million clients in 2000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offering in the more , the percentage of adhesian scenes of two percent .
With 50 sourds , there &apos;s 10 percent in less than in adhesions in the least of them , because they &apos;re only five . Why are they only five . Why ?
Because with 50 sources of which choosing , is hardly hard to decide , and the choice is replaced to the indomans .
And tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course ,
You know , it &apos;s not just to these old guys will eat food for dogs because they &apos;re going to have enough money , they also want to say that decision is so hosttic , they also lose the datories of the datory .
Not participating , they &apos;re losing up to five dollars a year from the work dator dator , which would be well be .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too much choices .
And I think that makes the world .
&quot; And to end , for the ethernity : ketchup , maionese mustarionese ? &quot;
Would you like to make the right decision , if it &apos;s for ethernity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to pick the wrong wrong , and yet yet the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can avoid paralysis and to do a choice , we &apos;re just satisfacts from the outcome , as we would have been with less options .
And that &apos;s about it .
One of these is that with many conditions between which you choose , if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you would have to do a different choice . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us will be better . And what &apos;s going on is that the alternative . And the reverse revenue revenue reverted by the decision ,
even when it was a good decision .
The more choices there are , the easier is to displeasure anything detail is unsatisfaction of option .
And also , there is what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert clariit very well as a value that we give things depends on what we &apos;re going to do is .
And the rest , when there are a lot of possible options , it &apos;s easy to represent the actual characteristics of the option that you have to have a choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m sorry with everybody who &apos;s not in New York .
But that &apos;s what you probably think .
There &apos;s this couple of the Hamptons .
A lever .
Splendida . Otma day . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not missing . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , eventually , it &apos;s August . &quot;
&quot; Everybody &apos;s my neighbors in Manhattan are away . &quot;
&quot; I could park right in front of the house . &quot;
And it goes to two weeks absilce from the idea that &apos;s losing -- every day -- the ability to parking where it wants .
The costo-opportunity , unfation decrease the sodness for what we have , even when the choice was excellent .
And the more are the options that we have to consider , the most attractive characteristics are going to be going to be cos-opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a vignity tells us a lot .
It &apos;s about the time , and maybe of living in the time .
But the most important point is that anything you take , you choose to not do the other .
The things we don &apos;t pick up to attract that they can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : the growing spiral of the expectations .
I tried it to my skin bought a new jeans .
I &apos;m almost always jeans .
Once jeans were just one , they bought and vestivate , they were uncomcomfortable , just after they took them a life and they were all all all the time , they started going to go well .
So I went to buy a couple new time when the old people were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
The committed me , &quot; You want to slim fit , relaxed fit ? &quot;
You want to do with the cernial or with the buttons ? &quot; Stonewashed or &quot; acidst &quot;
&quot; Do you want to get it ? &quot;
&quot; You know , they want to be a strange , or a bunch , &quot; Continupright .
I was sallowed , and after a little bit I could say , &quot; I want the guy , which was the only guy , &quot; I &apos;d been the only guy , &quot; I had no idea what it was , so for a time , I went out to the jeans , and then I went out the best jeans I had ever ever .
It was the most of the choice . And all that I had the best choice .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse is that with all of my own expectations were altissue , the jeans had to be perfect .
I had a minimum expectations . I didn &apos;t expect anything that was just a kind of , but when I saw 100 different , but when I saw 100 different , steams , at least a kind of be perfect .
What I got was good , but not perfect .
And after I was compared to the chosen with what I was ununsatisfied in the expectations .
The addition of options in people &apos;s life not to increase the expectations that have respect to excellence of the options themselves .
And this will produce less satisfation , even when the results are good .
No one in the world of marketing , they realize .
Because if they knew , you &apos;d not know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more to this .
&quot; He was better when you was worse , &quot; The reason he was better when you was worse is that when you was worse was even able to meet the pleasant pleasant pleasant .
In the world we live in the world where we live in , unexpectancy citizens with the expectancy -- the most of the expectations -- the most we can hope is that things are at the height .
You never had pleasant pleasant because your expectations , my expectations , they &apos;ve ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Baxis , &quot; Yes , you want to . &quot;
I mean -- I &apos;m just a little authographic moment -- which I &apos;m really married and my wife is really amazing .
I didn &apos;t have to do better , I didn &apos;t contented me .
But it &apos;s not always a bad thing .
And finally , one consequence of buy a couple of jeans , when there &apos;s just that you have that when you &apos;re not satisfied , and you ask , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot;
The world is the responsible . What would I do ?
When you have hundreds of kinds of jeans , and buy one insodisfacing , and you ask who is the responsible , it &apos;s just just clear that responsible for it , it &apos;s just right .
You could have done better .
With hundreds of varieties , there are no excuse for the insuccessful .
So when people make decisions , even if the outcome is valid , they feel unsatisfixed and give the cold .
In the last depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this honest honest honest depression is just that people have deludent experiences because standards are too .
And when they have to explain this situation , they think the breaker is they are .
So the final outcome is that we &apos;re better better , but we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely fake .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit of choice , but from this didn &apos;t have any any any of it , but from this wouldn &apos;t be a lot of choice .
There &apos;s a magical value , magical value . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure I &apos;ve been overcome from a piece of the level where the choices improvement of our life .
Now , from the political point of view -- I &apos;ve got almost finished -- from the political point of view , the peanch is the following .
What it allows all this in industrial society is wealth .
There are a lot of places in the world , and you know about that , where the problem is not too much choice .
The problem is that they have too bad .
So , the faccenda that I &apos;m talking about is a bad evil of modern , rich society .
And what it does depress and angry and is this : Steve Levitt spoke about how the expensive those expensive and comfortable seats are useful . It &apos;s a spouting money .
I mean , these choices , complicated and dispendious , is not they &apos;re just useful .
They are deleterie .
They &apos;re doing worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows choice to be poured in those where people have too few people have too few , it wouldn &apos;t be just their life to improve but also .
This is what economists call parthetetic improvement .
A redistribution of income redistribution of the income redistribution of this , excess that it lie us .
So , to the end , you can become everything you want ,
You know , people of culture , you &apos;ll think , &quot; What does that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t get anything in a glass . &quot;
&quot; A castrade imagination , a limited view of the world --
and I &apos;m going to be interpreted .
But then , I realized , instead , I realized that that that the fish knows the long fishshshshoot .
Because the reality is that if you &apos;re missing in the boccia , so that you can &apos;t have freedom . You don &apos;t get freedom . You get freedom . You get freedom .
If you break the mouth so that everything you can diminds to decrease the satisfation .
You &apos;re holding the paralysis , and you reduce the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too strange , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of a symbolic sphere is a recipe for injury and , I &apos;m going to the round .
Thank you very much .
