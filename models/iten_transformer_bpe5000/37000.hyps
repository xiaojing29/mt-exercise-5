Last year showed these slides slides to demonstrate that the arctic calculus , which for almost three million years had the size of the 48 United States , the size of 48 , the United States , it &apos;s required over 40 percent .
But that underwater gravity of the problem because it &apos;s not about the ice of the ice of the ice .
The arctic ice ice is , in a way , the glacial heart of global climate system .
It &apos;s got winter and you reverse required .
The next slide is going to be a carrying revenue rapid about the last 25 years .
The glaces are signed in red .
As you see , they &apos;re going to go to the blue blue .
That &apos;s the ice ice in the winter , that &apos;s required of summer .
You can see that the so-called ice so-called ice , or more , is like a blood blood , which is like blood , which here I was in the body .
In 25 years , it went from that , to that .
This is a problem because the interests that are glacied the land around the arctic ocean where there are huge amount of fuel coal , which is sounding , slum into the arction .
I &apos;m going to the total-warming pollution , that amount could damage , that amount could doubling , through this point of not return .
In some deep lakes in Alaska metan , the metane is already already bolling out of the water .
The professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska University of Alaska team at the bottom .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You &apos;re good . The question is if we &apos;re too .
One reason is this is that this thermal exchange in the Greenland from north .
This is a river regime ice .
And the ported had never reached like that .
This is the Kangerfish river , in the southeast of the Greenland in the Greenland of the Greenland .
If you want to know how the sea level for the shouts of the glaciers on land , it &apos;s where the sea .
These currents are growing up rapidly .
On the other side of the planet : Antarctica , the greatest block of the planet .
Last month , scientists have declared that the ice balance of ice is in negative , and that the Western artide , which pogy on some submarines , is particularly heat the end .
It &apos;s six feet at the level of the water , like Greenland .
Sulil Himalaya , the third largest block of ice , you see new lakes , that few years ago were glacied .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population received half of the world &apos;s wild water from that smooth .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the water of this city .
The ported it up .
But when it decreates , the same happens to the same water .
In California , snow on the Snow has got 40 percent of it &apos;s decrediminished .
The hyriries are in crisis .
Spreviously , as you read , they &apos;re grave .
The safety growing up in the world door to a remarkable increasing inceness .
The environmental disaster , the environmental disaster , and unprecedented .
Four times more of the last 30 years I was about 775 years old .
This is a unsustainable and all of the unsustainable .
If you look in the historical context , you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day .
Look at the point of the East Pacific , from Americas , to the Americas , to the West and both parts of the Indian subcontinent , where there is a radical scoveral impoverment in the ocean .
The greater causes of global warming , together to deforestation , which is the use of fossil fuel fuel .
Oil is a problem , and coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two of the most emissions , together to China .
And he came up with a lot of other coal central .
But we &apos;re seeing a change of a change of direction .
These are the announced projects in the last years and some of the vers of the vers .
Anyway , there &apos;s a political struggle in our country .
The coal and oil industrial , they &apos;ve spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the pulit coal , which is a bone .
I had a picture of me --
Verice in the Christessee , in the Tennessee , where I saw , there was a pouring of fuel four-billion litri litri fting flow .
You may have seen it on the news .
This is the second largest flows in America .
It &apos;s happened around Christmas .
The Chrise of one of the coal industrial industrial .
Video : His the carbon is a kind of allegro and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and we grow our economy .
Frosch the carbon has always been flier .
It &apos;s good , adorable and workers keep working on the wild .
Al Gore : From here is a big part of the West Virginia .
The greatest miner-mountains is Massey Coal . This is the CEEO . This is the CEEEO .
Video : Don Blankenship : I &apos;m going to be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosy , Harry Reid -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking .
Al Gore : So the Allime for the Clima &apos;s Protection launched two campaign .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : So , the next thing about the climate change as a business .
So , for our priorities is to invest a lot of money in a publishing effort to make public revenue and confused the coal truth .
Actually , coal is not sporch .
We think it &apos;s clean -- it &apos;s also a good profumber .
So you don &apos;t pretend of climate change .
Let me go .
Video : Attore : Carbon -- you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
So let &apos;s take a turn into a rolling structure for how pulit coal coal coal .
Straordinarily ! I &apos;m a little noise , but this is the sound of the pulit fuel technology .
The coal consumption is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology that you see changes everything .
Take a look , this is the clean odien technology .
Al Gore : So the positive alternative is connected to economic and the national security .
Video : America is in crisis , the economy , national security , climate crisis .
The wilo that connects them all : our dependence from fossil fuel fuel , like coal and oil .
Now , there &apos;s a new , auduty solution to get around it .
Repower : 100 percent clean energy in , in a decade .
A plan to get America to work , make us more secure , and help stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that I had to solve our problems .
Repower America .
Al Gore : This is the last one .
Video : It &apos;s about re-energy to America .
One of the faster ways of getting getting to dependence from fuel , that killing our planet .
Comparsa : The future is here . Sun , a new energy network .
Comparsa : New aging aging for jobs .
Complease , Repower . It &apos;s time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old African African says , &quot; If you want to go fast , go to all , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
If you want to go away , go together . &quot;
We have to go far quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I made a LHC .
And you promise to return to the way to get back to how the machine works .
So I am here . And for those that the other time , the LHC is the greatest scientific experiment ever tried -- 27 kilometers of circumfirm .
His task is to reate the conditions that were less than a billionaire of a billion-second second .
All of this is just ambitious .
This is the machine under Ginevra .
We photographing these mini-Big Bang in the results .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- it &apos;s larger 44 meters and it has a 222 feet .
This is an ATLAS , in construction so you can see the proportions .
The 10 September last year we &apos;ve got on the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was caused to be employed in the control room .
It &apos;s a picture of particles that had done all the LHC , and getting into collision , deliberately , with a part of LHC , and spread particles inside the resulator .
In other words , when we saw that image the 10 Ocean , we know that the machine worked , which is a great vinity .
I don &apos;t know if this was this to take us more or this , when someone went on Google and saw that the beginning page was this .
That means we had a cultural impact beyond that scientific impact .
About a week after , there was a problem with the car , just to these files here -- these dories .
These files took 13,000 ampampampampbs when the machine works at the most of the power .
Now , technicians between you will look at the files and they will say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . They &apos;re too throws . &quot;
And they can do it because when they &apos;re very cold become the so-called files .
So , at least 271 degrees , at a lower temperature of the space between the stars , these files can bring that current .
In one of the giounts between the most magnetic magneets in the LHC , there was a defect of factoration .
So the walls surrise slightly , and the 13,000 ampampto suddenly met a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think these magneets are weight over 20 tons , and they moved around about 30 centimeters .
They were flights about 50 magnees .
We had to take them , what we did .
We have them rests and upon it and wandering .
They &apos;re now coming back all the underground .
I finally got the march in the end of the LHC is going back to be integrated .
We &apos;re going to accept what we &apos;re going to get data or jeck , or July , and we keep our adventure to find out what the morning that &apos;s the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these crashing crashing the value of science and science and the frontier engineering of science and frontier . It &apos;s easy to confuted .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s the value of things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of an Inglese scientist , Humphhrey Davy , who , I guess , in defense the experiments of his clean , his pupillo was Michael Faday , said , &quot; No , it &apos;s a lot of dangous , to the progress of human mind as the mind as the ideas of science as the definitely , it &apos;s not mystyle mysties in nature , and that &apos;s complete new of conquises .
Thank you .
I want to start asking you about rethinking about when you , you play with children , you play with the morning .
While you know , how to reach and you get them and and get them , and you know , you know , you know , you know , and to solve problems and manipulating space relations .
The space argument is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , by the usual inspired by the usual of our interaction with physical objects , together to my Pact , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , and I started asking wondering , &quot; And if , when we use a computer , instead of having a computer , instead of having the only mouse of the mouse like digital polytrel that digital polytrel that &apos;s moving on a desktop , we could have to defer with both hands ,
and fix it ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big interactive computer like a bik-like biscope .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big interactive computer like a bik-like biscope .
You can see them , you can see them , &quot; they can see &quot; see &quot; and they have a wireless radio .
But above all , they &apos;re physical objects , like the morning , you can just move out of grabbed .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physicists , conwardness of the movement , other , and as they become more physics , of the movement , of the movement , of the movement , of the other , how we can explore and fun style of interaction .
I &apos;m going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is to show video : if you cline it in a direction , if you &apos;ll cline on a direction , it will rotate on the other hand goes back .
These are confident of other people .
If I rely them , you know what they &apos;re around .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can be a little bit .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can be a little bit .
They also had their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications was the way to use was to use communities on data , to call a &quot; pouring &quot; on a liquid . &quot;
In this case , we have three Siftable configured like a real frame of painting , and I can use them to the central color in that way .
and I can use them to go into the color in that central , where you get .
If we go too much , we can get a little bit of it .
There are also beautiful possibilities of learning , like languages , the math and the mathematand logic games where people can try and make things quickly , and see the results results .
Now I &apos;m --
This is a Fibonacci that I do with a equations program .
Here we have a words of words that it &apos;s in the middle and Boggle .
Basically , to every Siftable , you had a letter in any Siftable , to every Siftable , to every Turn out of any Siftable , and you &apos;re looking for words , I &apos;m looking for words , I &apos;m looking for words , control it a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new set of letters and new set set of letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the children came up to the Media Lab , I did , I &apos;ve made it so that I went and turned them out and I turned them to a video .
They were very much pleased .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
You just say , &quot; Species of words , &quot; and they know what to do .
Here &apos;s other people trying to .
This is our beta younger tester , there on the right .
It actually wanted to be stunk .
They were only only in the morning for him .
Now , this is an interactive application of a interactive cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of the languages . He &apos;s Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , lifting the Siftable them associated .
It can put new characters in the scene , lifting the Siftable them associated .
So , it &apos;s going to get out the sun .
Video : The sun is surprising .
David Merrill Merrill now a treor the scene .
Video : The arange treatment .
Bel work ! Yeah !
So shake the Siftable and put in neighbors can make the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing his story .
Video : Hello .
DM : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide him like .
DM : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide him like .
Video : See , cat it .
DM : The last example I &apos;ve got time to show you is a tool , to sample and performing music .
It &apos;s a tool , made of recently , to sample and performing music .
The Siftable here are sounds here are sounds like low and the battery .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose to use .
You can also put these sound in a sequence to compose your pleasure .
And just modify it just by making a sound and a sequence .
These are actually you can control from alive , like the reverberation and the filter .
And you have the attacks to a particular sound and then cline for the begging .
And then there are general effects as time and volume , that you apply to the whole sequence .
Let &apos;s look at how it works .
Video : We &apos;re going to start a very much in two Sifounded sequence , we take them into a series , we go into a series , we extend , and we add another base .
I &apos;m going to put a line .
Video : Now I added percussions --
Video : And now I &apos;m going to put the battery on the battery , so I can control the vise of the vive .
Video : I can pop up the whole sequence of the whole sequence to the whole sequence of time , or the other .
Video : I &apos;m going to add the bottom to the bottom to the bottom to give more expression .
Video : I can re-in-in-in-flflying .
So I don &apos;t have to plan this first , but I can suddenly make it longer , or more corta .
And now , finally , I can smoking the whole sequence of the left Siftable , the Sciver &quot; volume . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new human human human interfaces that we &apos;re still more more like how they work our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to move is to is that it &apos;s coming this new generation of the design of things to interact with digital media , that will bring information in our world .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time to talk to all of you .
I &apos;m a writer .
Speer books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than this , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the fascinating of my life .
And I don &apos;t look like to change .
But , I said , something specifically has happened in my life and my career , who brought me to reach the whole relationship with this job .
The particular thing is I recently wrote this book , this is this book , this biography called &quot; Mangia , Prega , &quot; which , &quot; where , &quot; Perhaps , &quot; where , &quot; I became a great , feeling , wild , interational bestseller .
And the result is that everywhere you go now , people treat me treated as if I was convicted .
Really -- conducted , conducted !
They &apos;re all come from me now and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t fear you couldn &apos;t make it better than than that ?
You don &apos;t fear to go out and write all life without being able to create a book that can matter of someone &apos;s a book that can you care about someone ? &quot;
that can matter someone ? &quot;
It &apos;s rassuring , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent -- I was a rhythththier .
I would go to the same reaction based on the fear .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you feel like to have successful ?
Do you fear that the ulililization is killed you ?
You don &apos;t have fear to make this mill for life without nothing ever ever coming out and to die on a cumb of dreams with the mouth wholing with the mouth whom of failing ? &quot;
Therefore , you know .
The short answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yeah , I fear of all those things .
I &apos;ve always had fear .
And I also have fear of many other things that people can &apos;t ininate .
like the algae and other things very frightening .
But , as I was writing what I thought and I was wondering , why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logical that anyone should expect to be frightened by a job that you feel born to do .
But what there is so particular in the creative companies to make us nervous about mental health as eleval health in a way that other carriers don &apos;t do ?
How my father , was a chemical engineer , and I don &apos;t remember one once in his 40 years of activities in his 40 years of activities that he was asked if he was an engineer ?
There was never -- that block of the engineer John , how do you go ?
Not working like that , you know ?
Onestly , chemicals as a group don &apos;t have certainly , in centuries , earn the reputation of being alized .
We have enough this reputation , we have enough this reputation , and not just creative writers but creative , we have this reputation of instables .
And it &apos;s not about anything that you look at the sad , and the deaths of the creative magnifies that , only in the 20th century , died young and often by their own .
And even those who are not suicidated as they &apos;re really suicked by their dones .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , &quot; Each , my book has killed me a little bit more &quot; A great deal statement about his life .
But we don &apos;t throw it when we feel saying , because we &apos;ve heard these things so long that somehow , we have completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and the suffering are somehow related and the suffering are somehow tied and the suffering are in some way related to the corner .
And the question I want to ask everybody here today is : Do you agree with this idea ?
You &apos;re fine this thing -- because it &apos;s also looking at a centimeter to me , you know , it &apos;s not good for this supposing .
I think it &apos;s hated .
And I think it &apos;s a dangerous , and I don &apos;t want to see it in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our great creative minds to live .
And certainly I know that , in my case -- in my situation -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start fuel to that felt dark for , whom I &apos;m in my career .
That &apos;s true -- I &apos;m quite young , I &apos;m quite young , I was about 40 years old .
I still have about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely to write about what I &apos;m going to write about the world , how the work that came out after the world as the work that came out of my last book .
I &apos;m going to be slaughter , because we &apos;re all more or less friends here -- it &apos;s likely to be in my back .
Oh , Gesu , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that &apos;s a person to start drink in the nine morning , and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would keep doing this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it seems to me , after a lot of reflect , that the way to work to continue writing is to create a protective psychological construct , OK ?
I have to find a distance of security between me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural natural anxiety about what I wrote to get . And as I was trying to get to look through time , trying to find other societies , and trying to find other societies could have better ideas and more healthy ideas and more and more and sane ideas to see if they could have better ideas and more sweep , I &apos;m writing about the other people &apos;s most most and more and so much for it all over
how to help people manage to manage the emotional risks of creativity .
And that research has brought me to the ancient Great and ancient Rome .
I &apos;m just just going to go back and then it comes back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
They were thinking that creativity was this spirit looks divine and that it came to men from some kind of different distant and unknown , for distant reasons and unknown .
The raw of these divini divines of creativity .
Socrate , wonderful , unbelieved that they had to have a very far from distdisturbing .
Romans were the same idea , but they called that kind of spirit without body a genius .
Which is great , because the Romans didn &apos;t really think that a genius were someone was particularly smart .
They believed that a genius were this kind of weather , literally lived in the walls of the study of a artist , a little bit like the elevening of being , and to get out of the work of the art and to model the outcome of that work and to model the result of that work .
Here &apos;s Emal -- that &apos;s the distance of which I talk -- that &apos;s that recurring psychological that proteges you from your work .
And everybody knew it was so that it worked , right ?
So , antic artists were protected by certain things , like the way , like , the way too narcisism , right ?
If your job was exceptional you couldn &apos;t take it all the goods , everybody knew that you had been helped from this genius .
If your failure job , it wasn &apos;t your whole , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a hell .
And so people who have been created creativity in the West for a long time .
And then the Renaissance came and everything changed , and it changed this great idea ; we put the human being to the center of the universe on top of all the universe on top of all of the universe over the mit-detached space .
This was the principle of humanism and people started thinking that creativity came out of the idivided .
And for the first time in history , you started to get this or that artist , like a genius that , as a kind of a person with the genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think that allow someone , a simple person to believe that they were like a recipient , like the source , and the source and the source of all the divines , creativity and unknowable and being a lot of divines and a lot of divines and a lot of wild life-wild responsibility .
It &apos;s like to ask someone to enjoy the sun .
Deform and deform and it completely distorce and creates all of these print expectations on performance .
And I think it was this pressure to destroy the artists in the past 500 years .
And , if that &apos;s true , and I think that is , the question is , and now ?
Can we do that , diversously ?
Maybe go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and creative mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t take 500 years of rational thinking in a talk about 18 minutes .
And they probably have people in the audience who would be tiit-supported scientific supports on the notion of , you know , they &apos;re going to follow people to fit on their own projects .
I &apos;m not going to convince you all about this thing .
But the question I want to ask is is -- why isn &apos;t you ?
Why don &apos;t you think about this way ?
Because it makes more sense of anything that has ever heard to explain explanation of the impredictability of the creative process .
One process that , like anyone who has ever tried to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- you don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t comports rationally .
And , in fact , it can seem to be paranormed .
I &apos;ve done this recently , with the extra-poem Ruth Stone , who has 90 years old , but it was a poem for all life and said to me in his rural Virginia , and he felt felt it , in his surgery , and he felt it , in the field , and he felt it , inside of if when a poem came from the landscape .
He said he was like a train of air .
And that was rolling to come out of the landscape .
And he felt it , because he was tremendous to make the land under his feet .
He knew that you had one thing to do was , he said , &quot; run like a matta . &quot;
And he was going to the house and he was chased up with this poem , and it wouldn &apos;t have to make anything else that take a piece of paper and a match , and he got faster and grab and grab it on the page .
Other times you couldn &apos;t be fast , so correct and correcrecrecruited and run without going to get to the house and the rolling her through the house and she would keep it and rolling it through the landscape , looking for , how she said , &quot; another poet . &quot;
Then there were those times -- this is not forget -- there were some moments when there were some moments when it was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was trying to paper and poem passed through , and he was passed through , and he said , he was like you to get , and then he said , he was like to get to the other hand and the office .
And he was the poem from the tail and he would be in his body and moved it to the page .
And in these cases , poem would be presented on the perfect page , but the contrary , from the last word to the first word .
So when I felt it -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly the same same same same as it is .
Not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conduction .
I &apos;m a mud , and my way to work is ; I wake up to the same orary every day and work and go and go and working and get it over the hell .
But even I got pined in my testyard , I &apos;ve got got payed against that thing , sometimes .
And I guess a lot of you have the han .
You know , even if the job and ideas came up to me from a certain source of source , I could not know .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it so we don &apos;t have a head of the head , but rather , that we stay healthy , but rather , that makes us healthy ?
As I think , the best example of me , the best example I have is the Tom Waits , which I interviewed several years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the most of the life was the incarnation of the art art tormented , trying to control , management , to check , to check these species of the impulses that are completely interiorized .
But then inveck , he sed , and he was driving on a hair in Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
It was going fast and all of a sent sent of this little melody , coming in his head of his head as inspiration , and leaving , and halling and hell , and the desider , but it doesn &apos;t know how to get it .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , it &apos;s not a match , it &apos;s not a pencil .
So he starts to hear this kind of old anxiety in the anxiety , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose it .
I &apos;m not quite good enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to the panic , he stopped .
And he got the whole mental process and made something completely new .
He just looked at the sky and said , &quot; Sorry , don &apos;t you see that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Do you look like to write a song now ?
If you really want to existing , it &apos;s a more hurt when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , you go to unimporting somebody else .
Go to disturbing Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his work was changed after this .
Not the job , the work was still dark , as always .
But the process , and the fish that was repair that was released when he was , the genius out of the genius that was , he caused to get to the other problems and liberated it back from where it was , to the way that he was doing it , he had to be a interiorized thing that he had to be a interiorized thing .
But it &apos;s a wraper , wonderful bizarre , wonderful , cooking , collaboration with a conversation between Tom and this strange thing that was not Tom .
So how much I felt that story started to change a little bit of the way that I was working on and I &apos;ve already saved me once .
This idea , I was saved when I was writing , &quot; Mangia , &quot; and I fall in one of those despair of those despair of those despair that we &apos;re all working on and we can &apos;t start thinking that and you can &apos;t start thinking that that it &apos;s a disaster , that &apos;s the worst book ever .
Not just bad , just the worst book writing .
And I started thinking about to checking this project .
But then I remember Tom who was talking to the air and I tried .
So I got up my face on the hell and I diress my comments to a vacuum of the room .
And I said , &quot; Which , we both know , what we both know , if this book is not going to be brilliant , it &apos;s not going to be much ?
Because as I &apos;m putting all I &apos;m going to put all I have , I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want to be better , you have to introduce your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t , you know what , I don &apos;t give you anything .
I &apos;m going to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to be recorded that I &apos;ve been presented to do my part . &quot; Because it &apos;s like , you know -- it &apos;s like , you know -- centuries ago in North Africa , people were rooms in North of the snaim , and music that went on and hours to the dances and the wings to the dances of the dawn , and to the dances and to the dances .
And they were always magnifigures , because the dancing were great .
But every once , it was something happened , and one of these artists became actually transmed .
And I know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know you all , a performance like this .
It was like the time stops , and the dancing would walk through a kind of portal and was not doing anything different from the usual , like 1,000 noticed before , but it was all standing .
And suddenly , you know , you know , not just like a human .
But he &apos;s got to divinity and below the lightened fire .
And when this happened , at time , people knew what was , they called it up .
Congiunted their hands and started to sing , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , God , &quot; God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
I mean , historic notes -- when the More ssouthern , preserve this habits with them and the ready to change in the centuries from Allah , &quot; Allah , &quot; Allah , &quot; which you can still feel in the corride or in the corride or flamenc flary .
In Spain , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , the boxes , &quot; Allah , &quot; undry , &quot; incapability , &quot; incaptured , &quot; incapture , &quot; a God .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes day after , the dancy itself , when you wake up and you wake up and you find out , the 11 in the morning , God is no longer there is no longer no longer .
It &apos;s just a dying with a lot of haking , and maybe it can &apos;t ever be able to get more to that height to that height .
And maybe nobody will sing no one name the name of God still gira , and what you have to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most sweep reciliations to do in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so cordingly angosciant if you can &apos;t believe , you know , the most extraordinary aspects of your being from you .
But it just credit that you &apos;re in soon soon as you &apos;re in a stable kind of a source of this team of your life that you have to go to somebody else when you &apos;re finished .
And , you know , if we think it all this way .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s certainly like I thought about it for several months in the work that I &apos;m going to public book that I &apos;ll soon soon , the dangerous , attitude , and actually attitude , and we followed my great success .
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel electrized from this is , I don &apos;t have fear .
Don &apos;t flow you . It &apos;s just your job .
Continua present-time .
If your job is dancing , you know .
If the divine , absurd genius , absurd people to leave some kind of wonderful , for a only time through your effort , then &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Otherwise , you do the same dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot; to yourself .
I think it and I think you should teach it .
&quot; Ole ! &quot; to yourself the same for having human love and testing with tals to have a tal testing tals to make you present .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I &apos;ve already talked about some of these human genome , what can mean and about new genes .
We &apos;re now starting a new process . We started digitize biology and now starting from that digital code , we &apos;re going into a new phase of biology , designing and synthesizing life .
We &apos;ve always tried to ask big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists , I think they &apos;ve been trying to understand to see various levels .
We &apos;ve tried different approaches , and we have a lot of different approaches .
We &apos;re digitize for about 20 years ever .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the analog world &apos;s the biology to the digital world of the computer .
Now , we &apos;re asking , can we regenerate life , or create new of this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome genome , which is the species from the smallest genome .
And we tried to reduce the genome for a little smaller .
We can get a hundred genes of the genes of the 500 that are here .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our way .
I believe me , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes we can eliminate , one at the time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this can bring to a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to design was synthesize this chromosome so that cromosome in a way that we could change the components to ask some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of &quot; Can we synthesize a chromosome ?
Can you make these big molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create before ?
And , in case , can we make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemical material inert .
The speed with which we are able to digitize life is growing up to exponential rhythm .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , design fairly slowly , but it &apos;s improving .
And our most recent results the results on a exponential curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process has required , starting with a bioethical review before the first experiments .
But we found out that synthesize DNA is very hard .
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that produce small DNA segments , the long strength of 30 50 letters , and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the more mistakes there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these fragments and encies the mistakes and refer the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , starting with digital information from the genome of the Phi of 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , we &apos;ve designed the mistakes and got a molecule of DNA molecule .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of inert chemical material inert and we put it in the bacteria , they have started reading this genetic code and to produce the viral particles .
The viral particles have been released by cells , they come back and they have destroed .
I &apos;ve been talking about recently with members of the oil industry , and I said , to them that they certainly understood .
They have been bleeer more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build its hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the largest things .
We wanted to build the whole chromosome of the bacteria .
I &apos;m more than 580 thousand genetic code .
So we thought we were to build it in cassette cables of virus , so that we can change cassets to understand what the components of a living cell .
Surely critical , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , 1995 , the standard accuracy was a mistake for every 10 mixture .
We &apos;ve discovered it , we &apos;ve been able to do it , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence we never could do it .
One part of the process is to design a long way of 50 letters that overcome with all the other segments of the other segments of 50 to build to underneath the small underneath of the small sountails that work together .
We &apos;re trying to unic elements here .
You &apos;ve probably read that we put in the trillion .
Think about it , we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters together .
So we can use the genetic code to write , sentences , sentences , thoughts .
What we did at the beginning was self-rolling .
Some of them have been delused to be delused to be poem .
We designed these segments to get them together with enzyme .
There are standing in and put them together .
And we started assemble in the parts , starting with the severe five to seven mix them , and we started to form segments , and we &apos;re going to form segments of 24 mila letters to get to 72 to the letters .
At every step we &apos;ve made these dramatic segments so that we could sequenced it , because we &apos;re trying to create a very very robbbblew , like you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re looking for automatize the process .
So , this seems like the tabelon a basket globe .
When we get these very long segments , more than 100 mies , more than 100 mies , they won &apos;t grow more directly in E.
You get to the limits of modern molecular biology .
So we have some other mechanisms .
We know another mechanism called homological received , which in biology is used to repair the DNA to repair the DNA to be able to unveil the DNA .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism called Deinococcus , it can absorb three million radiation of radiation .
You can see in the top of the same restrict as his destroyed cromosome is destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s just like it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely dry .
They can live under vacuum .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life exists in space , and you &apos;re moving new environments in the water .
Actually , NASA has shown that this is .
This is a molecule that we built using these proces , just using the yeast with the design appropriate with the design appropriate segments to put .
The yeah leaven them automatically .
This image was not taken with a electric microscope , but with a regular microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It &apos;s a so big molecule that we can see it with a little little bit of it .
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the publication that we did a little time ago .
I &apos;m more than 580,000 letters .
It &apos;s the greatest molecule ever molecule .
It has a 300 million molecular weight .
If we &apos;re going to do it with a carat with a carat , you &apos;d like to make this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ?
Of course , you know , you know , is a game .
It &apos;s a little more complicated when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s easier even when it is eucarily the eucarily cells like our : you just get out of the nuclear and put another , which is basically the process of clonation .
In the archaea , the chromosome is instead of integrated inside the cell , but we have recently demonstrated that we are able to make a complete transplant of a cell trap from one cell to another and to acvary it .
We can clean a chromosome parent from a microbial species .
The two are different as the tops .
We added some genes in a way we decide to chromosome .
And then he skied it with the enzymes so that they were killing all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell is amazing -- and you &apos;re appreciate our sophisticated graph -- the new chromosome is gone inside the cell .
And we were thinking we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried still have to get there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that they had added up a second or a third chromosome somewhere , and I added up in a second thousands of new traits to that species .
So , who thinks about evolution as only as a gene at the time you can &apos;t understand much of biology .
There are some enzymes called &quot; restriction enzyme , &quot; they addicts to digital .
The chromosome that was in the cell .
The phone -- the chromosome we have put it in it .
It &apos;s expressed , and they recognized the other chromosome as a material , and we found with just the cell and the new chromosome .
It became blue because of the genes that we put .
And in a short amount of time , all the characteristics of a species went lost , and it turned into a new species , based on the new species , based on the new species that we put into the cell .
All the proteins have changed , and membraned membraned , and when we read the genetic code exactly what we &apos;ve moved to .
Now , this might seem to be genetic alchemy , but we alter the DNA can change things in a way .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that there is no genesis -- but we have a progression from three million years of evolution , and I &apos;ve already told that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion in which they &apos;re going to be created a new species on this digital process .
Why do you do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty obvious when we think about our necessity .
We &apos;re going to go from six and a half billion people to 9 billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to give you an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one existing in 1946 ; 40 years , there will be four of them .
We &apos;re having problems now to find food , fresh , fresh water and fresh for six and a half billion people .
It &apos;s going to be able to do it for nine billion .
We Utilize more than five billion fuel fuel barrels , more than 30 billion barrels .
That means a hundred million barrels a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replace them , it &apos;s a huge challenge .
We &apos;re in more we have the whole CO2 emission from these materials that end up in the atmosphere .
In today , because of the scientific discoveries all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the designed for the future .
The electronic industry has only a dozen about components , and you think about how many different things came out .
Our limits here is data principle from reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , thank you very much of these synthesization , and we can create what we call a combinatory genomics .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think about how to use these 20 million genes or optimize processes to produce or drugs , and new vaccines , we can change , because to a small team , and create more molecular biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , check chemistry or fuel , production of vaccines .
This is an instantanezes of some software programmed we &apos;re working on to be able to sit down and design species at the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how they &apos;re going to be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
We &apos;re now focusing on the fourth generation .
You also see that you extract howned by the grain was an experiment .
We have coal coal , and third generation that will use enough sugar fugar fur fuel than than they are or different kinds of butanle .
But the only way biology can have a big impact without increasing the cost of food and limb and limlimb the cost of food and limb the willing of food and limb , so we &apos;re working out to design cells that can achieve this purpose , and we think we can have the first fuel of the first fuel in about 18 months .
War sunlight combined CO2 is a metodo--- but in our discoveries around the world , we found different metods .
This is a organism that we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
It &apos;s going to the deep ocean , about 2,500 feet of the water to the webollitemperature .
It creates the CO2 using it by using it as a molecular energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand whether we can incanal the CO2 , which can easily be transported through tubes , convert that CO2 into fuel , to drive this process .
So we think we might be able to increase what the basic question of &quot; what life is life is . &quot; What life is we are , versus , we have the modest goal to replace the entire oil industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can you do you ?
It would be a main source of energy .
We also are working on the same methods to create instantly vaccines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with flu , we &apos;re always back for a year and with a dollar in less when it is to find the right .
I think that you can change building combinable vaccines in anticius .
Here &apos;s how the future might start to look at the time , the tree of evolution , accelling evolution with synthetic bacteria , arches , and finally eucariote .
We &apos;re so so much to improve people .
Our purpose is to make it . Thank you very long enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the faster possible , some fundamental work , the new technology that we &apos;ve taken to the Microsoft in a purchasing almost a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s a environment where you can interact is local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data .
We &apos;re seeing a lot of gigabyte of digital photos with a kind of a constant suit and continuous , for a fast panoramic fast-panoramic photos , display images like .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much the amount of information that we see , how big these collapses of data or images .
Most of the digital photographs , but this for example is a scan from the Library of Congress , and the Library of the Congress , and it comes into the gamm of the Congress .
It &apos;s not a difference because the only thing that limits the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen at any time . It also a very flessible architecture .
This is a whole book , all of the data , not of images .
This is the Surver Dickens . Each the column is a chapter .
So to show you that it &apos;s just about text and not of images , we can do something like this , to really see that it &apos;s a real representation of the textent , not of a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a little bit artificial to read a piece of electronic book .
I don &apos;t advice it .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s a number of The Guardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a section .
And really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading the real version of a magazine or a magazine , or a daily sense of a multiple kind of a half .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the Guardian .
We created a lot of fashion and resolution -- much higher than what you use in a normal publishing -- and we put you in the normal content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or others , or even the specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the space limits of space on the screen .
I hope that this means means , you know , you finally , people who are willing to get around and other similar porcheries .
Of course , maps is one of the most obviously , for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say we have a contribution to give you even in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States overhead of a geospace , on a NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually alive on the web ; you can go to see it .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which is a project called Photosynth , which is a project called Photosynth , which is a project called Photosynth , which is a project called Photosynth , which is fighter two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting visual research at the very interesting computer made by Noah Snavely Seitz student , at Steve Seitz of Microsoft Rick Szeliski Rick . It &apos;s a great collaboration .
And it &apos;s live on the web , I was running from Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from one image to the other and have this kind of multiple experience to resolution .
But the spacecraft of images here actually a meaning .
The algorithms of the computer algorial , they &apos;ve recorded these images together , so that they correspond to the real places that the people -- all sorts close to the Great Montagne Roccies . They were taken . So you see the elements of a slightly stable or a slightly stable of a slightly stable or a sweeping of a slightly link or landscape .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;ve got time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more space .
I want to go directly to one of the NoahNoahh data -- and this is from a very unprecedent prototynth of Photosynth that we did work for the first time , to show you what I think think is the back behind this technology , Photosynth technology . And it &apos;s not necessarily evident by looking at the environments that we put in the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so forth .
This is a reconstruction of Nothree Dame &apos;s Caucral images from Flickr . Bauct Nobody Dame in Flickr and you get images of these kinds of gpus and and so on . Olickr . And you get one of these orders , and so on . Oach of these orders are discovered to appearing this model .
So they &apos;re all images from Flickr and they were all connected to space level in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to ign this very simple way .
You know , I never thought of finish finish in working for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifying to get this kind of accounts here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of phones that are , from those cell cell photos , which is a significant number of , put together in this environment .
And if I can try and try and try and look for the more strange .
Many blocks from the faces , etc .
Somewhere you have a series of photographs -- there &apos;s a series of photographs --
This is a poster Nothree Dame is recorded correctly .
We can go from the six-sight posters of this environment .
The essential point is we can do things with the social environment . This is now taking from the sususuit -- from the entire collective memory of how the earth looks like , from visual point of view -- and connects all that data together .
All of those pictures become connected together , more than the sum of the parts .
You have a model of the entire land emerges .
Think about this as a prolungent of Stephen Lawler &apos;s work on the virtual Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as people who use it , and the people who use it , and the people who use it .
Their photos are marched with meadow by other people .
If you get someone is the idea of contrast all these sets , my picture of the Cathedral picture of Nothing &apos;s Cathedral three Did suddenly enries falls of all that data , and I can use it as a point of ingress in that space , in that metaphor , using the pictures of the cross-moon and cross-user .
Of course , a consequence of all the interesting virtual patterns of all interesting virtual patterns in any interesting part of the land , collected not only by seen airplane and satellite images and similar , but from the collective .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I mean , I know ? What your software is going to do is that at some point in the next years , all the time , all the photographs that you know , all of the world will be basically connected together ?
BAA : Yeah . What is doing is basically to find out .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , you want , in images .
And it &apos;s going to be doing it in the content of the images .
And it becomes very interesting if you think about the rich breeding of seanti-like information that many of these images have .
As you can see , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the web is a lot of information about the images .
Now , what happens if that picture is connecting all your photh ?
So the amount of semantic interconnection and the amount of wealth that comes out is really huge . It &apos;s a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really amazing .
BAA : thank you very much .
One of the main pleasers when you travels and one of the ethnographic research is the way to live between who has no forgotten the antic traditions , between who you have the past in the wind , and touch it in stones of the rained the rained stones of the plants .
Basti Jaguous , Jaguous , they still travel beyond the Via Lattea , or that the old old Himalayas , the Inuit &apos;s still cold of significant , or that in Himalaya , the distinctive budget still of the Dharm , to remember the central anthropology of anthropology , and the idea that the world we live in which we don &apos;t have in a sense of reality , but it &apos;s just a reality , a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of adaptive set that our stirply made , well or bad , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential lowered .
We all come up . We all procreate .
We are subjects to remarkable .
We have to face the inexorability of death , so we don &apos;t surprised it if we &apos;re and we talk --
We all have an art .
What &apos;s the specifically is the particular rhythm of the song , the rhythm of any culture .
It &apos;s not about the Thests of the Borneo &apos;s &apos;s Pforests , or the followed the Voodoo &apos;s desert , or the Chinese warriors of the Kaizen in Kenya , Curander , or a camp in Kenya , or a cammal in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my journey of journey in the desert a month ago , or a yak hallevator in the Qomolangma , Everest , the dea mother of the world .
All of these people are teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving around the world .
And , if you reflect a moment , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
Togogs , the miriades of cultures in the world are spiritual , spiritual life , which you know , the planet and it &apos;s important to the planet , so it &apos;s important for the planet as biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural spill as a hetnosphere and you can define the etc . and you can define the whole whole whole concepts , dreams , mits , ideas , inspirations , intuitions taken out of being from the human imagination of the awareness .
The ethnosphere is the fantastic of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be as as much pollution .
And because biosphere was very very very much more , it &apos;s happened to the ethnosphere and unfortunately , very quickly ,
No biologist , for example , would say that 50 percent of all species is , or is on the horrible ord , because it &apos;s flew , or -- in the most apocalyptic diversity -- in the most optional field of biological diversity -- and you don &apos;t even get close to the mystic -- that of cultural diversity --
The surgery of all of this is , of course , the language loss .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not made by a vocabulary or a vocabulary or a series of rules .
One language is the spraking of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle with every culture comes in in the material world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a kissing , a thought , a hotter ecosystem of .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re sitting here in Monterey , at least half no longer is subsurrounded in the ears of the children .
They &apos;re not teaching children , the one that means , unless campaign , which has already died .
What &apos;s more sad than you have to be the silence , of the being the last last talk about the last last to talk , the world &apos;s why we don &apos;t have to transmit wisdom of the wisdom or to anticipate the promise of the children ?
This is the one of someone in some world in some of the world every two weeks : every two weeks , every old or two weeks . Even the last silver , and brands to the last sillabs of a language .
And I know someone of you say , &quot; Is it not better like that ?
The world wouldn &apos;t it be a better place if we were going to talk about all the same language ? &quot; All right , we &apos;re all yoruba .
We talk about kogi .
You cat a sudden what it means you can &apos;t talk to his language .
I &apos;d like to give you a journey through the ethnosphere --
a little trip in the ethnosphere to give you a bit of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I say &quot; different ways of existing ways of existing . &quot; I mean , different ways of existing .
Let &apos;s take for example , this Barasana boy , in SSSweet Amazon , the people of the anaconda &apos;s river of the latte severe in the top of the side of the wild snap &apos;s panish .
It &apos;s a people who can &apos;t distinguished the blue color from the green because the time it has identified color from the green because the time it &apos;s identified in the forest of the people .
They have a strange language and a matriridge , called &quot; exogy language , &quot; we have to marry a person who &apos;s talking a different person talking about a language .
All of this has roots in the mythological past , yet the particularly , in these families that are in these families or seven languages because of the matririribs no language .
They &apos;re just listening and then start talking .
Let &apos;s take one of the most interesting tribe with , with which I lived , the Waorans of Ecuador , a popular people who had the first contact in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionaries have been trying to make a fatal mistake .
They &apos;ve had gone down the top photographs that retraded them into the place that they were addressing , forest that this people in the forest that people had never seen anything about two-dimensional .
They &apos;ve taken the land , they turned around to the research of a form or a figure and not out , they have a figure , they &apos;re not going to have to be able to be killed the hell , and they killed the five missionary with the lance .
But the Waorans didn &apos;t kill the foreigers .
They were killed with them .
54 percent of mortality was caused by themselves .
We were saved at eight generations and we found two natural death cases and when we &apos;ve insisted to know , they admit had invecked to the so that he died , and then they killed it . And then they killed it .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal as 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned a really interesting task when my Harvard professor , asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti between the secret society to the basis of the power of Duvalier and Tonton Macout-sued , and I impossessor of the poison to do sus .
In order to make sense of the miraculous , I should have understand Voodoo culture and that Voodoo is not magic .
It &apos;s pretty a complex metaphor vision of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to ask the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christianity , Islam , Good , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always leaven out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no religious faith . And instead , and the Voodoo and the Voodoo is not anything else that illed with these religious concepts .
What &apos;s interesting is the voodoo is the intense relationship between life and death .
So the vivives are going to be the beat .
The spirits can be invocated by the Great Acqua , respond to the rhythm of the dance and replace temporarily to the vive soul so that for a short active active active active to follow it becomes the god .
So , for this voodooists love to say , &quot; You go to church to talk about God .
We go to the temple and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment you were posslow-up , is the spirit that you , how can you get you bad ?
So you see these incredible events : followed these voodoo in state of trance that touches infuel touches , you know , you know , a very strong demonstration of the body when it &apos;s catalyzed in a state of extremitation .
In all the people who I have the most extraordinary lived in the Kogi Santa Marta Santa Marta Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta .
They were to the ancient civilization that once were living on the charge of the charge of Colombia on carrise of Colombia on the windurance , the people would retreat the volcanic .
In a continent of blood , this people has never been conquised by the spaghousing .
But they &apos;re actually government government government government , but their formation is so extraordinary .
The young people are taken away from the families to three or four years , and they live secret in a world of dark and shading in a world of stone of the basic glaciers for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years I &apos;ve been born about to reproduce the nine months of gestation that transrunning into the uter of mother , now they &apos;re metaphor in the Great Mother people .
For all of this time , they &apos;re accounted to the values of their society , values that predicts that their prayers and just their prayers and prepent their prayers , keep the cosmic balance .
And so , as this amazing start , they &apos;re suddenly brought out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , they see an alard . And that &apos;s what they &apos;re in the first eventually , when the sun kiss the beautiful values of , all that they &apos;ve learned in theory is constitute in his theory . The pret does a step back and says , &quot;
&quot; Visto me as I said . I said .
It &apos;s great . It &apos;s now to you . &quot;
They &apos;re called the greater brothers and say that we , brothers , are the colors of the world &apos;s destruction .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the indigenous people and invows and the environment we call Rousseau and the old history of the selling sevble , which is a race concept of its simity or maybe invoating Thoru and we say these people are closer to the Earth of us .
Redwood people are not feelings , no indebate from nostalgia nostalgia .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the malarial palude or the vents of Tibet , but because of the time and the rhythids , they created a mystical mystical of the Earth is not about the concept of the Earth &apos;s concept of being aware of of of the world .
What does that mean ?
That &apos;s a little bit different with Ande that you can believe that the mountain is a spirit of the mountain is a spirit that will be a deeply different , and it &apos;s going to be a very different relationship with the mountain or that place with the mountain or that place that grows to create that a mountain is a lot different rocks will be shown .
whether it &apos;s dimurdering a spirit or a mineral caught .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that define the relationship between the individuals and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia British believing that forests would have been cut .
And that I have a different human being from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the dimmora and the bank of the heaven and the bank of the heaven and the cannies that live in the Hukukukukukukukicely , that they face in the Hamatsa .
If you start to consider that these cultures can create reality , you can start to understand some of them all of their senational discoveries . We take this plan .
I took this picture to open up in the North Amazon the North Amazon .
Maybe some of you &apos;ve heard about the ayahuasca , the most powerful psychophical active psychophical active repertorium .
What makes the ayahuasely , it &apos;s not the potential of the substance , but his elaboration . It &apos;s made by two elements .
On one side , this lian side , this legny leap that contains a bunch of beta-coal , harmoline and harmoline , slightly hallucinogen .
And by by trying to the only cross a smoke blueprint that you alter the concience , but it &apos;s mixed with the leaving of a coffee family , and they said , &quot; Dr. Poptry is aliride .
This plan plant powerful methyptamine , very similar dimethypmethylyptyptamine .
If you ever see the Yanomami thydimethydimethydimethydimethydimethydimethydimethydimethydimethydimethydimethydimethydimethyptamine .
Tiring that dust for the birth is a little bit like being shooted by a becoming shooting of barking and land on a sea of electricity . &#91; Risate &#93; &quot; I don &apos;t believe a distortion of reality .
I often have to my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who had taken the psychedelivered the afterwards of the fold hutter , with his discovery of fungi in the &apos; 30 in Mexico .
According to my thesis not going to classify these tripamine as as hallucinogen , because if you &apos;re made you can &apos;t tell anybody to be hallucinated .
It &apos;s possible to get it , it &apos;s just if you &apos;re above with other chemicals that they denied MAO .
Now , it &apos;s the nice , the beta-fuel that are inhibitches in this lian injury , the same kind of need to potentiate the triptamines . The question is spontaneously , in a 80,000 species of plants , like these people have these people who have these defed deaths of plants , like these people have two defologically not similar defed to the sum ?
We use the great Europeupheric and error , which can revealing to infruted .
But if we ask Indians , they &apos;ll tell us , &quot; The plants talk about it . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuasca , which distinguished in the forest , and that in our eyes would come into the same species .
If we ask them how they were going to be , &quot; &quot; I thought , &quot; I thought , &quot; I thought , &quot; I thought , &quot; No .
The solution is , you take the 17 variety in a night of moon , and we &apos;ll have a different tone .
With this is not graduate Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting that stami .
Now , &#91; applausi : The problem is that even those of us that have to heart people who have to heart people who have painting people but somehow reduced to the sea of the history of our real world , and it &apos;s going to the world , and it &apos;s going to the real world , and it &apos;s going to it .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it &apos;s not going to remember her or his technological innovations , but as the one was where we stopped and and we used active and we used active or passive passive , and we used active or passive , the mass destruction of the biological diversity of diversity and cultural diversity of the planet .
All the cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibilities .
And the problem is not technology .
The Soux Indians have not been ssnow when they put on the arms and flished as Americans have no stop being American when they put on the horse and hot .
It &apos;s not the change or the technology that threatening integrity of ethnosphere . It &apos;s the power .
The hard hard to domination .
And if you look at the world , you &apos;ll find that these are not destined to disappear .
They &apos;re living creatures and very , very , very , very , unlike the existence from forces identificable existence from forces .
It &apos;s about the Penan &apos;s disboscampaign in the Penan --
a peak peak in Sarawak , in the southeast East , a people who lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to a generation ago , and now reduced to the results on the rights , where you can see the river river &apos;s rightly from the dayayayayon-ring , and the next to the Merional Cinese , where the window , and the horizon , and Merian , where you know ,
ready to fill the wooden wooden with the subject to the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that came with the discovery of the gold .
If we move on the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the hard hard hard for political domination .
As you know the genocide , the extinction of a people , is a universal level , but the ethnocid , destruction of the style , destruction of the style , not only is we &apos;ve addressed , but it &apos;s a celebrated part of the development strategift .
And you can &apos;t understand the Tibet until you start .
I &apos;ve taken the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in the Western China through the Western Tibet , coming to Lhasa with a young link , but only came to Lhasa young man , but only came to Lhasa whose talk about .
6,000 sacred monuments in the dust and centers .
1.2 million people killed from the military in the Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascrited in the Panchen Lama .
Which is that it was killed in the time of the Chinese invasion .
Suo uncle was made with Suan Santiity during the diaspora that led the people in Nepal .
His mother was imprisoned and his cholf was rich .
It was brought to hidden at the age of two hidden birth , because he had a wave because he couldn &apos;t have to live without him .
The sister , who did the same , was put in reducing camp .
One day , he revertitled a cooled band Mao and , for this transgression , was put to the forced to the forced for seven years .
The Tibet can be insable , but the spirit of the people &apos;s insane , but the spirit of the people is from keeping .
And it flights up , it &apos;s all falls up to a choice .
We want to live in the world monocromatic or do we want to get the policy of diversity ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he died said that his greatest feeding was that we in our view of the world , we &apos;re not only going to see the whole gams of human imagination , we &apos;re going to see the whole gams of the human imagination , we &apos;ll see it from a forged lands to see a sleep for them to another .
And it &apos;s about to remember that our species existed for 600,000 years .
The Neolithica Revolution , who gave us agriculture , who has made us unflew in the seed , by replace the severe of the seed , and by the way , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has been 300 years old .
That &apos;s history doesn &apos;t suggests me that we have the answers to all the challenges we have to deal with in millennies .
When you know , when you know , what to be human , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all refer the chance of being what we are : a conscious species , that must make all the people and the gardens can trigger . And there &apos;s great moments of great moments .
I &apos;ve taken this picture on the north of the Baffin the end of Baffin , when I went to the whale hung with the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , and this man , Olaya man , Olaya
The Canadian government has not always been gentile with the Inuit and the &apos; 50s to stabilize our supremidden , we have them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refused to go .
His , teming for his life , he took them all the weapons , and all his toons .
You have to know that Inuit doesn &apos;t feel cold , they exploit .
The skaws of the origin were made of fish flying in spread of spaces in spaces of spaces .
The grandfather of this man didn &apos;t reach out of the arctic or the bylizeros or from the bylizer .
It &apos;s got flied away , it &apos;s socked the packaged in their own hand . When I did it flied it in his hand . When I did it frozen , and they were working with a sama .
It &apos;s got salive salive on the end of this clock , and when I solid solid , he killed a dog .
He shaking the dog and created a bright , with the toraaaac coat , he dropped another dog , and he enlied on the banking , and it &apos;s disappeared on the bang , the crank it &apos;s standing .
We want to talk about horns with nothing ?
In the opening 1999 , the CCCCCCCCCCCEEEO , the largest state of California and Texas .
It &apos;s their new painting . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s an independent land . They all the mineral resources .
One beautiful example of how a nation-state can reconciliation with his people .
And , finally , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious to the people who of us has been in these remote areas of the planet , and they &apos;re not remote .
For someone is home .
They represent sections of human imagination that go back to the dawn of the time . And for us all , the dreams of these children , like dreams of our children , they become part of the geography of hope .
And we are National Geographic , we are convinced that politicians will never get to anything .
We believe we believe polemics --
&#91; Applausi &#93; are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month our website . Every month , 35 million visits .
156 countries transmit our television channel .
Our magazines are lets of millions .
Our work is traveling in the ethnosh to bring our audience in places of cultural wonderful , cultural places that will go away from what they &apos;re going to have to be dropped out and , hopefully for the central reveal of the exist of the existing of diversity , and we have a life in a world of existing a world in a world and we have to find a life in a world pluralist and multiculticket to find a world and mill
where the wisdom of all people can contribute to our collective wisdom .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that book that I hope is called other other other than you &apos;ve already heard and try to point out some links , in case you don &apos;t notice .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the official dogma . &quot;
The dogma official what ?
The dogma official companies of Western industrial society . The dogma official Dogma : &quot; If we want to maximize the well-being of our citizens . &quot;
The reason is , on one side , in fact that liberty is itself itself a value , it &apos;s very precious , useful , essential for humans .
On the other fact that if we are free , we &apos;re free , each of us can do anything that massively for all that massively massively , no one of the wild wild , without any any deciding in the name .
The way to massively freedom is massively choice .
The more choices are , more of people , more libere , and the greater freedom , is their well-being .
This , I think , it &apos;s so deeply roomed in society that nobody would have to put it in doubt .
And it &apos;s also deeply royal in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;ll let me just put a note on the conditions for the winds .
In my supermarket is 175 inches , without counting the 10 variety of olive olive oil and 12 hits whales and the 12 household of friends that you can buy for a huge amount of conditions in the circumstances that no one of the 175 people who are already ready of your degree .
Here &apos;s what the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic store to buy a stereo , if , CD lettor CD , radio , raining , light bull ,
And in this single store , there &apos;s a great deal of the block .
We can do six and a half million different combinations using the components that are in a only store .
You have to admit that &apos;s so much choice .
Other camps : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the telephone services , at all , at all , to be a Bell .
They were noleggied the phone , you didn &apos;t buy it .
One of that , between the other , was that the phone never break .
These days are gone .
We now have a nearly illimited variety of phones , especially between cell phones .
Here &apos;s cell phones .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , cut them them them in the nose , and raining for crème , and rainforb for crème .
If you haven &apos;t seen it still saw in the store under the house store , you &apos;re very certain that will soon get .
And what happens is that people come into the stores and ask this question . And what &apos;s the answer ? The answer ? The answer is &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
So , in other ways of life that are much more important than the bug , you see the same explosion the choices .
Assistence : it doesn &apos;t happen in the United States that you &apos;re going to go from the doctor and the doctor tell you what you to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do A or B , &quot; You can have these benefits and these risks &quot; B , &quot; has these benefits and these risks &quot; B , &quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Doctor , what would I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; You have these benefits , and those risks , and B has these benefits and B has these benefits . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebat , &quot; Doctor if you were , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result we call it &quot; self-expression of the malate , &quot; expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But it &apos;s not that you can move the weight and responsibility for someone who knows something , that &apos;s a doctor , to someone who knows about , it &apos;s doctor , to someone else that knows nothing -- and it &apos;s certainly sick -- and it &apos;s not a matter of course , it &apos;s sick -- and so it doesn &apos;t know , in the ideal condition ,
There &apos;s a huge marketing of products , directly to people like me and you , who if you think about it , it &apos;s not a sense , because we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why are we advertising them ?
The answer is that they want to ask them to ask them to ask them to ask them to change the recipe .
Something like this is our orpheric identity is a matter of choice , how we see in this vignity . We don &apos;t want to force the children . I &apos;m going to make the children . I &apos;m going to make it .
And we can re-up how many times you get to get .
Which means that every morning , at the risake , you have to decide what kind of you want to be .
I &apos;m going to the family and the matriririse , a common time perspective , almost for anyone , was that married the most soon possible , and you start to have the most soon possible , and you start to children the most soon possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and even what to do after .
So , all it &apos;s really to play .
I teach them to very smart students , and I &apos;m going to them 20 percent in less of work than a time .
And not because they &apos;re less bright , because they &apos;re not very brilliant .
But why are I &apos;m imthoughts , I mean , &quot; Do I should be married or not ? Do you know ? &quot;
&quot; Should I marry it later ? I have to think before children or the career ? &quot;
They are logoring .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this is not complete the process of homework that I teach and not get a nice voice to my exam .
And they have to really do that . They &apos;re important questions .
Now , the job : we &apos;re lucky , like Carl undering , because we &apos;re able to work every minute , every day , from every day , from every day , from any day , from any day of the planet , except that Hotel Randolph .
In the parentesesesis , there &apos;s a corner , and I don &apos;t say what , where WiFi works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use me .
What does this mean , this amazing freedom of choice we have about the work ? It &apos;s that we have to keep on , continually deciding , at any time , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing soccer , with the cell phone in a pocket , Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , tily , on the knees .
And even though they &apos;re all spending , every minute we see that we see our son roving , we &apos;re also wondering , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you have to answer this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? I have to email this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is &quot; no , &quot; all this makes the experience of your son very different people than the own game very different than than the other conditions .
So , anywhere we look , small things and small and big things , and lifestyle , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : You were some possibilities , but it wasn &apos;t all about choice .
The world today looks like this : The world &apos;s a good thing , or negative ?
The answer is Sem .
So the positive positive lets we know all , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative .
All of this is two negative effects of people .
The first paradoxically , is that produced paradoxysis that produced paradoxysis that produced paradoxysis that produced paradoxysis that .
With a lot of options , it becomes very hard to do it .
I offer you a significant study : a study of the volunteers .
A colleague connects to the data of the Vanguard data , the giant company , with about a million pension of pension , with about a million customers of the founded by 2,000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offering in more , the percentage of adhesion the percentage of adhesion the side of two percent .
With 50 offerts , there &apos;s 10 percent less less than the adhesions than when they &apos;re available . Why ?
Because with 50 funds that choosing , is maledefed to decide , and choice is returned to the back to the back .
And tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course , tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and
You know , it &apos;s not just that these old workers from old people to dogs , because they &apos;re not going to have enough money , even wants to say that the decision is so that they lose the source of the jobs .
Not participating , they &apos;re losing to five dollars a year from the work dator , that would be well disposed to be true .
So the paralysis a consequence of tropes .
And I think it makes the world .
&quot; And to end , for the ethernity : ketchup , maionese sensors ? &quot;
Would you like to make the right decision , if it &apos;s for ethernity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to pick the wrong wrong , and yet the condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can avoid the paralysis and make a choice , at the end of how we would be with less options .
And that for several reasons .
One of those is that with a lot of conditions between which you choose , if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could do a different choice that would be better . And what the alternative is that the alternative imagined us to branch for choice , and the regreaten decrease satisfying seven-displays by the decision ,
even when it was a great decision .
The more choices are , easier , is easier than any details that it &apos;s unsatisfaction of the option .
Also , there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert claried very well , it &apos;s like the value we give things depends on what we &apos;re compare .
From the rest , when there are a lot of possible options , it &apos;s easy to represent the characteristics of the option that you have to be less sationally .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m going to use with all of those who are not in New York .
But that &apos;s what you probably think .
There &apos;s this couple of Hamptons .
A luxury .
It &apos;s all for them . Otspread a day . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not going to be miss . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , it &apos;s August . &quot;
&quot; All my neighbors in Manhattan are away . &quot;
&quot; I could park right in front of the house . &quot;
And it &apos;s going to two weeks assilce , that &apos;s losing -- every day -- the ability to park where it wants .
The cost-to-opportunity decrease satisfying the satisfying .
And the more are the options that we have to consider , the more attractive features .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
We &apos;re talking about living the moment , and maybe we &apos;re slowly .
But the most important point is you &apos;re going to you , you choose to not do the other .
The things we don &apos;t choose have a lot of attractive what we do .
Third point : the growing growing of the expectations .
I tried it on my skin butch a new jeans .
I &apos;m pretty always a jeans .
Once the jeans were just like , bought them and dressed and dressed them , were disciled , just after they took them a life and they were all well .
So , I went to buy a couple of jeans , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
The bet said , &quot; You &apos;re going to slim fit , you know , relaxed ? &quot;
I want to do it with the cerninic or with the button ? &quot; Stonewashed , &quot; or &quot; acidum ?
&quot; Was you want to do it ? &quot;
&quot; Sotto , you want to get it or stretch ? BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBla , &quot; Continupright them .
I was stunk , and after a while I did , and after a while I did , you know , the only guy , &quot; he was the only guy , &quot; I had no idea what it was , so for a time time , I came out of jeans , and then out of the jeans that ever had .
It was the very very much . I had the best choice .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was that I was that with all of that choice , my worst expectations were so so , jeans had to be perfect .
I had minimum expectations . I didn &apos;t expect anything exceptional when there was one , you know , but when you saw 100 different , stedents , at least one kind of have to be perfect .
What I did was good , but not perfect .
After I was compared to the chosen with what I was trying to do was insatisfaced to the expectations .
The addition of options in the lives of people don &apos;t make that increasing the excellence of the same options .
And that will produce less satisfying , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the marketing world .
Because if they knew it , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more to this .
&quot; It was better when you were worse , &quot; The reason he was better when you were worse was worse , you were still able to meet some pleasant surprising .
Other day , in the world we live in -- opulent , industrialized citizens with the expectancy -- the most of the expectancy .
You never surprised to pleasant because your expectations , my expectations , have ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Baxy , &quot; Yes , you want it . &quot;
I mean , little authographic moment -- that I &apos;m really married and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t have done .
But it &apos;s not always a bad thing .
And finally , you know , you know , you know , when you have the kind of the jeans is that when you &apos;re not severe , and you say , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot; , the answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What would I do you do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a satisfaction , and you ask you who is , you ask who &apos;s responsible , it &apos;s just as clear that responsible , it &apos;s you .
You could have done better .
With hundreds of available variety , there are no excuse for the insuccessful .
So when people make decisions , even if the result is valid , you feel insatisffying and give the cold to them .
In the last years , depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only , but important -- of this wave of depression is just that people have deludent experiences because standard are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation they think the blame is .
So the end result is that we &apos;re better , actually , we &apos;re better at the end .
Let me remember you .
This is the dogma , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely fake . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit of choice better than having any of it , but from this didn &apos;t go from that much better .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve been overcome from a piece of the level where the choices improving our life .
Now , from the political point -- I &apos;ve almost finished by the political point of view , the peanch is the following .
What it allows all of this to industrial society is wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know , where the problem is not they have too too much choice .
The problem is they have too too packs .
So the thing I &apos;m talking about is a malage of modern , rich , Western society .
And what depressing and angry is this : Steve Levitt Levitt has talked to you about yesterday about how much those expensive and seolers for children are useful . It &apos;s a money .
I mean these choices , complicated and dispended , it &apos;s not that they are just useful .
I &apos;m even deleteries .
They &apos;re doing worse .
If a little bit of what we are in our society allows that they were poured in those where people have too few people have too too much better .
This is what economists call a partables improvement .
A redistribution of income re-income re-income re-income re-income re-toeding .
So , just conclude , &quot; Gilout , you can become all you . &quot;
You , people of culture , you &apos;ll think , &quot; What does that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious you can &apos;t do anything in a shelf in a bright . &quot;
&quot; A castrade imagination , a limited vision of the world -- &quot;
and I &apos;m going to do it so at the beginning .
But then , I realized that that that fish knows the long knows that that that fish knows the long knows .
Because the reality is that if you &apos;re missing the bocch , you can &apos;t get freedom . You don &apos;t get freedom . You don &apos;t get freedom . You can &apos;t get freedom .
If you break the bocch so that everything is divents possible to decredivents .
You get the paralysis , and you reduce the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too strange , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of some symbolic sphere is a recipe for inhappiness and I theme , for the raising .
Thank you very much .
