Last year I showed these slides to show that the glal calculus that &apos;s glal calculus , which for almost three million years of years had the size of 48 United States continents , it &apos;s restrip of 40 percent .
But this underneath the gravity of the problem because it &apos;s not exhibition the ice of ice .
The artica calculus is , in a sense , the heart of the global global global global global global global global global global system .
It &apos;s expanded up and the summer retreating .
The next slide is going to be a carrelated carrelated to the last 25 years .
The glaces are reached in red .
As you see , they &apos;re expanding to the blue boat .
That &apos;s the ice ice in the winter ice , which is a summer ice .
You can see that the cosiddle cosing , five years or more , is like the blood , which is like the blood , which here is the body .
In 25 years , so , in the way .
This is a problem because the rewarming demonstrate the land of the land , where there are huge amount of fuel coal , where there are huge amount of fuel fuel , which is transformed in meters from the microbes .
I &apos;m going to the totalal-up atmospheric inflate , that amount could be double , that amount could be double , super-up the point of not around .
In some smoon on Alaska metan is already refer from the water .
The professored Katey Walter University of Alaska University of Alaska team of grade , the very low team .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You &apos;re good . The question is if we &apos;re going to be .
One reason is that this exist termal exchange the Groenland from north .
This is a river at regime .
The ported that had never reached levels like .
This is the Kangerlussuaimed River Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea level of the glaces on land , here &apos;s where the sea is where you reach the sea .
These currents are increasing rapidly .
On the other side of the planet : Antartide , the biggest ice block of ice in the planet .
The last month scientists have depped the stage is in negative , and the Antarctttle of the ice is in the western , which rain some sun islands , is particularly rely in the smooth .
Equival six feet of the actual level , like Groenland .
Sulla Himalaya , the third largest block of ice , you see new laghi , which few years ago was glacious .
40 percent of the world population population is returned half of the water power from the potential .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the power of this city .
The ported is increased .
But when it demining , the same happens to the water .
In California , snow , in California , and it &apos;s deminuity of 40 percent .
The hyriries are in the crisis .
The predictions , like you read , they &apos;re grant .
The growing safe in the world leads to a remarkable increasing inceness .
The disaster disaster environmental disaster are increasing out of the normal and unprecedented .
Four times more than the last 30 years I was going to do 75 years I was going to do 75 .
This is a remarkable thing .
If you look at the storytelescescope can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we add 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the area of the Pacific Gacific , the Americans , to the Americans , to both both parts of the continent of the subcontinent continent , where there &apos;s a radical impoversent in the ocean .
The greater cause of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fuel fuel fuel fuel use .
The oil is a problem , and the coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two of the most emissions , and in China .
And he proponed to build a lot of other central central centers .
But we &apos;re seeing a change change .
These are the designers annullated in the last years and some alternative proposal of the versus .
So , in the way , there &apos;s a fight in our country .
The industrial coal and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote fuels 250 million dollars in the last year to promote fuels , which is a symboboy .
That picture would reminds me something --
Veras Natale , in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a loss of 3.8 billion litri dent ,
Maybe you &apos;ve seen the news news news .
This is the second largest flow in America .
It happened around Natal .
The public advertising one of the coal industrial .
Video : You know , you know , â™« Frosty the carbon and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it &apos;s growing our economy .
Frosty carbon carbon dioxygen is more cleaner .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and the workers keep the workers .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest minerary society is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : You &apos;re clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelos: Nancy Pelos: they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima Protection of Clima Clima .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Attore : ALergy we see the climate change as a mindset of our business .
So , for this priority is to invest a lot of money in a recommend to make public and confused the truth on the coal .
In fact , coal is not spork .
We think it &apos;s pulit -- it &apos;s also a good profumo .
So you don &apos;t preprehate climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Attore : Caunt , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
So let &apos;s go around a structure at the avanguardia of how it &apos;s about the fuel coal .
Straordinarian ! machines are a little rumorous , but this is the sound of the sound of the fuel technology of pulit .
The fuel consumption is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology that you see changes everything .
Take a look : this is the odiern technology of pulit .
Al Gore : Instantly , the positive alternative . You can put on the economic security and the national security .
Video : America is in the crisis , the national security , national security , the climate crisis .
The phililo that connecting all : our dependence from fossil fuels , as the fuel fuel and oil imported oil .
Now , though , there &apos;s a new , audace solution to use it .
Real America : 100 percent cleaned energy , in 10 years .
A plan to remate America , to make us more secure , and help stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that bads to solve our problems .
Really America . Scoprite more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It &apos;s about readed energy to America .
One of the faster ways of getting to dependence from combustible combustible that killing our planet .
Comparsa : The future is here . I feel , sun , a new network energy .
Comparsa 2 : Number two : New York investimate jobs .
Complplan : Really . It &apos;s time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old old lunch African-African says , &quot; If you want to go fast , go from soles .
If you want to go away , you go back together . &quot;
We need to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I did a introduction on the LHC .
And promised to return to the way to go back to how the machine works .
So , you know , the other time , the other time there was no , the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment we &apos;ve been been doing -- 27 kilometers of circles .
His task is to represent the conditions that were at least one billion a second second from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
This is just ambious .
This is the car under Ginevra .
I &apos;m going to do this little Big Bang in the remarkable Big Bang in the relevers .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- it &apos;s a foot of 22 feet and it has a diameter of 22 feet .
This is a picture of ATLAS in construction so you can see the proportions .
The 10 secember of the last year we put the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was because of immense festee standing in control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first fashion of particles that had done all the LHC , entring in collision , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles in the welator .
In other words , when we see that picture the 10 secember , we realized that the machine worked , which is a great vittory .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to make us more or this , when somebody went on Google and saw that the page was this .
That means that we had a cultural impact on the scientific impact on .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had to these files here -- these files .
These files 13,000 ampamp, when the car works at the master of power .
Now , the techniques between you will look at the files and they &apos;re not true . I &apos;m philes too much . &quot;
And instead of doing it because when they &apos;re very cold become the costs of the costs of the costs .
So , at least 271 degrees , at least 271 degrees of space between stars , these files can bring that current .
In one of the fect between the most of the magnetic magnetic in the LHC , there was a defect of factory .
So the files of the files of the files , and the 13,000 ampampsuddenly met a electronic resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think these magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic .
They &apos;re giving about 50 magnetic magnetic .
We had to take them , what we did .
We reprined them and wells .
They &apos;re going back to their underground .
I &apos;m going to the end of the LHC is going to be new integror .
We &apos;re going to go out , and we expect to get the data to judgment or lue , and we continue so our adventure to find out what the universe is .
Now , of course , in a way , these crashing crashing the dibatch of science and engineering engineering frontier . It &apos;s easy to confuture .
I think that &apos;s so hard , the fact that &apos;s done to go beyond the limits , I think it &apos;s the value of things like the LHC .
I want to end with the words of a scientist Inglad , Humphrey Davy , which , I guess , in defense of experiments of his pupillo , his pupillo , his cleaner was Michael Faray , he said , &quot; Nothing is so dangerous for the progress of the mind of the human mind is definitely dangerous . &quot; There are no mystations in nature , and that doesn &apos;t have a consequent of our own monmonmonitors are not in the world . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start asking for rethinking when you , you play with children , you play with children .
While you understand how to reach them and grab them , and they learn how to figure them out and moving , and they &apos;re actually going to think and solve problems .
The spacectation is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , from informative information that is the useful kind of interaction with physicists , and the collaborator of my Pacacacts , and the collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking , &quot; And if , when we use a computer , instead of the mouse as a computer , instead of having the mouse as a digital pass , we could have put it out on a desktop , we could have a little bit of the hands of the hands of both hands ,
and I &apos;m going to take it to be pleased with it ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , built the Siftool .
In a few words , a Siftip is a big interactive computer like a bisceight .
In a few words , a Siftip is a big interactive computer like a bisceight .
You can move with your hand , they can see them , they can see their own , feel the movement and they have a screen and a wireless radio wireless .
But overwhelming objects , like the morning morning , you can move away .
The Sifest-way way , the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physicists , conscious of the movement , of the other movement , and as they become more physicists , conscious of the movement , of the other movement , of the other things , of how we can move , we can explore new and interaction .
I &apos;m going to try with some simple example .
This Sifest-up . This Sifool , if you cline it in a direction , the video will be going to rotate it , if you &apos;re out of the other htory .
These reactives are aware of the other other .
If I stopped them , they &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re around .
If they &apos;re circumsting it , they see it and they can act a little bit .
If they &apos;re circumsting it , they see it and they can act a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of interaction was the way we can use common gestures , to example , &quot; a color like if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftip configured like to the boss and I can use them to the color color color in the central , where they &apos;re missing .
and I can use them to use it to the color color in the central , where they &apos;re missing .
If we &apos;re too too , we can put a little bit bit .
And I &apos;m also beautiful possibility of learning , like the languages , the mathematics and logic games where people can try to try things quickly , and see the results ts immediately .
Now , I &apos;m --
This is a sequence of Fibonacks that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a game of words that &apos;s half in Scarabeet and Boggle .
Of course , at every turnaked turnal letter -- in every Siftextent , at every Siftool , you &apos;re going to have a letter to case on every Siftool , and while you &apos;re trying to understand him on a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds re-second , and you have a new set of letter and new chance to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the children came in in the Media Lab , I did it in a way that I was trying them and I turned out a video .
They were very pleased .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of appapplied is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
You just say , &quot; You know , &quot; You know what to do .
Here &apos;s other people who try it .
This is our moa little bit youngest bee , there on the right .
It actually wanted to be impllary .
They were just morning , for him .
Now , this is an appliance of a interactive cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool for learning . He &apos;s Felix . He &apos;s Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , solving the Siftip them .
It can put new characters in the scene , solving the Siftip them .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : The sun is sister .
David Merrill : Now he &apos;s got a treatment in the scene .
Video : The arange treatment .
Bobs ! Yes ! Yes !
So , you shelter the Siftool and put them neighborhood can be interacting the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing their story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a story with the open end , and it can decide him how to move .
DM : It &apos;s a story with the open end , and it can decide him how to move .
Video : Vola , gat .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , which is a tool , to crample and experspective music .
It &apos;s a tool , and it &apos;s a tool , to sample and to do music .
The Sifestabove here , the sounds like the basis , the bacteria .
Each one of these four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also put these sounds on a compores to comcompose your pleasement .
And it just just doing it a sound and a sequence . &quot;
These are actually you can control from the vivious , like the revers and the philer .
I &apos;m acacting it to a sound and then cline to reach it .
And then there are general effects as time and volume , that they appliance to the whole sequence .
Let &apos;s look like .
Video : DM : We &apos;re going to start putting a basis in two Siftexture , we put it in a series , we add in a series , we add other basic basic basic .
Now , I &apos;m going to put a line .
Video : DM : Now I &apos;m going to add perception --
Video : And now I &apos;m going to put the philt on the bacteria , so I can control the effect from the vivious .
Video : DM : I can &apos;t reduce the whole sequence to the whole sequence of time from one side or the other .
Video : DM : And now I &apos;m going to add the bottom to the bottom to give more expression .
Video : DM : I can re-re-flight . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to planning it before , but I can suddenly make it more , and it &apos;s a lot of time .
And now , I can smoking the whole sequence of inclining the whole sequence of the left Siftivity .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new interfaces , more more like how they work our brain work .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this path , and some chance that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that &apos;s coming this new generation of objects that we &apos;re going to bring out of digital media , which will bring information in our world .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the now of talking to all of you .
I &apos;m a writer .
I &apos;m going to talk about this is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that .
It &apos;s also love and the bband the bbbbbban .
And I don &apos;t expect that it can change .
But , said this , something particular happened in my life and in my own career , which has led me to report the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is I &apos;ve been recently wrote this book , this biography called &quot; Manegy , Prega , &quot; Ama , &quot; which , diversously , for some reason he came out in the world and became a great sensors , for some reason , and he became a great sensors , willing , and he &apos;s a great kind of feeling , and I &apos;m going to have a great interational , and I &apos;m going
And the result is that everywhere , you &apos;re going to get people like to me as if I was condconducted .
I &apos;m going to -- conducted , conducted !
They &apos;re all concerned to me and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t fear to do better than than you can &apos;t do better than than than they &apos;re doing better ?
You don &apos;t fear to keep writing all life without life that can be able to create a book that can importance to someone ? &quot;
Can you importantly ? &quot;
It &apos;s resure , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember that I remember that I &apos;m 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was an adolescent -- I was a writer .
I would enjoy the same reaction of the fear .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you have to get successful ?
You don &apos;t fear that the ulililights ?
You don &apos;t fear to do this to the whole life without anything that &apos;s ever out and die on a cumb cumb to dry the bocking bow the bow of failed failed with the bow of failure ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I fear all those things .
I &apos;ve always got fear .
And I also fear of many other things that people don &apos;t have to be initiate .
As the algary and other things sweaving .
But as I write what I was thinking about and I asked me about it , and I would ask me about it . Why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logical logical that anybody should expect to be seventually as a work that you &apos;ve been born to do .
But what is so particular in the imposes of creative companies to make us nervous about the mental health health as a way that other caring in a way that other caring don &apos;t they ?
As my father , for example , he was a chemical engineering engineer and I don &apos;t remember one time in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if he was a fear engineer ?
It was never -- that block of engineering John , how does it go ?
It didn &apos;t work so , you know ?
Onestly , chemicals like a group don &apos;t have certainly , in the centuries , the reputation of being alcolized .
We have enough writers , we have enough this reputation , and not just creative writers , but creative of all kinds of things , we have this reputation of being huge instabsenally .
And it &apos;s not the other one that you can see the tristes of the magnifies of creative magnifies that , only in the 20th century , die young and often as they die .
And the ones that you don &apos;t seem to be really disappeared by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before to die , in the last interview said , &quot; Every book book has killed me a little bit more &quot; A extraordinary business of their life .
But we don &apos;t give them to say why we &apos;ve heard these things so long that we &apos;ve heard these things so long that we &apos;re completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering the notion that creativity and suffering are somehow read and that the art , at the end , and the art .
And the question I want to ask to ask all here today is : you agree with this idea ?
It &apos;s good for that -- because it &apos;s also looking at the way of a distance to me not good for anything about this supposition .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous and I don &apos;t want to see the perpepepeoples in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better encourage our big creative creative minds .
And certainly I know that , in my case -- in my case -- in my situation -- it &apos;s going to be very dangerous to the surrounding , overed the circumstances where I &apos;m in my career .
That &apos;s -- you look , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m a young , I &apos;ve been about 40 years .
I &apos;ve got about four work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything else &apos;s writing in now , and it &apos;s going to be judged after the seventing success of my last book .
I &apos;m going to be slavor , because we &apos;re all more or less friends here -- it &apos;s likely that my biggest success is to my own own own own .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start blow in the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would keep going to keep doing this work that we love .
So , the question is , how do it ?
And so it looks like , after many thinking , that the way to work to continue to write is what to create a protective construct construct of psychological construct , right ?
I have to somehow to find a security between me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural natural advanced on what I &apos;m going to do is actually going to try to look through the time , trying to find other societies of time , trying to find other societies and more societies and more and more societies and more and more and more and the most most ideas and the natural ideas and the natural natural ideas and most of the natural ideas and the natural natural advancing of which I &apos;m going to see
how to help people use people to manage the emotions of creativity .
And that research took me to the ancient Great and ancient Rome .
I &apos;m going to do it because I &apos;m going to go back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity creativity came from from men , OK ?
And it was thinking that creativity was this spirit looks like , and that sell them to men from a few distant and unknown , for reasons and unknown , for reasons and unknown .
The grew us called these spirits divini looks like creativity .
Socrratic , he believed to have a demon that elargive sent wisdom from far .
Romani were the same idea , but they called the kind of spirit without a genius .
The Romani is great , because the Romani didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a smart particularly intelligent .
They thought a genius was this kind of divine entity that was created in the walls of a dealing , a little bit like the elevent of the study of a defairly bit as the elected as a constitude of the work and to model the outcome of that work .
Here &apos;s eastly -- here &apos;s the distance of what I talk about -- that &apos;s the distance that you protect the results of your work .
And everybody knew it was so that it worked , right ?
So , the antichi antic artists were protected from certain things , like , for example , the too narcism , isn &apos;t ?
If your work was exceptional work , you couldn &apos;t take it , and all the mermerished , they all knew that genius were helped by this genius .
If your failed work , it was not all your own failed , right ?
Everyone knew that was your genius to be a unable .
And so people like , han concept of creativity in the West for a long time .
Then the Rince came and everything goes to change , and they &apos;re going to go to the center of the universe above the universe above and the mysters and no longer to leave space to the creatures that they write out of the divinity .
This was the principle of humanism and people started thinking about the creative principle and people started thinking that creativity came out of the hydivide .
And for the first time in the story , you start to reference this artist or that artist as a kind of genius , rather than a person with the genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big error .
I think that allow someone , a simple person to believe that they &apos;re like a recipient , the essence and the sisters of the source and the sisters of divini divins , creative , unknown and ethernical and ethernical is a phililent , to be a very big person to give fragile pties , and the way to give you a lot of human pocket of human human .
It &apos;s how to ask someone to injury the sun .
It &apos;s details completely the ego and creates all these ingessent expectations on performance .
And I think it was the pressure of the artists in the passed 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think that is , the question is , and now ?
Can we do it diversity ?
And , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , &quot; Maybe a little bit of human relationship .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can &apos;t take 500 years of thought in a talk of 18 minutes .
And it &apos;s probably people in the audience that would be connected to the scientific notion of the notion of , insusum , you do that people are being being being being being being on their own projects .
It &apos;s probably not going to convince you all about this .
But the question I want to ask is -- why not ?
Why don &apos;t you think about this way ?
Because it has more sense of anything else that has ever heard to explain the exact imprevedibility of the creation of the creation process .
One process that , as anybody ever attempt to do something -- so , basically , all here -- you know , you don &apos;t comfortable .
And , in fact , it can sometimes seem to be completely paranorful .
I did this inherently with the extraordinary poeet Ruth Stone , who has been 90 years , but it was a little bit for all life and said that during the Virginia , he was working in the Virginia , he was working in the camps , and he felt it , in the camps , and he felt it , in the landscape .
He said he was like a frageous crash .
And it was rotating up to her landscape .
He was able to come , because he was tremendous land under his feet .
He knew to have one thing to do to that point and he was , words , &quot; Shorders , &quot; we &apos;re going to go like a match . &quot;
And he &apos;s going to home and it was followed by this poem , and he would not have to take a piece of paper and a math , pretty quickly , as the trapart , and it &apos;s got it , collecting it , and it &apos;s the page .
Sometimes , you could couldn &apos;t be fast , so correcal and correcal correcent , and the rroled poem and the poetry and the poem would continued to rotate through the landscape , trying to , like she said , &quot; another poet . &quot;
Then there were those times -- this piece I &apos;m not going to be -- there was a moments where the was almost losing , right ?
So , he was running home and he was trying to be looking for paper and the poetry through , and he was a matched in the while he was going , and then he said , that it was like , if you were halled with the other hand and the office .
And it was the poem from the coda and the repair in his body and transmitted on the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page and intatta , but at the end , the last word at the first word at the first word .
So when I felt it -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly equal to my creative process .
Not all my creation process -- they &apos;re not a conducucucucucture .
I &apos;m a mule , and my way to work is ; I wake up at the same orar every day and to go and go and go up and go over and go and passing it .
But even I &apos;m in my aggin , I strike up against that , sometimes .
And I guess , I also think many of you the han .
You know , even though the work and ideas came to me from a certain source of source , I could not honestly know it .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it in a way to not get your head , but rather , what &apos;s going to do is rerevenue to us ?
For how I think about , the best example of the same time I have is the musician Tom Waits , which I &apos;ve interviewed years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life was the incarnation of the artist of the art art of the same ruled , and we &apos;re looking for management , and we &apos;re all sorts of impulses .
But then I &apos;m going to inveck , and he was driving on a day , he was driving up to a Los Angeles , he changed everything for him .
He was going fast and the whole whole little bit of a sudden this little framework of melodia , which comes in his head as a inspiration , and the wants , to know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the desider , but the desider , but the desider , but it doesn &apos;t know how to take it .
It has no piece of paper , it has no match , it &apos;s not a recorder .
So it starts to feel this kind of old old ansia is growing in him , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to go up with this song even ements .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to go to the panic , they stop .
I &apos;m going to put the whole whole whole whole whole new process .
He just just looked at the sky and he said , &quot; I &apos;m not going to see that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Would it like that can write a song now ?
If you really want to exist , you &apos;re going to get care of you .
Altrain , you &apos;re going to importantly to someone else today .
You can disturbing Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his work process changed after this .
Not the work , the work was still dark .
But the process , and the fish of anxiety that was reduced when the genius , the genius that came out of him , and it was going to go out . And it came back to the other problems and freezing it back where it was , and it was going to be a interiorized and tory .
But yes this peculiar , wonderful bizarre , wonderful bizarre , and this strange thing straight in Tom and this strange and the straight that didn &apos;t have Tom .
So how the story that I was working in the way I was working in the way I was working and already saved me once .
This idea , I &apos;ll save when I was writing &quot; Many , Prega , and fell in a cave of those cave of the disperation where we &apos;re all working on something and we &apos;re working on something and we can &apos;t see that it &apos;s going to be a disaster , which is the worst book .
Not just good , the worst book wrote .
And I started thinking about to think of this project .
But then I remember of Tom I talked about the air and tried .
So I got my face on the manoscritical manoscriticized and diress my comments to a room of the room .
And I said to high vices , &quot; Sents , what we know that if this book is not going to be brilliant , you know that if this book is not going to be interestingly cold , no ?
Because I &apos;m seeing here I &apos;m putting all I have , I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want to be better , you have to present and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know , I don &apos;t do it .
I &apos;m going to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I would like to do my part of the record I was presented to do my part . &quot; Because the end is so , OK -- the centuries of North Africa , people were dance to the closest dance of moon , and the music that went on for hours and the alba and the music that went on for hours and the alba .
And they were always magnifigures , because the ballerers were fantastic and they were fantastic .
But every time , he was a bit , something happened , and one of these artists became actually transcending .
And I know what I &apos;m talking about what I know , because I know that you &apos;ve all seen , at a point , a performance .
It was like the time , it was like the time , and the ballerin a kind of portal and he was not doing anything different from the usual , like 1,000 notes before , but it was all the way , but it was all the way to come .
And suddenly , you know , it &apos;s just like a human .
But it &apos;s going to go out and under lighting in the fire of divinity .
And when this happened , the people knew what was , people knew what it was , they called him .
They were going to be a hands , and they started to sing , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , God , &quot; God , God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Crious notice historic -- when the Morinvaser the south of Spagna , I was a habitude with them and the ready to change in the centuries . &quot; Allah , Allah , &quot; I &apos;m a &quot; Ole , &quot; which you can still feel in the corries or the flamenco .
In Saina , when a artist did something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , I hathetic , I &apos;m a great thing , branch , &quot; uncomcomcomfortable , &quot; uncomfortable , and this is -- a last last of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But the problem comes the day after the ballerin the same , when you wake up and find that are the 11 of the morning of Martedday morning and the last one of God &apos;s not there .
It &apos;s just a dead , so that &apos;s a lot of bad ginocac , and maybe it &apos;s not going to be able to each other .
And maybe nobody will be the name of God &apos;s name of God &apos;s still while , and what is to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most pececting rerereconciliations to do in a creative life .
But maybe it &apos;s not to be so angosciating if you can &apos;t believe , advanced , that the most extraordinary aspects of your being being being from you .
But just credest you &apos;re just just just a little bit of a source of a source of one of this team of your life that &apos;s life you have to go to someone else when you finish it .
And , you know , if we think about this way it changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s certainly like I thought about a different months during the working book that I was working in the working book book that I &apos;m going to do , dangerous , and I was the dangerous , and it &apos;s been done .
And what I &apos;m going to continue to tell me when I feel electrized this is , not going to have fear .
Don &apos;t last you . It &apos;s just your work .
Continua present-arts for your side , any one can be .
If your work is balling , balling .
If the divine , they &apos;re genius to give you some kind of wonderful decide to leave some kind of wonderful , for a only moment through your effort , then &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Altrain , you do the same dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot; You know the same .
I think it &apos;s got to teach it .
&quot; Ole ! &quot; to you know , even for having a human love and testables to be a tal testables to show you continuously ,
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As I &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects on the human genome , on what can mean to do is to the new set of gengenes .
Now we &apos;re starting a new perspective : we started digitize biology and now start out of that digital code we &apos;re going to be moving in a new fase of biology , designing and synthesizing life .
We &apos;ve always tried to ask big questions .
&quot; What is the life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists , I think they &apos;ve been trying to understand how many levels .
We tried it different approaches , reduce the minimi terms .
We &apos;re digitizing about 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the analog of biology in the digital world .
Now , we ask : Can we regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from genome genome that can authoreplicate in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit more .
We can eliminate a hundred genes of genes that are here .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple respect our .
Credeaths , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it &apos;s very unlikely to do that this can bring to a living cell cell .
So we decided that the only way to designing to re-saying this cromosome cromes in a way that we could actually change the components to ask some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of the &quot; We can synthesize a cromosome ? &quot;
Can we have the chemistry to produce these big molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create before ?
And , in case , we can actually make a cromosome ?
A cromosome is just a piece of chemical material .
The speed with which we can digitize life is growing up to exponential .
Our ability to write gene code , instead , designing , rather slowly , and it &apos;s better .
And our most recent results the results of the results .
We started 15 years ago .
The process has required , starting with a bioethics before we started a bioethics before we started the first experiments .
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult .
There are thousands of cars in the world that produced little segments in the world that produced little segment , the width of 30 to 50 letters , the longer , the most errors are .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments and correct the errors .
And this was our first attempt , starting from digital information about the genome of Phi X174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed frammments , we &apos;ve been designed the retion correction of the errors and got a DNA molecule of DNA molecule .
The interesting part of the interesting part of chemical material inherite chemical material , and we put it in bacteria , and they started reading this genetic code and make it viral particles .
The viral particles then they &apos;re reminded by cells , they &apos;re back and destroy the E.
I talked about recent with the members of the oil industry , and they certainly started this model .
They have more than you have revenue .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build its own hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things more in the big .
We wanted to build the whole cromosome cromes .
I &apos;m about 580 mile letter code .
So we thought of construct it in the size of the viruses , so that we can change the cassette casses to understand what the components of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard accurate was a mixes of every 10 mies .
We found it , resequenced , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence never would be able to do it work .
One part of the process is designing slow-to-50 letters that you overwhelming all the other segments of 50 to make smaller submit to build smaller submit that work together .
Let &apos;s take elements together here .
You &apos;ve probably read that we put in the fire .
Think about it , we have a gene code on four letters : A , C , Gs and T.
Three of those letters together code , and they &apos;re about 20 amminoacids , and there &apos;s a specific order to letter to letter every amamminds .
So we can use the gene code to write , frash , thoughts .
What we did at the beginning was authograin it .
Some of them have been dolphin the fact that it wasn &apos;t .
We designed these segments to do for potential them just emphantom .
There &apos;s a enzyme that are reparate and they put them together .
And we started assembling parts , starting with the parts , starting with five to seven mile letters , and unendles in a way to form of 24 mies to put them out to 72 , letter to the letters to 72 , moons , and we put them to 72 .
So , we made these segments that &apos;s abundance , so that we could sequence it because we &apos;re trying to create a very good process .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So this looks like the tabellon a player of basket .
When we get these segments very long , the more than 100 mystery , the more than 100 meters , they &apos;re not going to grow more directly in the E.
You get to the limit of the tools of molecular biology .
So we looked at some other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called reverse homologist , which in biology , which is used to repect the DNA to be able to unting the DNA segments .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinoccurred Deinoccurred , it can absorsorb three million radiation .
You can see in the upper riquader as his chromosome is destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours comes back exactly exactly how before it was before .
There &apos;s thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be completely completely .
They can live under the vacuum .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life exist in space , and you feel to find new environments of water .
In fact , NASA showed that this is going to be able .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built using these proceed , just using the lievated design of segments that we &apos;ve been built segments to put it .
The lieventually assembla .
This picture was not taken with a microscope microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It &apos;s a molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that coprint a period of time .
This is the publization that we did a little time ago .
I &apos;m about 580,000 letters .
It &apos;s the biggest molecule of a structure ever created by man .
It &apos;s a weak molecular weight .
If we &apos;re pass it with a career , we &apos;d like 142 page only to transmate this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ? How can we activtivate it ? How can we accomplished it ?
Of course , you know , you take a game of kids .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria .
It &apos;s easier to do when it &apos;s eucarian cells like our : you can just get nuclear nuclear and put another one , which is basically the process of clonation .
In the archaea chromosome is instead of integrated inside the cell , but we &apos;ve recently recently demonstrated that we can do a complete trapion a cell to another and of activate it .
We can refed a cromosome from a micbial cromosome .
The two are different than men from rice .
We add some gene in a way that we can decide what to choose for cromosome .
And then the four-button with the enzyme , so to kill all the protein .
And when we put it in the cell , the cell was raped -- and you open our soft graph -- the new cromosome is -- the new cromosome is gone inside the cell .
And we started thinking that we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried it anywhere .
This is one of the majority of evolution .
We found that tantissim species have added a second or a third cromosome from some part , add in a second thousands of trouble of new trails .
So who thinks about evolution as a gene only as a gene of biology .
There &apos;s a enzyme called &quot; From a re-remarkable restrition that they actually actually digit out DNA .
The cromosome that was in the cell doesn &apos;t have one .
The mobile phone phone -- the chromosome that we put it .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other cromosome as a material extraneum , and we were refined with the cell and the new cromosome .
It became blue because of the genes that we put it .
And in a short short plasm , all the characteristics of a species are gone , and it turned out of the whole new species , based on the new software that we put in the cell cell .
All the protein are changed , the memories are changed , and when we read the genetic code exactly what we &apos;ve moved to .
Now , this might seem like genetics , but it &apos;s going to look at the DNA things that &apos;s pretty substantial .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that here is not about genesesesesesestimate from three million years and a half years of evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion where we &apos;re going to create new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty obvious when we think about our necessity .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion and a half billion people at the next 40 years .
Right to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now , there are three people on the planet for each one exist in 1946 years , there &apos;s four years , there are four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medical medical , wellin six billion and a half billion people .
It &apos;s going to be more daily to do for nine .
We use more than five billion fuel baroid , more than 30 billion barbaroid .
That means 100 million barables a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process of repairs them , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
We need to keep all of CO2 emission from these materials that finished in the atmosphere .
At the day of today , because of the scientific discovery of the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the components of the future .
The electronic industry has only a dozen about components , and think about how many different things came out .
Our limits limits here is data data in the biological reality and from our imagination .
Now we have some techniques , because of these synthesizer methods , able to create what we call genomics combinatory .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million cromosomes a million cromosomes a day .
Think about 20 million genes of different genes or try to optimize the process to produce their doctor or drugs , new vaccines , we can change , we can change , we can change , we can change , and create more biology that in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemical production or fuel , chemical vaccines , production of ethc vaccines .
This is an instantaneous of some software programming where we &apos;re working to be able to seat and design species at the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t necessarily know how they &apos;re going to be .
We know exactly what their gene code is their genetic code .
Now we &apos;re focusing on the fuel coal of generation .
You also saw it out of the grain of the gram was a final experiment .
We have depenpend on the generation and third generation that will use enough to be on the sugar of the higher value as the doctor or different butanol .
But the only way biology can have a great impact without increasing the cost of food and limlimestablished the cost of food and limlimestablished the CO2 in matter before , we &apos;re working for cells that can reach this goal , and we think we can have the first coal-fourth generation in about 18 months months .
The solar light combined the CO2 is a metodot -- but in our discovery in the world , we found different metods .
This is a organism that we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
It &apos;s going to be 2,500 feet deeply depth to the temperature of the water .
It &apos;s using molecular use of CO2 using molecular use as a source of energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand whether we can incanaling CO2 , which can easily be transported by your bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
So , the short thing we might think that we could be able to increase what the question of the basic question of what life is is &quot; We , versus the goal of the oil industry .
ExExcept . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can you do ?
It would be a major source source source of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working for using the same methods to create instantanetic vaccines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with flu , we &apos;re always back of a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s about to find the right vaccine .
I think that &apos;s going to change constructing combinable in anticipe .
So , here &apos;s how the future could start seeming , now , the tree of evolution , accell-evolution with synthetical bacteria , arches , arches , and inquitous cells .
We &apos;re so so that we &apos;re going to improve people .
Our goal is to do in a way of living enough to try to make it . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the faster , some fundamental work , the new technology that we took to the Microsoft in follow , as a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s a environment where you can interact is local level that remodity is that remoon with a huge amount of data data .
Here we &apos;re seeing many digital pictures of digital pictures of digital photos with a kind of digital zoom and continuous , for a fast panoramic , despite images like .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these data are collected with data or images .
Most of the digital photographs , but this for example is a provenient scanning from the Biary of Congress , and it comes in in the gamma of 300 megamma .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that limits the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen at any time . It &apos;s also a very flexel architecture .
This is a book book . It &apos;s a whole book ,
This is the Casa desolate of Dickens . Every colonna represents a chapter .
To show you that &apos;s just a text of the way of images , we can do something like that , to see that &apos;s a real representation of the textbook , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a little bit artificial book .
You don &apos;t give it .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s a number of The Guardian .
Every picture of a check .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading the real version of a view of a meal or a daily kind of a half of a daily kind of a half of a half of a half .
We also did something with the corner of this number in particular number of The Guardian .
We created a public advertising advertising -- much higher than what you use in a normal publishing content -- and we put it in a normal content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that means to put people in the people , and to other porcheries like , I didn &apos;t have to be necessary .
Of course , maps is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don &apos;t want to lose time , if you don &apos;t say we have to contribute you to give them in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States , the geospacy picture of NASA .
So now we &apos;re going to move something else .
This is actually from the websy on the web ; you can go and see it .
This is a project called Photosynth , which fighting two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research that we &apos;ve been a very interesting thing that Noah Snavely , a student of Washington , with the help of Steve Seitz Seitz &apos;s Microsoft Rick Szelki Microsoft Rick Szelki .
And it &apos;s from the webssy , I &apos;m going to be a websy .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from a picture of the other image and have this kind of experience of experience to re-resolution .
But the space spacectively images here has actually a meaning .
The algorithms of visualization , they &apos;ve been recorded these pictures together , so that correspond to the re-places where the imagination -- all the next to the Montagne Rocciose dog -- they &apos;re taken .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original set of Noah--- and this is a previous prototosynth that we &apos;ve done work for the first time the summer -- to show you what I think about is really the key to show you what I think is really the key to the key to the environments that we &apos;re really going to do in the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of the Cacacactedge of Nobody Dame images from Flickr . Badigit . Badigit &apos;s NoDDamickr in Flickr , and you get images of these kinds of wireless . And so on . Ognce one of these conconcones a picture that &apos;s discovery .
So , they &apos;re all pictures from Flickr and they &apos;re all spacecting to this way .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this very simple way .
You know , I would never thought of finishing work for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratificating the kind of accounting here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different kinds of photocaming : from those cell cell phone to those professional SLR , a significant number , and a significant number of these things that &apos;s environment .
And if I can try and try to try and look at the more strip .
Many of them are faces .
Somewhere you &apos;re a series of photographs -- eccole .
This is a Nobody poster Drecorded correctly .
We can go from the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with the environment . This is taking data from the whole memory , of the whole collective memory of the collective memory of the visual view -- and connected all of those data together .
All those pictures become connected together , the largest part of the parts .
You have a model of the whole land that emerge .
Think about this as the prolungation of Stephen Lawler on Earth &apos;s work on the virtual Earth .
It &apos;s something that &apos;s growing up in complexity as people use it , and the whose advantages to be worth of using it .
Their pictures are marked with meaded aded by other people .
If you &apos;re the idea of contrast all these smilk , the name of the name of the cattattedge of Nobody DDememame . You &apos;re going to be reverse to the space , and I can use the point to immersed in that space , in that metaphor to the space , and I can use the picture of anybody else , and have a social experience of the kind of cross-moon cross-mo-st-like .
Of course , a consequence of all that are virtual models of all the interesting , the way of the land , collecting search , not just as as an airplane and satellite images , but from the collective memory .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I understood ? What your software is going to be able to do is that at a point , in the next years , all the photographs , all the photographs are we going to do is basically connected with anybody in the world &apos;s world &apos;s going to be basically connected together ?
BAA : Yes . What is doing is actually doing is to find .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , you know , in pictures .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about requires of seant information that many of these images have been able .
As you do a research research of the web , you digit a sentence and the text on the Web page of the images .
Now , what happens if that picture is that picture is connecting to all your pictures ?
So the amount of seant interconnection and the amount of reconnection , and the amount of re-fairly . It &apos;s a classic effect of network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the pleasant of the pleasant of the delician of the research of the ethnogical research is the way to live between who have no forgotten the old hotter , and the hits the past in the wind , and the fleaving in the wind , and the fleaving in the wind , and the fleaving in the plants .
Well , the idea that the sciamani Jaguar travel , and the idea that the Himalayas , which the old old old Inuit &apos;s still colorful . And the mystical subject , the distinced budgets still the pire of the Dharer , but to remember the central central central of anthropology , and the idea that the world that we have no solute solute model , but it &apos;s just a model of reality , but it &apos;s just a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stirpe has done , well or bad , many generations ago .
And of course , we all share of the essential trails .
We all all of the procreation .
We &apos;re very initiation .
We need to deal with death of death , so we don &apos;t surprising if we &apos;re blealing and we &apos;re looking at --
We all have an art .
What it &apos;s the roll of song , the race of the song , the ritmo of the dance of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that the Penan of Borneo &apos;s forests , or the follow of the Voodoo &apos;s Rederriers , or the guerriers of the Children &apos;s Rededge in Kenya , or a camel in Kenya , or a cammelliers in the heart of Sahara .
He was my journey of journey in the desert a month ago , or a yak hallelator in Qomolangma , Everest , the dea mother of the world .
All these populations teach us that there are other ways of thinking about other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And if you think a moment , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
Inside-the-the-cultures of cultures the world create a spiritual life and cultural life that fly the planet and it &apos;s important for the well-being of the planet , so as the biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural race as a kind of ethnososphere and you can call the total sense of all the concepts of all concepts , units , inspiration , ideas , inspiration , very inspiration , from the human imagination of consciousness .
The ethnosphere is the great parimonium of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be as a kind of inquisitive species .
And because biosphere was very , as a very , as a very successful bit as a succeed on the ethnosh and too much more quickly .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all the species was or is about the ord of the summit &apos;s just because it &apos;s fense , or -- in the most apocalyptic diversity -- and you don &apos;t even get a little bit of biological diversity -- and you don &apos;t even get it very mystic -- that &apos;s the most optimistic diversity -- that &apos;s the most optional diversity .
The one of this is , obviously , the loss of course .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not just compost just by a vocabolary or a series of grammical rules .
One language is the spraking of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle of the way of all the culture comes in the world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a kosystem , a thought , a thought , a spiritual chance .
And of those 6,000 languages , while we &apos;re sitting here in Monterey , at least half half the people are not being being being being in the ears of children .
They &apos;re not teaching children , the which means , less that you don &apos;t know , less you know , they &apos;re death .
What &apos;s more tristes of being the amount of silence , to be the last last to talk a language , of the last last to talk about a language , of the children &apos;s children ?
This is a few weeks of the world &apos;s been a few of the world of every two weeks : every two weeks , every year , a old language and leads to her last last silver language .
And I know someone of you will say , &quot; Is it better like this ?
The world would not have a better place if we &apos;re all the same language ? &quot; Benisite , then we &apos;re all yoruba . We &apos;re talking about yoruba .
We talk about kogi .
You &apos;re going to see a trailer what it means you can &apos;t talk to their language .
I &apos;d like to do a journey through the etnosphere --
a little journey in the ethnososphere to give you a abay of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I say &quot; different ways of existing exist . &quot; I mean different ways of existing .
Let &apos;s take for example this bimbo Barasana , in Amazon Sinentrional section , the people of anaconda , which creates the midance of the latest shoulder in the panish panish of the hibits of grand .
It &apos;s a people who &apos;s not able to distinguish the blue blue blue out because the celine birth is identified in the time of the forest , where you depends the people who are going to think about the people .
They have a kind of kind of weird , called &quot; exogamn &quot; analyze &quot; exogram &quot; : You need to be sposing a person who &apos;s talking a different language .
And all this has been roots in the past mythological , but the particularly the households that are in these families where you &apos;re talking about six or seven languages because of the mythical matters .
They &apos;re just listening and then start talking about .
Let &apos;s take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived , the Waorani of Ecuadnordan , a incredible popular people that had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionary missionary have been trying to a kind of error .
They did go out of the top of the photographs that they were reretrails , forget that this people who were going to be the people who &apos;s forest that the forest forest forest forest that they had never seen anything about the size of the size .
They &apos;ve been collected the pictures , they &apos;ve been taken the research of a figure and , not find anything , they have conclused that it was treated , and they killed the five missionary missionary with the lance .
But the Waorani don &apos;t kill the strange of the strange .
They killed between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by their same .
We &apos;re eight of eight generations and we found two natural death cases and we &apos;ve insisted to know , they admit that one of them was invest , and they killed it . And then they killed it . And then they killed it . And then they killed it itself .
The cactors were able to recognize the animal urine 40 pass and recognize it .
In the first &apos; 80 , I was assigned a really interesting task when my professor of Harvard , asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti in the basic secret of the power of Duvalier and Tonton Man outes , and the Tonton Man outes , and the Tonton Man outes .
To give sense a sense of the miraculous , I should have to understand Vodn culture and the Voodoo is not magic .
It &apos;s pretty a complex vision of the world .
Very interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the big religion of the world , what would you say to me ?
Cristianth-up , Islam , Buddhism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has no religious faith . And instead , and the Voodoo is not other than the distilled of these religious concepts of religious gengenous source of nated gency .
What makes it interesting is the intense relationship between life and death .
So the vives they &apos;re doing the spirits .
The spirits can be invocated by the Great Actually , they respond to the race of the dance and replace time replace to the animate animation of the vive in a short short short active , the following becomes the god .
So , for this voodooists like to say , &quot; You &apos;re white who go to church to talk about God .
We give the theme and we become God . &quot;
And since you &apos;re posing , is the spirit that &apos;s spirit you , how can you do it ?
So you see these incredible events : following voodoo in state of trance that touch impunishes , unfuels that touch impunishes a rather strong demonstration of the body when it &apos;s catalyzed in a state of extremendous excitation .
I &apos;m all the people with which I &apos;ve lived the most extraordinary people are Kogi Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta . Santa Marta , in the Colombia .
And they have to the ancient civilization that once they lived on the charge of the charge of the Colombia in the charge , the people were retreated to the volcanic massy , the people were retreated on the volcanic massment .
In a continent of blood , this people have been conquised by the spage-to-spage-to-spage-to-shelter continent .
But it &apos;s been government by a clam , but they have their formation is very extraordinary .
The young following housesel from the families , and they live secret in a good world and buium in a good world and hit in the basis of the glaciers for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years choose about reproduce the nine months of gestation that translated in the mother of the mother , now are are metaphor in the Grands Mather .
For all this time , they &apos;re accultured to the values of their society , values that previous that they &apos;re seeing their prayers and just their prayers , they &apos;re better than the equilibrium -- or to say the ecological balance .
And the term of this incredible initiation , they &apos;re suddenly brought out and for the first time to life , at the age of 18 years , see an algrade . And that &apos;s the same bulb , when the sun kils the beautiful valli , and the sun the mooth of beautiful landscape , and he says , &quot; The prince is all that they &apos;ve learned in the theory .
&quot; Vison ? Proprid as I said .
It &apos;s amazing . Now it &apos;s now to you protect it . &quot;
They call the majority and say that we , brothers , minors are the evolves of the destruction of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about indigenous populations and the environment we call Rousseau and the old history of the selvacuum history , which is a concrazes in its simplicity or maybe invoding Thoreau and maybe invoid Thoreau , and we say that these people are closer to the Earth of us .
The Indies are not not the untimental sentimental people are not weak out of nostaly .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the malarian Asmat or in the Asmat the ice ice , but because of the time and the rhyththththanks , they created a mystic mystic of the Earth &apos;s concept of an extremely consciously , but on an intuition of the concept that Earth can live only because it &apos;s ununtexture .
What does that mean ?
It &apos;s saying that a kid of Ande who &apos;s going to grow up with the mountain is an Apu spirit that will be a depor the way that &apos;s a deeply different , and it &apos;s going to have a very different relationship with the mountain or that place a boy of Montana who &apos;s a massive , and the massive rocks is a ament of rocks to be scavate .
which is the dimora of one spirit or a little bit of a little bit of it .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that define the relationship between individuals and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia Britannica creating that forests that they were going to be cut .
And that &apos;s a human being different from my friends Kwawaucucl who believe that the forests are the dimora of Hukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukuk-initiation , and the bal byours .
If you start to consider that these cultures can create reality , you can start to understand some of them feeling .
I took this picture to open this picture to open Amazon the Western Amazon .
Maybe some of you &apos;ve heard about the ayahuask , the most powerful substance psychoactive repertoire .
What makes it fascinating for the ayahuasks is not the potential of the substance , but his elaboration . It &apos;s compost .
On one side , this lian lessly , the leaning liana , harmful and hardly harmful , hardly , slightly hallucinogene .
And by trying to the only plant you have a smoke that alter a little bit of consciousness , but it &apos;s mixed with the leaving of the family coffee Psychoption .
This plant contains powerful powerful , very similar to seriotonin , very similar to the seriotonin , dimethyptamine .
If you &apos;ve ever see the Yanamammed , you &apos;ll see the Yanammit , they &apos;re doing from a different set of species , it &apos;s a methyptamine .
Tiring that dust for birth is a little bit like being gone . It &apos;s a little bit like to be shot of barking , and you can land on a sea of electricity . &#91; Risry &#93; Don &apos;t believe a distortion of reality ; it makes the solution .
I often got to my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , Richard Evan Shultes , with his fungi discovered the hallucinogens , with his finishy discovery of the &apos; 30s in Mexico .
Second my tesesesesesesesesesesesesesesesesh because if you &apos;re done , you know , you know , you know , you can &apos;t tell no one of being hallucined . And you can &apos;t be abunte to be abunte to a , but they &apos;re obviously in the intestine , because if you &apos;re done by a sense that , of course in the intestababunte ,
It &apos;s possible to be absensus just if they abunte with other chemicals that denian MAO .
Now it &apos;s the beautiful beat : the moal-co-co-the-in-injjjitor , the same kind of need to be able to be able to be the triptamine . The question is expensive . The question is spontaneous , in a fer of 80,000 species of plants , like these people are doing these people who are are doing this , but if you &apos;re combined in this way ?
We use the great eufemale evidence , which can be infruted by the error , that can reveal infruted .
But if we ask the Indians , they &apos;ll tell us &quot; The plants talk about it . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuasks , which distinguishing neply in the forest , and that &apos;s the eyes would come in the same species .
If we ask them how they stopped their tasses will say &quot; &quot; I thought of the hahead of plants , the rest of the rest of the rest of it ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : they &apos;re taking 17 variety in a night of moon the four-band each other will be a different tone .
With this doesn &apos;t graduate Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than to count stami .
Now , &#91; applauser &#93; the problem is that also the ones of us that have a heart people who have a little bit of the indigenous people are pushed to the margins of history than our real world , and it &apos;s passing .
In fact , the 20th century , in the 111th century , it &apos;s going to remember their own technological innovations , but rather like the one was where we stopped and enabled actively , and we used it and passive accepted actively , the problem is not the problem .
All cultures have been involved in a dance for new chance of life .
And the problem is not technology .
Indians Sioux , they don &apos;t stop being Sioux when they put out of arco and frecovered as Americans have no stop being Americans when they put out of horse and calated .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that mindset of ethnosh . It &apos;s the power .
The hard hard to do the domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you &apos;ll find that these are not destined to disappear .
They &apos;re living creatures and dynamics are out of the existence from the existence of identificabove their adaptment .
It &apos;s a disbosyssamp in the Penan --
a nomads of Sarawak , in the West East , a people who lived in the forest to a generation of course , and now reduction to a generation ago , and now reduction on the ries of the river , where you can see the river river &apos;s river , where you can see the river from the lim that looks like the Bornee Cinese , where the naasional Mar Cnian Cnian Ethananthesis , where the hor the horizes the horizes of the horizan , and the horizernnest , and the waving that &apos;s going to the horizes of the River &apos;s the Samong
You &apos;re ready to repire the bulk with the bags of the forest .
Or the Yanomami , are the disease that have come with the world .
If we put on the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the hard hard hard to see the political domination .
As you know the genocide , the exections of a people , is a constantly addressed at the level , but the destruction of the style of life of a people , not only is conducted , but it &apos;s a celebrate , but I also celebrate in certain certain ambers , because it &apos;s part of the development .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of Tibet until you go from the beginning .
I &apos;ve been spent 6,000 miles from Chengdu in China Western China through Tibet , coming to Lhasa with a young connected , but only came to Lhasa with a young connected , but only came to Lhasa with a young , and I realized what behind the statistics we feel about .
6,000 monuments sacrice reduced in the dust and centers .
1.2 million people killed from the military Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascrited at Panchen Lama .
The one means that it was killed at the time of Chinese invasion .
Human uncle , in the Santity of the diaspora who led the people in Nepal .
Her mother was imprisoned and her her her hits was rich .
It was led to birth of birth to the age of two years hidden birth , because he couldn &apos;t live without him .
The sister , which did the same , it was a mess in education .
One day he had a little bit calculated a fashion a fashion , for this transgrsion , was a mess of Mao and , for this transgrsion , was a little bit of sat for seven years .
The pain of the Tibet can be insopportrait , but the spirit of the people is from tener .
And it turns out , it &apos;s all reduce to a choice .
We want to live in the world monotic world or we want to get the world policy of diversity ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before we die said that his biggest fear was that , in our way to go to this amorage of the world , we don &apos;t just see the whole gamma of human imagination , but a day of thought , but a day we &apos;re going to wake up a day , we &apos;ll send send a sleep of thinking about the world ,
And it &apos;s equipment that our species is exist for 600,000 years .
The Neolitica Revolution , which has given us us agriculture , which has done us to be seed , and replace to replace the poetry of the shaming of the skaman with the prosclero , creating the archy of specialization , and we &apos;re talking about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world has been 300 years old .
That &apos;s what &apos;s story is not suggests me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we &apos;re going to deal with the military to come to come .
When these miriades of cultures the world is asked what they want to say to be human , they respond with 10,000 different vices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all refer the chance of being what we &apos;re : a kind of conscious species , that has to be able species , that &apos;s where all the people can fire . And there are great moments of optimism .
I took this picture on the north of Baffin , when I went to core the whales of whales with the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and I was told the wonderful story of her grandfather .
The government has no always been gentile with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to stabilize our supremate , we have them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refused to go .
The family , I &apos;m going to take his life , and he took them all the weapons , and all its equal .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t feel the cold , they do it .
The paintings of the slitte of the slitte of weight in the coat .
The grandfather of this man didn &apos;t put out of the night or the bbylizard that was suffering .
It &apos;s been disgacked , it &apos;s calculated the pantalons in the peat and defected in their hand . When the did it . When the did it . And when I did it create a mom .
He &apos;s got a salive on the punch of this choll column and when I became solido , he killed a dog .
He shelter the dog and created a bridaughter , with the lower clog , he has a slitter , he has a swarded on the banking , and it &apos;s disappeared on the banking , and it &apos;s disappeared on the banking of the bbband it &apos;s a bone of the dog , and he &apos;s a band he &apos;s been a bright .
We want to talk about horse with nothing ? &#91; Ris&#93; And this , in different ways , &#91; Applausi &#93; is the symbol of the resilience of the people in the world .
In the aprile 1999 , the government has reduced to Inuit &apos;s control of an area of territory control of an area of the largest California and Texas a Texas med and Texas .
It &apos;s their new paria . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s an independent territory . They &apos;re all minerary resources .
One of an natione-state natione-state can reconciliating with his people .
And , to finish , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious to the one of us is in these remote places in these remote places , and I realized that they don &apos;t remote .
For someone &apos;s home .
They represent the boundation of human imagination that they &apos;re at the algry of time . And for us all these children , as the dreams of these children , become part of the nuda nuda .
To end , we of National Geographic , we have belief that politicians will never come to anything .
We believe that polements --
&#91; Applauser &#93; don &apos;t be persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month our site has re35 million visits roughout the world .
56 countries transmate our television dog dog .
Our magazines are lets from millions of people .
Our work is traveling in the ethnososphere to bring our public places in the world of wonderful and cultural places from which will be abled by how they &apos;ve seen and , hopefully , they &apos;re going to be able to find a central reveal of the anthropology : the world of existing in a world of life in a world , and we need to find a life in a world and we need to find a life in a world of life in a world , and we need to find a life in a plural and we need to find a life in a life in a life in a life in a life in a world of life in
where the wisdom of all the people can contribute to our well-being collective .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope you &apos;ve heard and proverwhelming some connections , in the case you don &apos;t notice .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the &quot; dogma official dogma .
The dogma official thing ?
The dogma official society of all the West industrial society . The dogma official official official . &quot; If we want to massive the well-being of our citizens . &quot;
The reason is , from one side , in fact that liberty is in itself a value , is precious , useful , essential for human beings .
On the other one of us can do that if we are free , each one of us can act to do all of us that massive our well-being , no one that decide in our well-being , no one that decide in our own .
The way to massize freedom is massive .
More choices have , more libing people have , more libing , and the higher is their freedom , is their well-being .
This is , I think , it &apos;s so deeply radicated in the society that nobody would dream to be a doubbbbblew .
And it &apos;s also deeply radicated in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly great .
I &apos;m going to put a simple note about conditions to injjump .
In my supermarket , there &apos;s 175 conditions , without contacts of olium extreme covering the 10 variety of olium extreme , and the 12 acets that you can buy a huge number of conditions in the circitional incincentives that nobody of 175 .
Here &apos;s what the supermarket is .
Then you go to the electronic store : cast , the lector , lettor CD , radio , plastra , light , light , light , light , light , light , light , light , light , light .
And in this single single store , there &apos;s a big number of audio components .
We can do six million different combinations using the components that there are in a only store .
You have to admit that &apos;s tangry choice .
Alther camps : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all the phone services that were desire for mammal , at the Pact .
He was born the phone , you didn &apos;t buy it .
One consequence of that , one of the phone didn &apos;t break .
These days , they went .
We have a variety of phone , especially between cell phone , especially between cell cell phone .
Here &apos;s the phone of the future .
My favorite is in the middle , mobile MP3 , cutting out of the birds , and forcing forced to cross .
If you haven &apos;t seen in the store under the house store , you &apos;re very much certain that I &apos;ll get .
And what &apos;s the end happens is that people get in the store and he does this question . And you know what the answer ? The answer is &quot; No . &quot;
You can &apos;t buy a phone that doesn &apos;t make a cell that doesn &apos;t make too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important acquissues , you know , the same explosion of choices .
Hololder health : it doesn &apos;t happen in the United States that you go from doctor and doctor you say it &apos;s going to do .
Instead , you go from doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do A , or B , we could do A , or B &quot; &quot; B&quot; has these benefits and these benefits . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Dr. Dr. , what should I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; You know , it has these benefits , and B has these benefits and these risks . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebacts , &quot; Dr. if she was me , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor : &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result we call it &quot; autonomy of the malated , &quot; expression that makes it a nice thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not that one to move the weight and responsibility to make decisions from someone knows something , which is the doctor , to someone else that knows anything -- and it &apos;s certainly certainly sick -- and it &apos;s certainly not an ideal condition -- and it &apos;s certainly not the ideal condition -- and so it doesn &apos;t know the patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing marketing of products , direct to people like me and you , that if you think about it doesn &apos;t make any sense , because we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why they advericize them ?
The answer is that they want to ask them to ask them to ask them to ask them to ask them to require .
Something about so fundamental is our identity is a question of choice , how we see in this vignet . &quot; We don &apos;t want to forced children . They &apos;re not want to forced their sex sex at at the right moment . We need to invent .
And we can reinventing how many times we &apos;re reinventing us .
The one that means that every morning , at the savings , you have to decide that kind of person want to be .
I &apos;m going to the family and matrimonium , a time the common perspective , which is almost to anybody , was that it was that you had the most pressive possible , and they started to make the most preserved time .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and even what to do after .
So , it &apos;s really going to play .
I teach students very smart students , and I &apos;m going to get 20 percent in the work of a time .
And not because they &apos;re less brilliant , not because they &apos;re less diligggasks .
But why are they imthoughtful , you know , &quot; Do I should be going to be going to be doing now ? &quot;
&quot; Do I should I think before the children or I was thinking before children or the career ? &quot;
They &apos;re logorant interrogen .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this implica don &apos;t complete the companies that asseize and not get a nice voice to my exame .
And they really have to do that .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , as Carl underolized , because technology allows us to work every day , from the Hotel Randolph .
And it &apos;s a coroline , there &apos;s a coroline , and I &apos;m not going to tell anybody where the Within .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work ? Is it going to continuously decide , continuously , at every moment , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son play , with the mobile phone in a pocket , the Blackberbery in other , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the bynthrobbbbynaboes .
And even though they &apos;re all spending , every minute that we see our son &apos;s son &apos;s game , we &apos;re asking , &quot; I must respond to this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? I got to email this letter ? &quot;
And also when the answer is &quot; no , this makes it experience of your son &apos;s own son &apos;s experience of your son very different than than what would have been in other conditions .
So , anywhere we look at all of these things , little things and styles of life , life is a choose of choices .
And once the world was this : That &apos;s the one of the chance , but it was not a question of choice .
The world of today is what the world today : The dilemma is , &quot; Is it a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is . It &apos;s a lot of thing .
We &apos;re all talking about the positive layers . So , I &apos;m going to talk about the negative .
All this is this commention two negative effects of people .
The first paradoxally , it &apos;s that makes paralysis that it makes paralyssis .
So , with many options between which choose , becomes very difficult to do it .
I give you a significant example : a study of study of voluntary pensive .
And a colleague has been access to Vanguard , the gigantic company of pension , with about a million customers , with about a million customers , 2,000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offering in the most , the percentage of adesion two percent .
With 50 sourds , there &apos;s 10 percent in less than adesions when they &apos;re available to be available to when they &apos;re just five . Why ?
Because with 50 sources of which choose , is sick to decide , and choice is rerereduced to the intomorrow .
And tomorrow , and they still domans , tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course , tomorrow .
You know , you know , it doesn &apos;t only mean that these old hadn workers will be enough money , because they &apos;re not going to have enough money , even want to say that decision is so unexpectations of the dator &apos;s work .
Not in the way , they &apos;re losing to five dollars per year from dator dator dator , which would be very displace to versaries .
So the paralysis is a consequence of having too many choose .
And I think it &apos;s the world .
&quot; And to finish , for ethernity : ketchup , sends or maionese , sends or maionese ? &quot;
Would you like to take the right decision , if it &apos;s for the ethernity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong wrong , and yet the condition .
So this is the first effect . The second one is that we can avoid the paralysis and to choice , at the end , we &apos;re less satissssssatisssssent with less options of which choose .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions of which choose , if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that would have been better . And what happens is that the alternative . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us to branch for choice , and the repairing demining the decrecrease of the decision , and the decreation declining , and the decrew declining , and the decreation declining ,
even when it was a great decision .
More choices are , more , it &apos;s easier to be unless detail that is insoddispleasing of the choice .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has clared very well stamapin how the value that we &apos;re depending on what we &apos;re compare .
First of the rest of the way , there are many options of the alternative to represent the alternative to be less sation-de-made , unless satisfaction of the option that you have choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m sorry with all the ones that are not New York .
But that &apos;s what you &apos;re probably going to think .
There &apos;s this copy to Hamptons .
A slow place .
Spile . Otttttttttttttttttle .
It &apos;s nothing . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , maledition , is Agust . &quot;
&quot; Everyone my neighbors at Manhattan are . &quot;
&quot; I could parking out of front in front of home . &quot;
And it &apos;s going to move on on the idea that &apos;s perdating -- every day -- the opportunity to park where it wants .
The costo-cost opportunity decreation for what we have , even when the choice was excellent .
And the more are the options that we have to consider the most attracting features are going to be able to be costo-opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
It &apos;s about the moment , and maybe of the living slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you choose to do , you choose to not do the other .
The things that we don &apos;t have many attractive attractive that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : spiral spiral .
I tried it on my skin bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
I &apos;m always always always jeans .
Once the jeans were just a guy , buys and vast vast vast , they were scomcomfortable , just after they took them a lot of times , just started to go .
So , I went to buy a couple of new when the old ones were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
And the committer said , &quot; Li wants to do it , &quot; Li wants to , relaxed , leaking fit ? &quot;
You &apos;re going to do with the cernier or with the bottons ? &quot; Stonewashed , &quot; or &quot; Cajjathdropping ? &quot;
&quot; Would you like it ? &quot;
&quot; Seight wants them to cover or stretch ? Bbla bbla .
I was salord , and after a little bit I did , I want the guy that -- which was the only guy , which was the only guy , &quot; I want to have no idea of what , so for a moment I was going to go out of the store , and then I went out the store , and I was going to go out of the store , and I was a few of jeans that ever had .
It was the very good . With all that choice I had the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse , the reason I was that with all of that choice , the jeans had to be perfect .
And I was very expectations . I didn &apos;t expect anything exceptional when it was existed , but when you saw 100 different , but when you saw 100 different , accidents , at least a kind of thing .
What I had to buy was good , but not perfect .
After I was talking about the chose with what I was trying to do was insoddisappeared to the expectations .
The added options in life of people don &apos;t do that increasing the expectations that have respect to the excellence of the same options .
And this will make less satisfation , even when the results are good .
No one in the world of marketing if it &apos;s made it .
Because if they knew it , you don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more to that .
&quot; It was better when he was worse , &quot; The reason why he was better when it was worse , it was when it was worse , you know , when it was a worse ,
So , in the world we live in the world we live -- opulent , industrialized citizens with the expectancy of perfeition -- the most we can hope is that things are at the altezes of expectations .
You &apos;ve never surprising to pleasant because your expectations , my expectations , you &apos;re ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Baxation expectations . &quot;
I mean -- little authobiographic moment -- which I really really sposed and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t have to do better , I didn &apos;t have to do better , I didn &apos;t have to do better , I didn &apos;t have to do better , I didn &apos;t have to do better , I didn &apos;t have to do better , I didn &apos;t have to do better , I didn &apos;t have to do better , I didn &apos;t have to do better , I didn &apos;t have to do
But it &apos;s not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of buy a couple of jeans , when there &apos;s just that one of jeans is that when you &apos;re not ssatisfacfaced , and ask you , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who &apos;s responsible ? &quot; The answer is clear .
The world is the responsible . What would I do ?
When you have hundreds of jeans , and buy one insoddisfacing , and you wonder who &apos;s responsible , is the responsible , it &apos;s just just clear that responsible , is how the responsible you &apos;re .
You could have done better .
With hundreds of variety available , there are no excuse for the insuccessful .
So when people are making decisions , even though the result is valid , they feel insssatisssssed and they give it their own .
In the last years , depression is exploding in the world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this depression is just that people have experiences deludent experiences because standard are too alts .
And when they have to explain this this is they think the cold is their own .
So the final result is that we &apos;re better , but we feel worse , but we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the dogma official , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely filled . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubbbbbbbbbbbbbust , but from this didn &apos;t have a lot of choice is better than a little bit .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve been overed by a piece of piece of the level where the choices are improving our life .
Now , from the political point -- I &apos;ve been nearly finished -- I &apos;m the notion of politician , the nocy is the following .
What it allows all this choice in the industrial society is the wealth of it .
There are many places in the world , and you know about it , where the problem is not that have too choice .
The problem is that they have too pocaine .
So the thing I &apos;m talking about is a maleship of modern , re-core society , re-Western society .
And what it makes depressing and angry is this : Steve Levitt talked about how those expensive and comfortable to the car seats are inutilize . It &apos;s a split of money .
I mean these choices , complicated and dispenpend , it &apos;s not that they &apos;re just useful .
I &apos;m a deleterie .
They &apos;re doing worse .
If a little bit of what we are in our society allows , you know , where people have too few of the people have too few chance , it &apos;s not just their life to improve but also our .
This is what economists call a better improve pareating .
A redistribution of income re-income redistribution of the poor -- because of this choice in excess that there mention us .
To conclude , &quot; Fililildlife , you can become all the thing you want to --
You , people of culture , you think , &quot; What makes that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious you can &apos;t do anything in a shocking of glass . &quot;
&quot; A kind of a covered view of the world --
and I &apos;m interprepreprepregnant .
But then , I realized that , instead , I realized that that fish knows the long fishing knows .
Because the reality is that if you &apos;re missing in frantumes the bocol , so that you can &apos;t get freedom . You don &apos;t get freedom . You don &apos;t get freedom .
If you break the bocol is all divents that you can diminusssatisfation .
You get the paralysis , and you reduce the well-being .
Everyone needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too strange , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of some sphere is a recipe for inhappiness and , I &apos;m going to be a reverse , for rovine .
Thank you .
