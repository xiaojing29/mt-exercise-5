Last year I showed these slides to demonstrate that the glacial calculated , which for almost three million years had the size of 48 United States , the continental size , it &apos;s retrofit of 40 percent .
But this underlying the gravity of the problem because it &apos;s not showing the ice of the ice of the ice .
The arctic ice ice ice ice ice ice is , in a sense , the glacial heart of global climate .
It &apos;s expanded up and reverse retreat .
The next slide is going to be a carrying reveness , which is the last 25 years .
The glaces are reported .
As you see , they &apos;re expanding to the blue .
That &apos;s the invern ice , which is summer ice retreat .
You can see that the soft called &quot; five or more , it &apos;s like a blood , which is like blood , which here I was going to be horide from the body .
In 25 years , it was like this .
This is a problem because the interests of the earth around the arctic ocean where there are huge amount of fuzzy ocean where there are huge amount of fuzzy that , melting , they &apos;re transformed into the arctic , they &apos;re transformed into the arctic ocean where there are huge amount of frozen .
I &apos;m going to the total pollution of global warming , that amount of unrhythms , that amount could doubling , overwhelming this point of not around .
In some deep lakes in Alaska methane of the metane is already related from the water .
The professorse Katey Walter of the University of Alaska team , and we had a team at a low lake , last winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You &apos;re good . The question is if we &apos;re also .
One is that this termal exchange termal exchange the Greenland from the north .
This is a glacial river .
The ported her own never reached like that .
This is the Kangerlussuaq River , in the southwest of the Greenland .
If you want to know how the sea level to be shrimp for the glaciers on land , it &apos;s where it reaches the sea .
These currents are getting very quickly .
On the other side of the planet : Antarctica , the biggest block of ice on the planet .
Last month , scientists have told that the ice balance of ice is in negative , and the Western artide , which pogate on some submargage , which is particularly quitous right on the sun .
It &apos;s about six feet of the water , like in Greenland .
Sulil Himalaya , the third greatest block of ice , you see new lakes , which a few years ago .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population was getting half of the water from that melting .
Sulle Ande : this glacier &apos;s the source of the water of this city .
The ported is up .
But when it decreases , the same happens to water .
In California , snowage of the Sierra Nevada has deminuity .
The hyries are in the crisis .
The previsions , as you read , they &apos;re grasses .
The safety world &apos;s bringing to a remarkable increasing incendi .
The environmental disasters are getting a rhythm outside of the normal and unprecedented .
Four times more of the last 30 years I was about the previous 75 .
This is a unsustainable , the way .
If you look at it in the historical context can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day .
Look at the highest Pacific , the East Pacific , and the Americics of the Indian subcontinent , where there &apos;s a radical royal radical impoverment of oxygen in the ocean .
The greatest cause of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossil fuel use .
Oil is a problem , and coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two of the most emissions , together to China .
And he proponed to build a lot of other central central centers .
But we &apos;re seeing a change of the way .
These are the annullated projects in the last few years and some alternative alternative vers .
Every way , there &apos;s a political struggle in our country .
The oil industrial and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote to clean coal , which is a bone .
That image would reminded me to something --
Verse , Natal Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion gallons of coal four-billion litri fts .
You may have seen it on the news .
This is the second greatest flow in America .
It &apos;s happened around Christmas .
The Chopping Children &apos;s ads of coal industrial .
Video : Happy the carbon is a kind of allegro and and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it grow our economy .
Frosty the carbon has always clean .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and the workers keep the sales .
Al Gore : From here is a big part of the West Virginia .
The greatest companies on the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I &apos;ll be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelososes , Harry Reid -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for Clima &apos;s Protection of Clima has launched two campaigns .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : ALergy : At the next thing we see climate change as a serious threat our business .
So that our priority is to invest a big amount of money in a publishes in a publishes to make public and confused to coal truth .
Actually , coal is not spork .
We think it &apos;s clean -- it also has a good profumher .
So not premiattached climate change .
Let me do .
Video : Cold , you &apos;ve heard a lot of them about it .
So let &apos;s make a turn into a roll structure to be about clean coal .
Stricordinarily ! The machines are a little noise , but this is the sound of the pulit fuel .
The coal consumption is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology of clean coal warming , which you see changes .
Try a look : this is the pulist odien technology .
Al Gore : Well , the positive alternative is connected to economic question and the national security .
Video : Comtion : America is in crisis , national security , the climate crisis .
The wire that the links all : our fossil addicted to fossil fuel , like the spork and oil .
Now , though , there &apos;s a new , audgment of this .
Repower America : 100 percent clean energy , in a decade .
A plan to report America &apos;s more secure , and make us more secure , and help stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that I joined to solve our problems .
Repower America . Strep more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : A is about re-energy to America .
One of the faster ways of bringing to take the dependence of fuel that killing our planet .
Comparsa : The future is here . Very , a new energy network .
Comparsa : Novers investimate for good work well-retribuites .
Complease : Repower . It &apos;s time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old African proverbio , says , &quot; If you want to go fast , go to alone .
If you want to go far , go together . &quot;
We have to go far , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED . I introduction .
And you promise to return to you to get a way of a car works .
So I am there . And for those that the other time was not there , the LHC is the greatest scientific experiment ever tried -- 27 kilometers of surrounding .
His job is to reach the conditions that were less than one mild of a second from the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
All of this is just ambitious .
This is the machine under Genra .
We &apos;re going to take a little Big Bang inside the relevant .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- is a wide 44 meters and it &apos;s diameter of 22 meters .
This is a spectacular image of ATLAS in construction so you can see the proportions .
The 10 September of last year we have packed the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was causes immense flew in the control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first of particles that did all the way around the LHC , by getting into the LHC , deliberately , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles inside the resultor .
In other words , when we saw that image of September , we realized that the machine worked , which is a great vittory .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to make us more or this , when somebody went on Google and saw that the initial page was this .
That means we had a cultural impact beyond that scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , and it was just about these files here -- these willing files .
These files take 13,000 ampampampes when the machine works at the most of the power .
Now , the technical of you will look at the filters and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . I &apos;m films . &quot;
And they can do that because when they &apos;re very cold become the so-called filters .
So , at least 271 degrees , at less 271 degrees , to the space of the stars , these files can bring that current .
In one of the giguntures between the most of new magnees in the LHC , there was a defect of factory .
So the files surrise slightly , and the 13,000 amppheres suddenly met a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think these magnets are fish that are about about about 20 tons , and they moved about 30 centimeters .
They were damaged about 50 magnees .
We had to take them , what we did .
We refed them and upset .
They &apos;re now going back to their underground .
Belter , the From LHC is going to be a new integrity .
We &apos;re going to accept that , and we expect to get data or July , and continue so our adventure to find out what the morning is the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these crashes are going on the value of science and science and compared to the value of science and compared to comparison . It &apos;s easy to conjecting .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s so hard , I think that &apos;s the value of things like LHC .
I want to conclude with the words of an Inglurrecy , Humphhrey Davy , who , I guess , in defense experiments of his clean , his clean was Michael Faraday , he said , &quot; Nothing is so dangerous for human mind . &quot; It &apos;s so dangerous for human mind as defines the ideas of science , that there are no mysties in nature , and that our new monds are complete monds of the conquent , and that our new monds . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start asking you about rethink about when you , you play with children , you played the morning .
While you could get them and grab them , take them and you learn them , and you learn about thinking and to do problems by understanding and doing space relationships .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , by the useful information of our interaction with physical objects , together to my consultation with physical objects , together to my own Pact , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking , &quot; And if , when we use a computer , instead of having the only sore of mouse as a digital passion , that &apos;s going to move on a desktop , we could have to affect physically , with both hands ,
and put it on our pleasure ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftool , a big interactive computer like a biscope .
In a few words , a Siftool , a big interactive computer like a biscope .
You can move with their hand , they can move with their hand , you know , &quot; hear , &quot; movement and they have a wireless radio .
But mostly , they &apos;re physical objects , like the brick , you can just move out .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physicists , they know about the movement , of the other , and as they become more physicists , and as they get more physicists , and how we can explore new and fun styles of interaction .
I &apos;ll start with some simple example .
This Siftable is to show of video : if you include it in one direction , it &apos;s going to rotate on the other side , it &apos;s going to go back .
These interactive portraits of other people .
If you rely them , they &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re going to be .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can agitate a little bit .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can agitate a little bit .
They also had their movement and they get their movement and they get .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was to use common gestures to use common gestures , for example , &quot; to sect a color like whether it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurated as a little boy of painting , and I can use them to go into the color , where they missing .
And I can use them to go into the color in that central , where they put .
We &apos;re going to come too , we can put a little bit .
There are also beautiful possibilities of learning , like languages , like languages , the mathematics and logic games where people can try to try things , and see the results that are very quickly .
Now I &apos;m --
This is a Fibonacci sequence that I do with a equations program .
Here we have a words of words that is in the middle of Scarabeo and Boggle .
Basically , to every Siftool , you get a letter to every Siftool , you &apos;re all going to get a letter on on every Siftool , and as you try to make words check it on a dictionary .
And then , after about 30 seconds , they have a new set of letters and new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the children came out of the Media Lab , I did so that I tried them and I went and went a video .
They were very pleased .
And one of the interesting things about this kind of appliances is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot .
You just say , &quot; Compounds of words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s other people who are trying to do it .
This is our beta youngest tester , there on the right .
It actually wanted to be impilary .
They just were just just morning , for him .
Now , this is an appliance of an interactive charge .
We wanted to build a tool for learning . He &apos;s Felix . He &apos;s Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , relievant the Siftable , they associated with .
It can put new characters in the scene , relievant the Siftable , they associated with .
So , it &apos;s getting the sun out .
Video : The sun is surprising .
David Merrill : Now he brought a treor the scene .
Video : The aranange treatment .
Bel work ! Yeah !
So , you shake the Siftable and putting them in the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing their story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s an open story , with open , and it can decide him as it goes .
DM : It &apos;s an open story , with open , and it can decide him as it goes .
Video : Gooden , cat .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , which is that I did , to sample and performing music .
It &apos;s a tool , which is made of a recent , to sample and performing music .
The Siftable here is from sounds like the bas, and the battery .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose to use .
You can also get these sound in a sequence to compose of your pleasure .
And then it just by making a sound and make a sequence .
These are actually you can actually control from alive , like reversus and the filter .
And you get it to a particular sound and then cline to fix it .
And then there are general effects as time and volume , which is appliances to the entire sequence .
Let &apos;s look at how it works .
Video : We &apos;re going to try one in two Siftool &quot; sequence , &quot; we put them in a series , we go into a series , we extra , add into a series , we add to a series , we add to a series , we add to the other base .
Now I &apos;ll put a bottom line .
Video : Now I added percussions --
Video : And I &apos;m going to put the lighting to the battery , so I can control the vive effect .
Video : I can require the entire sequence of the time from one side or the other .
Video : And I &apos;ll now add the bottom of to the bottom to give more expression .
Video : I can remate the sequence of &quot; to the flying &quot;
So I didn &apos;t have to plan this before , but I can suddenly make it longer or more court .
And now , finally , I can smoking the entire sequence of the left Siftable to the Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to make new human interfaces and more more more looks like how we work and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this way , and also some possibilities that we &apos;re trying to bring out of the lalaws .
The concept I want to transmit is that it &apos;s coming this new generation of design to interact with digital media , which will lead to the information in our world we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the hour of talking to all of you .
I &apos;m a writer .
I &apos;m books , I &apos;m my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the fascinating of my life .
And I don &apos;t look like it .
But , that , something particular has happened recently in my life and my career , which led me to reezing the whole relationship with this job .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called &quot; Mangia , Prega , &quot; which , diversity from my previous books , for some reason he came out in the world and became a great , feeling , interational bestseller .
And the result is that everywhere , now , people treat me treated as if I was convicted .
First , it &apos;s convicted !
They come up to me all worried and say , &quot; Do you don &apos;t fear you couldn &apos;t make better ?
You don &apos;t fear to go out and write all life without being able to create a book that can you care about someone ? &quot;
that can matter to somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s reassuring , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember the more than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a teenager -- I wanted to be a writer .
I would go to the same reaction based on the fear .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you feel like he couldn &apos;t succeeded ?
You don &apos;t fear that the humiliation of killed you ?
You don &apos;t have to make this mill for all life without anything that you &apos;ve never come out and to die on a cumle of dreams with the mouth wholever with the mouth of failure ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yeah , I &apos;m afraid of all of the things .
I always had fear .
And I also have a lot of other things that people can &apos;t really inherently .
Like the algae and other things .
But , as I think about writing what I thought and I would ask myself , why is it ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logical that anyone who would have expected to be frightened by a job that you feel like to do .
But what is there of so particular in the creative companies to make us nervous about mental health as as owe in a way that other careers do they do ?
As my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don &apos;t remember one in his 40 years of activity , and I don &apos;t remember one he was engineer ?
There was never -- that block of the engineer John , how does it go ?
It wasn &apos;t working like that , you understand ?
Onestly , chemicals as a group don &apos;t have certainly , in centuries , in the reputation of being alcumed .
We have enough this reputation , we have enough this reputation , and not just creative writers , but we have this reputation of being enormous instabove .
And it doesn &apos;t remains that look at the sad of the magnificent dent of creative magnifts that only in the 20th century , and they &apos;re going to do .
And the ones that don &apos;t seem to be really suicked by their dones .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , &quot; Every book book has killed me a little bit more . An says , &quot; A remarkable statement about their life .
But we don &apos;t throw it up when we feel this , because we heard these things so long that somehow we have completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and the suffering are somehow and the suffering are in some way of and that art , at the end , it will always constraints to the anges .
And the question I want to ask everybody here today is : Do you agree with this idea ?
It &apos;s good for me -- because it also looking at it from a centimeter to me , I &apos;m not good for this support .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous , and I don &apos;t want to see it perpetuated in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our great creative minds .
And certainly , I know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start to the feeling of support of support , and the above all of the way to the surrounces , where I &apos;m in my career .
That &apos;s -- I mean , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m about 40 years old .
I still have about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that whatever I &apos;m going to write about the world as the work that he came out after the world as the job of my last book .
I &apos;ll be a little bit of my friends here -- it &apos;s likely that my greatest success is to my shoulders .
Oh , Gesu , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that brings a person to start drink in the nine morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would keep doing this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it looks like , after a lot of reflective , which the way to work to continue to write is to create a protective psychological , OK ?
I have to find a security distance between me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxiety distance between me , which is going to get . And as I was trying to look for this year , trying to find other societies , to look through time , trying to find other societies , to see if they could have better ideas and more sane ideas and more sane distance between me , I &apos;m going to write about it , I &apos;m going to write , I &apos;m writing this year , and I
how to help people creative manage to deal with the emotional risks of creativity .
And that research led me to the ancient and ancient Rome .
I &apos;m just just going to come up and then it comes back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
They thought about creativity was this spirit looks like , and that it &apos;s divine and that it would come to men from some surprising and unknown .
The Greeks were called these spirits of the devices of creativity .
Socrate , wonderful , believed that he had a saggees from away .
Romans were the same idea , but they called the kind of spirit without a body genius .
which is great , because the Romans didn &apos;t think a really thought that a kind of smart , was somebody were particularly smart .
They thought , a genius was this sort of a divine that literally lived in the walls of a little bit like the study of an artist , a little bit like the walls of a lot of how to ellow , and it came out of the work of the artist and modeling the output of that work .
Here &apos;s an exectional -- that &apos;s the distance of which I talk -- that psychological construction that you protect your job .
And everybody knew it was how he worked , right ?
So , the ancient artists were protected by certain things , like the too narcism , no ?
If your job was exceptional you couldn &apos;t take and all the mermerely , everybody knew that you had been helped by this genius encourters .
If your failure job , it wasn &apos;t your false , you know , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a hurt .
And so people have the han of the way of creativity .
And then the Renisissance came and everything changed , and it changed , and we put the human being at the center of the universe over all the other and the mysties and without more to leave space to the mit .
This was the principle of rational humanity and people started thinking that creativity came out of idivided .
And for the first time in history , it started to referred this or that artist as a kind of genius that artist to a person with the genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big error .
I think that allow somebody , a simple person to believe that they &apos;re like a recient , like , the source and the essence and the people of all the mysties , creative , unknown and unknown and ethernal and ethernal and is a very big responsibility .
It &apos;s like to ask somebody to enjoy the sun .
It turns out and it &apos;s completely ego and it creates all of these expectations on performance .
And I think it was this pressure to destroyed the artists in the past 500 years .
And , if that &apos;s true , and I think that &apos;s , the question is , and I think that &apos;s now ?
Can we do that diversity ?
Maybe go back to a more ancient understanding of human relationship between humans and mystery creative .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t take 500 years of rational thinking about a talk about 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience who would be link to have been tiitness about the notion of , so do you do , they follow people who are going to fit on their projects .
I &apos;m not going to convince you all about this .
But the question I &apos;d like to ask is -- why don &apos;t you ?
Why wouldn &apos;t you think about that way ?
Because it makes sense of anything that has ever heard to explain the imprevehabstract of the creative process .
And a process that , as anyone who has ever tried to do something -- so , basically , all of this , basically , all here -- you know , you don &apos;t comports rationally .
And in fact , it can look like paranormal .
I did this meeting recently with the extraordinary Ruth Stone , who &apos;s got 90 years , but it was a poem for all life and said to me that during his childhood in the rural Virginia , and he felt it , in his camps , and he felt it , in if , when a poetry to the landscape .
He said he was like a train of air .
And that was roling to come from the landscape .
It felt it , because he was getting the earth under her feet .
He knew he had one thing to do that , and he was , &quot; to run as a matta . &quot;
And he was going to the home and he was going to be followed by this poetry , and it wouldn &apos;t have to get a piece of paper and a pencil , and he was getting it on the page .
And sometimes he couldn &apos;t be fast enough , so he was so fast and the courreefs and he had to come to come to home and the rolling poetry through and forced it and forced to roll through the landscape , as she said , &quot; another poeet . &quot;
And then there were those times -- this piece I never forget to -- there were times when there were almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was trying to find paper and poetry to do it , and he was going through , and he said , he was going to go , and then he said , he was like he leaking with the other hand and the office .
It was offering poetry from the tail and he would put it into his body and moved it to the page .
And in these cases , poetry would be presented on the perfect page and the contrary , from the last word to the first .
So when I felt it -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly the same same as it is .
Not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conduction !
I &apos;m a mulo , and my way of working is ; I wake up to the orary every day and sweating and work and go over and go over .
But even , in my summer testgin , I strike up against that thing , sometimes .
And I guess a lot of you have the han done .
You know , even if the job and ideas came to me from a certain source of the source , I could not know ,
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it so that we don &apos;t have a losing your head , but rather , that makes us healthy healthy ?
As I think about , the best example of this is the best example of Tom Waits , which I interviewed several years ago .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of the life was the incarnation of the artist tormented , trying to control , managing , tomorrow trying to check , to check , total , and tomorrow species of the sort of creative impulses .
But then he inveck , he hurt , and he was driving on a himself in Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
It was going fast and all of a sent , this little piece of apelusious , which comes into his head as inspiration , and it comes into his head of his head , and the desidera , and the desider , and the desider , but it doesn &apos;t know how to take it .
He didn &apos;t have a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a pencil , he doesn &apos;t have a recorder .
So he starts to hear this kind of anxiety , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;ll go on from this way of even .
I &apos;m not good enough , and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to the panic , he stopped .
And he put the whole mental process and made something completely new .
He just looked at the sky and said , &quot; Speam , don &apos;t you can see that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Do you look like it can write a song now ?
If you really want to exist , it &apos;s coming back to a bit more than you when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , you go to a little bit more today .
You &apos;re going to disturbing Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his work process changed after that .
Not the job , the job was still dark as always .
But the process , and the anxiety of the anxiety , which was released when he was the genius , the genius that came out of the problems and liberated it back from where it was , I realized that it didn &apos;t have to be an interiorized and torgmented .
But it does this peculiar , wonderful bizarre , collaboration , a conversation between Tom and this strange thing that &apos;s got to go out and forth that was not Tom .
So how I felt that story started to change a little bit of change the way I was working on and I had saved me once .
This idea , I &apos;d save when I was writing , &quot; Prega , &quot; and , &quot; and fall in one of those cave of the despair that we cause all come out when we &apos;re all working on something and we can &apos;t get a disaster , which is the worst book .
Not just bad book , just the worst book .
And I started thinking about this project .
But then I remember Tom who talked to the air and I tried .
So I got up my face on a handsed and diress my comments to a vacuum of the room .
And I said to high voices , &quot; Sent , what , we know , if this book is not going to be brilliant is not going to be a bright ?
Because as you see , I &apos;m putting all of , I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want to be better , you have to introduce you and do your side .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do that , I don &apos;t do anything .
And I &apos;ll go to write the same because it &apos;s my job .
And I &apos;d like to be recorded that I was today to do my part . &quot; Because , it &apos;s so , OK -- , , centuries does in North Africa &apos;s deserts , people were rooms in the North of the lasts of moon , dance and so on the albor to the high .
And they were always wonderful , because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
But every once , it was a lot of , something happened , and one of these artists became really transmitted .
And I know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know you &apos;ve all seen , at a certain point , a performance like this .
It was like the time that he stops , and the dancer walks through a kind of portal and it wasn &apos;t just from the usual , like 1,000 noticed before , but it was unflew .
And suddenly it doesn &apos;t just look like a human .
But he turned out to divinity .
And when this happened , he was , the people knew what was , they called him .
They were to sing their hands and started to sing , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
I was the storical notes -- when the Morord south , I got this habits with them and the ready to change in the centuries from &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , &quot; and the ones , &quot; which you can &apos;t hear in the cords or in the cords or flew in the corride or famenco .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , and they , Allah , and they &apos;re , Allah , I &apos;m just a little bit of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes after , the dancer comes after , when you wake up and you see them , and you find out that &apos;s the 11 in the morning of Martedesday and the God &apos;s not there .
It &apos;s just a big dead to the churn , and maybe it &apos;s not going to get more to that altitude .
And maybe nobody will sing God still flew , and what it has to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most painting recious to make in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so angosciant if you can &apos;t believe , you know , the most extraordinary aspects of your being being being from you .
But it just credit that you are given from a unimaginable source of this team of your life that you have to go to somebody else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think it all this way .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s certainly like I thought it for several months in the book that I &apos;ll put on this book that I &apos;ll soon , the dangerous , I &apos;ll attempted , and I &apos;ll be able to do this .
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel appliances from this is , I don &apos;t have fear .
Don &apos;t flow you . It &apos;s just your job .
And they &apos;re going to introduce you to your side , any it can be .
If your job is dancing , you know , you can &apos;t .
If the divine , absurd , absurd you decide to leave some kind of wonderful , for just time , through your effort , then &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Otherwise , do the same dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot; to you . &quot;
I think it &apos;s got to teach it .
&quot; Ole ! &quot; to you the same , even just for having human love and testabgine testabgine to make you very much .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects on the human genes , what can mean and about new set of genes .
We &apos;re starting a new path : we started digitize biology and now starting to digital code , we &apos;re going into a new phase of biology , design and we &apos;re in a new phase of biology , design and synthesize .
We &apos;ve always tried to ask big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; is something that many biologists , I think they &apos;ve tried to understand how many levels .
We tried different approaches , reducing it to the minimum terms .
We &apos;re digitize for almost 20 years ever .
When we sequenced the human genome was treased to go from the analogical world &apos;s digital world .
Now we ask : can we regenerate life , or create new from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome genome genome genome , which can be in the launched species .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little smaller .
We can get a hundred genes of the genes of the about 500 of the genes that are here .
But when we look at its metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our .
Credemic me , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , one is very unlikely that this can bring to a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to move the component to design was synthesize this chromosome that chromosome could change the components to ask some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of &quot; Can we synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Can we have the chemistry constent to produce these big molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create before ?
And in case , can we make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is a just a piece of chemical material that is inert .
The speed with which we &apos;re able to digitize life is growing up to exponential rhythm .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , and rather slowly , but it &apos;s getting better .
And our most recent results the results are getting an exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
And the process required , starting with a biotic review before we started with the first experiments .
But we found that synthesize of DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that produce little DNA segments , and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the more degenerative process : the more , the more errors there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these fragments and correct the errors .
And this was our first trying to do , to start by the digital genome of Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus kills kills .
We designed the fragments , effectively , the corrupted corrupted and get a molecule of DNA .
The interesting part is when we took this kind of chemical material that &apos;s inherent and we put it in the bacteria , they started reading this genetic code and make viral particles .
The viral particles have been released by the cells , and they &apos;ve gone back and they have destroyed .
I talked about recently with members of the oil industry , saying to them that they certainly have understood .
They &apos;ve been rice .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build its hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things bigger .
We wanted to build the entire chromosome of the bacteria .
I &apos;m more than 580 myththththology .
So we thought we &apos;re going to build it on the size of the virus , so that we can change cassette to understand what the components are of a living cell .
Saction is critical , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard accuracy was a mistake of any .
We discovered , we &apos;ve been resequenced , 30 errors . If we had to use that original sequence we never would have to do it .
One of the process is to design segments that are overwhelming 50 letters that overwhelming with all the other segments of 50 letters to build smaller underneath the small ones that work together .
We &apos;re going to take unic elements here .
You &apos;ve probably read that we put in the side of the flie .
Think about this : We have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of the letters that have a little bit of acminoacids , and there &apos;s a specific order of letters for every amminds of acid .
So we can use the genetic code to write , frash , thoughts .
What we did at the beginning was self-roll .
Some of them have been delusi from the fact that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
We designed these segments to be able to just join with enzymes .
There are all that relate them and put them together .
And we started assemble of parts , starting with the parts , starting with the chments from five to seven thousand letletters , and they &apos;re just going to form segments of 24 mila letters to them , and they get to 72 to 72 thousand and letletters .
We have made these dramatic segments so that we could sequence it , because we &apos;re trying to create a very good remarkable procedure of creating a good good good revenue .
We &apos;re trying to automatic the process .
So , this seems like the tohabelone playful players .
When we get to these very long segments , more than 100 thousand basis , it doesn &apos;t grow more directly in the Eccles .
You get to the modern molecular biology .
So we looked at other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called homological revenue , which in biology , we use to repair the DNA that can join the DNA that can join the segments .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiation , can murn three million rad rad .
You can see in high roll like his chromosome is destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s just like it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely dry .
They can live under vacuum .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life exists in space , and it &apos;s unlike that , and it &apos;s a lot of water .
Actually , NASA showed that this is happening .
This is a molecule that we built using these processes , just using the yeast with the design appropriate segments .
The yeast evense them .
This image was not taken with a regular microscope , but with a regular microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It &apos;s a so big molecule that we can see it with a slightly little microscope .
These are pictures that they cover a six seconds .
This is the publishers that we did a little time ago .
I &apos;m more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the greatest molecule that &apos;s ever created by man .
It has a 1,000-year-old molecular weight .
If we &apos;re going to do it with a 10 without spaces , we need 142 pages only to transform this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ? How can we do that ?
Of course , you take a virus is a little bit of the kids .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria .
It &apos;s easier to even when it &apos;s eucarily cells as our : you can just get to the nuclear nuclear and put another , which is basically the clonation process .
In the archaea of a chromosome is integrated inside the cell , but we recently demonstrated that we &apos;re able to make a complete trap of a chromosome from one cell to another and to activer .
We clean a chromosome in a kind of a microbial species .
The two are different as the men from rice .
We add some genes in a way that we could decide which to be able to decide which to do this chromosome .
And then it &apos;s melt with the enzymes .
And when we put it into the cell was amazing -- and you &apos;ll open our soft graph -- the new chromosome graph -- the new chromosome has gone into the cell .
And we thought we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to get there .
This is one of the major things of evolution .
We found that a second or a third chromosome , they add a second or a third chromosome , somewhere , and add into a second thousands of new traits to that species .
So , who thinks about evolution as one gene when it doesn &apos;t understand much understand the biology .
There are some enzyme called restriction enzyme , which even digital DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell , not possible one .
The phone -- the chromosome that we put it on --
And it &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other chromosome as a material extraneum , and we found with only the cell and the new chromosome .
It became blue because of the genes that we put .
And in a short time , all the characteristics of species have gone lost , and it turned into a new species , based on the new species , based on the new software that we put into the cell .
All the proteins have changed , and members have changed , and when we read the genetic code that is that we moved to .
Now , this may seem to be genetic alchemy , but by allowing the DNA , we can change things in a very substantial way .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that this is not about genesis -- but progression from three million years of evolution , and I &apos;ve already told that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion where they &apos;re going to create new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty obvious when we think of our need .
We &apos;re going to go from six and a half billion people to 9 billion in the next 40 years .
Right ? I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each exist in 1946 ; in 40 years , there will be four of them .
We &apos;re having problems now to find food , fresh and clean , medical and gas , and gas and gas , for six billion and a half billion people .
It &apos;s going to be more hard to do it for nine billion .
We use five billion coal-toilet barrels , over 30 billion barrels .
That means 100 million barrels a day .
When I look at biological processes , or any kind of process to replace them , it &apos;s a huge challenge .
We have to keep all of the CO2 emission from these materials that end up into the atmosphere .
And today , because of the scientific discoveries that all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the designed components for the future .
The electronics industry only only only one dozen about components , and think about how many different things came out .
Our limits here is data from biological reality and from our imagination .
Now we have techniques , because of these methods of synthesization , that we call a combinatory , and able to create what we call a combinatory .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think of these 20 million genes of the genes or to optimize the processes to produce it or drugs , new vaccines , we can change , because of a little team , and create more molecular biology that in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemical production or fuel , production vaccines production .
This is an instantaneous of some software programmed we &apos;re working on to be able to seat and design species at the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t necessarily know how they &apos;ll be .
We know exactly how their genetic code .
We &apos;re focusing now on the fourth generation .
You also saw you that extract ethanol from the wheat was a hurt experiment .
We have coal of second and third generation that will use enough enough coal will use more coal fuel than they get or different kinds of butanle ,
But the only way biology can have a big impact without increasing the cost of food and limestone that we have the best impact of food and limestone that we &apos;re working for cells that can achieve this purpose , and we think we can have the first fuel that purpose , and we think we can have the first fourth generation of about 18 months .
The solar light combined CO2 is a metodo--- but in our discoveries all over the world , we found different metods .
This is a organism that we described in 1996 .
It &apos;s going to the ocean , about 2,500 feet deep to the Jollition temperature .
It creates from CO2 using molecular using molecular as a source of energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand whether we can incanaling CO2 , which can easily be carried through tubes , converted CO2 into fuel , to drive this process .
So , we think we might be able to increase what the basic question of &quot; what life is , &quot; is we have the way to be able to increase what life is , we have the furniture of the oil industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do that from TED , where can you do that ?
It would be a major source of energy .
And we &apos;re working on to use the same methods to create instantly vaccines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with flu , we &apos;re always forth of a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s about finding the right .
I think that you can change building combinable vaccines in anticius .
Here &apos;s how the future might start to look change , now , the tree of evolution , accellating evolution with synthetic bacteria , arches , and finally , eucariote , and finally , eucariote .
We &apos;re so so far from improving people .
Our purpose is to make a long enough way to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;ll show you , the most quickly possible , some fundamental work , the new technology that we brought to the Microsoft in a year ago exactly . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s a environment where you can interact is local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data .
We &apos;re seeing here , many gigabyte of digital pictures with a kind of a constant zant and continue , for a fast panoramic , display the images as we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much the amount of information that we see , how big these collapses of data or the images .
Most of the digital photographs , but this for example is a scanning scanning from the Library of Congress , and it comes into the gamma of Congress , and he walks into the gapiel .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that limits the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen at any time . It also is very flexible architecture .
This is a book , all of the data not of images .
This is the Dickens . Every column . Every column is a chapter .
To demonstrate that it &apos;s just about text and not of images , we can do something like this , to really see that it &apos;s a real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be an artificial way to read a piece of electronic book .
I don &apos;t recommend that .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s a number of The Guardian .
Every big image is the beginning of a section .
And really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading the real cartoon , or a daily , which is for nature a multiple kind of a kind of a lot of a lot of a half of a kind .
We also did something with the angle of this number of the Guardian .
We created a high-resolution ads -- much higher than what you use in a normal publicity -- and we put in a normal publicity . And we put in the content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the space limits of space on the screen .
We hope that means to put people up and other similar people and bringing up to people and similar porcheries , not to be necessary .
Now , of course , mapksis one of the poorest applications for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say that we have a contribution to do this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. sovereign NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually live on the web ; you can go to the web ; you can go to see it .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research at the very interesting computer that Noah Snavely , a student at Steve Seitz of Washington , with the help of Steve Seitz of Microsoft Rick Szeliski Rick . It &apos;s a great collaboration .
And it &apos;s from the live on the web , I was running from Seadragon .
You can see when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from one image to the other and have this kind of experience to multiple it .
But the space location of the images here has actually a meaning .
The visualization of the computer algorithms have been recorded these images together , so that they &apos;re going to the real places that imagine -- all close to the Grases on the Roccies : They &apos;ve taken out of Roccience -- they were taken . So here you see some of the elements of a slipped -- and these things have all connected to the space level .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more space space .
I want to go directly to one of the Noahn-original data set of Noahnth data that we did work for Photosynth that we did work for the first time we &apos;ve done the first time we &apos;ve got to do what I think is really the key behind this technology , the Photosynth of Nothing that is really evident at the environments that we have put in the website . And it &apos;s not necessarily evidence that we have in the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of Nothrethree-of-Nothrethree-of-Flickr . Bathame Nothrethree-Dame in Flickr , and you get images of these guys in shirt and so on . Onone of these boundaries , which is discovered a picture that it was discovered to appear to this .
So they &apos;re all made by Flickr , and they were all connected to space level this way .
And it &apos;s possible to igate this very simple way .
You know , I would never be thought of finished working for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifying to receive this kind of accounting here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of phones of phones that SLR professional , and a significant number of these phones who are in this environment .
And if I can , I try to look for those more strange .
Many of them are blocked by the facks , etc .
Somewhere you have a number of photographs -- there .
This is a Nothrethreat of Nothrethreat Dame .
We can go from the physics of this environment .
The essential is that we can do things with social environment . This is taking data from the susum -- from the entire collective memory of how the earth , from visual point of visual standpoint -- and connects all that data together .
All of those pictures become connected , greater than the sum of the parts .
You have a model of the earth of the entire land emerges .
Think about this as a prolungent of Stephen Lawler &apos;s work on the virtual Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows into complexity as people use it , and the people who use it , and the advantages to get with use .
Their photo is marched with meadapted by other people .
If somebody is the idea of contrast to all these saint smile , my picture of Nobody , my photograph of Nothree-DDemadrale , it &apos;s reaching of all that data , and I can use it as a church to immersed in that space , in that metaphor , using the picture of everybody else , and have a social experience of the crcross-user and have a social experience of the kind of crcrcross-user and ob-user .
Of course , a consequence of all of this is very very elaborate virtual models of every interesting land , collected from the planes and satellite images and just , but from collective memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What your software is going to do is that at a certain point , in the next few years , all the photographs , all the photographs that we have to all in the world will be connected together ?
BAA : Yeah . What is doing is basically is to find .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the images .
What &apos;s really interesting if you think about the richness of seant information that many of these images have .
As you do a picture of the images on the web , you get a sentence and the text on the web is , the web has a lot of information to the images .
Now , what happens if that picture is connecting all your picture ?
So the amount of semanantic interconnection and the amount of wealth that comes out of it is really enormous . It &apos;s a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really amazing .
BAA : thank you very much .
One of the pleasures when you travel and one of the ethnographic research is to live in the order of the living in the wind , and the old traditions , among the workers , the hits the hurt stones from the railest , the hits in the walls , it &apos;s driven in the walls , and it &apos;s driven in the walls of the plants .
Basti Jaguit &apos;s Jaguar traveled to the Via Lattea , or that the old old old old Inuit still is a significant thing , or that in Himalaya , budget budget of the Dharm , to remember the central of anthropology , and the idea that the world we live in the whole world that we live in no solved sense , but it &apos;s just a model of reality , but it &apos;s just a reality , of reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our irply stirpy set that our irply , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share essential essential .
We all all come . We all all procream .
We &apos;re subject to start with initiation .
We have to deal with death of death , so we don &apos;t surprise and we &apos;re seeing --
We all have an art .
What hits is the particular rhythm of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that they &apos;re the Borneo &apos;s forests , or the following the Voodoo &apos;s desert , or the desert of the Kaise in Kenya , in Kenya sevil , Curander &apos;s Curander &apos;s Ande , or a cammelt in the heart of Sahara .
He was my journey of journey in the desert a month ago , or an expanded an yak in the West values , on Mr. Everest , on Mast , Everest , the dea mother of the world .
All of these populations teach that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving around the world .
And , if you reflect a second , it &apos;s a concept that it can give you hope .
Together , the track of cultures the world are making a spiritual , and cultural life that happens the planet and it &apos;s important to the planet , and it &apos;s important to the planet , as biosphere .
And you can think of this cultural spill as a kind of ethnosh and you can call the etnosphere , the total of all of the concepts , dreams , mit , ideas , inspiration , intuitions , taken out of being the human imagination from the alba of aaaaaaawareness .
The ethnosphere is the fantastic of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be as as a pollution .
And because biosphere was very very much of the ethnc , it was very quickly to the ethnosh , and unfortunately much more quickly .
No biologist , for example , would say that 50 percent of all species was or is about the aesintion is just about , or -- in the most opocalyptic -- in the most opocalyptic field -- in the field of biological diversity -- and not just approximately -- that of cultural diversity .
The one of this is , of course , the language loss .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just a vocabulary or a series of rules , or a series of rules , which is a series of rules .
A language is the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle of every culture comes in in the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a stick , a thought , a spiritual ecosystem .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we sit down to Monterey , at least half not is sussurrounded in the ears of children .
They don &apos;t get teached children , which means less to say , unless to change something , which is already death .
What is more sad than you have to be the silence , of the last to talk about a language , the last to talk about a language , the way to transmit the wisdom of anticipate or anticipate the children ?
This is the one of somebody in the world &apos;s been in some of the world every two weeks . every two weeks of a fairly muster and brands with the tomb &apos;s ultimate language .
And I know somebody of you will say , &quot; Don &apos;t it better ?
The world wouldn &apos;t it be a better place if we were going to let all talk about the same language ? &quot; We all talk about yoruba .
We talk about kogi .
You &apos;ll find a sudden what it means you can &apos;t talk about their language .
I &apos;d like to do a journey through the etnosphere --
a little journey in the ethnosphere to give you a assage of what we &apos;re lost .
Many of us forget that when I say &quot; several ways of exist , really , really , very different ways of exist .
Let &apos;s take for example of this Barasana child , in the Amazon Sytherony , the people of the anaconda , which creds in the latest of the milk &apos;s check &apos;s the river of the milk &apos;s shoulders .
It &apos;s a people who cannot distinguished color from the green color , because the celestified color from the green because the time of the forest , that it depends the people .
They have a strange language and a rule , called &quot; examination , &quot; Portum , &quot; Purity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You have to marry a person who talks a different language .
All of that has roots in the mitological past , but the particularity is that in these families six or seven languages because of matririries a language .
They &apos;re just listening to listen and then start talking about .
We take one of the most interesting tribe with which I lived , the Waorans of Ecuador , a amazing people who had the first contact in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionary have been trying to make a fatal mistake .
They &apos;ve been getting off the photographs that retrated them in the sheets that were going to return that this pluent people in the pluent that this rainforest people had never seen anything bi-dimensional .
They collected the photographs from land , they turned around to the research of a shape or a figure , and not out , they found out that it was the haise , and they killed the five missionary .
But Waorans didn &apos;t just kill the foreign &apos;t just the foreign &apos;t killed the foreign .
They killed each other .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by their own .
We were saving generations of course , and we found two natural death cases , and when we &apos;ve insisted to know , they admit that was invested by by by invecked , and then they killed him , and then they killed him , and then killed him . I mean , they had an incredible knowledge of forest .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine from 40 steps and recognize species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned a really interesting job when my Harvard professor , asked me if I would go to Haiti to go to Haiti in the early early &apos; 80s , and I impossessor of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes , and impossessor .
To make sense of a miraculous , I should understand Voodoo culture and that Voodoo &apos;s not magic .
It &apos;s pretty a complex metaphorrific view of the world .
Very interesting .
If I asked you to tell me about the world &apos;s great religions , what would you say ?
Christianity , Islam , Buddhism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Sharian Africa has no religious faith . And instead , and the Voodoo is not the distilled to these religious concepts of these religious concepts of religious concepts .
What makes interesting is that voodoo is the intense relationship between life and death .
So , the vives are going to be the spirits .
Arequire that can be invocated by the Great Acqua , they respond to the rhythm of dance and replace temporary to the live so that for a short moment , the following way that for a short moment , then the following following to become the god .
So , this voodooists like , &quot; You want white , you go to church to talk about God .
We give us to the theme and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re posssat , is the spirit that drives you , how can you get wrong ?
So you see these incredible events : following the voodoo in state of trance that touches intimate , you know , you know , you know , a pretty strong kind of extremely powerful to the body when it &apos;s catalyzed in a state of extremely excitation .
In all the people with whom I lived with the most extraordinary is Kogi of Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta , in in the sector .
And you know , when you were a tyranged on charge , which once lived on the charged chargent plan of Colombia on the volcanic masses , the people retreat on the volcanic masses that are being herself on the charge charge .
In a continent of blood , this people had never been conquised by the spagnoled .
I &apos;m actually actually actually an extraordinary , but their trained , they &apos;re very extraordinary .
The young people are taken off by families to three or four years , and they live secrets in a good world and shading in a good world and shading the base of the frozen frozen at the base of the frozen payed by the 18 years .
Two periods of nine years , by the way to reproduce the nine months of gestation that they go into the mother of the usual , now they &apos;re metaphor in the usual of the Great Maaaather .
For all of this time , they &apos;re acctured to the values of their society , which predicts that their prayers and just their prayers and keep the prayers and they keep the cosmic balance .
And so the term of this incredible initiation , they &apos;re suddenly brought out and for the first time , of 18 years , they see an alba age . And that &apos;s what they &apos;re going to learn about the first balls , and the sun the stick , when the sun fits in the whole valuable . The pret pret is all about the splendor . The pret does a step of time , and says :
&quot; Visto me as ? I said .
It &apos;s amazing . Now it &apos;s now to you can protect it . &quot;
They call the greater brothers and say that we , brothers , and we &apos;re the colputing of the world &apos;s destruction .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the Indigenes and the environment invores and the old history of the wild noble , which is a razy concept , or maybe we invode Thoreau and we say that these people are closer to Earth .
Redwood people are not feelings , or indebate .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the evil Asmat Asmat or in the vents of Tibet , but because of time and rituals , they created a mystical mystical of the Earth is not about consciousness of essness is untire-known to human awareness . The concept that the Earth can live only because it &apos;s infused by human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
That &apos;s a little bit different with the Ande who will grow credying the mountain is an Apu that will lead to be human being deeply a deeply different , and it &apos;s going to have a very different relationship with the mountain or that place , or that respect to a Montan who grocery mountain is a cluster of rocks in the mountain is a massive rocks .
which is the dimora of a spirit or a mineral caught is irrelevant .
What &apos;s interesting is , the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia British believing that forests we had to be cut .
And that I have a different human being from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the forests of Hukukukukukukukukuk and the cannies that live in the Hukukuk-in initiation .
If you start to consider that these cultures can create reality , you can start to understand some of them , we can start to understand some of them . We take this plant .
I took this picture to open up the nordc Amazon the northwest .
Maybe some of you have heard about the ayahuasca , the most powerful psychophical psychophical active repertoire .
What makes the check of the ayahuasely , is not the potential of the substance , but his elaboration . It &apos;s about two elements .
From one side , this lian lighting of a coal lian , harmoline and harmoline , slightly hallucinogen , slightly hallucinogen , slightly hallucinogen , a lighting of the coal lian , slightly hallucinogen that lighting a bit of the leaving of the coal lian , a lian of the legny side ,
And by taking the only plant , you have a blueprint that alter a little bit of consciousness , but it &apos;s mixed with the leaves of a coffee family ards , and it &apos;s called Psychotry is saying .
This plant contains powerful , very similar to the serotonin , dimethyptamine , dimethyptamine .
If you ever see Yanomami thydimethydimethydimethydimethydimethydimethydimethydimethydimethydimethydimethydimethydimethyptamine .
Tiring that dust on the nose is a little bit like being shot from a bear of painting , and you can see on a sea of electricity . &#91; Risate &#93; Not a distortion of reality . It doesn &apos;t create a distortion of reality .
I often said to my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who had been shown , and the man who had been shown , with her discovery of hallucinogens in Mexico .
I think that I &apos;m my thesis not going to classifting these tripptamine as , because if you &apos;re made not telling anybody to be hallucinated . &#91; Risate the tripamine &#93; trtrtramines , but they can be abandomly be , because they &apos;re dencaturated by a enzyme that &apos;s of course , in a foot , which is , of course , in the cabinowising ,
It &apos;s possible to be assume , because it &apos;s possible to above with other chemicals that would be MAO .
Now it &apos;s the beautiful : the Tibeta-coal , which is inhibitors of MAO , the same kind of need to potence the triptamine . The question of spontaneously surprising : in a 80,000 species of plants , like these people have to find two defologically not similar , but that if you can combine defological . But that is what &apos;s the sum to the parts of the parts ?
We use the big eugly of the evidence and the error , which can reveal to be infruttifer .
But if we ask Indians , we say , we &apos;ll say , we &apos;re going to say , &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribe , the Cofan , has 17 ayahuasca , who distinguished nicely in the forest , and that at our eyes would come into the same species .
If we ask them how they stbipping their toxonomy will say , &quot; I thought , &quot; I thought , &quot; Do you know , you don &apos;t know , I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take the 17 varieties in a night of moon , and they &apos;ll have a different tone .
With this is not graduate at Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than counting the stami .
Now , &#91; applausers &#93; the problem is that the ones of us have to heart people who have painting , but somehow relief to the sea of the history of our real world , and it &apos;s going to go beyond .
In fact , the 20th century , in 300 years , it &apos;s not going to remember her or his technological innovations , but rather like the one was where we stopped and and we abbracactivity and we abbracactively abbracactivity of the mass and cultural diversity of the planet . Now the problem is not change .
All the cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibilities .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Six Indians have no smitted to be Sioux when they put up the arc and frecent as Americans have no stop being American when they put on the horse and hot .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that threatening the integrity of etnosh . It &apos;s the power .
The hard hard to domination .
And if you look at the world , I &apos;ll find that these are not cultures to disappear .
They &apos;re living creatures and spined out of forces from forces that are out of identificable to come beyond their adaptation .
Which it &apos;s a disboscampaigns in the Penan --
a people who were Sarawak , in Sarawak , in the Asian East , a people who lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to a generation , and now reduced to the servitery and the prostitution of rivers , where you can see the river from the lim , which seems to be carried out of the newest Chinese , where the nable ones are becoming up with the horizon ,
It &apos;s ready to fill the wooden wooden .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that have come with the discovery of the gold .
If we move on the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the hard hard hard to see , you &apos;ll see the hard hard to see the domain of political domination .
As you know the genocide , the extinction of a people who are universal level , but the ethnic , but the ethnocience of the style of a people , not just is constyle , but it &apos;s also part of the development strategifts .
And you can &apos;t understand the Tibet until you go from the beginning .
I &apos;ve path the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in the West Tibet , coming to Lhasa young guy , but just came to Lhasa young link , but only came to Lhasa young , but only came to Lhaaaaadial statistics that we feel talking .
6,000 monuments sacred reduced in dust and centers .
1.2 million people killed the military during the Cultural Revolution .
And the father of this guy who was assigned to the Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed to the times of the Chinese invasion .
His uncle to Santice in the diaspora that led the people in Nepal .
Her mother was imprisoned and his cholf was rich .
It was brought to hide at the age of two hidden was born under his gonna tank because he couldn &apos;t have any of him .
The sister , who did the same , was put in reduction field .
A day , he revertitled a refining fascient Mao and , for this transgression , was put to the forced to forced to forced the forced jobs for seven years .
The Tibet can be insopposable , but the insopposable , but the insane of the people is from tener .
And then , it turns out to a choice .
We want to live in the world of monocromatic , or we want to get the policy world of diversity ?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he died said that his greatest fear was that we go to this amord vision of the world , not only we &apos;ll see the entire gams of human imagination , we &apos;ll see the entire gams of thinking , but one day we &apos;ll see a day we &apos;ll wake up to a sleep persususe to us to a sleep to forget that there .
And it &apos;s humiliating that we have been 600,000 years old .
The Neolitica Revolution , which gave us agriculture , who gave us us us us us us to the seed of seed , by giving the poetry of the skip , with the poetry of specialization , and we &apos;re talking about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has to stent .
That shark story doesn &apos;t suggests me that we have the answers to all the challenges we &apos;re going to have to deal with in millennies to come .
When to these myrihics of cultures the world is asked what it means to be human , they answer to be human , they answer with 10,000 different voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all refer the possibility of being what we are : a conscious species , which has to make all the people and gardens can be going to be what we &apos;re : a great moments of optimism .
I took this picture of the north of Baffin the island of Baffin , when I went to the whales with Inuit , and this man , Olaya , and the man , Olaya , and he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The canadese government wasn &apos;t always kindness with the Inuit and the 1950s to stabilire our suprematiracy , we have them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refused to go .
His , temting for his life , he brought him all the weapon , and all of his toys .
You know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t have the cold , they exploit .
The skades of the origin , in origin , which was made of fish in the spaces .
The grandfather of this man didn &apos;t intimidnight or from the arctic or the bylizer .
It &apos;s disgaped away , he &apos;s hot the panthaked in the skills of focused and defected in their hand . When I did it frozen , he &apos;s working with a lighting .
He spring up the sale of this cackle of this cackle , and when I became solid , he killed a dog .
He sheloied the dog and created a bright , with the toracy , he snap , he sent on the banks , and he stunned on the banks , the crank , the choll of the bank , the crank in the bank , it &apos;s got a bunch ,
We want to talk about horse with anything ? &#91; Risate &#93; And that , in different ways , &#91; Applausi &#93; &#93; is the symbol of the Inuit and of all the Indies and all the Indies people in the world .
In the open 1999 , the CCCCCCancy reduced to Inuit the total control area of a greater land of California and Texas together .
It &apos;s their new pathian . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s an independent land . They all have mineral resources .
A beautiful example of how a natione-state could reconcilie with his people .
And , to finish , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious to the people who we have been in these remote areas of the planet , I realized they &apos;re not remote .
For somebody is home .
They represent sections of the human imagination that go back to the time . And for us all of these children , as dreams of these children , as the dreams of these children , are part of the soud of hope .
And we &apos;re in National Geographic we are convinced that politicians will never get to nothing .
We believe that polemics --
&#91; Applausers &#93; are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month our website has to tell the stories . Every month our website .
156 countries transmit our television .
Our magazines are lected by millions .
Our work is traveling into the ethnosion to bring our public places in a wonderful cultural places that are going to go away from what they &apos;ve seen and , hopefully , abbracing , for a year &apos;s central reveal of the exist of anthropology : the merita merges of exist in a pluralist and muralist , muralist and munulticultural world , and we have to find a life in a pluralist and muncent , muralist and mundle for a world in a world in a world of life in a world of life
where the wisdom of all people can contribute to our collective well-being .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that book that I hope you &apos;ve heard and try to highlight some connection , in case you don &apos;t notice them .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the official dogma . &quot;
What &apos;s the official ?
The dogma official society of all the West industrial companies . The dogma offal dogma : &quot; If we want to maximum the well-being of our citizens . &quot;
The reason is , on one side , in fact that liberty is itself itself a value , is precious , useful , essential , for human beings .
On the other hand is that if we are free , we can do that if we are free , we can do to just understand to make everything that massively our well-being , no one that decide in our well-one .
The way to massively freedom is massively choice .
More choices , the more of people are free , and the greater is their well-being , the greater is their well-being .
This , I think , is so deeply doubt in society that nobody would have a doubt .
And it &apos;s also deeply rown in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;ll let me a simple note about the conditions for the winds .
In my supermarket is 175 conditioning , without contact the 10 varieties of olive olive oil and 12 hats you can buy to make a huge number of conditions that you can buy a huge amount of conditions in the circumstances that nobody of 175 .
Here &apos;s what the supermarket .
And then you go to the electronics store to buy a stereo : cases , CD reader , radio , plastra , lifting , light .
And in this single electronics store , there &apos;s a big audio number of audio .
We can make six and a half million different combinations using the components that there are in one only store .
You need to admit that there &apos;s a lot of choice .
Other fields : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all the telephone services , at the shelf that were provides to be mad .
They were noleggied the phone , you didn &apos;t buy it .
One of that , between the other , was that the phone had never break .
These times are gone .
Now we have a nearly illimited variety of phones , especially between cell phones , especially between cell phones .
Here &apos;s cell phones .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , cut them off MP3 , cut off the kitchen , and forth for chromantic chronist .
If you haven &apos;t seen it yet , you saw in the house store , you &apos;re very soon to get .
And what &apos;s happening is that people come into the stores and ask that question . And what is the answer ? The answer ? The answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t make too much .
So , in other ways of life that are much more important than the acquises , it &apos;s the same explosion of choices .
Assistence : don &apos;t happen more in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor &apos;s doctor and you say you need to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; Okay , we could do A , or &quot; A has these benefits and these risks &quot; B , and these risks . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Doctor , what would I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; You know , and the risks , and B has these benefits , and B has these benefits and risks . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebact , &quot; Doctor if she was me , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
And the result we call it &quot; self-expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But it &apos;s not that you can move the weight and responsibility of making someone who knows something , which is the doctor , to somebody who knows about , and almost sick , to somebody else that knows about -- and almost , of course , it &apos;s not the ideal condition to make the power .
There &apos;s a huge marketing of products , directly to people like me and you , who if you think about it doesn &apos;t make sense , because we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why are we advertising them ?
The answer is that they want to ask them to ask them to ask them to require them .
Something that is that we don &apos;t really want to be our orphoto of choice , as you see in this vignity , &quot; We don &apos;t want to force kids . Soreaughter as we don &apos;t get an identity to the right moment . We have to invent .
And we can reinvent us how many times we &apos;ll get .
which means that every morning , at the riskly , you have to decide what kind of person want to be .
I &apos;m going to family and the matrimonum , a time , the common perspective , almost for anyone , was that there married you can , and it started to be the most soon possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when you , and not even what to do after .
I &apos;m doing this , it &apos;s really to play .
I teach them to very smart students , and I &apos;m going to them 20 percent in less of work than a time .
And not because they &apos;re not very brilliant , not because they &apos;re less diligent .
But why are I imposy , I mean to ask , &quot; Should I marry or not ? Should I get to do that ? &quot;
&quot; Should I get a little bit ? I have to think before children or the career ? &quot;
They are logoring .
And they &apos;re trying to answer these questions , even though this implica don &apos;t complete the homework and not get a good voice to my exam .
And they have to really do that . They &apos;re important questions .
Now , the job : we &apos;re lucky , as Carl underlying , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from the Hotel Randolph .
And in the parentis , there &apos;s a angolin , and I don &apos;t say that , where WiFi works .
I don &apos;t say that , because I want to use me .
What does this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work ? Is it we need to continuously decide , continually every time , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing soccer , with cell phone in a pocket , Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , typically , on the knees .
And even if I &apos;m all spending , every minute we see our son to roving the game , we &apos;re also asking , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; Do we need to answer this ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? I have to email this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is is &quot; no , &quot; all of this makes the experience of your son very different than what it would be in other conditions .
So , anywhere we look , small things , small and big things , and materials and lifestyle , life is a question of choices .
And once the world was this : White , there were some possibilities , but it wasn &apos;t all about choice .
The world of today is a good thing , or is , &quot; Is it a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is to us .
So the positive positive layers we know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative .
All of this is really really really really two negative effects of people .
The first , paradoxysis that produced paralysis that it makes paralysis that it makes paradoxysis that it makes paradoxysis that that it &apos;s paradoxysis that it makes paradoxysis that it makes paradoysis that it makes paralysis that it makes paradoows
With a lot of options between which choosing , it &apos;s very difficult .
I give you a significant example : a study of volunteer plans .
A colleague access to Vanguard data , the giant company , the giant company of pension , with about a million clients .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offering in more , the percentage of adhesion .
With 50 offers funds , there &apos;s 10 percent less than adhit , when they &apos;re available ?
Because with 50 funds of which choices , is sictly difficult to decide , and the choice came back to indomans .
And tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and tomorrow , and of course I never get .
You know , it doesn &apos;t mean only that these old workers are missing food for dogs because they &apos;re not going to have enough money , even to say that decision is so unlike that , they lose the funds of the datory of work .
Not participating , they &apos;re losing up to five dollars per year from the job dator , which would be well disposed to be there .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think it makes the world .
&quot; And to finish , for ethernity : ketchup , maionese sends ? &quot;
Would you like to make the right decision , if it &apos;s eternity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and they &apos;re not going to pick up the wrong .
So that &apos;s the first effect . The second is that even if we can avoid the paralysis and to make a choice , at the end of how we would be with less options .
And that for a different reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions that you choose , if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have done a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the imagined alternative . And what happens is that the imagined alternative to us to us , you know , it &apos;s just about the decision ,
even when it was a very good decision .
More choices , there are , the easier of any detail that &apos;s insatisfaction is insatisfaction of choice .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert clarified as well as it is the value that we give things depended with .
And the rest of the options , when there are many options of , it &apos;s easy to represent the alternative to the option of option that is choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m sorry with all of the ones that are not New York .
But that &apos;s what you probably think .
There &apos;s this couple of Hamptons .
A luxury .
It &apos;s all about splendida . Otspapes . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not missing . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , the dust , it &apos;s Agust . &quot;
&quot; All my neighbors in Manhattan are away . &quot;
&quot; I could park right in front of the home . &quot;
And it goes to two weeks on the idea that &apos;s losing -- every day -- every day -- the ability to park where it wants .
costo-opportunity , costo-imminishes the satisfying for what we have , even when choice excellent .
And the more are the options that we have to consider , the more attractive features will be return to the costo-opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
It &apos;s about living the moment , and maybe of living slowly .
But the most important point is that whatever you choose , you choose to not do the other .
The things that we don &apos;t choose to attract that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : the growing expectations .
I tried it on my skin bought a new couple of jeans .
I &apos;m just just a jeans .
Once jeans were just one , and they were bought and dress and dressed and they were uncomcomfortable , just after they brought them a whole life and they were all good times , they started going to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple of jeans when those old were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
And the commess said , &quot; You want to slim fit , do you know , fit ? &quot;
I want to do it with cernic or with the buttons ? &quot; Stonewashed , &quot; or &quot; acidum &quot;
&quot; Would you like ? &quot;
&quot; And they want to strects or bla ? ? Bla bla . &quot; Continupright .
I was unblefed , and after a while I was able to say , &quot; I want the guy , which was the only guy , &quot; he didn &apos;t know what it was , so for a hour I tried everybody &apos;s sick jeans , and I came out of jeans , and then I came out of the jeans , and the best couple of jeans I had .
It was the maximum . I had the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse is that with all of that choice , my expectations were so so much , the jeans had to be perfect .
I had expectations of my expectations . I didn &apos;t expect anything exceptional when there was a 100 different kind of , but when I saw 100 different , which was to be perfect .
What I did was good , but not perfect .
After I had compared to the one I was trying to do with what I was trying to do was forced to expectations .
The adds of options in the life of people don &apos;t do that to increasing the excellence of the options of the options of the same .
And that will make less satisfying , even when the results are good .
No one in the world of marketing if it is .
Because if they knew it , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more to that .
&quot; It was better when it was worse , &quot; The reason he was better when it was worse was even even even even even encounter .
We &apos;re looking at the world where we live -- opulent industrialized opulent , industrialized citizens with the expectancy of perfeatures .
You never surprised me so that your expectations , because your expectations , I had to be ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Besearative , &quot; Yes , you want to . &quot;
I mean -- little authographical moment -- which I &apos;m really married and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t have done it .
But it &apos;s not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of a couple of jeans , when there &apos;s just that kind of jeans is that when you &apos;re not satisfied , and you ask , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot; The answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What would I do ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of jeans , and you buy a insoddisdisfacing , and you ask who is the responsible , it &apos;s just clear that responsible , it &apos;s so clear that responsible you &apos;re .
You could have done better .
With hundreds of variety , there are no scans for insuccess .
So when people get decisions , even though the result is valid , they feel insatisfaction and give the blame .
In the last few years , depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only , but important -- of this udepression is that people have deludent experiences because standards are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation they think it is their .
So the final result is that we &apos;re better , we &apos;re better , but we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely fake . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit of choice better than having any of it , but it &apos;s not going to be a lot better .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic value . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure that we &apos;ve overcome from a piece of the level where the choices improved our life .
Now , from a politician -- I almost finished -- from the political point of view , the peanch is the following .
What allows all this to industrial society is the wealth .
There are a lot of places in the world , and you know , where the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too bad .
So the thing I &apos;m talking about is a malfy that I &apos;m talking about is a malage of modern , recheck , which is Western society .
And what it does depressing and angry is this : Steve Levitt spoke about how much those expensive expensive and display samins for children are ineless . It &apos;s a money push of a money .
I mean these choices , complicated and dispended , it &apos;s not that they &apos;re just inutilize .
I &apos;m deleterie .
They do have worse .
If a little of what we do is in our society allows so much choice , it &apos;s not just their life to improve , it &apos;s not just their life to improve but our .
This is what economists call is a partable-improvement .
A redistribution of income redistribution does well -- not just to poor -- because of this , excess that it takes us .
To conclude , &quot; You can get what you want . &quot;
You , people of culture , you &apos;ll think , &quot; What does it believe that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t do anything in a glass . &quot;
&quot; A castrade imagination , a limited vision of the world -- &quot;
I &apos;m going to do it this way , at the beginning .
But then , thinking about it , I realized that that that fish knows the long knows that that fish knows the long time .
Because the reality is that if you &apos;re missing in the bocrs , so that &quot; everything is possible . &quot; You can &apos;t get freedom . You can &apos;t get freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you break the mess , so it &apos;s all possible to decrease satisfying .
You get the paralysis , and you reduce the well-being .
They all need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too strange , maybe even for us .
But the absence of a few symbolic sphere is a recipe for inhappiness and I &apos;m , I &apos;m going to the raising .
Thank you very much .
