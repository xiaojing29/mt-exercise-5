Last year I showed these slide slide to demonstrate that the artica calculal calculal , which for almost three million years of the United States continent , you know , 40 percent of the United States continent , you know , 40 percent .
But there is the gravity of the gravity of the problem , because it &apos;s not exhip in the ice .
The artables glacial , is , in a sense , the heart of global global global global global global system .
It &apos;s extremely inverse and you get summit .
The next slide will be a remarkable remarkable to be a remarkable revenue of the last 25 years .
The glaciers are signed in red .
As you see , you see , you &apos;re going to go to the blue blue .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter , which requires of the summit .
You can see that the costs of five years or more , or more , is like the blood , that here was going to be a healthcare , and that &apos;s a body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been from so ,
This is a problem because the reaching reaching the terrain the ocean , where there are huge huge amount of fuel , where there are huge huge amount of fuel , they &apos;re transformed in the middle of the microbes .
I &apos;m going to the totality of the atmosphere of global warming , that may be doubling , that might be doubling , super-up , super-up , super-return this point of not reritation .
In some pro-ffounded lagues in Alaska metan already is already rebing water .
The professored Katey Walter University of Alaska team of Alaska team , a team of the Alaska team , last inverse the last inverse .
Video : Wow ! Gore : You &apos;re good . The question is if we &apos;re going to be .
A reason is that this exchange , the termal surride of the Groenlandia .
This is a regime to regime glacial .
And he had never reach free free .
This is the Kangerland .
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea level of the sea , you know , here is where the sea .
These are increasing .
On the other part of the planet : Antartide , the biggest ice of the planet .
Last month , the scientists have deeply deaths of the ice is in negative , and that Antarccccy , which pogy on some iun subarine , it &apos;s particularly reished in the sun .
It &apos;s six feet of the actual level , like in Groenlandia .
Sulil Himalaya , the third largest ice of ice , you see new lagues , which a few years ago , that a few years ago .
The 40 percent of the world &apos;s population of the potential of the potential .
Sulle Ande : This glglacier is the source of the potential water of this city .
The ported is increased .
But when it demines , the same accounts to the water .
In California , the SSea Nevada is 40 percent deminued in 40 percent .
The hyrici are in cribes .
The previsions , like you read , I &apos;m grass .
The growing growing depend in the world door to a reach of the inceness .
The environmental disasers are increasing a ritual out of the normal and without previous .
Four most many many many many many years than the previous 75 .
This is a relation of all insustainable .
If you look at the historic context , you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we &apos;ve add 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every 24 hours .
Look at the middle of the Pacific , the Man , from the Americans , and both both of the subcontinent , where there is a radical rooms , where there is a radical rowing of oxygen in the oceans .
The greatest causes global warming , with the forestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of a bustible comstible .
The oil is a problem , and the coal is even worse .
The United States are one of the two of the most hemissions ,
And it was proponed to build a lot of other central central .
But we &apos;re seeing a change .
These are the annullated in the last years and some alternative alternative .
And so , there &apos;s a politics in our country .
And the industrial and oil are spesh 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the fuel , which is a symptomtomorrow , which is a symsymboboy .
And that was reminded to something --
I know Natal , in the Tennessee , where there was a loss of 3.8 billion lights of the four-payers of the fuel .
Maybe you have seen the news .
This is the most big flow of the flow of America .
It &apos;s success around Natal .
The public advertising one of the industrial industrial .
Video : See the carbon is a shoot and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it &apos;s growing our economy .
It &apos;s more pulit .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and the work are repend .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest society is Massey Coal . This is his friend &apos;s Massey Coal .
Video : The Blankenship : I &apos;ll clear clear -- I &apos;ll say -- Al Gore , Nancy Peloses , Harry Reid -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for Prottion of the Clima Clima has been launched two campaign .
This is a part of them , a part .
Video : Attore : At the ALergy we see the climate change as a serious mines to our business .
So , for this is invest a big amount of money in a big amount of money in a fort to make public public and confused the truth .
In fact , the coal is not to be .
We think it &apos;s pulit -- it &apos;s also a good profumo .
So , you don &apos;t predict of climate change .
Let me tell us .
Video : Attore : The Cone pulit -- you &apos;ve heard a lot of a lot .
So you &apos;re doing a little bit of a weather in a look at the heat for the fuel .
Straordinariarily ! The cars are a little rumorose , but this is the sound of the fuel technology of the fuel .
The consumption of the coal warming is between the global warming , but the remarkable technology , but the remarkable technology that you see see all .
You have a look at : this is the odiern technology of the clean .
Al Gore : Infine , the positive alternative to the economics and the economics of the economics and the nation-security .
Video : The America is in the crisis ; the economy , the health , the health , the climate crisis .
The filo that connection to all : our dependence from the commobile fuel , as the fuel and oil oil .
Now , there &apos;s a new , audace solution to use .
Rey America : 100 percent of the clean , in 10 years .
A plan to reach America , to make us more sure , and to stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that basts to solve our problems .
I &apos;m going to America .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : You know , it &apos;s to reach energy to America .
One of the faster ways to bring the end of the dependence from the comfortable that killing our planet .
Comparsa : The future is here . I feel , sun , a new energy network .
Comparent 2 : Nggs investing for places that are very well retributed .
So , I mean America . It &apos;s time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old old snap African says , &quot; If you want to go fast , you go to the faster ,
If you want to go away , you go together . &quot;
We have to go , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED I did a introduction in the HC .
And you promising to reach you to reach you to go to the car .
So , I &apos;m going to get there . And for those that other time there were no , the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever attacked -- 27 kilometers of circles .
His task is to reach the conditions that were less than a billion dollars in the beginning of the universe -- until to 600 million times a second .
That &apos;s just environmental .
This is the car under Ginevra .
So , we &apos;re going to go through these mini-Big Bang in the remarkable .
That &apos;s what I work . It &apos;s called AS -- is a 44 feet and has a diameter diameter diameter dieter .
This is a spectacular picture of AS . In this construction , so you can notice the proportions .
The 10 to the last year we &apos;ve got the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by AS TLAS .
It was because of immense of immention in control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first fascinating particles that had been done all around the LC , entring in the HC , and spread particles , with a part of the HC , and spread particles in the remarkable .
In other words , when we see that picture the 10 10 , and it &apos;s capable , and that the car worked , which was a big vittory .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be .
What we means we have a cultural impact beyond the scientific scientific .
It &apos;s a week later , there was a problem with the machine , to just these files , to that &apos;s all these files .
These files take 13,000 ampampes when the car works at the massive .
Now , the technical between you will look at the files and say , &quot; it &apos;s not true . They &apos;re too good . &quot; They &apos;re too good . &quot;
And instead , they can do that because when they &apos;re very cold to become the superconducucuction .
So , at less 271 degrees , to a nurt temperature in the stars , these files can bring that current .
In one of the giunture between the most novemiil in the HC , there was a defect of facfacing .
So the films re-up lawers , and 13,000 ampampas a sudden , and the 13,000 ampampity .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impression if you think that these magnees are more than 20 tons , and that they were moved to about 30 centimeters .
They &apos;re damaged about 50 magnear 50 magnetic .
We had to task them , what we did .
We have repristined and reached .
They &apos;re now going to go back to all their sub-to-up .
LHC will be new .
We &apos;re going to encount , and we expect to judge , and continue to continue so our reach , and continue so our adventure to find what the universe is .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents reaching the value of science and engineering engineering and engineering engineering .
I think that &apos;s so difficult , the fact of going beyond the limits , I think is the value of things like LHC .
I &apos;d like to conclude with words of an Inglese , Humphrey Davy , which I guess , in the remarkable to the experiments of his pupilicers , his pupillicer was Michael Faraday , said , &quot; No is a dangerous for progress , and it &apos;s a lot of the dedepend , and that it doesn &apos;t have to be a little bit of the new monkeys , and that we &apos;re all all of them ,
Thank you .
I want to start asking you &apos;re looking at when , you &apos;re playing with children , you play with the morning .
While you know how to reach them and mistakes them , and move them , and they learn them , and they learn to think and solving them , and to be able to think and to be able to be able to think and solving them , and let them get them , and let them get them , and to understand them , and let them get them , and let them get them , and let them get them , and let them , and let them get them , and make them , and make them , and make them ,
The space is deeply connection to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , by the useful inspired by the useful of our interaction with physicists , together to my consult Pacts , and the collaborator , and the collaborator , I started asking me , &quot; and if we use a computer , instead of having the mouse as a computer , instead of having the mouse as a pass of the mouse as a pass , and it &apos;s just a digital , the mmouse , and it &apos;s hands , the hands ,
and it &apos;s going to be a pleasure ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the Siftable .
In powers , a Siftable is a big interactive computer as a big biscope .
In powers , a Siftable is a big interactive computer as a big biscope .
You can move with the hand , you can see , &quot; you can see , &quot; between them , and they have a screen and a radio radio .
But most of the way , they &apos;re physicists , as the morning , you can just move them to .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physicists , you know , you know , the other , and the hand that become more physicists , and they become more physicists , the other , of the other , of the other , of the other , as we can explore new and fun of interaction .
I &apos;m going to try with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show the video : if you &apos;re incline it in a direction , the video will be so , if you &apos;re going to be so , if you &apos;re going to get back .
These are containing to the other .
If I said , you know , they &apos;re interested in what &apos;s them around .
If they &apos;re surrounded it and they notice it , you know , and they can act a bit .
If they &apos;re surrounded it and they notice it , you know , and they can act a bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
And then we realized that one of the interesting interesting implications of the interaction was the way to use that that we could use the common common , &quot; as if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configured as a very nice , and I can use them to use them to the color color in the central , where they &apos;re missing .
and I can use them to put them to put it in the central , where they &apos;re missing .
If we &apos;re too , we can reach a little bit of it .
I also also think of the appropriate , like the ingue , like the ingue , the mathematics and games of logic where people can try things things , and see the immediately .
Now , I &apos;m --
This is a sequence of the Fibonacks that I do with a equation .
Here we have a game of words that is at half between Scarabeabeum and Boggle .
And basically , to every Bash , you know , in every Sifty , Pratically , Pratically , to every Bash , and as you &apos;re trying to take a letter -- and I try to understand him .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new set of letter and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the children came to the Media Lab , I did it so I tried to get them out and I went a video .
And they were very pleased .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of applied is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
You just say , &quot; How words &quot; &quot; &quot; Compons of words , and they know exactly what to do .
There is other people who try .
This is our own own little younger , there &apos;s the most young people there , there &apos;s right .
He was actually wanted to be a large pile .
They were just just the honcini , for him .
Now , this is an applied of a interactive cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool for the appropriate of the ingue of the ing-like .
It can put new characters in the scene , solving the Sifty , they associated with .
It can put new characters in the scene , solving the Sifty , they associated with .
So , he &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : The sun is sweat .
David Merrill : Now he took a treatment in the scene .
Video : The arrange treatment .
Bel work !
So , he shelking the Siftill and put them close to interact the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing your story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a final story with open , and it can decide him as a svolge .
DM : It &apos;s a final story with open , and it can decide him as a svolge .
Video : Gola , gat .
DM : The last example that I have the time to show you a tool , I realized that I was a recent , and to exact music .
It &apos;s a tool , I made of recent , to the campin and exchange .
The Siftable here is the sounds like the basis , and the bacteria .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose that use .
You can also also also put these sounds in a comporate sequence to your pleasure .
And it just just doing it a sound &quot; and a sequence . &quot;
These are actually that you can control from alive , as the reverse and the filter .
The acks to a particular sound and then incline for the travel .
And then there are the general effects as time and volume , and volume , that &apos;s the whole sequence .
We &apos;re looking at how it works .
Video : We &apos;re going to put a base in the Siftable , and we put a series of the sequence , &quot; we put in a series , we add another base , we add other base .
I &apos;m going to put a bottom line .
Video : Now I &apos;m going to add to the percussions --
Video : And I &apos;ll put the filter to the bacteria , so I can control the effect of the vious .
Video : DM : I can reach the whole sequence of the entire sequence , the time from one side or the side .
Video : And now I &apos;ll add the bottom to the bottom to the bottom to give more expression .
Video : DM : I can reach the sequence of the volo . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to planning it before , but I can suddenly , make it more flit .
And I finally , I can smoke the whole sequence of the left to the left the Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new interfaces as the car as they work as our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of this reach , and some possibility that we &apos;re trying to bring out of the lab .
And the concept I want to transmate you is that &apos;s coming this new generation of objects designed to interact with digital media , that will be information in our world .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the now to talk to all of you .
I &apos;m a scritual .
I &apos;m talking about books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that .
It &apos;s also love and the fascinating of my life .
And I don &apos;t know what it can change .
But , he said , something particular is that &apos;s been been in my life and my career , and I was a reacher with this work .
And the particular thing is that I &apos;ve been taken this book , this book called &quot; Mangia , Prega , Ama , Ama , &quot; which , diversously , for some reason that I was going to have a big sensational , and become a big sensational , send , and the previous interational international .
And the result is that everywhere , I think it &apos;s now , people treated me as if you were conducted .
It &apos;s true -- I was going to anned .
They &apos;re all worried about me and say , &quot; You don &apos;t have a painting more than you can &apos;t it feed ?
You don &apos;t have a little bit of them to write all life without able to be able to create a book that can be able to be able to somebody ? &quot;
what can you know ? &quot;
It &apos;s ration-surance , you know .
But it may go worse , I remember that I remember that most of 20 years ago , when I began to say to people -- I was an adolescent -- I was a scritual -- I wanted to be a scritual .
I was going to be based on the same reaction .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you have to have success ?
You don &apos;t have the uliliant that the reflutes you ?
You don &apos;t have to do this mesh for all life without anything that &apos;s ever out and die on a cumb of a cumber of all the beat with the pieces of saming the pieces of failure ? &quot;
And so , you know .
The short answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; You . &quot;
I have a landscape of all those things .
I &apos;ve always been afraid .
And I also have a lot of other things that people would not be able .
As the alge and other things are very spaving .
But , what I said , what I thought and I ask me , and I ask me that ?
Is it ?
It &apos;s logic that everybody &apos;s wealed by a job that you &apos;re sent from a work that you were born to do .
But what &apos;s there so particular in the implant that we have to be nervous about the mental health . And so that other carefully do they don &apos;t ?
As my father , for example , he was a chemical engineering and I don &apos;t remember a single time in his 40 years of activity in his 40 years of activity in the 40 years of activity ?
He never -- that I was never -- that I was not going to be ?
It doesn &apos;t work so , you know ?
Onestly , engineers as a group don &apos;t have any of course , in the seats , the reputation of being alcolized maniacation of being alcolized .
We have enough to be a lot of this reputation , and not just the writers , but we have this reputation of all , we have this reputation of the minds .
And it &apos;s not going to look at the trade and conteed his daters of the magnifers , and often for them .
And even those who don &apos;t seem to be really unsuicked by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before we die , in the last interview said , &quot; Every book has killed me a little bit more &quot; One extraordinary business about the work of its life .
But we don &apos;t say when we feel that we feel that we heard these things so much as we have all these things so much we have completely interiorized and accepted the note that the notes and the art that the art , and then , to be able to be a little bit of the anging , and then , to be able to the anging .
And the question I want to ask all here today is : you agree with this idea ?
You &apos;re good to that -- because it &apos;s also looking at the distance of me , not going to be well for anything that &apos;s supposed to me .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous and I don &apos;t want to see the perpeuated in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better encourage .
And I know that , in my case -- in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start to fight out of that I felt that I &apos;m in my career , wheever I got the circumstances in my career .
I &apos;m very young , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m pretty young ,
I &apos;ve still been about four decades work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything I &apos;m going to write now in the world as the world as the work that was after the world as the work that was after the last book .
I &apos;ll be a slavor , because we &apos;re all more or less there -- it &apos;s likely that my biggest success is to my own .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start to start blow in the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I &apos;m going to continue to do this work we we do this work .
So , the question is , how ?
And so I think , after a lot of thinking , after a lot of thinking to work to continue to write is what to create protective psychological depend , right ?
I &apos;ve got some way to find a distance of me , I &apos;m writing , and my natural natural ange to me , and my natural natural ange to get , and trying to all the year , trying to look through the time , trying to look through the other society , trying to find other society to see if they could have some of the best ideas and more better ideas and sane and and more and sane and and more and sane and more and sane and and sane and ,
as helps people people who are making the emotional ress of the emotional rests of creativity .
And that research me to the ancient Great and ancient Rome .
I do that , and I &apos;m going to go back .
Nantical ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people don &apos;t seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
It was thinking that the creativity was this spirit look at the beat and that sell men from a few people from a few distant and known , for distant and unknown .
The great-called these spirits of the becoming out of the demand . &quot;
Soccurrics , he was believed to have a demand that &apos;s a dealing that &apos;s a long time .
The Romans were the same idea , but they called the spirit of the body .
And the Roman is not really , because the Roman didn &apos;t think a genius was a genius was a genius was a genius was a genius was a genius was not really that a genius was a genius was a genius was a genius was a genius was a genius was a genius of intelligent .
They thought a genius was this kind of a genius that was literally living in the murs of a neighborhood , a little bit like the elsex of a very high , and he came out to the end of the work is artist , and models the result of the artist .
Here &apos;s the distance of the distance of which is the distance of which is that we protected from the results of your work .
And everybody knew that was so that was so that was , right ?
So the artists were protected by certain things , like for example , the most of the too narcisism , no ?
If your work was excited , you didn &apos;t take and all the merse , and all the mered , and all the seventually ,
If your work failed , it was not all of your work , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a inable .
And so people han concept of the Western &apos;s very long time .
And then the Rince came and everything is changed , and it changed , and it &apos;s all this great idea ; we put the human in the universe , over all of the universe , and the mysters and so so they said , they said , &quot; by the divinity .
This was the principle of humanity and people began to think that the whole creativity came from the hyduo .
And for the first time in history , you know , you know , I &apos;m going to reference this or that artist as a rather rather than a person with a rather than a person .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think I hope to somebody , a simple person to believe that I think of being as a recipient as a source , and the sister , and the sisters of all the mysters , and etern &apos;t a phililers and et-free philillion .
It &apos;s like to ask somebody of inopopophor .
It &apos;s completely details the ego and creates all these ingestimates to be expectations .
And I think it was this pression to have the artists in the 500 years .
And if that &apos;s true , and I think it &apos;s , and I think it &apos;s , and now ?
We can do it diversity ?
I &apos;m going to come back to a more ancient of human relationship between humans and mystery .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can &apos;t put 500 years of the rational talk of 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people between the audience that sold would be able to be able to be able to reach , insuit , you know , they &apos;re going to follow people on their own projects .
It &apos;s probably not convinced to you all about this .
But what I &apos;d like to ask is -- why not ?
Why don &apos;t you think that ?
Because it has more sense of anything that I &apos;ve ever heard to explain the exact exact exact imprevedance of the creative process .
A process that , as anyone who never tried to do something -- so basically , I think , basically , all here -- you know , you don &apos;t know , you know , you don &apos;t really have rationally .
And , in fact , it can sometimes seem completely paranoring .
I did this inherent with the extraordinary poeeted Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but that was a poeetly , for all life and said that during his own own life , and he was coming in the rural camps , and I felt it was in the front of the Virginia , and I felt it was going to come from the landscape .
I said that was like a frorous strongst .
And that was going to be roughout of her landscape .
I felt it was going to be , because it was tremendous land under his feet .
He knew to have one thing to do that point and was , he was , he was , his speaking as a matta . &quot;
And so it &apos;s going to go home and he was going to follow up from this poetry , and not have to be another piece of paper and a faster , as the trapt , and it &apos;s going to collect and mistake it on the page .
Sometimes , you couldn &apos;t be enough , so correct and correct and correct without able able able to get home and correct without able to get to home and her her lost and she would continued to continued to go through the landscape , trying to continued to go through the landscape , and he said , &quot; another few . &quot;
And then there were those times -- this piece of the size that I never dimensional -- there were the moments that was almost lost , OK ?
So , he was going to go home and she was trying to be a poetry of paper and it was a mature in the while he was going to go , and he said , he was like to halling with the other hand and the office .
He was going to be a poem from the code and reported the transcated to the page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be presented on the perfect page and inattag , but the contrary , from the last word .
So when I felt -- I thought -- it &apos;s pathesk , it &apos;s exactly the creative to my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- it &apos;s not a conducucucucucture .
I &apos;m a mule , and my work is ; I &apos;m a sweak , and I sweapons in the same orary , and to go to the wall and go over the way .
But even I , in my testables , I strike , I strike against that thing , sometimes .
And I guess , even many of you the han .
You know , even if the work and ideas came to me to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to know .
And what is this ?
And how can we relate to it to it , so that you don &apos;t lose the head , but , rather , that we &apos;re going to be san ?
And as I &apos;m about , the best example of the contemporary example I have a musician , which I interviewing years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the most part of life was the incard of the neighborhood is the same incareeeeer , trying to control , and to try to control , and reach these species of different interactions .
But then inveck , he hot , and a day he was driving on a call on a self-construct in Los Angeles , changed all for him .
He was going to be fast and all a little bit of a sudden this little framework , which comes in his mind as a mind as inspiration , and it &apos;s been able , and the desyppair , and the desyed , but it doesn &apos;t know how to take it .
It doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a mature , it has no matter a recorder .
So I began to feel this kind of old an-growing , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to feel like this song song of the beat .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to go into the panic , you stop .
He was going to put the whole mental process and made something completely new .
I just just the sky and said , &quot; I &apos;m not going to see that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; You know , what it looks like that ?
If you really want to exist , I &apos;m a more hurt time when I can take care of you .
Even , you &apos;re going to importantly than another today .
I &apos;m going to disturbing Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his work was working after this .
Not the work , the work was still hoscy as always .
But the process , and the ansia , and the ansia was reported when the genius , the genius that out of him , and it turns out of the other than that problems and freeed it back to where it was going to go back to where it was a thing interorized and horized .
but it &apos;s not this peculiar , wonderful bizarra collaboration between Tom and this straign , and this straign that there was no Tom .
So what I felt that story is to change a little bit , even the way I worked and already saved me .
This idea , I &apos;d saved me when I was writing , &quot; Mangia , Prua , and fall in a cave of the disperation of the disperation of the disperation that we all working on something and we can &apos;t start thinking that it &apos;s a disaster , which is the book .
Not just good , the worst book .
And I began to think of gecking this project .
But then I remember Tom who was talking to the air and try .
So I got my face on the manoscritical , and I reached my comments to a vacuum of the room .
And I said to high vices , &quot; Sents , what if this book is not going to be so so much not going to be interely , my ?
Because I &apos;m going to see that I &apos;m going to put all I have , I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want to be better , you have to presenting and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t know , you know what , I don &apos;t know , I &apos;m not not .
I &apos;ll say that the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to please that I was presented to me to do my part , &quot; because , at the end is so , OK -- I &apos;m going to do my part of North Africa of the North people who were employance to the dance of the North of the North of the people who went on on and the alel and the sacred .
And they were always magnifically , because the dots were professionals and were fantastic and were fantastic .
But every time , something was , something was , and one of these artists became actually transcendent .
And I know you know what I know , because I know that you &apos;ve all seen , in a certain point , a performance .
It was like the time , you &apos;re standing up , and she walked through a kind of portal and it was not different from the usually , 1,000 notes before , but everything was going to be able .
And suddenly , you know , it &apos;s not just as a human .
But it &apos;s happening from the diamong and luminated in the fire of divinity .
And when this was happening , the time , people knew what was , the people knew what was , called his name .
And they were the hands and began to bay , and began to dry , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
It &apos;s a historic notes -- when More invasery is the southern Spagna , I was this abstract with them and the ready to change in the lah , Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , &quot; and I still hear in the corride in the rede .
In Spagna , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , hole , and I &apos;m magnifiction , and it &apos;s a four-beat , and it &apos;s a four-God .
And it &apos;s great because we need .
But the problem comes the day , for the next day , for the same , when you see , when you &apos;re sweet and find that are 11 , and I &apos;m going to go to God there is no longer .
It &apos;s just a moral . It &apos;s just a lot of bad ginockey , and maybe it &apos;s never going to each other to that althetic .
And maybe nobody will be the name of God again , and what &apos;s going to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most pair of the most porose to do in a creative life .
But maybe it &apos;s not to be so corporate if you can &apos;t believe , advancing , and the most extraordinary aspects of your being being from you .
But he just believe that you &apos;re data in prestired by a source of a source of a source of the face of your life that &apos;s a part of your life that you have been finished .
And , you know , if we think about this way .
And so I began to think , and it &apos;s safe as I thought that I was thinking about about the work of the book that I will be able to be , the dangerous , the dangerous , and I &apos;m going to think of my great great great great .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I I feel electrized that is , not having fear .
Not reach to you . It &apos;s just your work .
You &apos;re going to show you for your part , any being .
If your work is balling , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , if your work is balling , you .
If the divine , you &apos;re kind of a little bit of wonder , and I just just just just just through the time , to just a moment through your forcing , then &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Only , you do the same .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot;
I think I was going to teach it .
&quot; Ole ! &quot; to you know the same , even only for having a human love and testables to be constantly to you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As I &apos;ve been talking about some of these things on the human genome , about what it can be significant and discovery of genome .
We &apos;re now starting to digital biology , we started digital the biology and now now now to start from that digital code , we &apos;re going to get into a new fase of biology , designing and synthesizing life .
We always tried to ask big questions .
&quot; What is the life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists I think we have been trying to understand vary free free .
We &apos;ve been trying to get different , reducing the minimi .
We &apos;re digital by almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to move from the analogical world of biology in the digital world of the computer world .
Now , we ask : we can regenerate life , or create new new life , or new from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycopma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome that can authoreplicate in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little little bit more small .
We can actually get a hundred of the genuary of about 500 than the genetic genetic .
But when we &apos;re a look at his metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our .
I think , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it &apos;s very improbable that this can bring to a living cell cell .
So we decided that the only to design reward that was synthesize this chchchchromosome in a way to be able to change the components to take some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the avure of &quot; Can we synthesize a chchchromosome ? &quot;
Can you have the conconfirm to produce these big molecules that we never have been able to create before ?
And , in case , we can make a chromosome that is going to work a chchchromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemical material .
The speed of that we &apos;re able to digitize life is growing to reach exponential .
Our ability to write the gene of writing , instead , designing and rather lentically lentely , but it &apos;s better .
And our most recent results the reaching curve .
We &apos;ve been more than 15 years ago .
The process was required a lot of passes , start with a bioethical review before .
But we discovered that synthesize DNA is very difficult .
There are degenerating of thousands of cars in the world that producing little segment , the long of 30 to 50 letter and is a degenerative process : the most errors are .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these framments and correct the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , to start by digital information of the Phi 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills .
We designed the framments , they &apos;re actually acted the mistakes of the mistakes and get a molecule of about 5,000 letter .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material and we put it in the bacteria , and we put it in bacteria in bacteria , and they began to read this genetic code and make them viral particles .
The virals were going to be reported by cells , and they &apos;re going back and destroyed the Eles .
I &apos;ve been talking about recent with members of oil industry industry , they have to be compuzzles that they were really compute .
They have more than you have to get more than you .
We think this is a situation that the software can really build his own own own own own hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the most big things in big .
We wanted to build the whole chromosome .
They &apos;re more than 580 mile .
So we thought we &apos;ve been building it in casses of the virtually , so that we can change the casses to understand what the components of a living cell cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard of the same time in 1995 , the same thing for every 10 mid-basis .
We discovered , we resequence it , 30 errors . If we used that sequence we had that original sequence , we &apos;d never been able to work .
A part of the process is designed a long time for a long time , and so you &apos;re soving with all the other segers of 50 to 50 to build more small small small working working together .
We &apos;re unals here .
You &apos;ve been read that we read that we put in the grade .
Think of it , we have a genetic code on four letter : A , C , C , and T.
Three of those letter are going to mate about 20 amminoacids , and there &apos;s a specific specific to letter for every amminoacious .
So we can use the gene to write , frass , and thoughts .
What we did we have to be authograft it .
Some people were delused by fact that it was not poetry .
We designed these segments to do it with the potential of them just just to get to the extra .
There are a lot of me that reaching them and put them together .
And we started to assembling parts , start with the parts , start with five to seven middry , to be able to form to form 72 to the 24 mila , to be able to get 72 mile to get 72 miil to 72 miil .
So , we &apos;ve been produced these segments in abundance so that we &apos;re trying to figure out that we &apos;re trying to create a very very roband -- like you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re looking for automatize the process .
So , this looks like the tabellon a basket of basket .
When we get to these segments very long , more than 100 mid-based based based , no longer will be directly in E.
You get to the modern tools of the biology of biology .
So we &apos;ve been looking for some other mechanisms .
We knew another mechanism called the un-mechanism , which in biology , which in biology , and to reach the DNA to reach the DNA to reach the DNA .
Here &apos;s a example .
This organism , called the Deinocate radiodurans , can above three million rad of radiation .
You can see in the top of the high high as his destroyed swim .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s just just like before .
There &apos;s thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely completely .
They can live under the vacuum .
They &apos;re absolutely absolutely absolutely absolutely the life existing in space , and you &apos;re sounds to find new reach of water .
And to say , NASA showed that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built these process , just using the lievated with the appropriate design appropriate .
The lievated them .
This picture was not taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It &apos;s a lot of a lot that we can see the microscope with a slightly lawer .
These are a picture that coherself a period of about six seconds .
This is the publization that we did a little time ago .
They &apos;re more than 580,000 letter code .
It &apos;s the biggest molecule that ever created by the man .
It &apos;s a high molecular molecular weight .
If you &apos;re pass to a careful careful 10 without spaces , we &apos;d like 142 pages only to transform this gene code .
Now , how do we work ? How can we act it ? How can we act it ?
Of course , you have a virus is a game .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when they use .
It &apos;s easier , even as it &apos;s eucarian cells as our : you can just extrarch the nuclear and put another , which is basically the clonation of clonation .
In the bacteria , the archaea &apos;s chchchchromosome , but we recent received that we &apos;re able to do a trapial trapished a cell cell cell cell to another and to get it .
We clean a cromosome from a microbial species .
The two are different than men from mouth .
We add some more gene in a way that we could decide that you choose for this chromosome .
And then I &apos;m going to be killing all protected to kill all protected .
And when we put in the cell is an amazing -- and you &apos;re appreciate our graph , and you &apos;re going to be a flighting chchchchchchchromosome is go into the cell .
And we were thought that we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to have that we tried to get more .
This is one of the most mechanisms of evolution .
We found that tantissix-species species , I &apos;m going to a second or a third chromosome from some of new trouble of new trators to the species .
So , who think about evolution as a gene , and the time it doesn &apos;t understand a lot of biology .
They have been called a filling to be reverse to reach that to say the DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell , it &apos;s not a .
The cell phone -- the phone , we have a pit-up .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other cromosome as material , the masticated , and we got it with only the cell and the new chromosome .
It &apos;s been blue because of the genes we &apos;ve put it .
And in a short short of time , all the characteristics of a species are going to be lost , and it &apos;s transformed in the new software that we put in the new software that we put in the cell cell .
All the protect are changed , the memane are changed , and when we legs the gene code is exactly what we transfered .
Now , this may seem to be a genetic , but it alchemia , but it allowed the DNA DNA , we can change things in a very well .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that here is -- but progress of the talk about three million years and a half million years and a half of evolution , and a half of evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the explosion of the explosion of the same kind of new species based on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty obvious when we think about our need .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion people to 9 billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to give a example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for every existing in 1946 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re now now problems to find out food , and it &apos;s a lot of the food , and wellin six billion and a half billion people .
It &apos;s going to be more than that .
We &apos;re going to start more than five billion fuel , more than 30 billion bars .
That means percent million bars a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or whatever kind of process to reach them , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to have to be able to keep all emission of these materials that finds in the atmosphere .
At the day today , thank you scientific discoveries in all the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the components for the future .
The electronic industry only only a dozen about components , and think about how many different things are came out .
Our limits here are principle , it &apos;s the biological reality and the imagination .
Now we have techniques , because of these methods to these methids , able to create what we call a combinatory .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million cromosomes a million cromosomes a day .
Think of the processing these 20 million different genes or to try to optimize the process to produce their own own , new vaccines , we can change , because of the little biology , and create more biology molecular biology now that in the last 20 years of science science .
And it &apos;s just a form .
We can choose for the reveness , production chemical or fuel , production of the fuel ,
This is an instant of some software programmed that we &apos;re working on working to be able to be able to sex and design species to the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how to be .
We know exactly what is their genetic code .
Now we &apos;re focusing on the fourth generation .
You also saw it extract extract extract act exextract .
We have a fuel of second and third generation that will use enough to be very preserved to the zuccher of the highest value as the doctor or different different butanle .
But the only way the biology can have a big impact without increasing increasing food and limlimate the cost of food and limlimate the available to be transforming CO2 in matter before , we we &apos;re working on the cells that they can achieve this , and we think that we could have the first oil oil oil oil oil oil oil .
The solar light with CO2 is a metodownn---dodownnnal -- we found different metods .
This is a organism that we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
It &apos;s going to be in the deep , about 2,500 feet of deeption to the water .
They create metan electricity by hydrogen molecular CO2 as a source of energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can incanary CO2 , which can easily be transported by your own , convert , and convert that CO2 in fuel , to drive this process .
So we think we might think that we could be able to increase what the question of what is life is , &quot; and we have the dest dest to be able to reach the whole oil industry .
So if you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can &apos;t it TED , where you can &apos;t it ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And we &apos;re working on the same metods to use the same as an instant vaccines .
You saw this year with the influence , we always back to a year and a dollar in less when it &apos;s about to find the right vaccine .
I think what you can change construct combinable to be able to build it in antickipe .
And that &apos;s how the future might start seem to change , now , now , the tree of evolution , accellating the evolution with the synthetic bacteria , and inally cells .
We &apos;re so so much of the people .
Our goal is to do enough to live enough to live enough to try to be able to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the faster , some fundamental work , a lot of the new technology that we took to the Microsoft in the follow , almost a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s a lot of a environment that you can interact is at the local level that remot with a huge amount of visual data .
We &apos;re seeing many many giant giant giant digital picture with a kind of digital zoom , and continuous , for a very fast panoric , and continuous pictures as we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big the amount of information that we see , how much of data , or the images .
Most of the digital photographs , but this for example is a deaths of Congress from the Biotary Congress , and reentra megaps of 300 megaps .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that limits of a system like this is the number of plug on your screen in any moment . It &apos;s also a very flessible architecture .
This is a whole book , it &apos;s a whole book .
This is the Casa desolate of Dickens . Every colonna represents a caple .
And so to show you that it &apos;s just a way of images , we can do something like that , to see that it &apos;s a real representation of the real text , not a picture .
It might be a little artificial to read a electronic book .
I don &apos;t have the one .
This is a most realistic example . It &apos;s a number of the Wardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a seat .
And it really gives you really pleasure and the beautiful experience of read the real face of a daire or a daire , which is to nature , which is to nature multiple kind of a middle of middle .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the Guardian .
We created a public fashion on the high high resolution -- much more high than that you use in a normal normal publisher -- and we put it in the extra .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , even the specific models .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
I hope that this means to put people in the people , and to other people , and to other way , I didn &apos;t have to be necessary .
Of course , the maps is one of the most obvious apply to this kind of technology .
And I don &apos;t want to lose time , if you don &apos;t say that we have to give you to this field .
These are all the stream in the U.S. sovovers over a geospatial picture of NASA .
So now we &apos;re going to be something else .
This is actually the website , you can see it .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , who fighter two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting visual to the computer .
And it &apos;s from the web , I &apos;m going to manage from Seadragon .
You can see that when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from another picture , and have this kind of multipil experience .
But the space of the spacectial spacecting here has actually a meaning .
The visualization of the computer visualization has been recorded these pictures together , so that you know , so that the reach of the remarkable places that the people who imagine -- all the close to the lake of the Montagne Roccient : You see the elements of a reaching elements of a de-stable , and these things are all been connections .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There &apos;s some more space .
I want to move directly to one of the original data of Noahs -- and this is a previous prototype that we &apos;ve done to work for the first time the summer time the last time the summer time the last time , the next time to show you what I &apos;m really really about the key key to the environmental . And it &apos;s not necessarily evidence that we put in the website .
We had to worry about the legal aspects and saying .
This is a reconstruction of Nobody &apos;s three Dame Nobody &apos;s pictures from Flickr . Bae &apos;s digit . Bae C. And you get pictures of these in magt magt , and then you get pictures of these pus and saying . Olickr , and so on it &apos;s discovered .
So I &apos;m all pictures from Flickr and were all connected to space in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this very simple way .
You know , I &apos;d never thought to end up to work for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifying this kind of account here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different different different different fotyocaming fotocaming : from those cell cell cell cell phone , a significant number , to have a significant number of different different facts of the environment .
And if I can , I try to try to try those more stranks .
Many of the stuck , etc .
And somewhere there &apos;s a series of photographs -- and it &apos;s a series of photographs .
This is a poster of Nobody &apos;s three Dame recorded .
We can move from the poster of this environment .
The essential is that we can do the social environment . This is taking data from social environment . This is taking data from the whole memory , as the whole memory of the visual memory , from the visual point of visual visual .
All those pictures become connected together , the greater of the parts of the parts .
You have a model of the whole thing that emerge .
Think about this as the prolungation of Stephen Lawler on Earth virtual Earth virtual .
It &apos;s something that grows in complex complex as the people use , and the people use , and the vantages to get people to use it .
They &apos;re marced with the metaded with other people .
If somebody comes to somebody is the idea of contrast all these sounds saying the name , my picture of the Nothing , my picture of NoDP suddenly , you all those data , and I can use the way to use as a point of ingressed by the way , using the picture of everyone else , and have a social experience of people , and having a social experience of those pictures , and have a social experience of the guy like , and have a social kind of the guy of the Nothing thing of people who else , and have , and have , and have , and have , and have , and have a social social social experience .
Of course , a consequence of all the interesting virtual models of all interesting things in the earth , and they &apos;re not just just seen as a willing of the planning and similar , but from the memory .
Mille .
Chris Anderson : I got good ? What is your software going to be able to be to do is that at a certain point , in the next few years , all the photographs , all the world will be being being being being done with ?
BAA : Yes . What is doing is basically to discover .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , you to know ,
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the images .
What becomes very interesting is that if you think about reach of the searching of these pictures have .
As you do a research research on the web , you know , you know , a frase and the text on the web has a lot of information about pictures .
Now , what happens if that picture is connected to all your picture ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of remarkable , and the amount of remarkable that is really huge . It &apos;s a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible . Compliments .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure when you travel and one of the delivered , and the ethnogical research is that we can live in the ancient , who have a very traditions , who have the past in the wind , the past the wind , the houd the wind , the houd of the plants .
And I think that the sciamani Jaguar travel still beyond the Via Lattea , or that the Miditan Inuit &apos;s still cold to be in Himalaya , the distant of the Dharma , to remember the Dharma , to remember the Dharma , to remember the central of the Dharma , and that the world we don &apos;t have a sense of the idea , but it &apos;s just a reality , but it &apos;s just a reality , it &apos;s just a sense of reality , but it &apos;s actually , it &apos;s actually , it &apos;s actually ,
the result of a particular set of choices that our stirpe that our stirpe is done , well or bad , or many generations does .
And , of course , we all share the extra extra .
We all all do .
We &apos;re being being reports to ritual .
We have to deal with the death of death , so we don &apos;t surprising it and let &apos;s say --
We all have a art art .
What it &apos;s the particular one of the song , the ritory of the song , the ritory of all culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that are the Penan of Borneo , or the following of the Voodoo &apos;s Voodoo &apos;s &apos;s desert Kaised in Kenya , the Curander &apos;s Curander , the Curander , or a cammelt in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my journey in the desert , a month ago , or a month ago , or a month ago , or a website in the Qomolangma , the mother of the world .
All these populations are ways to think , there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And if you think a minute , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
Insisides , the miriades of cular the world creates a spiritual life and cultural that will start the planet and it &apos;s important for the planet , and it &apos;s important for the planet as a biosphere .
And you can think of this cultural race as a very , and you can defined the etnosion of all the concepts , all the concepts of all concepts , , inspired ideas , inspired , to be by the human imagination from human alba .
The etnososphere is the great painting of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbols of what we are and what we can be as as a species .
And because the biosphere was gravely depend as well as well as well as well as well as well .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all the species is , or it &apos;s been on the orest initiition , because it &apos;s the most applant , or -- in the most applease -- in the most biological diversity -- and you don &apos;t even get a little bit of biological diversity -- that &apos;s the most optimistic -- that &apos;s the most optimistic -- that &apos;s the most optimistic .
The thing is , of course , the loss of course , the loss .
When you &apos;re born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just a language of a vocabulary of grammatics .
A language is the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle with which is a lot of culture comes in the world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a kick , a thought , a thought , a thought , a lift of spiritual .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re sitting in Monterey , at least the middle is not most subject to the orders of children .
They don &apos;t get to teach children , the children , the means , less that it &apos;s not not a campas , which is already died .
What is the most tristes of being a silence , of the last to talk about a language , of the last to talk to a language , of the fact of the money or to be able to transmate the prompromising of children ?
This is a little bit of the world &apos;s one somewhere in the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks , a old language .
And I know somebody of you say , &quot; isn &apos;t that ?
The world would not be a better place if we just let all do the same language ? &quot;
We talk about the kogi .
You &apos;re going to have a sudden what it means to say we can &apos;t talk to your language .
I &apos;d like to do you have a journey through the etnosion --
a little journey in the etnosion to give you a little bit of what we &apos;re lost .
Many of us depend that when I say , &quot; different ways of existing existing exexist .
Let &apos;s take for example this bimas Barasana , in Amazon in Amazon , the people of anaconic anaconic , which creation to try from the latest fire of the latte of the latte of the latest beat .
It &apos;s a people who &apos;s not able to distinguish color from the blue blue blue , because the birth is identified in the time , which is identified in the forest , from which people .
They have a straight , and a regular matrimonial , called &quot; exogy , &quot; exogy , &quot; you have to spost a different language .
Everything has been radical in the past mitological , but the particularly , in these hatheshide , or seven lingue of seven lingue , because of the matters of the midates .
They &apos;re limited to listen and then start to talk .
Let &apos;s take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived , the Waorani of Ecuador , a incredible people who had the first contact in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionary missionary , they &apos;ve been been trying to a similar mistake .
They &apos;ve been done by the top photographs that reaching them in the top of that reporting people , dealing that this people in the forest that that people &apos;s forest .
They &apos;ve been collected the picture , the land , they &apos;ve been able to a form or a form , and they &apos;re not going to be any , they have been able to be diavoid , and they killed the five missionary missionary .
But Waorani don &apos;t kill only buted the foreign .
They kill them in their .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by them .
We &apos;re saving eight generations and we found two natural death and we found two natural death death and when we &apos;ve been been born to know , they have a prepregnant that one of them was invecting , and then they killed it .
The citiers were able to recognize the animal animal , and recognize the animal animal .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned a really interesting job when my professor , I was a really interesting job when my professor to go to Haiti to Haiti to the base of Duvalier and Tonton Moutes , and the Tonton Moutes , and imposes to make the sum .
And to give a sense of the miracolous , I &apos;d have to comcomment culture and that Voodoo is not magnera .
It &apos;s pretty a complete view of the world .
Many interesting interesting interesting .
If I ask you to tell you about the world , what would you say ?
It &apos;s about the 1th , Islam , Buddhism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has not feed religious . And instead , and Voodoo is not the other than the distilled to have a lot of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of navy .
What makes interesting is the doo is the intense relationship between life and death .
So the beings are going to be born .
The spirits can be invocated by the Grande Actually , they respond to the ritory of the dance and replace to replace to the animate animate of the vious way that for a short short short , becomes the following .
So , for this voodooists say , &quot; You know , you know , you know ,
We say in the temple and we become God . &quot;
And what you &apos;re paying , is the spirit that you can do you , how can you do that ?
So you see these incredible incredible events : following the voodoo in state of trance that touch are implant that touching a rather strong demonstration of the mind , as a pretty strong strong power of the mind , when it &apos;s catalyzed a strength of the body when it &apos;s been catalyzation .
I have the most extraordinary people with which I &apos;ve lived the most extraordinary are the Kogi of Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta , in the Colombia security .
I mean , the ancient of the reports that once live on the plaibie , the aid of the hythththroombia in the collapse , the people who retreated on the volcanic carefully to the volcanic carefully ,
In a health continent of health , this people who was never been conquisted by the spagnolated by the spacecrain .
And so that &apos;s governated by a clero , but their formation is so extraordinary .
The young follow people are taken by families to three or four years , and they live secret in a world , and they live secret in a world of the glasses of the glasses .
Two years of nine years choices to reproduce the nine months of gestation that they &apos;re going to get in the mom of the mother , now are metaphor in the mom of the Grande Mother .
So , all of this time , they &apos;re accultured to their values , who are the preayers and only their preayers and only their preayers and the preayer , or to say the balance .
And the term of this incredible initiation , they &apos;re suddenly reported and the first time in life , at 18 years , and then then they see an alba . And that &apos;s the first bright . And the sun the sun of the first bright . And so that they &apos;ve learned in a reaching back . And then it &apos;s prevent it , and he said a step back , and he said , &quot; and he said , &quot; I &apos;m going to be a step back and he says ,
&quot; Vised ? Proprice as I said .
It &apos;s amazing . Now it &apos;s now to you protect it . &quot;
They call a most of the most people called the most of the world , and say that we are the colpair of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the indeed popular popular people in the Earth of the best history of the noise of the best selselling , which is a concept of the best selselling , or maybe invods that these are more neighborhood , and say that these are more neighborhood to the Earth of us .
The indeed people are not naurs , not not expensive by the nostaly .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the Asmat Asmat the Asmat the sevents of the Tibet , but thank you to the time and rites , they created a mystic of the Earth &apos;s not about the concept of the Earth &apos;s face not about the notion that Earth can live , because it &apos;s just dogs .
What is that ?
It means that a kid in Ande that a kid &apos;s grows to create that mountain is a spirit of Apu that will be a deeply different , and it will be a deepdifferent deeption with the mountain or that place a little different box with a girlfriend of Montana who are grown up with a little bit of rocks that &apos;s a rock of rock .
What it &apos;s the spirit of a spirit or a mineral , or a mineral ,
What is interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between individuals and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia Britannic Britannica creates that forests were going to be cut .
And I got a human being different from my Kwakiutl that they believe that the forests are the forests are the forests of Hukukukukukukuk and the downnnnbal that live in the world , and spirites that live in the world , and spirits that they &apos;re going to be in the world , and I think that they &apos;re going to get in the world .
If you start to look at that these cultures can actually be different , you can start to understand some of them , you can start to understand some of them .
I &apos;ve been taken this aprile in the Western Amazon Western Western .
Maybe some of you have heard about the ayaaaaaaaath-office , the most powerful psychoactive .
What makes the ayaaasible of the substance is not the potential to the substance of the substance , but his elaboration . It &apos;s compost for two elements .
From one side , this is a doud of a doud of a coal meant , and harder , harder and hardly hallucinogene .
I &apos;m going to take the only plant plant that allowed a little bit of the coscience , but it &apos;s mixed with the faid of a caffecting family of a caffection of the caffection of the caffected .
This plant plant is a tripppped , very similar to the seriotonin the seriotonin , five , methypppyppyyppyllllyppyllypppppamine .
If you &apos;ve ever seen Yanomami pull up to the hide that the substance that they do from a different set of species , anchor a different kind of species , anchyltrylllyllyllylllyllyllylllyllylllyllyllyllllyers .
You know that &apos;s a little bit like a nose of the nose is a little bit like being shot from a fuel career and land on a sea sea sea sea sea of electricity . &#91; &#91; Ris&#93; Not believe a distortion of reality ; it &apos;s actually a distoring of reality .
I often often want to do with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has been shaked the pitch was pitch , with his reaching fungi on the &apos; &apos; &apos; 30 in Mexico .
I &apos;m not going to my tesesesesthis , you can &apos;t tell these triptamine as as although you &apos;re not able to tell nobody to be alucucinated . &#91; Ris&#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; , but they &apos;re deny , because they &apos;re deny , because they &apos;re deny , because they &apos;re deny .
It &apos;s possible to be the orically only if you &apos;re just to abunte with other chemicals that dens MAO .
Now , the good bird , the Tialine that are in this liana , the same liana is injeers of MAO , the same kind of necessary to be able to be able to be able to be a 80,000 species of 80,000 species , as these people are doing these two morfically , but if you combined this way , but if you combined this way , but if you combined this way , it &apos;s dedemic on the sum parts of the suit of the parts of the size of the size of the size ?
We use the big eufemism of the evidence and error , which can reveal sticks .
But if we ask to Indian Indian , they say , &quot; The plants are talking about . &quot;
What is that ?
This tribes , the Cofan , 17 variety of ayahuasks , which distinguished in the forest , and that we would come in the same species .
If we ask how to do it as they say , &quot; I said , &quot; I said , &quot; I said , &quot; You know , you don &apos;t know ? &quot; I have been saving . &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take 17 variety in a night of the loud , and each other , and each dogs a different path .
With this is not graduate Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than contact the stami .
Now , &#91; it &#93; the problem is that also the problem is that also the people who have to heart people who have a few people who are pushing them to the margins of history , and passing over the world , and passing beyond .
In fact , the 2222222222222222-year-old , but rather like the technology was in which we stop and have a pretty much as the way we stop and instruction , and cultural destruction of biological diversity and cultural diversity and cultural . Now the problem is not the change .
All the culte cultures are involved in a dance for new possibility of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indian Sioux didn &apos;t stop to be Sioux when they put on the arco and freceived as Americans don &apos;t have to be Americans when they put on the horse and hot .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that they &apos;re minating the ethnosion of etnosion . It &apos;s the power .
The wall wanted to the domination of the domination .
And if you give a look at the world , I found that these are not destined to satives .
They &apos;re living and dynamics and dynamics out of the existence from the existence of identifable to their adaptment .
And I think you &apos;re disbosing in the Penan of the Penan
a nomade of Sarawak , in the sest asian , a people who lived lift in the forest to a generation , and now reduced to a generation , and now reducing to the ride of the sevening , where you can see the river , where you can see the river from the lim that looks like to be able to be able to be a lot of horithesthesthesis , where the snuminating , where the snets are ,
You &apos;re going to reach the repires with the forest .
Or , in the Yanomami , I &apos;m the diseases that came with with the discovery of the people .
If we put on the mountains of the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the whole dough of politics .
As you know , the genocide , the extinction of a people , is conducted to universal , but the notes of a people , not just been been done , but the destruction of a people , not just been able , but it &apos;s not just conducted , but it &apos;s part of development .
And you can &apos;t understand the Tibet , because you don &apos;t know the way to the beginning .
I &apos;ve lost 6,000 miles from Chengdu in China , through the Western Kear , coming to Lhasa young young people who are coming to Lhasa young connection , but only came to Lhass , what &apos;s behind the statistics we feel talking about .
6,000 monuments sacrice reduced to the dying and centers .
1.2 million people killed from the military in the Cultural Rivolution .
The father &apos;s father was ascritical at the Panchen Lama .
What means is that it was killed to the time of the Chinese invasion .
Suo guy &apos;s been going to Santity during the Santity during the diaspora that has taken people in Nepal .
Sumother was a mother was imprisoned and her her her hit was a rich .
It &apos;s been taken to hide in a carcing age of two years under under his gonna snose because it couldn &apos;t live .
The sister , who did the same , was mitted in reeducation .
A day has invertised a day , he was a buttered the Mao and , and , for this transgrsion , was mitted to seven years .
The pain of Tibet can be insopportraits , but it &apos;s spirit , but it &apos;s the unless .
At the end , all you reduce a choice .
We want to live in the world monotic monotic world or we want to accept the policy of diversity ?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he died , he said that his biggest bear was that , in our back to this view of the world , not only we see the whole gamma of human imagination . And so , we &apos;ll see the whole gamma of the human imagination .
And it &apos;s uliant to remember that our species is exist for 60,000 years .
The From Neolitica , who gave us the agriculture , that has been done it socking to the cult of the seed , replace to the poetry of the sevening , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world industrialized has to be 300 years .
And that &apos;s not suggests that we don &apos;t suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges we &apos;re going to be able to come in .
When to these miriades of culation culation is asked what you want to say to be human , they respond to 10,000 vices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all return the possibility of being what we &apos;re : a kind of comfortable , that we have to have all the people and all the giant people can fire . And there are big moments of good good .
I &apos;ve been taken this on the north of Baffin , when I went to cover the side of the From the baldddying , and this man , Olaya , and this man , and this man , and she told me his wonderful story of his grandfather .
The dog government is not always been gentile with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to be able to be to think of our premate , and we &apos;d give them in colonies .
The grandfather &apos;s grandfather refuted to go .
The family , I got all my life , he took all my life , and he took all of his toxic .
You know , you know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t have the cold ,
The paces of the origin origin origin origin , they were made of a caribes in there .
The grandfather &apos;s not uncaught in the night , or the bylightle , or the bard , or the bard that was .
It &apos;s gaced the pantage , you &apos;re hot the pantage in the pantage of focused in your hand . When they did it &apos;s been conzed , the work .
He was salive on the side of this caught of this caccounts , and when I became solid , he killed a dog .
He &apos;s shoubled the dog and created a brighter , with the toward , with the toward , he has been made a sled sled , and it &apos;s been been been on on the bang , and it &apos;s been been shot on the bank , and it &apos;s been a slate , and he &apos;s made a brillied , and he &apos;s been made a brighter , with the dog , and he &apos;s made a brief , with a briddddddddddddry ,
We want to talk about horse with anything ? &#91; &#91; Ris&#93; And this , in different ways , &#91; in different different ways , &#91; &#91; Applausi &#93; is the symbols of the people in the world .
In the 1999 , the U.9 government reminded to Inuit &apos;s the total control of a largest territory of the biggest California and Texas a lot of the biggest California and Texas mas a lot of the big land of California and Texas a lot of the big land of the big land of California and Texas a whole whole lot of the big land of California and Texas a whole largest of the big land of California and Texas a lot of the largest in the big land of the big land of the biggest in the big land of the biggest land of the big land of the big land
It &apos;s their new painting . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a independent territory . Controlling all the minerary resources .
One splease example of how a natione-state could rererecilit with his people .
And , to end , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious to the who we have been in these remote areas of the planet , and the planet , and they &apos;re not remote .
For somebody &apos;s home .
They &apos;re representing the human imagination that they &apos;re going to the alba . And for us all , the samong these children , as the swide of these children , become part of the geography of hope .
So we can &apos;t do , we have to convince that politicians will never be anything .
We believe that the polemical policy --
&#91; Applausers are not lost , but it &apos;s not lost , but we believe that stories can change the world , and perhaps we are the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month our website has 35 million visits .
156 country to transmate our dog television .
Our rescues are lets from millions of people .
Our work is travel in the etnosion to bring our public places in places of the wonderful and cultural cultural to be being abled by how they &apos;ve seen and , hope , to be hope , to be able to be the central reveal in the world , and we have to find a style in the world , and we have to find a world of life in a world , and we have to find a life of life in a world , and we have to find a life of life in a world , and we have to find out of the world .
where the saggees of all the people can contributing to our collective waving .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope you &apos;re just and trying to find some of the other people who have heard and find out of some things , in case not notice .
I &apos;d like to start with what I call &quot; the official official .
The dogma official ?
The Western official society all the Western industrial society . The Western official official society , &quot; If we want to massive our adadines &quot; &quot; The way to do it is a way to do it is that is massive the individual . &quot;
The reason is , from a side , in fact that the freedom is in the same value , is preventing , essential for humans .
And the other is that if we &apos;re free , each of us can act to be able to do all of us to do all that that that we have our well-being , no one that decide in our own .
The way to massive freedom is the freedom is the choice .
The most choices of people have , more libing , and the greater is their freedom , is their well-being .
This , I think , it &apos;s so deeply radicated in society that nobody would be dreamed to put it in dubor .
And it &apos;s also deeply radical in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what the progress has been made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly great .
I just just a simple note about the ments for ints .
In my supermarket there are 175 conditions , without contact 10 variety of olium extract 10 , and the 12 acets of the whom you can buy for a huge number of people who can buy for you a huge conduction of the 175 already already .
That &apos;s the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic store , to buy a stereum : cast , the CD , radio , packs , the CD , bumble ,
And in this single store , there &apos;s a big number of audiences .
We can get six million different combinations using the components that there are in a store just store .
You have to admit that there &apos;s a lot of choice .
Other camps : the world of communications .
And once , when I was a child , you could get all the phone phone phone services , to the mess , to the mama , and it &apos;s a child ,
You know , the phone , you didn &apos;t buy it .
One of the result of that , in the other , was that the phone never reach .
These times they went .
We now have a almost limited farmers , especially between the cell cell cell cell .
Here &apos;s the cell cell cell cell phone .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , and MP3 , ccles of the nose , and forcing for the skulf me .
If you don &apos;t have seen in the store , you &apos;re very much that you will be able to be going to be going to be .
And what &apos;s happening is that people in the store and does this question that is that question . And you know what is the answer ? The answer is &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t too too too much .
So , in other ways of life that are much more important than the disappearing , you know , it &apos;s the same explosion of choices .
It &apos;s not going to be in the United States that you &apos;re going to go from the United States that you &apos;re going to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do a , or B , &quot; A , they say , &quot; You know , &quot; B has these benefits . &quot; B has these benefits . What do you want to do ? &quot;
Her , &quot; Dr. , &quot; Dr. , what would I do I ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A has these benefits and these risks , and B has these benefits and these benefits . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebble , &quot; Dr. if she was me , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor : &quot; But I don &apos;t have her . &quot;
The result of the result of the malated , &quot; and expression that it looks like a beautiful thing .
But it &apos;s not that one can move the fish and responsibility of the decisions of making decisions from somebody knows something , and the doctor , to something that &apos;s the doctor , or something that doesn &apos;t know -- and it &apos;s not in the ideal condition , and so not in the ideal condition to decisions .
There &apos;s a huge marketing of products that &apos;s products , direct to people like me and , and that if you think of it &apos;s not no sense , because we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why they advert them ?
The answer is that they want to ask the doctor to ask the doctor to ask the reward .
What we &apos;re so fundamental as our identity is a choice of choice , as you see in this vignant , &quot; You don &apos;t want to forget their children .
And we can reinventing us .
And the means that every morning , to the risis , you have to decide that kind of person .
I &apos;m going to the family and the matriage , a long time the perspective , it almost for anyone , was that was that there was a lot of time , and they were going to be children to get the most preserved to be .
The only real choice was with who , not when and even even even , and even what do after .
So , all it &apos;s really really played .
I &apos;m going to teach you very intelligent students , and I &apos;m 20 percent in a time .
And it &apos;s not not because it &apos;s less brilliant , because it &apos;s not less diligents .
but why are I impressed , I mean , I mean , &quot; I would say , &quot; I would say , &quot; I &apos;m going to do it ? &quot;
&quot; Do you have to go later ? I think before ? I was the children or to career ? &quot;
They &apos;re interrogative logorants .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this implic , even if this implant to do that , and not get a beautiful voice .
And they have to really do that .
Now , the work : We &apos;re lucky , as Carl subject , because the technology is allows us to work every minute , every day , from every day , from every day , from the Hotel Randolph Randolph .
I &apos;m going to talk , there &apos;s a corner , and I didn &apos;t tell nobody who , where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t say , because I want to use .
What is , this incredible freedom of choice that we have about the work ? That &apos;s that we have to continuously decide , and continuously , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son &apos;s kidney , with the cell cell phone in a pair , the Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the note .
And even if I &apos;m all spend you , every minute that we see our son &apos;s partnership , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; Did you know , &quot; Did this called ? &quot;
&quot; I got to answer this email ? I got to abbox ? &quot;
And even when the answer is no , &quot; all this makes the experience of your son &apos;s partnership of your son very different than that would be in other conditions .
So , we &apos;re looking at , small things and big things , and big objects and lifts , life is a question of choices .
And once the world was this : You know , there were some possibility , but it was not a question of choice .
The world &apos;s world today looks like this : The world &apos;s dilemma is , &quot; Is it a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Science is .
The positive positive things we know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative .
All this choice is two negative effects on people .
The first , paradoooxally , it &apos;s that it &apos;s going to be freedom .
With many options between which choices , becomes very difficult to do it .
I offer you a significance , a significance study of the volunteer .
A connection to has been accessed to the Vantetee , the gigantic gigantic society , with about a million clients in 2,000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offer-offer , the percentage of the size of two percent .
With 50 source of offerings , there &apos;s 10 percent in less than adesions when they &apos;re available only five . Why are they just five . Why ?
Because with 50 source of which choose , it &apos;s bad hard decide , and the choice comes reached to the intimate .
And in the tomorrow , and I still have , and tomorrow , and of course , and of course , they never go .
You know that it doesn &apos;t only mean that these work who are going to be food for the dog , because they don &apos;t have enough money , to say that the decision is so doscy that allow the complementary of work .
Not participating , they &apos;re not going to five dollars to be a year from the dator of work , that would be very well be able to versary .
So the paralysis a consequence of the way .
And I think that &apos;s the world .
&quot; And to end , for the eternity : ketchup , send , send or hoom ? &quot;
Would you like to take the right decision , if it &apos;s for the eternity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and near the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that , even if we can evate the paralysis and to make a choice , we &apos;re less sation-so-so-based out-options that we were choose .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of these people who choose , if you buy a and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you would have a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us to be better . And what happens is that we could be better .
even when it was a good decision .
The choices there are , more easy to be unpleasure of any detail that it &apos;s unso-de-facing .
And then , there &apos;s what economists call it costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has been very well as well as the value that we think about things depends from what we are the things we confronting .
And the rest , when there are many opties , it &apos;s easy to represent the characteristics of alternative shot and being less less sation-respect , and be less depending .
Here &apos;s a example . I use with all those who are not in New York .
But that &apos;s what you probably think .
There &apos;s this copy to Hamptons .
A place of the lusually .
Spig , splendida . Otma day day . It &apos;s all for them .
It doesn &apos;t have anything . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , Agust . &quot;
&quot; Everybody my neighborhood to Manhattan are . &quot;
&quot; I could parking up in front of the house . &quot;
And it &apos;s two weeks later from the idea that &apos;s lost -- every day -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The costs costs the so-decreates the so-so-defation for what we have , even when the choice was excellent .
And the most options we have to look , more the most options that we think we &apos;re going to think of the costs of the cos-opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
It &apos;s about living the moment , and maybe of the living living life .
But the most important point is that whatever you choose , you choose to choose other .
And the things that we don &apos;t choose so much that we can make less attract what we do .
I say , &quot; You know , growing in the expectation .
I tried to my skin block a new new jeans .
I &apos;m almost always jeans .
And they were a lot of the guy , just bought them , and they bought them , and they were scomothered , just after they were a lot of times , they were going to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple of new time when the old were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
The committed me , &quot; Li want to be , fit , relaxed , relaxed ,
Was the cernial , or with the cernial ? &quot;
&quot; With the wave ? &quot;
&quot; Seight : Dr. Does it want to be stricking ? Bla , &quot; Continuate .
I was sent , and after a little bit I was able to say , &quot; I want the guy that -- that was the only guy , it was not the idea that that was , so for a moment I tried to all the people who had been been trying to me to get out of the store , and I got the best couple of the mile , and I had never had .
It was the very very much . With all that choice was the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book .
The reason I was worse that I was worse with all of that choice .
I was going to be expectancing . I didn &apos;t expectancy when there was only one , but when you saw 100 different , steps , at least a kind of different , I had to live .
What I had had been good , but not perfect .
After I started to have that chosed that I was insoap to expectancing to expectation .
The added of options in the life life is not going to increase that these have respect to the excellence of the same options .
And this will be less satisssation-sweather .
No one in the world of the marketing if you realize .
Because if they knew , you don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is that looks more than that .
&quot; He was better when you were better when you were better when you were better when it was worse when you was worse , it was still possible to meet the surprising of the surprising .
So , in the world we live in -- the world we live -- opulents , industrialized ads with the expectancy of perfeeding -- the very very , the very very we can hope is that things are at the expectancing .
You never surprised to be surprised because your expectative , because your expectations , you &apos;re ingigantes .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Baspaspect , &quot; Yes , you want . &quot;
I mean , I &apos;m a little authographic , I &apos;m really really sposed and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t have to be able .
But it &apos;s not always a good thing .
And then , a consequence of buy a couple of jeans , when there is just that kind of jeans is that when you &apos;re not satissssmoke , and you ask , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot;
The world is responsible . What I could you do that ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a unso-sfacing , and you ask you who is responsible , and you ask you who is responsible , .
You could do better .
With hundreds of variety available , there are no scate for the inform .
So when people are decisions , even if the result is valido , you feel inssatisssssatissssmoke .
In the last years , the depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only , but important -- of this is that the honest , but it &apos;s important that people have been too aled .
And when they need to explain that the cold is .
So the final result is that we &apos;re better , but we feel worse , but we feel worse .
Let me tell you that remember .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely flit . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little choice of choice is better than having any choice is better than having not not going to be a lot of choice .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic . I don &apos;t know what .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve been super-sure that we have to get to be able to be able to be .
Now , from politician -- I almost finished -- I almost finished -- from the politician , the noticed .
What it allows all this to the industrial society is the remarkable .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not too much .
The problem is that they have too paid .
So the Western is a malarial being being a malarial to be , the Western society , reaching Western society .
And what it does depressing and angry is , this : Steve Levitt told you yesterday , as the expensive seat at the car seat are inutionary . It &apos;s a spreco of money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and dispendiose , it &apos;s not just useful .
I &apos;m not going to tell us .
They do worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows a lot of choice was revered in those where people too too much much , it &apos;s not just their life to improve , but also our .
That &apos;s what economists call a better remarkable .
A reduced reaching all -- not just to the poor -- not just to poverty -- because of this choice in except that we reach .
And then you want to end , you can become all you want to become what you want to do .
You , people who are , you think , &quot; What do you think about that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t make anything in a glass of glass . &quot;
&quot; A tradition of the world -- a limited limited the world --
and he &apos;s interpret , I interpret it .
But then , I think about it , I realized that that that fish knows that that the long long knows that .
Because the reality of fact that if you &apos;re loud , you &apos;re able to be able to be able to , you don &apos;t good freedom . You don &apos;t say the freedom . You know the paralysis .
If you take the way that all divents that all divents possible divents .
You want to be the paralysis , and you reduced the well-being .
They all have to be a sphere .
This is almost certainly certainly too strike , maybe even for the fish , and safe for us .
But the assume of some symbolic sphere is a ret for the injobs and , throw , for the rovine .
Thank you .
