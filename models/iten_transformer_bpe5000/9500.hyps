Last year I showed these slides to show that the arttic glacial , which is almost three million years of the United States , the size of 48 , the United States of the continent , you know , it &apos;s reduced 40 percent .
But if you have this underneath the gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t exhip the ice .
The heat glacial acial , is , in a certain sense , the heart of global climate climate climate system .
It &apos;s expanded and you get a witer .
The next slide is going to be a remarkable revenue to sell the last 25 years .
The layers are reported in red .
And as you see , they get down to the blue score .
That &apos;s the inversus in the way , you get to summit .
You can see that the cosoice costs , five years or more , is like the blood , which is here refuorious from the body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been from so ,
This is a problem because the warming warming land land , the wider wild where there are huge amount of fuel , where there are huge amount of fuel that , they &apos;re going to be transformed in metan from the microbes .
I &apos;m going to get to the total inquination of global warming , that can be doubling , that &apos;s going to have , to have this point of not around .
In some lagues in Alaska metan is already already rebits from water .
The professored Katey Walter of Alaska team of Alaska team , a team print that last inversus last inversus .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : I &apos;m good . The question is if we &apos;re going to be .
A reason is that this extra termal exchange the Greenland from the north .
This is a fire to regime glacial .
The ported never had ever reached free lights .
This is the Kangerlussuahead , in the southern ovest of Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level to the sea level for the glacies on the ground , here is where we get the sea .
These currents are increasingly quickly .
On the other side of the planet : Antarccclock of ice the planet .
The last month , the scientists have dealed that the ice is in negative , and the Antarccccles , and the West arties , which pogy on some iun sun sun .
And you were a six feet of the actual level , like in Groenland .
Sulil Himalaya , the third largest block of ice , you see new lagues , which few years ago were glacies .
40 percent of the world population has been able to the water from that sell .
Sulle Ande : this glacier &apos;s the water water .
The ported is increased .
But when it deminures , the same happens to the water .
In California , neve the Sierra Nevada is 40 percent .
The hydrogen are in cricrisis .
The previous previous , as you read , they &apos;re free .
The growing because it &apos;s a remarkable to the world &apos;s door to increase the inceness .
The disasers are increasing out to a round out of the normal and without previous .
Four times more more than the last 30 years than the previous .
This is a lot of sustainable .
If you look at the historical context , you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we &apos;ve had a 70 million tons of CO2 -- 25 million tons in the ocean every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every 24 hours .
Look at the area of the Pacific Pacific , the Americans , to the Americans , to both the subcontinent , where there &apos;s a radical roads , where there &apos;s a radical scoveroveroversment of oxygen .
The greater because of global warming , together , with the forestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fuel fuel .
The oil is a problem , and the coal is even worse .
The United States are one of the two , with the more emissions , together China .
And it was proponed to build a lot of other central central .
But we &apos;re seeing a change of direction .
These are the annullayers in the last years and some alternative of the alternative .
And every way , there &apos;s a layer in our country .
The industrial industrial and oil have speso 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the coal to promote the fuel , which is a symptomtomorrow .
And that was reminded me to something --
Veras Natal Tennessee , where I saw , there was a 3.8 billion liers of the coal fying of coal four-coal .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the second largest flow of the flow in America .
It &apos;s happened around Natal .
The advertising one of the industrial industrial industrial .
Video : Frostice the carbon is a kind of algror and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it &apos;s growing our economy .
Frostice the carbon is increasing .
It &apos;s at good price , adorable and the workers are repend .
Al Gore : From the west part of the West Virginia .
The most big minerary society on the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Botkenship : I &apos;ll be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Peloses , Harry Ready -- don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima &apos;s Prottion .
This is a one of them , a part .
Video : Attore : ALergy , we see the climate change as a serious serious minaces as a sat at our business .
For this , our priority is invest a lot of money in a waste to make adadvert and confused to make adadversus and confused on the coal .
In fact , the coal is not spork .
We think it &apos;s pulit -- it &apos;s also a good profumo .
So , you don &apos;t preventing climate change .
Let me .
Video : Coobone : Cone clean -- you &apos;ve heard a lot about it .
So , let &apos;s make a lot of a weak , for how much is about the fuel .
Seordinariarily ! Seordinordinordinarily , but this is the sound of the fuel technology .
The consumption is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology , but the remarkable technology that can see .
Did a look at : this is the technology of the fuel .
Al Gore : You know , the alternative positive connects , and the national security security .
Video : Compleased America is cricrisis ; the global security , the climate crisis .
The filter that the connection , our dependence from the combustible , as the fuel and the imported oil .
Now , there &apos;s a new , audity solution to use .
Real America : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to remate the work , to make more sure , and help stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that basts to solve our problems .
Real America . Scoprite than .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Compleased : It &apos;s about refuel .
One of the faster than you get to the end of the wells from combustible to kitchen to kill our planet .
Comparsa : The future is here . I feel , sun , a new energy .
Comparty 2 : Nggs invest for places of jobs .
Compleasant : Real time . It &apos;s time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old old proverbio African says , &quot; If you want to go to fast , go to the faster .
If you want to go , you go , you go . &quot;
We need to go , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I did a stick on the LHC .
And promises to reach to reach you to reach you to how it works .
So , I &apos;m going to get . And for those that other time , the LHC is the most scientific experiment ever tried -- 27 kilometers of circles .
His task is to reach the conditions that were less than a billion second second from the universe -- until we start at 600 million times a second second .
All that &apos;s simply environmental .
This is the car under Ginevra .
I &apos;m going to take these mini-Big Bang inside the remarkable .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- is a 44 feet and has a diameter diameter diameter diameter diameter .
This is a picture of ATLAS . In the building , you can notice the proportions .
The 10 secember last year we &apos;ve got the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was because of immense festhize .
It &apos;s a picture of the first fashion of particles that had done all around the LHC , going to go into collision , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles in the remarkable .
In other words , when we see that picture 10 , the picture of the ember , I realized that the car worked , the car was a great vitty .
I don &apos;t know if you &apos;re going to get more optill this , when someone went on Google and saw that the page was this .
That means that we had a cultural impact beyond that scientific impact .
It &apos;s about a week later , there was a problem with the car , had to these files -- these files .
These filters , they take 13,000 ampampampate when the car works works .
Now , the technical between you will look at the files and they &apos;ll tell , &quot; It &apos;s not true . &quot; They &apos;re films too good . &quot;
And instead can do that because they &apos;re very cold to become the reflecting superconduct .
So , at least 271 degrees , to a nurse temperature in the stars , these files can bring the current .
In one of the giunture between the most novemila in the LHC , there was a diphon .
So the films refinding a little bit , and the 13,000 ampampsent bull , they met a resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think that these magnetic magnetic fish , and that they moved about 30 centimeters .
They &apos;re damaged about 50 magnetic magnetic .
We had to get them , what we did .
We repristined and travel .
They &apos;re now coming back to their own sub-up .
LHC is going to be new integral .
We will go , and we expect to get the data to judge or lying , and we continue to keep so our adventure to find what are the morning that we have the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents reaching dibacking the value of science and engineering and engineering . It &apos;s easy to confuture . It &apos;s easy to confuture .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact of going to go beyond the limits , I think is the value of things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of a Inglory , Humphrey Davy , which , I guess , I can , in remarkable to his own own , and his clean , his clean was Michael Fararry , said , &quot; No is dangerous is , &quot; No is dangerous is , &quot; No , &quot; No , dangerous is that there are no mysters in the ideas of the ideas that are not mystical .
Thank you .
I want to start asking that when you , you know , by children , you play , you play up .
As you get to how to reach and make them , you get them and move them , and move them , to learn to think and to be able and remarkable and manipulating space .
The space is deeply connected to the way we understand , the world &apos;s very much about us .
So , by the inspired useful , the useful objects , with physicists , together to my commodity , and my collaborator , and my collaborator Jeevan Kanithi , I started asking me , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of having the mouse as a passion , which is a computer sore on a digital deskle , we can move on a sounds ,
and it &apos;s going to be a pleasure ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big interactive computer as a bisceight .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big interactive computer as a bisceight .
You can move with the hand , can see , &quot; you can see , &quot; between them , I feel the movement and they have a screen and a radio .
But the way , they &apos;re physicists , like the morning , you can move them .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as they get more physicists , remarkable , they know , the other , and they get more physicists , and they become more physicists , and they get more physicists , to move new and they can explore new and fun , we can explore new interaction .
I &apos;ll say , I &apos;ll give some simple example .
This Sifty is configured to show the video : if you get it in a direction , the video is going to take this , if you can get from the other side .
These reactives are aware of the other .
If you reduce them , they &apos;re interested in what is around .
If they &apos;re circles , they notice and can agitate a little bit .
If they &apos;re circles , they notice and can agitate a little bit .
They also get their movement and inclination .
We realized that one of the interesting interesting interesting implications was the interaction was to use that we could use the data , to be the data , to put in the data , to put in the color as if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configured as you to get them to put it in the central , where you get it .
and I can use them to get the color in the central , where you get .
If we &apos;re too , we can put it a little bit .
I &apos;m also beings , as the ability to apprint , like the lingue , the mathematics and logical games where people can try and see the immediately .
Now , I &apos;m --
This is a sequence of Fibonacks , I do with a equations .
Here we have a game of words that is at half between Scarabewoggle and Boggle .
It &apos;s basically , to every first first , you have a letter on every Siftable , , Pratically , you know , you know , you know , and when you &apos;re trying to understand him .
Then , after 30 seconds , you remissing , and you have a new set of letter and new possibilities .
Thank you .
And here is the children came up to the Media Lab , I did it , I &apos;ve been doing a video .
They were very much .
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people very much instructions .
You just say , &quot; You know , &quot; You know , &quot; and they know what to do .
And here &apos;s other people who try .
This is our Tiester &apos;s our little little young , there &apos;s the right .
It was just just impilary them .
They were just the window , for him .
Now , this is an interactive of a interactive cartone .
We wanted to build a tool for the bedddogue , he &apos;s Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , by the Siflavery , they &apos;re going to do .
It can put new characters in the scene , by the Siflavery , they &apos;re going to do .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : The sun is sun .
David Merrill : Now he took a treatment in the scene .
Video : The arange treatment .
Bel work ! Yes ! Yes !
So , you shit up the Siftill and put them out of the characters .
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing your story .
Video : Hao !
DM : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide him as a svolge .
DM : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide him as a svolge .
Video : Vola away ,
DM : The last example I have the time to show you is a tool , I realized , to take it , to go and to the music .
It &apos;s a tool , I realized , for the campamamamples and execting music .
The Siftable here is to the sounds like the basis , and the battery .
Each of these four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also get these sounds in a composes to your pleasure .
And it just just touch a sound , &quot; and a sequence . &quot;
These are actually , you can control from travel , as the wells and the filter .
The acks to a particular sound , and then then incline for travel .
And then there are the general effects as time and volume , which is applicate to the whole sequence .
Let &apos;s look like .
Video : DM : We &apos;ll try to put a base in two Siftable , &quot; we put it in a series , we put in a series , we add , we add another basic basic .
Now , I &apos;m a straight line .
Video : DM : Now I &apos;m going to add some percussions --
Video : DM : And I &apos;ll put the battery to the battery , so I can control the effect from the vivious .
Video : DM : I can reveleness the whole sequence of inclining , and then from one side or from the other .
Video : DM : And now I &apos;ll add the bottom for the bottom to give more expression .
Video : DM : I can reach the sequence &quot; to fly . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to be planning , but I can suddenly , to make it more or more cort .
And now , finally , I can smoking the whole sequence of inclining to the left the Sifey . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new interfaces as well as they work as our brain work and it &apos;s going to work .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this perperspective , and also some possibilities that we try to bring out from the lab .
The concept I want to transmate is that we &apos;re going to get this new new objects that we want to interact with the digital media , which will will be information in our world .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the now to talk to all of you .
They &apos;re a scritice .
I &apos;m going to talk about this , but it &apos;s more than this , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the fashion of my life .
And I don &apos;t think that it can change .
But , he said , something particular happened to my life , and in my career , and my career , which has to reach the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is I &apos;ve been written this book , this biography called &quot; Mangia , Prega , &quot; which , &quot; I saw , and she became a great , for some reason I was going to get a big , sensors , unlike , &quot; international .
And the result is that everywhere , people are treatment as if I was conducted .
It &apos;s true -- conducted !
They &apos;re all talking about me , and they &apos;re all worried and say , &quot; You don &apos;t have a fair to do ?
You don &apos;t fear to keep writing for all life without being able to create a book that can can be able to create a book that can importing someone ? &quot;
Can you importantly someone ? &quot;
It &apos;s rassurant , you know .
But it could go worse , at the one I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say , I was a broadolescent -- I was a scritual .
I would take it up the same reaction .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t I want to have success ?
You don &apos;t fear that the ulilights ?
You don &apos;t fear to do this to make all all life without anything that &apos;s ever out and to die on a cumb of every broken broken with the wocking bits of failure ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : &quot; Yes . &quot;
I fear to all those things .
I always had painting .
And I also fear of many other things that people could not inate .
And as the alge and other things spaves .
But , as I thought , and I thought , and I would ask me , why ?
Is it ?
It &apos;s logical that anybody have to be spaving from a job that you have to do .
But what &apos;s that particular imposed to make us nervous about health mentally , as the mental health health as a way that other career ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemistry and not remember a chemistry and not a time in his 40 years of activity , which was asked if they were afraid to be engineer ?
He never have -- that stuck of John , how to be ?
It doesn &apos;t work that , you know ?
Onestly , the engineers like chemistry and nesture , in the lawers , gash , the reputation of being alcolized maniacy .
We have enough to be a lot of this reputation , and not just a creativity of them , we have this reputation of being huge instabessentially .
And it &apos;s not the other other you see the tristes of the magnification , the needges that , only in the 20th century , they die and often often .
And also those who don &apos;t have suicked to be really disappeared by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before we die , in the last interview said , &quot; Every , my book said , &quot; Every little bit more &quot; One extraordinary business about their life .
But we don &apos;t take a lot of time , because we heard these things so much , we &apos;ve heard these things so much , we have to have completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and the bulence are in some way to be a little and that art , to conflit , to the end , to the end , constantly , and the art .
And the question I want to take all here today is : Are you agree with this idea ?
It &apos;s good , because it &apos;s also looking at a centimeter of distance to me , not good for nothing .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous , and I don &apos;t want to see the next century .
I think it &apos;s better encouraging our creative creative creative creative people .
And I know , I know , in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start to get out to fit to the way , I felt that I felt like the circumstances , overwhose are in my career .
You know , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m a 40 years .
I &apos;ve still about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely to write from now , and then it &apos;s going to be judicted by the world as the work that was after the world , as the last book .
I &apos;ll be to slavor , because we &apos;re all more or less friends here -- it &apos;s likely to my biggest success is to my spread .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thought that leads a person to blow in the morning , and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would continue to do this .
So , the question is , how ?
And so it seems , after many reflect , which the way to work to continue to keep him to keep what to create psychological psychological psychological , right ?
I had to some security distance to me , I &apos;m writing , I &apos;m writing , and my natural natural beauty , which is going to get . And as I was trying to look through the time , trying to look through the time , trying to see if they could have have better ideas and see if they could have better ideas and see if they could have better better ideas and more sane ideas and more and healthy ideas and more sane and and sane and ,
how to help people people who are able to manage the emotional reaches .
And that research has brought me to ancient and ancient Rome .
You can go to why I &apos;m going to go back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
It was thinking that creativity was this spirit look at the wine and they sell men from a few surprising sounds and known , for reasons and unknown , for reasons and known .
The greatest were called these spirits . &quot;
Socpy , wonderful , he thought of having a demand that elargive saggee from far .
The Romans were the same idea , but they called the kind of spirit without a genius .
The which is great , because the Roman didn &apos;t really think a genius was someone who was a smart .
They thought a geniio was this kind of divine , which was a living living in the lawalls of a study , a little bit like the elevent of a bunch of artist , and they sell it to get the point of artist and model the result of the artist and model the result of that work .
Here &apos;s the willing -- that &apos;s the distance of which is -- that we &apos;ve got to protect you from your work .
And all they knew that was so that he worked , right ?
So , the artists were protected by certain things , like , as the too narcism , not ?
If your work was excited to take it and all the meriture , all they all knew that they were helped by this genius .
If your work failed , it wasn &apos;t all your , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a incapable .
And so people han concept of the western creativity in the West for a long time .
And then the Rinhaissance , and it &apos;s all the way , we put the human being at the center of the universe , over and mysters and mysters and mysters and mysters and mysters and mysters and they get the divinity .
This was the most human principle , and people started thinking that creativity came out of the iduo .
And for the first time in history , you start to reference this or that artist as a genius , rather than a genius to a person with genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think it &apos;s going to allow someone , a simple person to create a recipe as a source , like a founder , the essence and the people of the divini divini divini , and etern is a responsibility for a phililers , and etern to give the fragile that human .
It &apos;s how to ask someone to ingoods .
It &apos;s completely , it &apos;s completely the ego and creates all these ingestures expectancy expectations .
And I think it was to have a 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it &apos;s , the question is , and now ?
Can we do it diversity ?
You can get to a more ancient than human understanding of human relationship and mystery .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can &apos;t have 500 years of thought , in a 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people between the audience who solgers would be able to legiture , you know , you do , you know , you do people who are going to get people to get to their projects .
Probably not to convince you all about this .
But the question I want to bring is -- why ?
Why don &apos;t you think about this way ?
Because it has more sense of anything that I &apos;ve ever heard to explain the exasperating exasperating .
A process that , as anyone who ever tried to do something -- so , basically , all here -- you know , you don &apos;t understand rationally .
And , in fact , it can sometimes look completely paranoring .
I did this recent against the extraordinary poeted Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but it was a poeer for all life and said that during his living living and said that during his own childhood , and he felt it was in the camps , and I felt it was going to get out in the camps , and I felt it was in the landscape .
He said , it was like a fragorous fragorous .
And that was roling to her from her landscape .
It felt it , because he could could be the land under his feet under his feet .
He knew to have one thing to do that point , and he was about , his words , &quot; to go as a match . &quot;
And he was going to go to home and it was going to follow this poem , and it would not have to get another piece of paper and a hit , and it would have to collect it , and it &apos;s page , and it &apos;s paying it .
And three times I couldn &apos;t be fast , so correfuel and corremoved and correed , and he would removed to the house and she would continued through and she would continued to go through and she would continued to roled through the landscape , trying to , as she said , &quot; &quot; another poet . &quot;
And then there were some times -- this piece never forever -- there was no moments that was almost lost , right ?
So , he was going to get home and the poem and the poem , and he was made a math in the while he was going , and he said , he was like to hell , and the office .
And it was a poem from the coda , and he was going to put in his body and the page on the page .
And in these cash , the poem would be presented on the perfect page , but the contrary of the first word .
So when I felt -- it &apos;s pazes , it &apos;s exactly the ugual process .
Not my creatures -- I &apos;m not a conducucucucture .
I &apos;m a mud muster , and my way to work is ; I can wake up at the same one day and to get up and go up and go down to the hell .
But even I , in my testestables , I &apos;ve got striscized against that thing , sometimes .
And I guess , many of you han .
You know , even if the work and ideas me came to a certain source of a certain source , I couldn &apos;t be aware .
And what is this ?
And how can we relate to it to make it , but , rather , you know , but , it &apos;s going to be to stay ?
And as I &apos;m about , the best example I have the Mr. Tom Waits , which I interviewing years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life was the artist of the artist &apos;s life was the artist of the artist , trying to control , management , to check , and we know , they &apos;re all all interiorized .
But then invecked , he was hot , and a day he was driving on a Los Angeles , he was driving all for him .
He was going to be fast and everything was a sudden this little framework , which is going to get into his head , as inspiration , which is a inspiration , and the wants , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the desider , but it wasn &apos;t to how to take it .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a math .
So , I started to hear this kind of old ansian old extra , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to get to hit .
I &apos;m not enough , I &apos;m not good enough , and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to go into the panic , you &apos;ll stop .
He was going to put the whole mental process , and made something completely new .
I just just just the sky and said , &quot; See , don &apos;t see that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Ti seems to write a song now ?
If you really want to get , you , it &apos;s a more more than a moment when I can take care of you .
Altrain , you go to importantly , something else today .
You know , I &apos;m going to get Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his process started started to change after this .
Not the work , the job was still hurry as always .
But the process , and the fish flow anesy , the weight was reduced when he had the genius , the genius that was was going to get back to where they were going to go back to where it was , to where it was , to be a inter-and reported .
but it &apos;s well-like , wonderful bizarra , wonderful , a conversation between Tom and this straight , and that but it wasn &apos;t Tom .
So how I felt that story I realized to change a little bit , even the way I worked and already save me a time .
This idea , I &apos;ll save when I was writing &quot; Mangia , Prega , &quot; and fell , &quot; and fell of the disperation that we &apos;re all working on something and we can &apos;t get to think that we &apos;re working on something and we can &apos;t start thinking that it &apos;s worst st book .
Not just good , the worst book .
And I started thinking about gecting this project .
But then I remember Tom I talked to the air and try .
So , I get my face on the manoscritical , and I reached my comments to a vacuum of the room .
And I said to high vices , &quot; Somebody , what if this book is not going to be going to be interested in , not ?
Because I &apos;m going to see what I &apos;m going to see , I don &apos;t have more than this .
So if you want to be better , you have to presenting and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know , I don &apos;t tell me .
I &apos;ll just write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I would want to think that was recorded that I &apos;ve been presented to do my part , &quot; because , you know , OK -- they &apos;re so , OK -- let &apos;s go to the North Africa of the people who was dance to the clear dances of the North of the North of the people who went on on and the alyer and the lab and the lab and the lab and the lab and the lab and the lab and the lab and and the music that they were going to be been on for for hours .
And they always magnifires , because the ballerini were professionals and were fantastic .
But every one , seventually , something was was , and one of these artists became actually transcending .
And I know what I know , because I know you have a view , to a certain point , a certain point , a performance .
It was like the time , you stopped , and the ballerine walked through a kind of laptop and was not different from usually , as the 1,000 noticed , but everything was going to be .
And suddenly , you can &apos;t just as a human human .
But it &apos;s going to get out of the divinity .
And when this was , people knew what was , people knew what was , they called her .
They were trying to bay , and they started to bay , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curious notice -- when Mors invased the south of Spagna , I was this habits , I was this above with their and the ready to change in the lah , Allah , Allah , &quot; I can still hear in the flamenco , &quot; I can still hear in cords or in the flamenco .
In Saign , when a artist did something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , I , and I &apos;m a magnifiction , and I &apos;m going to understand , it &apos;s a bunch of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need .
But , the problem comes the day , for the same , when you see , you know , when you see it &apos;s the morning , and I find that are the 11 , and I &apos;m going to get more .
It &apos;s just a mortle with a lot of bad ginocoly , and maybe it &apos;s not going to get more to that althetic .
And maybe nobody will will give God God again as a gira , and so , so it &apos;s to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most pay-resolder to do in a creative life .
But maybe it &apos;s not to be so corosciant if you can &apos;t believe , advanced , which the most extraordinary aspects of your being being to .
But he just just believe you get out in the time , you know , a kind of a source of a welt of your life that team you have to get something else when you &apos;re going to get something else when you &apos;re going to get .
And , you know , if we think about this way .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s because I thought about a different months during the working of the book that I &apos;m going to think , the dangerous book that I &apos;m going to think , the dangerous , and I &apos;m going to think of my great great great great great .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel electrized this is , not to have to have painting .
Not to get you . It &apos;s just your work .
Continua present-up for your side , any one can be .
If your work is balling , it &apos;s balling , it .
If the divine , hasn , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , for a little bit of wonderful , for a time through your forces , then &quot; Ole ! &quot;
And you do , you do the same dance .
&quot; Ole ! &quot; to you .
I think , you have to teach it .
&quot; Ole ! &quot; to you , just , just for having human love and testles to have a tal love to reach .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
And as you know , I talked about some of these projects on the human genome , about what can significant and discovery of new genes .
We &apos;re starting a new perspective : we started to digital the biology and now now to get that digital code , we &apos;re going to get into a new phase of biology , design and synthesizing and synththesizing life .
We always tried to bring big questions .
&quot; What is the life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists , I think they have to understand vararity .
We tried different approaches , reducing the minimi .
We &apos;re going to be digital by almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was was to move from the analogical world of biology in the digital world .
Now , we ask , we can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome , which is the smallest genome .
And we tried to reduce a genome for creared a little bit more small .
We can actually get a hundred of genuary genes of the 500 that are here .
But when we take a look at his metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our .
It &apos;s simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one , it &apos;s very imlikely to make this living cell cell cell cell cell .
So we decide that the only one on to design was synthesize this chromosome , to get to change the components for some of these critical questions .
And so we started the avoid we could synthesize a chchchromosome ? &quot;
Can we have the chemistry to make these great molecules that we never have to create before ?
And , in case , we can make a cromosome ?
A cromosome is just just a piece of chemical material .
The speed with which we can digalize life is growing to be growing exponential .
Our ability to write the gene code , instead , designing , but it &apos;s going to be better .
And our most recent results the reaching on a curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process has requires , starting with a bioethical review before we start the first experiments .
But we found that synthesize DNA is very hard .
There are decade of thousands of machines in the world that produce little segment , the long length of 30 to 50 letter , and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the most mimistakes there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments and corret the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , to start by the digital genome of Phi 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills .
We designed framments , they &apos;ve been designed the mistakes and get a molecule of DNA molecule , and I &apos;ve got a molecule of DNA .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material , and we put it in the bacteria , and we put it in the bacteria , and they started reading this genetic code and make them viral particles .
The viral particles are then left by cells , they &apos;re going back and they destroy .
I talked about a lot of recent the oil industry said that they have to tell them that they have to understand this model .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build his same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in big .
We wanted to build the whole chromosome .
They &apos;re more than 580 mile mile to 80 mile .
So we thought we &apos;ve got to build it in the viruses of the virus , so that we can change the casses to understand what they &apos;re the components of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these are need to be very accurate .
When we started this genome for the first time in 1995 , the first time in 1995 , the age of a mixer for every 10 mixes .
We found , resequence , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence , we &apos;ve never been able to work .
A part of the process is designed check for 50 letter to get 50 letter to make more seged with all other segments that I &apos;ve got to make more small submasses that work together .
Let &apos;s take the untic elements here .
You &apos;ve heard you read that we put in the filigrgrade .
Think about that : We have a genetic code on four letter : A , C , Good and T.
Three of those letter codify , and they have a cover , and there &apos;s a specifically , and there &apos;s a specifically to letter amammed for every amminoacious .
So we can use the gene code for words , frass , thoughts .
What we did at the beginning was authograised .
Some people have been delusers from the fact that wasn &apos;t .
We designed these segments for potential to just get them with exist .
There are a lot of reparate , and they put them together .
And we started to assembling of the parts , we start with five to seven mix letter , to seven mix letter , and they &apos;re going to get to get to 72 miil to get to 72 mix .
And we can take these segments in ababundance , so that we can try to make them a very much robust -- like you can see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems to be the tabellon a basket of basket .
When we get to these very much long segments , more than 100 mixes , they &apos;re not going to grow more directly in E.
You get the limits of the molecular biology .
So we &apos;ve considered some other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called reaching welling , which in biology , which in biology , you use the DNA to refying the DNA to unt .
Here &apos;s a example .
This organism , called Deinoccurry , can absorb three million rad rad .
You can see in the upper riquake as his cromosome came out .
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly as it was before .
There &apos;s thousands of organisms that are able to do .
These organisms can be completely completely .
They can live under the vacuum .
They &apos;re absolutely absolutely certain life in space , and you can get new environmental environments .
And to say , NASA showed that this is .
This is a molecule that we built using these processes , just using the lieventually using the lievity of segments to put it .
The lievelished them .
This picture was not taken with a electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a molecule that we can see the way to see the microscope .
These are a picture that coprint of a second six seconds .
This is the published that we did a little bit of time .
They &apos;re more than 580,000 letter code .
It &apos;s the largest molecule ever created by man .
It has a molecular molecular weight .
If we &apos;re going to be a caracy to 10 without spaces , you would like 142 pages to transcure this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ? How can we act it ? How can we act it ?
Of course , you have a virus game .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when they get bacteria .
It &apos;s more simple , when it &apos;s eucariote as our : you can just just extrarch nuclear , and put another , which is basically the clonation of clonation .
In the bacterium bacteria , the chromosome is instead of integrated the cell , but we &apos;ve been able to do a complete of a chchromosome from a cell to another and active .
We clean a cromosome cromosome .
The two are different as the men from mouth .
We add some gene in a way to decide what to decide to decide to have this cromosome .
And then he sad with the losing out of the proteins .
And when we put the cell is been studies -- and you get our graphict , and you &apos;ll get our graphict -- the new cromosome is go into the cell .
And we started that we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to get more , but we tried to get more in there .
This is one of the most mechanisms .
We found that tantisssell a second or a third cromosome from some part , add a few of new trouble , and you can see in a second thousands of perspective .
So , who thinks about evolution as a gene to the time that it doesn &apos;t understand a lot of biology .
There &apos;s a lot of the freserve called &quot; retrial to tell you that DNA to say , the DNA .
The cromosome was in the cell , not one .
The phones -- the phones that we have a pitch .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other cromosome as a material , and it has been , and we got to have a building , and we &apos;ve got to only only the cell and the new chromosome .
It became blue because of the genes that we have a hoses .
And in a short of time , all the characteristics of a species are going to be lost , and it &apos;s transformed in the new software that we have a new species , based on the new software that we put in the cell .
All proteins are changing , people change , members are changes , and when we read the genetic code exactly what we transfit .
Now , this could look like a genetic alchemy , but it &apos;s going to change things in a very substantial .
Now , I already explain that there is no genesis -- but of progress , and I said , maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the evolution , and I said , maybe maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the Cambriana in which is going to get new species on this digital .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s enough to find when we think about our needs .
We &apos;re going to go from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right for a example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one in 1946 ; in 40 years , there &apos;s four .
We &apos;re going to find food , it &apos;s going to find food , the food , medicine and welline for six billion people .
It &apos;s going to be more to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion fuel than five billion fuel bits , more than 30 billion bags .
That means 100 million bits a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process for remarkable , it &apos;s a huge challenge .
We have to understand the whole emission of CO2 emission from these materials that finds in the atmosphere .
At the day , thank you scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I love thinking that are the designers for the future .
The electronics industry has only a dozen of the dozen industry , and think about how many different things were came out .
Our limits here are principle data from the biological reality and the imagination .
We have techniques , thank you to these synthesizing methods , able to create what we call genomics .
We can build a big robot that can make a million cromosomes a day .
Think about processing these 20 million genes of different genes or to try to optimix their processes , to make them , new vaccines , we can change , because of the molecular team , and create more biology molecular now that in the last 20 years .
And it &apos;s just a selection .
We can choose for survival , chemical production or fuel , production of diers , vaccines .
This is an ancient istic of some software programmed software that we &apos;re working to be able to sex and design species at the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t necessarily know how to be .
We know exactly what is their genetic code .
We &apos;re focusing on the fuel of fourth generation .
You also saw you that extract act extract from the grain was a very bad experiment .
We have a fuel of second , and third generation that will use enough to be able to be on the waste coal , as they are different kinds of butanle , like the doctor or different butanle .
But the only way , the biology can have a great impact without increasing increasing food and limlimb food , and limlimb the available , and we think that &apos;s going to be to make the whole whole thing , and we think that they can achieve this goal , and we think that we can have the first coal .
The solar light combined with CO2 is a metodo--- but in our discoveries in the world , we &apos;ve found different metods .
This is a organism that we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
It &apos;s going to be in the ocean , about 2,500 feet of deepity .
It &apos;s a metan using hydrogen molecular as a source of energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can incanary CO2 , which can easily be transported to your dbees , convert that CO2 in coal , to drive this process .
So , we think we could be able to increase what the question of what life is , &quot; We have , versus , we have the deserve goal of chemistry to get the whole oil industry .
So , right . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can you can &apos;t it ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working to use the same metods to create instantanes .
You saw this year with the influence , we always go back to a year and a dollar in less when it &apos;s to find the right vaccine .
I think what you can change in anticipe .
And that &apos;s the future could start look at changing , now , the tree of evolution , accell-evolution , accell-evolution with the evolution with syntheists , and then then then , and then then , and then then , and then then , and then then then eign cells .
We &apos;re so much from the way to improve people .
Our goal is to do a way to live enough to try to make a lot of a lot . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to see , the most quickly , some fundamental work , the new technology that we took to the Microsoft in the follow of a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s a environment that you can interact is at the local level that you can interact with a huge amount of visual data .
So , we &apos;re seeing a lot of gigabyte of digital photos with a kind of wealth and continuous , for a very quickly , and we can .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much much information that we see , how big they &apos;re these collected data or images .
Most of these digital photos , but this for example is a provenient from the Biary Biary of Congress , and reentry in the Chinese chalk , and revers in the 300 megaps .
It &apos;s not a difference because the only thing that limits of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen in any moment . It &apos;s also a very flexel .
This is a whole book , not pictures of the data .
This is the Casa desolate of Dickens . Every column .
To show you that it &apos;s just about the textbook , and we can do something like that , to see that , to see that it &apos;s a real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial for read a electronic book .
I don &apos;t tell you .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s a number of The Guardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a seat .
And it really gives you a pleasure and the beautiful experience of read the real version of a daily or a daily dly , which is a a kind of a kind of kind of a half of a kind of kind of a half of a half of a half of a half of a half of a half a kind of tough .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of The Guardian .
We created a public fashion on the high solving -- much more than what it uses in a normal publisher -- and we put it in a normal publisher -- and we put it in the extra .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specifically technical models .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that this means to put people in the people , and to other kind of , you know , I didn &apos;t have to be necessary .
Of course , the maps is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this field , I don &apos;t want to lose time , if we don &apos;t have to say that we have to give you .
These are all the roads in the United States sovoved here geospatial image of NASA .
So , we go to something else .
This is actually from the web .
This is a project called Photosynth , which figures two different technologies .
A is Seadragon and the other is a visual research at the computer . It &apos;s very interesting that that Noah Snavely , a student of Washington , with the help Steve Seitz and Rick Szelki Szelki &apos;s great .
And it &apos;s from the websamp , management from Seadragon .
You can see that when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from a picture of the other thing , and have this kind of experience experience .
But the spacectively pictures here has actually actually a meaning .
The algorithms of visualization have these pictures together , so that they &apos;re going to reach these pictures together , so that you imagine -- all the close close to the lagues , and they imagine -- all the next next to the Montagagagagagagagagement -- they &apos;re taken .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more spread .
I want to go directly to one of the original data of Noah-ah-h-year-old hosynth . I &apos;m going to work for the first time , the first time the last time , the first time the last time , the technology is really the key behind this technology , the technology that we put in the website . And it &apos;s not necessarily evidence that we put in the website .
We had to worry about the aspects of legal aspects and saying .
This is a reconstruction of the Caral Cacactively images from Flickr . Bast . Bast , and you get some kind of framework , and you get pictures of these wildddamage , and so on . Olickr . Olickr . Oach of these conconstitute .
So they &apos;re all pictures from Flickr and they &apos;re all connected to space .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this .
You know , I never would have thought to end to work for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very free to get this kind of accounts .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of photocaming : from those phones of the mobile phones , a significant number of these professional phones , to do this environment .
And if I can , I try to try and get those more struggle .
Many block is a bunch of faces , etc .
So , somewhere you find a series of photographs -- eccolumn .
This is a poster of Nobody .
We can go from the physics of this environment .
The essential is that we can do things with social environment . This is taking data from the whole memory , is taking data from the entire memory , from the point of view -- and connected to all those data together .
All those pictures become connected together , more than the parts .
You have a model of the earth .
Think about this as a prolder of Stephen Lawler on the virtual Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complex as a man , and the people use , and the people use .
Their pictures are marced with metads by other people .
If someone is the idea of contrast , all these sounds saying , my name , my photos of NoDame , I &apos;m going to be a sudden , you know , and I can use how to ingrade it , and I can use how to ingrade for immersive , using the picture of people else , and having a social experience of the cross-like , using the phones of people who are , and have a a social experience of the mo-.
Of course , a consequence of all the interesting virtual models , extremely elaborate of every interesting part of the Earth , collective phototypes and satellitary images , but from satellitary .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized that ? What &apos;s your software is going to feel to do is that at some point , in the next years , in the next years , all the world will be practice .
BAA : Yes . What is doing is that practice is to find .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , you to , between pictures .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the images .
The thing is very interesting is if you think about remarkable information seant that many of these pictures can possibly be .
As a research research research on the web , you know , you get a frase and the page on the web has a lot about pictures .
Now , what happens if that picture is connected to all your photo ?
So the amount of interconnection , and the amount of remarkable to get it is really enormous . It &apos;s a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the pleasant pleasant when you travels to and one of the research research is that we can live between who don &apos;t have to live who don &apos;t forget the past in the wind , the wind , touch it in the wind , touch it in the wind , the waving of the plants .
Basti thinking that the sciaman Jaguar Jaguar , or the idea of the Lattea , or the Muit &apos;s still column , or the Inuit &apos;s still sent , or the subject , or the subject of Dharma , the world &apos;s importance , the world that we live in the most of anthropology , and the idea that the world we live in a sense of the fact , but it &apos;s just a model of reality , but it &apos;s a model of the reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stirpe has made , good or bad , or bad , or not , many generations .
And , of course , we all share of the exists .
We all all do . We all do .
We are subjects to rerits .
We have to deal with the death death of , so we don &apos;t surprised it and we look at it .
We all have a art art .
What it &apos;s the particular is the particular , the round of song , the ritory of the dance dance of culture .
Not the leaders that are the forests of Borneo , or the follow of the Voodoo &apos;s Voodoo &apos;s desert Kaised in Kenya , the Churge in Kenya , the Curge , the Curander &apos;s heart , or a cammers , or a camp in the heart .
He was my journey of the journey in the desert a month ago , or a hallevator of the Qomolangle in the values of the world .
All these populations are teaching that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And if you reflect a moment , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
Insisisides , the miriades of cultures , they create a spiritual beritual and cultural life that flight , and it &apos;s important for the well-being as as the biological roughness .
And you can think about this cultural rich as a a etnosphere and you can defined the etnososphere , the whole whole concepts , sample , and inspirational , ideas , inspired , intuition , inspired , intuition , by the human alba .
The etnosphere is the great pathrimonium .
It &apos;s the symbols of what we are and what we can be as a kind of inquisitive .
And because the biosphere was gravely consumed by the same thing was to be in the etnosphere and too much more quickly .
No biologist , for example , would say that 50 percent of all the species is is on the orest one of the sumintion because it &apos;s just , or -- in the most appowers -- in the field of biological diversity -- and not even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even a little bit about hythththesis .
The weird of all this is , obviously , the perspective .
When you were born 6,000 lingue on this planet .
A language is not just compost by a vocabolarian or a series of rules of rules .
A language is the exhibition of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle with which is a soul of every culture comes in the world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a bunch of mind , a thought , a thought , a thought , a spiritual possibility .
And those 6,000 linger , as we &apos;re sitting at Monterey , at least half the people , at the ears of the children .
They don &apos;t get more teacher , the children , the wells , which doesn &apos;t have died .
What is more tristes than being a silence , from being the last to talk about a language , the last talking to a language , not to get to to put the wisdom or to get the promises of the kids ?
This is a few weeks of the world &apos;s been some of someone in the world &apos;s two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks .
And I know someone to say , &quot; Is it better ?
The world would not a better place if we talk about the same language ? &quot; Benisate , then we talk about all yoruba . We talk about cantese .
We talk about kogs .
You can find a tract of what it means to say , &quot; I can &apos;t talk to your language .
I would like to make you a journey through the etnosh --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a bunch of what we &apos;re lost .
Many of us department that when I say , &quot; different ways of existing .
Let &apos;s take for example , this bimbo Barasana , in Amazon the wild wild , the people &apos;s willing , which creates midancy , which creates midaten from the bull of the west in the bads of serious wild .
It &apos;s a people who don &apos;t can get the blue blue blue from the blue blue , because the celests , because the celized birth , because the time is , which depends .
They have a strian language and a candle , called &quot; exogy &quot; , &quot; Ramia &quot; : you have to sposing a person who talks about a different language .
Everybody has been a radical past mitological , but the particularly the particularly these families , the particularly in these families , you &apos;re about six or seven layers because of the matures .
They can hear and then they start talking to them .
We take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived , the Waoran Ecuador , a popular people who had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionaries have been trying to a mistake .
They did , they did , they did them retraits that they reritenagement , they reritenagement , dealing that people who &apos;s forest , they had never seen anything about bi-dimensional forest .
They collected the pictures , they &apos;ve been able to the research of a shape or a figure , or a figure , they &apos;re not going to get anything , they have to have the diavoid diavy , and they kill five missionaries with lance .
But Waorani don &apos;t kill only kill the foreign .
They kill them .
54 percent of mortality was caused by their own .
We &apos;re saved at eight generations and we found two natural death and when we have been able to know , they put a lot of their invectent , they have a lot of their invectent , and then they kill it , and then they kill it .
The camamammers were able to recognize the animal that &apos;s 40 pass and recognize the species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned a very interesting task when my Harvard professor , I asked if I want to go to Haiti to Haiti in the basic secret of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes and Tonton Macoutes , and Tonton Macoutes .
To give a sense to miracolous miracolous , I would have to understand the Voodoo , and the Voodoo is not magic .
It &apos;s rather a metaphor a visual view of the world .
Very interesting .
If I asked you to tell me about the world , what would you say ?
Cristian , Islam , Good , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has not to religious . And instead , it &apos;s not the other than the distilled .
What makes a interesting thing that it &apos;s the intense is the intense to life and death .
So , the beds do the beds .
The spirits can be invocated by the Grands Actually , they respond to the dance and replace to the soul of the living as a brief moment is that for a short moment is that for a short active active .
For this woods to say , &quot; You know , you know , who are going to talk about God .
We say , we say , &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re posite , is the spirit that you can do ?
So , you see these incredible events : follow woodoo in state of trance that touch , and they touch a rather than power of the mind is that the body when it &apos;s catalyzed a demonstration in a state of extremely excitation .
And the people who have the most extraordinary people who have been in the most extraordinary Kogi &apos;s Kogi &apos;s Santa Marta , in Colombia sectors .
They get to the ancient of the ancient civilization that once live on the aid pleasure of the Colombia in the acacting , the people , the people who are reports , the people who are going to be on the volcanic cards .
In a continent of blood , this people who was never conquisted by the spagnles .
And today , they have governed by a clever , but their formation is so extraordinary .
The young follow waste , they &apos;ve got to three or four , and they live secregated in a world , made of good and nintures in the basis of the stones of the fold for 18 years .
Two years , nine years choose about reproduce the nine months of gestation that transform in the mother , now are metaphor , they &apos;re metaphor in the Chuter .
For this time , they get acculturated to their society , values , values that are predictions and just their preayers and only their preayers .
At the term of this incredible beginning , they &apos;re suddenly brought out and the first time in life , at the age of 18 years , they see an an alba . And that I think of the first bright , when the sun the sun , when the sun the valvalues of beautiful beautiful landscape , everything has learned in theory is a conference in his own own own own .
&quot; Vist ? I said ,
It &apos;s amazing . Now it &apos;s now to you protect it . &quot;
They call a lot of the world , and say that we , fratthers , we are the colpain of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about indeed populations and the environment invoid Rousseau and the old story of the noble selagagement , which is a concept in his simplicity or maybe invoid Those , and we say , &quot; Those , and we say that these are more close to the Earth .
The indees are not noses , they &apos;re not noses by nostaly .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the Amad , the Asmat or in the Tibet , but thank you at the Tibet , but thank you at time and rites , they created a mystic of the Earth is not about a concept of essentially , but on a very much more substic : the concept that the Earth can live .
What does that mean ?
It means that a girl who &apos;s going to be a little bit of Ands that the mountain is a spirit that will take his dest to be a human being depy , and it &apos;s going to have a very different thing with the mountain or that place that &apos;s a lot of a boy that &apos;s a mountain or that &apos;s a rock of rocks that a rock of rock rock that &apos;s a rock of rocks to be a rock .
which is the dimmer of a spirit or a mineral is irrilevant .
What is interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between individuals and the natural world .
They grew up in the forests of Columbia Britannic Britannic credying to be cut .
And that has a human being different from my friends Kwakikiutl who believe that the forests are the dimer of Hukukukukukukukukuk and the cannibal bal that live in the world , spirits that live in the world , spirits that they live in the world , spirits .
If you start to think these cultures can create different different , you can start to understand some of them , you can start to understand some of them .
I wrote this picture to aprile in the Amazon narrow .
Maybe some of you heard about the ayhuash , the most powerful psychoactive psychoactive repertory .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuash is not the potential for the substance , but his elaboration . It &apos;s compost by two elements .
From one side , this lightle that &apos;s contains a bunch of Tioline , hardddogene , read it &apos;s a lot of hallucinogene .
And by taking the only planted one of a smoo smoo , which allowed a little bit , but it &apos;s mixed with the family of a caffecting family of a caffection of the caffection is said Psychchchment .
This plant plant contains , very similar to seriotonine , dimethyltrypppyypppyypppypppyppyppamine .
If you ever see Yanomami pull up for the hide , the basically , the substance that they do from a different set of species , you can &apos;t get a methyltrypppypppypppamine .
Thirt to the dust on for the nose is a little bit like to be shooted by a four-block of dipinking and land on a sea sea . It doesn &apos;t believe a distortion of reality . It &apos;s actually not a distortion of reality .
I &apos;m going to be often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has written the man who has taken the hallucined , with his replacement in the 191930s in Mexico .
So , I &apos;m not a classificate , you can &apos;t have to be however , because if you &apos;re doing not to tell nobody to be hallucined . They can &apos;t tell any of being hadn .
It &apos;s possible to assume , just if you get the hasn of chemicals that denian MAO .
Now , the beautiful : the Tibeta-coaline that are in this liana injeers , are the same kind of need to potential to get the tripping triguguing trouble . The question is extra . The question is exhierve spontaneous . The question is a little bit of the plants , like this , but if you combined in this way , create a chemistry that &apos;s a chcheap that &apos;s so much than the ground ?
We use the great eufemism of the mixy and the mixy , which can reveal sticks .
But if we ask Indians , they &apos;ll tell us &quot; &quot; &quot; The plants talk about . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuash , which distinguished , and that we can tell them in the forest , and they would get in the same species .
If we ask them how to stay their tass to say , &quot; I thought , &quot; I think it &apos;s not , &quot; You know , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take 17 variety in a night of laming and each other , and each other .
With this is not graduate Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than count .
Now , , they &apos;re going to applausers , the problem is that even those who have to the indees are pitted , but some way to get to the world , and they get beyond .
In fact , the century , between 300 years , it &apos;s not going to remind for his his wars or its technology , but rather like the technology was where we stop and have a wealth , and we used to have a lot of biological diversity and cultural distraction of biological diversity and cultural . Now the problem is not the change .
All the cultures have been involved in a dance for new dance for new possibility .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indian Sioux didn &apos;t stop being Sioux when they put it from the arco and frecovered as Americans don &apos;t stop being American when they put on the hot and they put it on the hot and hot .
It &apos;s not the change or the technology that mindity or the technology that &apos;s empowered .
The wall fell of the domination .
And if you get a look at the world , I find these are not destined to disappear .
They &apos;re living living and dynamics , from the existence from the existence of the existence that go beyond their adaptment .
I &apos;m a disboscameras in the paintings of the Penan --
a popular nomade of Sarawak , in the ground , a popular west , a people who have lived lights in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduction to the service and the next titation on the west , where you can see the river , where you can see the river from the lim that seems to get a half Bornee , where the windmed , where the winder , they &apos;re going to be a willing to get the willing ,
you get to repires with the waste , with the forest .
Or , in the Yanomami , are the disease that are coming with the discovery .
If we go on on the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research research , you &apos;ll see the wall of the policy .
As you know the genocide , the extinction of a people , is conducted at universal level , but the hurt , the destruction of life of a people , not only is to be an announced , but it &apos;s a lot of development .
And you can &apos;t understand the Tibet until you &apos;re not going to be on the beginning .
I lost 6,000 miles Chengdu in China , the West through Tibet , through Tibet , coming to Lhasa with a young people , but only came to Lhasa with a young connection , but only came back to Lhasa .
6,000 monuments in the sacred and wwwwwwwwwwinder and centers .
1.2 million people killed by the military Rivolution in the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical ascritical at Panchen Lama .
The one means that it was killed to the Chinese invasion .
Suo guy &apos;s flew with Sua Santity during the diaspora who has brought the people in Nepal .
Sua mother was imprisoned and his cold was to be reported .
It was brought to hide in a carcing at at the age of two years under his waving because it couldn &apos;t live without him .
The surprised , which did the same , was a samp camp .
A day has invertissue a besk of a cheap , and this transgression , was a besides , was sent to seven years .
The pain of Tibet can be insable , but the spirit of the people is from the people &apos;s tener .
And it was , all reduce a choice .
We want to live in the world monocromatic monotony or we want to accept the policy of diversity ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he died , he said that his largest was that , in our way , to go to this view of the world , not only we can see the whole gamma of human imagination , but we &apos;re going to see the whole gamma of thought , but we &apos;ll give us a sat at at at that there were other possibilities that they were other possibilities that they were other possibilities .
And it &apos;s a thousand years , to remind that our species is there for 600,000 years .
The From Neolitica , which has given us us us the agriculture , which has made us to socking the socking of the season of the samp , with the next cler , creating the archarchy of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world industrialized has to be 300 years .
And that &apos;s a story , not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges we have to get to to the millenses to come .
When these miriads of cultures , what we want to say to be human , they respond to 10,000 vices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all return the possibility of being what we are : a kind of aware , that &apos;s going to have to make all people , and all the gift can fix .
I wrote this picture on the north of Baffin the island of Baffin , when I went to whales , and this man , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya story of his grandmother .
The government government didn &apos;t always have been gentile with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s for stakes , we have them to have them to premix them , we &apos;ve got to do it .
The grandmother &apos;s not the grandmother &apos;s refuted to go .
The family , I &apos;m going to throw them out , and all his toward , and all his actual actual actual .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t have the cold ,
The skin origin origin origin origin in origin , which was made of fish fying in the skin there .
The grandmother &apos;s not a man had not intimimidance or the blilightica or from the blilightica ,
It &apos;s a gacked on , you know , it &apos;s hot the pantalons in the pantalons of focused and defeced in their hand . When I did it was conzable to .
He has seventually salive on the dogs of this cat and when it became solid , he killed a dog .
He has a bridaughter , and created a bridaughter , with the toward , he created a slta , he has made a slta , he has been sat on the bank , the bank , the chisa , and he created a bunch .
Let &apos;s talk about the horse with nothing ? &#91; &#91; Ris&#93; And this , in different ways , &#91; Applauses &#93; is the symbols of the people of the people of the world .
In fact , in 1999 , the government government reduced to Inuit &apos;s control of the most great land of the greater than California and Texas , the Texas a Texas ,
It &apos;s their new pathria . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a independent territory . Controllate all the mineries .
One splendise example of how a natione-state could rerererererererererererererecience with his people .
And , to finish , I think it &apos;s rather obvious to think about the world , I realized that they &apos;re not remote .
For someone &apos;s home .
They representing seasasing the human imagination that they save the alba . And for us all of these children , as our children , as our children , are become part of the nuda .
To end , we have National Geographic , we convinced that politicians will never be anything .
We believe that polements --
&#91; &#91; Applausers &#93; not lost , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the best institution to tell stories about the world . Every month our site . Every month , we have 35 million visits .
156 countries transmit , we can make our television .
Our resolds are layers from millions .
Our work is travel in the etnosion to bring our audience in the wonderful places that they &apos;ll go away from what they will go away from what they &apos;re going to get out of how they saw and , hopefully , the world &apos;s going to be in the exist of exist : the world mermerable to be in diversity , and we need to find a life in a world of life , and we need to find a life in a world of life in a world , and we need to find a life in a world of life in a place ,
where the saggees can contributing our well-being collective .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things I wrote in this book I hope to do you have heard and put some of the things that you &apos;ve heard and find out of the hits , not notice .
I want to start with what I call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Did &quot; &quot;
The dogma official ?
The dogma official society &apos;s the West &apos;s dogma official society , the recite dogma official , &quot; &quot; If we want to mate our aders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The way to do it is to do it is a freedom . &quot;
The reason is , from one side , in fact that freedom is in the fact that freedom , it &apos;s predicted , usually , usually for human beings .
And then , if we are free , each of us can act for us , each of us can act to do everything that masses our well-being , without no one that decide to have no one that we have to say .
The way to massive freedom is a freedom to be massive .
More choices , they &apos;re more libing , and more is their freedom , the freedom , is their well-being .
This , I &apos;m going to go , it &apos;s so much roads in society that nobody would dream to put it in doubbt .
And it &apos;s also deeply roadicated in our lives .
I &apos;ll show you some examples of what progress is to be possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly great .
I lost a simple note about the people who &apos;s minds for injumping .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without contact 10 variety of olium extrain , and the 12 acets of whales , you can buy a huge number of people who can buy a huge amount of conducted in the circle that nobody of 175 ready is of your degrees .
So , here &apos;s the supermarket .
And then you go to the store of electronics to buy a stereoth : heck , radio , plification , radio , bits .
And in this single store store , there &apos;s a big number of audiences .
We can make six million different combinations using the components that there are in a only store .
You have to put it there &apos;s a lot of choice .
Other camps : the world of communications .
And once I was a child , they could get all the telephone services , at the mothers , at the mothers who were supposed to mom , and it was a mooth .
You had nurant the phone , they didn &apos;t buy it .
One of that , one was that , in the other , was that the phone never made .
These times they went .
We have a variety almost limited than the phones , especially between phones .
Here &apos;s the phones of the future .
My favorite is in a middle , MP3 , cutting up , cut the nose , and forline for the chchchchcheck .
If you don &apos;t have seen in the store on the house , you &apos;re very much certain certain you will get .
And what happens is that people get in the negotives and doing this question , and it does this question , &quot; You know , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not to buy a phones that doesn &apos;t make a troppe .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the acquisists , you know , it &apos;s the same as you can choose .
It &apos;s a blood : not going to happen in the United States that you &apos;re going to win from the doctor and the doctor you know what you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do a , or B , &quot; A , or B , &quot; A has these benefits and these risks . &quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
Tu Dr. Dr. r. r. r. r. r. r. &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A has these benefits , and these risks , and they have these benefits . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebits : &quot; Dr. if she was me , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor : &quot; But I &apos;m not . &quot;
The result we call it &quot; authonomy , &quot; expression that it looks like a beautiful thing .
But in fact , it &apos;s not a fish and the responsibility of taking decisions from someone who knows something , and so it &apos;s the doctor , to someone who knows , and it &apos;s not anything -- and it &apos;s almost certainly certainly , and so , in the ided condition to make it decisions that it &apos;s true .
There &apos;s a huge marketing of products drugs , direct to people like me and you , if you think , you can &apos;t have any sense , because we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why they admit ?
The answer is that they want to ask the doctor to ask the doctor to ask us to ask the require .
And so , a lot of the identity , is our identity ever is a choice , as you see in this living , &quot; we don &apos;t want to forced the children .
And we can reinventing how many times we aggrade us .
The one means that every morning , to save , you , you have to decide that kind of person want to be .
I &apos;m going to family and the matrimoniio , a time the perspective , sounds almost for anyone , was that there was a lot of time , and it was going to be able , and they started to get the most preserved .
The only one choice was with who , not when , and not when it &apos;s doing after .
So , it &apos;s really really to play .
I &apos;m going to talk very smart , and I &apos;m going to get 20 percent in a lot of time .
And not because they &apos;re not because they &apos;re not because they &apos;re not because they &apos;re less diligent .
but why are I imposed to ask , &quot; I would ask you , &quot; I would have to be ? &quot;
&quot; Should I get to sposite me ? I think before ? I think about the children or career ? &quot;
They &apos;re interrogative .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this implica doesn &apos;t complete the companies that assemble and get a beautiful voice .
And they really have to do it .
Now , the job : We &apos;re lucky , as Carl underneath , because the technology allows us to work , every minute , every day , from every day , from Hotel Randolandolen .
I &apos;m talking about , there &apos;s a coroline , and I won &apos;t tell nobody who , where the Within the Si works .
I don &apos;t tell you , why I want to use .
What does , this incredible freedom of choice that we have to continually decide , to continually , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our child play , with the mobile mobile mobile , the Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the notebook .
And even if they &apos;re all spending , every minute we see that we see our child roving , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; I said , &quot; I &apos;m going to answer ? &quot;
&quot; I want to answer this email ? I would have to abboy this letter ? &quot;
And then , when the answer is no , &quot; no , &quot; all this makes the experience of your child very different conditions .
So , anywhere we look at , small things and great things , life is a lot of choices .
And once the world was this : You know , there were some possibly , but it wasn &apos;t a choice of choice .
The world today is a dilemma : The dilemma is , &quot; Is it a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Sather is .
The positive layers , we all know , so I &apos;ll talk about the negative .
All this choice is two negotiative of people .
The first , paradooxally , it &apos;s produced .
And so , you know , it &apos;s very hard to do it .
I &apos;ll give you a significant example : a study of the fairs of flying fying .
A lot of my connection to the Vangift data , the gigantic society of pension , with about a million customers in 2,000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offerte , the percentage of adhesion the two percent .
With 50 source source offer-source source source of adhesions than the available adhesions when they &apos;re available only five . Why ?
Because with 50 source of which choose , it &apos;s bad hard to decide , and the choice is reported to the intimate injected .
And in the tomorrow , and I &apos;m more tomorrow , and of course , I &apos;m going to ask .
You know , you know , it doesn &apos;t just mean that these old people will will get food because they don &apos;t have enough money , to say that the decision is so dogical that they lose a lot of complain that they lose the dator &apos;s work .
Not going to participating , they &apos;re going to five dollars for a year from the dator dator , which would be very disposes .
So the paralalysis a consequence of having choose .
And I think it &apos;s the world .
&quot; And to end , for the eternity : ketchup , send or maionese ? &quot;
Would you want to take the right decision , if it &apos;s for the eternity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and yet the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that , even if we can avoid the paralysis , we &apos;re less sweak by how we were less options of how we would be with less options .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many of the people who choose , if you can buy a , and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have better . And what the thing is that the alternative imagined us to maricage , and the pyle is that the alternative results to the soft , and the remarkable to the depth , and the fricated the dealing , and the fricated depation ,
even when it was a great decision .
More choices , there &apos;s more easy to displeased than any detail , which is undresh of the option .
And so , there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has clearly well as the value that we do things depends from what we do is to do with .
So , the rest , when there are many options , it &apos;s easy to representing the alternative characteristics of alternative shooting and be less to be unless to be able to be .
So , here &apos;s a example . I &apos;m not in New York .
But that &apos;s probably what you would probably think .
There &apos;s this copy to Hamptons .
A place of luser .
Spiach . It &apos;s all the day . Otma day . It &apos;s all for them .
It doesn &apos;t missing anything . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , they &apos;re a bunch . &quot;
&quot; Everybody in Manhattan are on . &quot;
&quot; I could parking out of the home . &quot;
And it &apos;s going to be a couple of weeks from the idea that &apos;s lost -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The costo-opportunity diminures the soddisfation for what we have , even when the choice was ecphoses .
And the more options we have to think , more the actual characteristics , you &apos;ll get to reach , as a cos-opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
It &apos;s about living the moment , and maybe of the living living .
But the most important point is that anything you choose , you can &apos;t get the other .
And the things that we don &apos;t choose so much attractive what we do .
Third point : I think it &apos;s growing .
I tried to my skin bought a new jeans .
I &apos;m almost always always jeans .
And you know , the jeans were just a kind of guy , they bought and wasting them , they were scomowestables , they were just to get them to go right .
So , I went to buy a couple of new when those old were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
The committed me , &quot; Li want to a slim , fit , relaxed , relaxed ? &quot;
Would you want to the certain certain nier or with the cles ? &quot;
&quot; Li want to straight ? &quot;
&quot; Seight wants to willion ? Bla bil , &quot; Continule was to elened to elense .
I was salyer , and after a little bit I could say , &quot; I want the kind of , &quot; I want to say , &quot; I want to have no idea what , so for a guy , I was going to get out of the uncle , and then I came out of the uncle , and I had the best couple of jeans I had .
It was the very very . I got the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse , the worst of my expectancy were althime , jeans had to be perfect .
I was all the beginning I had no excited . I didn &apos;t expectively , when it was a kind of , but when you saw 100 different , stead , but when you saw 100 different , at least a kind of thing .
What I had to buy was good , but not perfect .
After I talked to that chose with what I was trying to be inssation-up .
The adadded options in the people can &apos;t increase the expectations that have to excellence of the options .
And this will make less sweather , even when the results are good .
No one in the world of marketing if you realize .
Because if they knew , they don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more to this .
&quot; It was better when he was worst , &quot; The reason it was better when it was worst , when you was worst , when you were worst , you could have been able to meet .
So , in the world we live in -- opultimate , industrialized aders with the wait of the perfetion -- the very very we can hope is that we can hope is that things are at the peck .
You never surprised to be , because your waiting for your expectations , I &apos;m ingigantic .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Baswait , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , you want . &quot;
I mean -- small author , I &apos;m really sposed and my wife is really studies .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t have to do ,
But it &apos;s not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of buy a couple of jeans , when there &apos;s just that kind of jeans , when you &apos;re not sweather , and you ask , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot;
The world is the responsible . What could I do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a insoft , and you ask you , you ask , who is the responsible , is the responsible , is so so that the responsible , is so so that the responsible is .
You could do better .
And with hundreds of variety available , there are no exchange .
So , when people take decisions , even if the result is valido , they feel undaughter and they say , they &apos;re going to do .
In the last years , depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only , but important -- of this willing to be , because the standard is that people have been too alite .
And when they have to explain this situation , they think the column is their own .
So the final result is that we &apos;re better , but we feel worse .
Let me reminds you .
This is the dogma official , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely fell . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than I don &apos;t have to have any of choice is better than a little bit .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic . I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s .
But I &apos;m sure we super-up with a piece of level where the choices choices to make our life .
Now , from the political point -- I &apos;ve been finished -- from the political point of view , the noticed is the follow .
What allows all this industrial society is the remarkable .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too paign .
So the facize I &apos;m talking about is a malent than modern society , remarkable society , remarkable society .
And what it does depressure and arrgrade is this : Steve Levitt told you yesterday , how those expensive expensive seats for bimes are . It &apos;s a spread of money .
I mean , these choices , complicated and dispendiose , it &apos;s not just useful .
They &apos;re adoptively deleteries .
They make worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows people to have been reververed in those where people have too few possibilities , it &apos;s not just their life to improve but also .
This is what economists call a better better .
A redistribution of the income is good to all -- not just to poor -- because of this choice in excess that we mend us .
To end , &quot; Flle , you can get everything you want to . &quot;
You , people &apos;s a lot of culture , you think , &quot; What does that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious , you can &apos;t make anything in a glass of glass . &quot;
&quot; A imagination , a limb view of the world --
and I &apos;m interpret , I interpret .
But then , I realized , instead , I realized that that fish knows that the fish knows .
Because the reality of the fact that if you &apos;re lamong frankon , so that , &quot; everything is possible . &quot; You can &apos;t get freedom . You can &apos;t get freedom .
If you take the bocking in a way that everything is possible diminures .
You get the paralysis , and you reduced the well-being .
Everybody need a sphere .
This is almost almost certainly too much stricks , maybe even for fish , and because it &apos;s sure for us .
But the assume of some symbolic sphere is a ret for the inhappiness and , throw .
Thank you .
