So last year I showed these slides to show that the glacial calculated , which for almost three million years has had the size of 48 million years had the size of the 48 continent , it &apos;s restrip .
But this underground , this underground gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice ice of ice .
The artica calculated is , in a certain sense , the heart of climate system .
It &apos;s about invern and summer the summer .
The next next 25 years , it &apos;s going to be a carlated carlying on the last 25 years .
The glaces are reached in red .
And as you see , as you see , they go to the blue .
That &apos;s the invern ice ice , which is a summer ice of summer .
You can see that the costs of the constitude , five years or more , is like , that &apos;s like a blood , which here fighting from the body .
In 25 years , it was so ,
This is a problem because the re-headed warming , where there are huge amount of coal ocean where there are huge amount of coal , where there are huge amount of coal , they &apos;re transformed in meters .
I &apos;m going to the total of the atmospheric inity to global warming , that amount of it could doubling , super-point point point of not around .
In some lahi , a little profound lagues in Alaska metan is already re-ridying from water .
The Katey Walter &apos;s University of Alaska University of Alaska team , a team print that last invern .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You &apos;re good . The question is if we &apos;re going to be it .
And that &apos;s why this exchange termal exchange the Groenland from the north .
This is a river at the glacial .
And he had never achieved that .
This is the Kangerlussuaims , in the southwest of Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level to the sea to the melting of the sea on the ground , here is where the sea .
These currents are increasing rapidly .
On the other side of the planet : Antarctica , the largest block of ice on the planet .
The last month , the scientists have deeply dealing on some submarium , and the West Antarcccccclearing on some subarts , which pogen on some submarine , is particularly relief in the sun .
Equival at six feet of the sea level of the water , like in Groenland .
Suli Himalaya , the third largest block of ice , you see new laws , which a few years ago , they were glaciers .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population was going to be half of the wild water from that .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the power of this city .
The top is increased .
But when he demining it , the same happens to the water .
In California , the snow on the Sierra Nevada is demining of 40 percent .
The hyries are crisis .
The predictions , like you read , they &apos;re grave .
The growing safe in the world leads to a remarkable increasing in the world .
The environmental disaster disaster is increasing a rhythm outside of the normal and without previous .
Four times more than than the last 30 years I was in the last 30 years I was going to be than 75 .
This is a remarkable to the whole insustainable .
If you look in the historic context if they can see the consequences .
For the last five years , we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the point of the area of the Pacific , the Americans , to the West , and both of the subcontinent , where there is a royyal root in the ocean .
The greatest cause of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , it &apos;s the use of fossil fuel .
The oil is a problem , and the coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the most emissions , together to China .
And he was proponded to build a lot of other central centers .
But we &apos;re seeing a change of direction .
These are the annullated projects in the last years and some alternative of the vers .
At any way , there &apos;s a fighting politics in our country .
The industrial oil industrial and oil has spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the fuel , which is a bosymympage .
That picture I was reminded to something --
Verso Natale , in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a loss of 3.8 billion litri wasters .
You may have seen it on news .
This is the second largest fllow of the last flow in America .
It &apos;s succeeded around Natale .
The wild advertising at one of the coal industrial was this .
Video : See , &quot; Frosty the carbon is a kind of allegror happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it &apos;s growing our economy .
Frosty the carbon is increasingly clean .
It &apos;s at the price , adorable and the workers keep the workers are going to keep the fashion .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The largest society is Massey Coal . This is the Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I &apos;m going to be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosyss , Harry Reid -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore , so the Alleance for the Clima &apos;s Protection &apos;s Protection .
This is one of them , a part .
Video : Attore : At the the West we see climate change as a snake at at the top of our business .
So , this is to invest a big amount of money in a very high forget in a public effort to make public and confused the truth on the coal .
In reality , the coal is not spork .
We think it &apos;s clean -- it &apos;s also a good profumo .
So , you don &apos;t preocuption of climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Caside : Carbone clean -- you &apos;ve heard about it very much .
So , let &apos;s go around a turn in a structure at the avanguard of how it &apos;s about puzzle .
Straordinarily ! The machines are a little noise , but this is the sound of the puzzle technology .
The coal consumer is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology that you see changes .
You look at a look at this : this is the pulit technology .
Al Gore : So , the positive alternative , you can reliief to the economic security .
Video : Instead : America is in the crisis , the national security , climate crisis .
The filter that the link that the connection of our dependence from fossil fuel fuel , like the spork and oil imported .
Now , though , there &apos;s a new , audacy for using cirne .
Real America : 100 percent clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to reach America , to make us more safe , and help stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that drought to solve our problems .
Real America . You get more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Complates : It &apos;s reating energy to America .
One of the faster ways of getting to the dependence from the fuel fuel that killing our planet .
Comparsa : The future is here . I feel , sun , a new network .
Comparsa : two : New 2 : New Design investment .
Complplease , America . It &apos;s time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old African proverbio says , &quot; If you want to go speed , go from solers .
If you want to go away , you go together . &quot;
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I did a reduction on the LHC .
And I promise to return you to get back to you on how the car works .
So I started here . And for the other time , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever attempted -- 27 miles of circonference .
Her task is to rear the conditions that were at least at least one billion by the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
It &apos;s just ambitious .
This is the car under Ginevra .
We did , we go to the rates these mini-Big Bang in the rilevers .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLATLAS -- it &apos;s a foot of 22 meters .
This is a show of ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLAS in building so you can see the proportions .
The 10 September 10 year we have paid the car for the first time .
And this was taken by ATLATLAS .
It was because of immense festhate in control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first fascivil in the LHC , coming in collision , deliberately , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles in the LHC , and spread in the relever .
In other words , when we saw that image the 10 industry , we know that the car worked , which was a great vitty .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to show us more or this , when somebody went on Google and saw that the page age was this .
That means we have a cultural impact beyond that scientific impact on the scientific .
About a week later , there was a problem with the car , had to do this , and the dored dored .
These filters they take 13,000 ampampes when the car works at the most power .
Now , the technicians between you will look at the filters and say , &quot; I &apos;m not true . I &apos;m willing . &quot;
And instead can do that because when they &apos;re very cold became the deaths .
So , at least 271 degrees , at a lower temperature in the stars , these files can bring that current .
In one of the most of the new magnetic magnetic , the MMMMMMMMMan , there was a defect of factoration .
So the films that surround up , and the 13,000 ampampampere suddenly met an electrical resilience .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think that these magnees are more than 20 tons , and they moved about 30 centimeter .
They &apos;re damaged about 50 magnetic magnetic .
We had to take them , what we did .
We repristine them and woulder .
Now they &apos;re going back to their underground .
I end up the LHC will be again .
We will go to it , and we expect to get the data or the right data , and continuing so our adventure to find out what the morning are the morning that we &apos;re constitute the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents reach the debate about the value of the science and engineering frontier . It &apos;s easy to contain .
I think that &apos;s what it &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s the value of the things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey , which , I guess , in the defense of inutilize , and his fenenenened , his clean was Michael Faday , he said , &quot; No , dangerous , and it said , &quot; No , dangerous is definitely dangerous for human mind as , that our science is definely , not there are no mysteries in nature , which we don &apos;t have to be able . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start asking you for rethink about when you , you play with children , you play with the morning .
And as you could get them to and get them , and to get them and move them , and you learn them , and to think and to do problems and by doing space and by by doing space and by the space relations .
The spacal reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , by the useful inspired by using physical objects , with physical objects , together to my Patatatch , and the collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking me , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of having the only a computer , instead of having the only mouse as a digital , we could have have to deal with a desktop , we could have to deal with with , we could have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to feel that it ,
and systemate it to our pleasure ?
And the question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , we building the Sifaim .
In a few words , a Siftable , a great interactive computer like a biscanned .
In a few words , a Siftable , a great interactive computer like a biscanned .
You can move with your hand , they can see it , &quot; they can see the movement and they have a screen and a wireless radio .
But mostly , they &apos;re physicists , like the morning , you can move it just as a deal .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of instruments to manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physicists , awarem , awars of the movement , and as they become more physicists , awars of the movement , of the other , how we can we can explore new and fun of interaction .
I &apos;m going to try with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show video : if you start it in a direction , the video will ropt it so , if you get out of the other hand back .
These remarkable remarkable remarkable .
If I affianm them , they &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re going to be .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can act a little bit .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can act a little bit .
They also had their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the way to use of the facts , for example , &quot; an example , &quot; for example , &quot; an example , &quot; a liquid , &quot; a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configured like you to see it , and I can use them to the shoulder , where they miss .
and I can use them to use it to the central color , where they miss .
If we &apos;re too , we can put it a little bit .
And it &apos;s also beautiful possibilities of learning , like the languages , the mathematics and games of logic , where people can try things , and see the results .
Now I &apos;m --
This is a Fibonacks that I do with a equations program .
So we have a game of words that is in half between Scarabeet and Boggle .
Basically , at every Sifty , at every Sifty , at every Sifty , at every Sifty , at every Siftable , and as you &apos;re trying to start to do it .
And then , after about 30 seconds remiss , and you have a new set of letters and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
And here &apos;s the children came in in the Media Lab , I did it and I turned them a video .
They were very iated .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
You just say , &quot; I mean , &quot; I &apos;m words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s other people trying it .
This is our Tibeta pester , there on the right .
It actually wanted to be embedded .
They were just morning , for him .
Now , this is an interactive cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of the languages . He &apos;s Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , solevating the Sifaim them .
It can put new characters in the scene , solevating the Sifaim them .
So , it &apos;s going to get the sun .
Video : The sun is surprising .
David Merrill : Now he took a treatment in the scene .
Video : The arancium treatment .
Bobs !
So , shake the Siftable and put it closes can make the characters --
Video : Well ,
-- by inventing their story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a very open story , and it can decide him as it is .
DM : It &apos;s a very open story , and it can decide him as it is .
Video : The way ,
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , I realized that , to sample and to do music .
It &apos;s a tool , which is a tool , to sample and to do music .
The Siftable here are act sounds like the bottom and the bacteria .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also put these sounds in a sequence to comcompose on your pleasure .
And it just to touch it just touch a sound and a sequence .
These are actually you can control from the vivious , like the rivers and the filter .
The acks to a particular sound and then incline to fix it .
And then there are general effects as time and volume , that you &apos;re applied to the whole sequence .
We look at how it works .
Video : DM : We will start putting a base in two Sifairy &quot; , &quot; we try it , we adadded it in a series , we go to advers .
Now I &apos;m going to put a line .
Video : DM : Now I added some of percussions
Video : DM : And I &apos;m going to put the glass on the bacteria , so I can control the vivive .
Video : DM : I can reach the entire sequence of inclining the time from one side or the other .
Video : DM : And now I &apos;m going to adding the bottom to give more expression .
Video : DM : I can get the sequence &quot; to the flying &quot; the flying . &quot;
So I didn &apos;t have to plan it before , but I can suddenly , make it more than the corta .
And now , finally , I can smoking the whole sequence of inclining on the left the Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new human faces and more resements as it work as our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this path , and some possibilities that we try to bring out from the lab .
And the concept I want to transmit is that we &apos;re going to take this new generation of objects to interact with digital media , which will lead to the world information .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the moment of talking to you .
I &apos;m a writer .
I &apos;m going to be a profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the love of my life .
And I don &apos;t look like it .
But , I said this , something particular , it was successful in my life and my career , which led me to report the entire relationship with this work .
And the particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called &quot; Mangia , Prega , &quot; which , diversously , from my previous books , for some reason came out in the world and became a great senational , sending , a great sending , a great sending , interational , to the point of the world .
And the result is that everywhere now , people are getting me like I was conducted .
I mean , I &apos;m going to do it .
They are all been worried about me and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t have feed to do ?
You don &apos;t really fear to write all life without being able to create a book that can matter ? &quot;
what can you care about somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s resurring , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a sheep .
I went to the same reaction with the same reaction .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you know , &quot; Don &apos;t we succeeded ?
You don &apos;t fear that the ulililiant refidred ?
You don &apos;t fear to do this to mesh all the life without life that nothing is ever outside and dying on a cumb cumb , with the mouth of failing ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is : &quot; Yeah . &quot;
Yeah , I &apos;m afraid of all of those things .
I always had a little bit of it .
And I also have a lot of other things that people could not inform .
And as the allows the other thing , it &apos;s like the allows .
But , as I &apos;m going to write what I thought , and I would ask me is why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logic that anybody would expect to expect to be frightened by a work that you &apos;ve been sent to do .
But what &apos;s that particular in the creative entrepreneurious , and what &apos;s nervous about the mental health as as other careers don &apos;t they ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemist and I don &apos;t remember one once in his 40 years of activity in which he was asked if he was , he was asked if he was engineered ?
It was never -- that block of John John , how do it ?
It wasn &apos;t going to work so , you know ?
Onestly , chemicals are not certainly in the centuries , the reputation of being alcolized .
We have a writers , we have enough this reputation , and not just creative writers , but creative reputation of all this , we have this reputation of being enormously unununless .
And it &apos;s not about the way to look at the sad of the wild of the creative minds that , only in the 20th century , they die young and often .
And the ones that don &apos;t have suicidated seem to be really disappeared by their dones .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , &quot; Every book has killed me a little bit more &quot; A fashion on to work of its life .
But we don &apos;t datch when we feel that to say because we have heard these things so long that we have completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are somehow how how do we &apos;re related and that art , at the end , it will always confidence to the anges .
And the question I want to bring all over here today is : Who are you agree with this idea ?
It &apos;s really good for you , because it &apos;s also looking at it for a distance to me not that .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous and I don &apos;t want to see it in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our great creative minds .
And I know that , in my case -- in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to fire to the feeling of support support , overeign the circumstances in my career .
That &apos;s true -- I mean , I &apos;m very young , I &apos;m very young , I &apos;m very young .
I still have about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything I &apos;m going to write about the world as the work that he came out after the world , as I was in the world , as I was in my last book .
I &apos;m going to be a little bit of , because we &apos;re all the more or less friends here -- it &apos;s likely that my greatest succeeded .
Oh , Gesus , that thought .
You know this is the kind of thought that it takes a person to start dying in the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would keep going to keep doing this work that we love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it seems , after a lot of reflective , which the way to work to write is to create a protective psychological construct , right ?
I have to find a little bit of the safety distance between me , I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxy on what I wrote to it to it . And as I was trying to look at the time , trying to find other societies to see if they could have better better than sane , and I &apos;m trying to find other societies to see if they could have better , and look at if they could have better , and I &apos;m trying to find some other societies
about how to help people to manage the risks of the emotions of creativity .
And that research me to the ancient Great and ancient Rome .
I &apos;m doing it because I come back in circle and then back .
Nelil ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
It was thinking that creativity was this spirit looks like this spirit looks like , and that came to a few men from a few distant and unknown for distant and unknown for distant and unknown .
The great-called these spirits divini bees of creativity .
Socrate , wonderful , he believed to have a demon a wisdom from far .
Romans were the same idea , but they called that kind of spirit without a genius .
And the one that is great , because the Romani didn &apos;t think a genius was somebody particularly intelligent .
They thought that a genius was this kind of divine that was living in the walls of a neighborhood , a little bit like the artist , a little bit like the exhidden . And that came out to be hidden the work of the artist , and to model the result of that work .
Here &apos;s eye--- here , that &apos;s the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological construct that you protect the results of your work .
And everybody knew it was so that it was going to work , right ?
So the antic artists were protected by certain things , as a way too narcisism , not ?
If your work was exceptional work , you couldn &apos;t take it all the mermerished , everybody knew that you were helped by this genius .
If your job failed , it was not all your hit , right ?
Everybody knew that was the genius to be a incapable .
And so the people who had to concept creativity in Western for a long time .
And then the Rended came and all of it changed , and they came up with this great idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe above all of the and the mysteries and without longer to leave the creatures and desk in the divinity .
This was the principle of the rational principle and people started thinking that creativity came out of the idividust .
And for the first time in history , you start this to referred out of this or that artist as a genius that to a person with the genius .
And I have to say , I think it was a big mistake .
I think that allowed somebody , a simple person to believe that they &apos;re like a recient recient , the essence and the sister of all the mysteries , creative , unknown and unseen and ethernal , and unfillness and a very big responsibility for a very big pair that human fragile .
It &apos;s like to ask somebody to enjoy the sun .
It &apos;s deapart and detains all these pricing ingeseshidden and make all these expectations on the performance .
And I think it was this pressure to destroy the artists in passed 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think it &apos;s , the question is , and now ?
We can do it diversously ?
And it &apos;s a more ancient understanding of the most ancient human relationship and mystery .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can &apos;t get 500 years of thought , in a 18 minutes .
And it &apos;s probably people in the audience who would only have to read it , you know , you do , you do , you do , do that they follow people , do they do , they do that they follow on their projects .
It &apos;s probably not going to convince you all about this .
But the question I &apos;d like to bring is -- why not ?
Why don &apos;t you think about this way ?
Because it has more sense of anything else that has ever heard to explain the exact exact exact exact imprevedibility of the creative process .
A process that , as anyone ever attempted to do something -- so , you don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t understand rationally .
And in fact , it can sometimes look completely paranoral .
I &apos;ve done this very recently with the wonderful poetry of Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but it was a poetry for all life and said that during the Virginia , working in the Virginia , working in the fields , and I felt it , in the fields , and I felt it , in if a poem came from landscape .
She said he was like a frageous tren .
And he was roling to ring her from the landscape .
It was going to feel , because he could could be under its feet under its feet .
He knew he knew to have one thing to do at that point and he was , &quot; to run as a match . &quot;
And so he was going to go to this poem , and it would be done by this poem , and it wouldn &apos;t have to take a piece of paper and a math , and it would take it up it to the page .
At three times I couldn &apos;t be fast , so correal and correcal and correal , and the poem , and he was going to go to house and her poem the roling , and she would continued to roll through the landscape , trying to , how she said , &quot; another poet . &quot;
And then there were those times -- this is not forget -- there was some moments when it was almost losing , right ?
So , he was going to run home and he was trying to paper and poem the poem through , and he was going to go , and then he said , he was like he leaking with the other hand and he was going to get to the other hand and the office .
It was going to be in his body and require the poem on his body and transcaught on the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page and intact , and the contrary , from the last word to the first word at the first .
So when I felt it -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly the same as a process .
Not all my creative process -- it &apos;s not a conducucucucucture .
I &apos;m a mud , and my way to work is ; I &apos;m wake up at the same orary every day and I sweep and work and go up and go over the goffer .
But even I , in my aggin the aggin my aggin , I &apos;m landing against that thing , sometimes .
And I guess that a lot of you the han done .
You know , even though the work and ideas came from me from a certain source , I couldn &apos;t be honestly know .
And what is this ?
And how can we relate to it so that we don &apos;t get the head , but rather , what does it remains ?
And as I &apos;m about , the best example of the contemporary example I have is the Tom Waits , which I interviewed different years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life was the incarnation of the same artist , trying to control , to go to the manage of the actual impulses , to help these species of creativity .
But then I invecked , he calculated , and he was driving on a &quot; highway in Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
He was going fast and it was going fast and it was a little framing of a melodia , who comes in his head as inspiation , helusive and hurt , and it wants , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and it doesn &apos;t know how to do it .
It doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a record .
So it starts to feel this kind of old anxiety , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to get up with this song of even ements .
I &apos;m not enough , I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to go to the panic , he stopped .
I &apos;m going to put the whole mental process and made something completely new .
He just looked at the sky and said , &quot; I &apos;m not driving ? &quot;
&quot; Do you look at a song now ?
If you really want to be able to get me to a more hurt , when I can take care of you .
Altrains , you &apos;re going to importance somebody else today .
You can disturbing Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his work process changed after this .
Not the work , the work was still dark as always as well .
But the process , and the fisher-fished , the fishment was reduced when the genius , the genius who came out of him . It was going to get it back to where it was , to do that it was not going back to be a thing interiorized and tormented .
But yes , this peculiar , wonderful , wonderful bizarre , a conversation between Tom and this outside , and this outside and that it was not Tom .
So how that I was going to change a little bit of the way I worked and already saved me once .
This idea , I &apos;ll save me when I was writing &quot; Mangia , &quot; French , &quot; and I fall in a bunch of those disperation that we &apos;re going to go when we &apos;re all working on something and we can start thinking that will be a disaser , that &apos;s going to be the worst book .
Not just bad , the worst book wrote .
And I started thinking about to get this project .
But then I remember Tom that I talked to the air and I tried it .
So I got my face on on the manoscritical and I got my comments to a vacuum angle of the room .
And I said , &quot; I &apos;m high voices , what we know , both know that if this book is not going to be a brilliant , not it ?
Because I &apos;m looking at me at the way I &apos;m putting everything I don &apos;t have , I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to introduce you and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know , I don &apos;t do it .
I &apos;m going to say to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I would like to be recorded that I was here to do my part , &quot; because -- at the end is so , OK -- centuries does in the deserts of the North Africa of people would get rown up for hours of lands , dance and the wild and to the algrba and and and the weline .
And they were always magnifigures because the dancy were professionals and were fantastic .
But every time , a little bit of something happened , and one of these artists became actually transcending .
And I know what I &apos;m talking about what I know , because I know that you &apos;ve seen , a performance .
It was like the time , and the dancing walks through a kind of a portal and she was not doing anything different from the usually , like 1,000 notes before , but it was going to be able .
And suddenly , not just as a human .
But he accounted from the divinity fire .
And when this was going to succeed , the people knew what was , called him .
They had to blow the hands and started to sing , &quot; Allah , &quot; Allah , God , God , God , God , God , God , &quot; God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curious note note -- when the investment of the Spagna , I preserved this , I preserved with them and the ready to change in the centuries , Allah , Allah , Allah , &quot; which you can see in the corrids or flew .
In Spagna , when a artist did something that , and I &apos;m not impossible and , &quot; Allah , the sun , &quot; Allah , I &apos;m going to do , &quot; unclear , &quot; unexpected , &quot; it &apos;s a four-sheer , &quot; Allah , &quot; Allah , &quot; Allah , &quot; Allah , I &apos;m going to be sheep , &quot; Allah , and I &apos;m going to be a magic , &quot; Allah ,
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes after , for the dancer , and I &apos;m looking at the morning , when you wake up and I &apos;m the morning of Martedday and the last God is no longer .
It &apos;s just a very bad datch to the ginocaque , and maybe it &apos;s not going to get out of that althetic .
And maybe nobody will dg the name of God &apos;s God &apos;s still while it , and what &apos;s going to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most painting reciliations to do in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so anges if you can &apos;t believe , advanced , that the most extraordinary aspects of your being being .
But it just credit that you have data in prestired by a source of this team of your life that you have to go to somebody else when you &apos;re finished .
And , you know , if we think of this way .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s certainly like I thought about it for several months in the working book that I will public public , I &apos;ll be paid , dangerous , and I &apos;m going to do this .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel electrized from this is , not going to have fear .
Don &apos;t fill you . It just your work .
Continua to you present-you for your part , any it can be .
If your work is dance , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
If the divine , aburd genius , you know , you know , it &apos;s a little kind of , for a only time , through your effort , then , &quot; Ole ! &quot;
And you can do it , you do the same dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot;
I think I think it &apos;s weak to teach it .
&quot; Ole ! &quot; I mean the same , even only for having human and testables to do a tal tal tal aggine to you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
And as you know , I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what it can mean and the discovery of new genes .
We &apos;re starting a new performing , we started to digitize the biology and now we start by that digital code in a new fase of biology , designing and synthesizing life .
We always try to take a big questions .
What &apos;s life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists , I think they were trying to understand how many of the levels .
We tried different approaches , reducing it to the minimum .
We &apos;re going to digitize from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the analogtic world in the digital world .
Now , we ask : can we regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma , which is the species from the smallest genome that can authoretic genome .
And we tried to reduce that the genome to create a little smaller .
We can eliminate a hundred genes of the genes of the about 500 that are here .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our .
I think , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this can bring to a living cell cell .
So we decided that the only way to design it was synthesize this chromosome that chromosome to get some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of &quot; we can synthesize a chromosome ?
Can we have the chemistry consend these great molecules that we never could do before ?
And , in case , we can make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is simply a piece of chemical material .
The speed we can digitize life is growing at the life is growing at the life is growing .
Our genetic code , instead , and it &apos;s a rather slowly , but it &apos;s improving .
And our most recent results the results on a exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
And the process has required a lot of passes , starting with a bioethics review before .
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that producing little segments , the long DNA , from 30 to 50 letters and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the most mistakes are .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments and correct the mistakes .
And this was our first attempting , to start by digital information about the genome of Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a small virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the framments , made the retion correction , and I got a DNA molecule about 5,000 letter molecule .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material and we put it in the bacteria , the bacteria , the bacteria have started reading this genetic code and producing the viral particles .
The viral particles were then reduced by cells , they &apos;re back and they destroy .
I &apos;ve talked about recent with members of the oil industry , and say that they have certainly understood this model .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build his hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in the big thing .
We wanted to build the entire chromosome .
They are more than 580 midres letter code .
So we thought we could build it in cassette cassette , so that we can change the cassette to understand what the components of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard of a mid-based on every 10 midded .
We found it , resequenced it , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence we &apos;d never be able to do it .
A part of the process is designing long as 50 letters to build smaller sovods with all the other segments of 50 letter to build smaller , working together .
We try to do unic elements here .
You probably have read that we &apos;ve seen that we put the flights .
Think it so : we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters together code about 20 amminds , and there &apos;s a specific letter , and there &apos;s a speciordine of letter .
So we can use the genetic code to write , frass , thoughts .
What we did at the beginning was authograin it .
Some of them have been deluser from the fact that it was not poem .
We designed these segments to get them to just join with enzyme .
There are some of them reparate and put them together .
And we started assembling parts of , starting with the sat five to seven mix to seven mix letters , and to a way to form the segment of 24 mila letters to them to 72 mila letters .
At every step we made these segments in abundance so that we could sequence it because we &apos;re trying to create a very good process , which we &apos;re trying to create a very good process .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems the tabellon a baskabeloff .
When we get these very long segments , more than 100 mix , more than 100 midden , it &apos;s not going to grow in the E.
You get to the modern molecular biology .
So we &apos;ve considered other mechanisms .
We knew another mechanism called the homologist called homologist , which in biology is used to repair the DNA to repair the DNA to bring segment .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinoccurcurred , it can absorb three million rad radiation .
You can see in the upper rise of the way of his destroyed is destroyed .
In 12 , 24 hours it &apos;s reassembled exactly as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely completely .
They can live under empire .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life in space , and it &apos;s going to find new environments of water .
At the real , NASA showed that this is .
This is a molecule image of the we built using these proceed , just using the lieventually design appropriate segment .
The lievere lievated it .
This picture was not taken with a microscope , but with a regular microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It &apos;s a very large molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that they cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the published that we did a little time ago .
They are more than 580,000 letters .
It &apos;s the largest molecule structure ever created by the man .
It has a molecular weight to 300 million .
If we &apos;re going to be a cart with a 10 without spaces , we &apos;d like 142 pages only to transform this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ? How can we activtivities it ?
Of course , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when they &apos;re using bacteria .
It &apos;s easier to do , as it is eucariote as our : you can just get the nuclear and put another , which is basically the cloning process .
In the archaea of the chromosome is instead of integrated inside the cell , but we &apos;ve recently shown that we &apos;re able to do a complete trapiant trapiant from a cell to another and activate it .
We could refed a chromosome from a microbial species .
The two are the ones as the tops .
We added some gene in a little bit more so that we could decide what to choose for this chromosome .
And then it &apos;s skip with the enzymes so that we killing all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was studied -- and you open our sofisted so-fisticato-filled . The new chromosome is gone inside the cell .
And we were thinking that we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to get ourselves over there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that tantisevere species have added a second or a third chromosome somewhere , adding a second thousands of new traits .
So , who thinks about evolution as a gene once you change didn &apos;t understand much of biology .
There are enzyme called &quot; From &quot; restrial &apos; that I can say that DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell , it was in the cell .
The cell phone -- the chromosome we have adverted it .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other chromosome as a material , the masticked , and we found with only the cell and the new chromosome .
It became blue because of the genes we put it .
And in a short time , all the characteristics of a species are going to be lost , and it turned out of the new species , based on the new software we put in the new software that we put in the cell .
All the proteins has changed , and memories are changed , and when we read the genetic code exactly exactly what we transfered you .
Now , this could look like genetic alchemy , but alter the software we can change things in a very subject .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that here is not about genesis -- but progress from three million years and a half years of evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the Cambriana , where we &apos;re going to create new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty obvious when we think about our need .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion and a half billion in the next 40 years .
Right to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for every one in 1946 ; 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find food , fresh water and wellin for six billion and a half billion people .
It &apos;s going to be more to do for nine billion .
We use more than five billion coallizer , more than 30 billion barrels .
That means 100 million barrels a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replace them , it will be a huge challenge .
We need to understand all the CO2 emission from these materials that fines in the atmosphere .
And today , because of the scientific discoveries of all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the design components for the future .
The electronics industry has only only a dozen about components , and you think of how many different things came out .
Our limits here are principle data from the biological reality and the imagination .
Now we have techniques , because of these methods of synthesization , able to create what we call a combinatory genomics .
We can build a big robot that can produce a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think of processing these 20 million of different genes or trying to optimize the processes to produce doctor or drugs , new vaccines , we can change , we can change , we can change , and create more molecular biology that in the last 20 years .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemical production or fuel ,
This is an instantanear of some software programmed that we &apos;re working to be able to sit and design species at the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t necessarily know how they will be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
We &apos;re focusing on the fourth generation .
You also saw that you can see that extract ethanol from the grain was a final experiment .
We have a second one of second and third generation that will use enough to be on the zuccher , as the opposed to the cover , and they &apos;re a different kinds of butanol .
But the only way the biology can have a great impact without increasing the cost of food and limited the cost of food and limarne the energy of the energy of the energy , so we &apos;re working to design cells that can achieve this purpose , and we can get the first coal-fourth of the fourth generation in about 18 months .
The solar light combined with CO2 is a metodowntown is , but in our discoveries all over the world , we have found different metods .
This is a organism that we had described in 1996 .
It &apos;s going to the deep ocean , about 2,500 feet of the deep ocean .
It creates metane by using hydrogen by using molecular hydrogen as energy source .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can incanal CO2 , which can easily be transported by a tubes , to converge that CO2 in coal , to drive this process .
So we might be able to increase what we might be able to increase what life is life is &quot; or we might be able to get the whole oil industry .
Right . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can you ?
It would be a major source of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working to use the same metods to create instantaneeeen vaccines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with flu , we &apos;re always back of a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s about to find the vaccine .
I think that you can change change , and it &apos;s a little combinable vaccines .
So , this is how the future might start to look at it , now , the tree of evolution , accellular bacteria , arches , arches , arches , arches , arches , and finally , and then eual cells .
We &apos;re so so much of improving people .
Our purpose is to do in a way to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the faster , some fundamental work , a new technology that we took the Microsoft in the way to a buy buy buy a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s a environment where you can interact is at the local level that remode with a huge amount of visual data .
So we &apos;re seeing here , a lot of digital photos with a kind of digital , and continuous for a very quickly , and a very quickly , for a very quickly , and we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much the amount of information that we see , how big they &apos;re these collecting data or images .
Most of them are in digital photographs , but this for example is a a from the Biary Library of Congress , and it &apos;s about 300 megapiel .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that limits its presents a system like this is the number of please on your screen . It &apos;s also a very flexel architecture .
This is a book , all of the data , not about images .
This is the Dickens of Dickens . Every colonna represents a chapter .
And to show you that it &apos;s just about textbook and not about images , we can do something like that , to do something like that , to do really do that .
It could be a little artificial way to read a piece of electronic .
I don &apos;t consider it .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s a number of The Guardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you a pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading the real caracy of a review , which is for nature of a half a kind of a half a kind of a half .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of Guardian .
We created a high-resolution addiction -- much higher than that that you use in a normal advertising -- and we put you in the extra .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specifically .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that it means to put people in the end and other door to the people and other similar porcheries , not have to be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this field , I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say we have to give you in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. sovraped the geospatial image of NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually from the webs . You can go to the Web ;
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , who &apos;s a few different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research that we made by Noah Snavely , a student of the University of Washington , with the help of Steve Seadrnow , the help of the Microsoft Research . A great great great collaboration .
And it &apos;s from the websan , I was in the websan .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from a picture to the other and have this kind of experience of multiple experience .
But the spacecation of the images here has actually a meaning .
The algoritms of the computer algorithms have recorded these pictures together , so that they correspond to the re-like the lagues -- all the next to the lagues of the Rocciose damage -- they &apos;re taken . So , you see the elements of a slides of a slides of a de-stable or or by by a sheep , and these things are all been all connected to space .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot of the more spaces .
I want to spend directly to one of the Noah-hahead -- and this is from a previous prototynthrooms that we have done to work for the first time , the summer -- to show you what I think is the key behind behind this technology , the Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily evident to look at the environments that we put in the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of Nobody Dame images made by Flickr . Bae Nothing three images from Flickr . And you get some kind of re-like , and you get images of these aries in the shirt , and he &apos;s got a picture that &apos;s discovered to be a picture that &apos;s discovery to do this .
So they &apos;re all pictures made from Flickr and they were all spacal to this way .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this very simple .
You know , I never would have thought of fining working for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifying to get this kind of access .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of phones , from the cell cell cell phone , and the significant number of the SLR , a significant number , put together in this environment .
And if I can try and try and try and look at those more strange .
And a lot of faces are in the same .
Somewhere you have a series of photographs -- it &apos;s a series of photographs -- it &apos;s a series of photographs -- it &apos;s a series of photographs --
This is a poster of Nobody Dame .
We can go from the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with the social environment . This is taking data from the entire collective memory of how to appear the earth , from the visual point of view -- and connects all of that data together .
All those pictures became connected together , more than the sum of the parts .
You have a model of the entire land that emerge .
Think about this as the prolungment of Stephen Lawler :
It &apos;s something that you grow in complex complex as as they are using it , and the advantages for the people who use it .
Their photo fits from other people .
If you can have a idea of contrast all these sets , and I can use the name , my picture of Nobody &apos;s cattedge three suddenly , he &apos;s got to be arrical , and I can use it as a re-ingress , using the picture of anybody else , and have a social experience of like , and have a social experience of a cross-moon and cross-used and cross-used social experience of the kind of a fas-like cross-like ,
Of course , a consequence of all that are virtual models of the extremely elaborate , and so that you can &apos;t just see airairplane and satellite images and similar , but from the collective memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I have understood ? What your software will you feel to do is that at a certain point , in the next years , all the photographs of the world will be connected ?
BAA : Yeah . What is doing is basically to find .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , in the images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the images .
And it becomes very interesting if you think of the required information that many of these images have .
As you do a research of images on the Web , you know , you know , a frase and the headline on the Web page of the pictures .
Now , what if that picture is connected to all your pictures ?
So the amount of seant interconnection and the amount of wealth that would go is really huge . It &apos;s a classic network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really amazing .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the pleasure of the wild , when you travel and one of the ethnograiny is the way to live in the wind , and the people who are going to have the old , you touch it in the wind , the hits , you touch it in the wind , the faiths , you get the filling in the wild of the plants .
And the way to think that the sciamani Jaguar travel , and the idea that the Lattea , or the Inuit &apos;s still colories of significant , or Himalaya , which in Himalaya , and the budgets , and the sense of the subject of anthropology , and the idea that the world we live in a sense of the anthropology , and the idea that the world we live in a sense of reality , but it &apos;s actually , it &apos;s a reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of adaptive set that our stirpful has done , well or bad , a lot of generations ago .
And of course , we all share the essential strains .
We all come . We all procream .
We are subject to the rist of the initiation .
We have to face the death of , so we don &apos;t surprising us to dg and we &apos;re not surprising .
We all have an art .
What it &apos;s the rhythm of the song , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that they &apos;re the forests of the Borneo , or the following Voodoo or Haiti , or the Sahara Kaithsis in Kenya , Kenya , the Curander , or a Churandery , or a cammelt in the heart of Sahara .
He was my company , he was the journey in the desert a month ago , or a yak in Qomolangma , Everest , the dea mother of the world .
All of these populations teachers are teaching us that there are other ways of moving in the world .
And if you reflect a moment , it &apos;s a concept that it can give you hope .
Insieme , the miriades of cultures in the world create a spiritual life and cultural life that has been going on the planet and it &apos;s important for the planet , so the well-being like biosphere .
And you can think of this cultural race as a ethnosphere and it can defined the ethnosphere , the total sum of all the concepts , dreams , with ideas , inspired , a inspirations , and inspirations , and inspiration , and inspiring , from the human algras .
The ethnosphere is the great patrimonium of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we &apos;re and what we can be as as a kind of inquisitive .
And because the biosphere was very , very , as a very successful , as a very quickly as well as well .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all the species is or is on the east , because it &apos;s filled , or -- in the most apocaly -- in the most apocaly -- in the field of biological diversity -- and not even get closer to the most mystic diversity -- that &apos;s the cultural diversity .
The language of all that is , of course , the language loss .
When you &apos;re born . And when you &apos;re born .
A language is not compost by a vocabulary or a series of rules .
A language is the spraking of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle of the way of every culture comes in the material .
Every language is a forest , a fighting , a thought , a thought , a spiritual of spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re sitting here in Monterey , at least half not being subsurrated in the ears of the children .
They don &apos;t teach the children , the which means , the that means , not the cames that &apos;s already dead .
What is more trister than the silence , the way of being the last to talk a language , not having to transmit the wisdom of the wisdom of the wisdom of the children or anticipating the promise of the children ?
This is a fated one of somebody in a few weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks , every two weeks , every two weeks , and it &apos;s a ancient language .
And I know somebody who will say , &quot; Is it not that ?
The world wouldn &apos;t it be a better place if we were to let all the same language ? &quot; Benisically , then we talk about it .
We talk about kogi .
You &apos;ll find a sudden what it means you can &apos;t talk about your language .
I &apos;d like to show you a journey through the etnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a assage of what we &apos;re losing .
And many of us forget that when I say &quot; different ways of existing . &quot; I mean , very different ways of existing .
We take for example this bimmbo Barasana , in Amazon the Amazon , the people of the anaconda , who crees to the mix of the test in the snake of the West in the snake of the pocket of the wild .
It &apos;s a people that &apos;s not able to distinguish the blue color from the green green because the celests is identified in the forest , where you depend the people .
They have a strange language and a matriage rule , dear &quot; exogam language &quot; : &quot; Am &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Am &quot; : you have to get a different language .
It all of that has roots in the mitological past , though the particularly , in these families and the summarian that &apos;s in these families , because of the marriage of midst .
They &apos;re limited to listening and then they start to talk .
We take one of the most interesting tribe with the most interesting tribe with the Waorani of Ecuador Ecuador , a incredible popular people who had the first contact in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionaries have been attempted a made .
They took them out of the top photographs that they would reduce them to the sheep , forget that this people in the pluvial forest that this people had never seen anything about bi-dimensional .
They collected the picture from the earth , they &apos;ve been made the research of a form or a figure and , not by find nothing , they had to be killed that the diavoil , and they killed the five missionaries .
But the Waorani doesn &apos;t kill the foreign &apos;t killed the foreign .
They killed between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by them .
We were saving eight generations and we found two natural death , and we found two natural death , and when we &apos;ve insisted that one of them was invecked , and then they killed it .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine for 40 pass and recognize the species .
In the early &apos; 80 , I was assigned a very interesting job when my Harvard professor , I was asked if I wanted to go to Haiti in Haiti , I wanted to go to Haiti in the basic basic power of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes , and I &apos;m going to get the woms of being being being a little bit of the poison .
To give a sense of the miraculous , I would have to understand the Voodoo culture , and the Voodoo is not magic .
It &apos;s pretty a complex metaphor of the world .
A very interesting .
If I ask you to tell me about the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianity , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Saaharan Africa has no religious fault . And instead , and the Voodoo is not else that the distilled to these religious religious concepts .
What &apos;s interesting is the voodoo is the intense relationship between life and death .
So , the vivividden are beat .
The spirits can be invocated by the Great Acqua , they respond to the dance of the dance of the dance of the vivious way that for a short active active active active , the following becomes the god .
So , this is the woodooists say , &quot; You &apos;re white who are going to talk about God .
We say , we say , &quot; God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re post , is the spirit that you , how can you do it ?
So it &apos;s seeing these incredible events : following voodoo voodoo , and that touch impunes a very strong demonstration of the body when it &apos;s catalyzed in a very strong extremely powerful power of the body when it &apos;s catalyzed in a extremely excited .
And in all the people that I &apos;ve lived the most extraordinary is Kogi Kogi Santa Marta , in the CCs , in the entrepreneurs .
And they would be a tirange of the tyraneity that once lived on the charge of the PPPPPPPPPPsychch , the people would retreat on the volcanic , that you could get on the charge of the charge of aid .
In a macaries of a blood , this people was never conquant to this people .
I &apos;m not a clero , but their formation is so extraordinary .
The young people follow from the families to three or four , and they live secret in a world of good and shadow in a world of good , and shadow for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years , they picked up to reproduce the nine months of gestation that translate in the mom of mother , now are metaphor in the Grande Mather .
For all this time , they &apos;re accululated to their society , values that previous that they prefers and just their prayers and they &apos;re layers to keep the cosmic balance -- or to say the cosmic balance .
And the term of this incredible initiation , they suddenly took out and for the first time in life , at the age of 18 , they see an algrade . And that &apos;s what &apos;s first of the first bull , when the sun kets the fell of the beautiful arms , all that have learned in theory is all of his splendor . The prevent does a step back and says : : : &quot; I think it &apos;s prevent it makes a step back and says :
&quot; Would I say , &quot; I said ,
It &apos;s amazing . Now it &apos;s now to you protect it . &quot;
They call it the majority of the minds and they say that we , are the cold of the destruction of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the Indigene and the environment we call Rousseau and the old history of the selwilling , which is a concept of a race in its simplicity , or maybe invoding Thoreau and say that these people are closer to the Earth of us .
The Indies are not not unknown as the nor unindebate .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the Asmat Asmat or in the Asmat the Tibet , but because of the time and the rituals , they created a mystic mystic of the Earth is not about consciously , but by a long time , but on a very good intuition of human consciousness .
What does it mean ?
It means that a kid of the Ande who will grow up with that the mountain is an Apu spirit will drive his desire will be a deep different human and it will have a very different relationship and it will have a lot of different , and it will have a lot of rocks , or that &apos;s a massive rock is a filled rocks is a massive rock of rocks are ready .
That &apos;s the dimone-mineral or a mineral is irrilever .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that define the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia Britannics , creating the forests that they were going to be cut .
And that &apos;s a human being different from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the dimora of Hukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukuk-living in the Hamsa .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of them feeling .
I took this picture to aprile in the nordeating Amazon the Western Amazon the nordem Amazon the nurturning Amazon the nurture Amazon the nordem Amazon the Western Amazon the Western Amazon the Western Amazon the nurse Amazon the Western Amazony .
Maybe some of you have heard about the ayahuask , the most powerful psychoactive , the most powerful psychoactive ,
And what it makes the elaboration . It &apos;s not the drug of substance , but the elaboration . It &apos;s what it &apos;s made .
On one side , this lighting lighting lighting a series of Ti-Dogen , hardmoline , and harddogen , slightly hallucinogen .
And by trying to the only plant plan , which alter a little bit that alter , but it &apos;s mixed with the coffee , but it &apos;s mixed with the caffection of the coffee Psychoptry is called Psychchcheck .
This plant has to triptamine , very similar to the serotonine , dimethyllyptamine , methyptamine .
If you ever see the Yanomami pull up to the birthday that &apos;s basically doing from a different kind of a different set of species , it &apos;s a methyptamine .
Tiring that dust on the nose is a little bit like being gone from a career foot and land on a bark of the wild , and land on a sea of electricity . &#91; Risate &#93; &#91; &#91; &#91; &#91; Risch &#93; not believe a distortion of reality .
I got often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who wrote the &quot; psichedelic was psichedelic , with his discovery of the hallucinogens in Mexico .
I mean , I &apos;m going to be a bunch these triptamine as alucinogen because if you &apos;re made not telling anybody to be hallucined .
It &apos;s possible to above the east , if you take other chemicals that would be the MAO .
It &apos;s the beautiful : the Ti-coal , that &apos;s the Soubers , the same kind of need to potential the triptamine . The question is that you can be able to potential the triptamine . The question is spontaneous , 80,000 species of plants , like these people are going to find two morpherically not like that , but that if you combined in this way , but that if you put in this kind of a biochemical version that &apos;s going to be a little bit ?
We use the great eufemale of the evidence , and the mistake , which can be infruted .
But if we ask Indians , they &apos;ll say , &quot; The plants talk about &quot;
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuask , who distinguish in the forest , and that the eyes would come in in the same species .
If we ask them how they stake their tassonomy will say , &quot; I thought I understand it was a &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take 17 variety in a night of moon and every one will dry it with a different tone .
With this is not graduate Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than count the stami .
Now , &#91; applausers &#93; the problem is that also the ones of us who have to the heart people who have paid them to be paid to our real world , and it somehow to our real world , and it &apos;s going to go beyond .
In fact , the 20th century , in 300 years , it &apos;s not going to be remembered to his , or his technological innovations , but rather like the one was where we stop and we used to abbracing and we used to get a lot of biological diversity and cultural diversity , cultural diversity and cultural planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All the cultures through the centuries are involved in a dance for new possibility .
And the problem is not the technology .
Indians Sioux , they &apos;re not stopped to be Sioux when they put it from the arms and frecce like Americans don &apos;t stop being American when they put from horse and hot .
It &apos;s not the change or the technology that mines the integrity of ethnosphere . It &apos;s the power .
The hard hard to domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you &apos;ll find that these are not destined to disappear .
They are living creatures and spined out of the existence from the existence of identifilling .
It &apos;s what it &apos;s disbing in the patria --
a nomasian , the nomasian , a people who lived free in the forest to a generation , and he was reduced to a generation , and now reduced to the servitus and the prostitution on the rights , where you can see the river inquinated from the lim that sounds just take a half of Borneo , where you can see the hurt the hildm , where the sounds like the horizon , where you know , you know , the horizero-su-like , and the horizonm , and the horizernal Cast , where the wwelseasian , where the hall of the west Cast , the
It &apos;s ready to fill the wooden soup .
Or in the case of the Yanomami , are the disease that are coming with the discovery of gold .
If we put on on the Mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the hard hard hard to see .
And as you know the genocide , the physical extinction of a people , it &apos;s a universal level , but the ethnocide , the destruction of the style of life , not only is to be announced , but it &apos;s a celebrated , because it &apos;s part of development .
And you can &apos;t understand the Tibet until you go from the beginning .
I &apos;ve spent the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in the Western China through the Western Tibet , coming to Lhasa with a young connection , but only came to Lhasa young connection , but I realized what &apos;s behind the statistics we feel about .
6,000 worlds sheep and centers .
1.2 million people killed from the military during the Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical at Panchen Lama .
And the Chinese invasion that was killed to the time of the Chinese invasion .
Her &apos;s ununless when the diaspora that led to the people in Nepal .
Her mother was imprisoned and his cold was being rich .
It was taken to cart on the age of two hidden , under his gonna because he couldn &apos;t live without him .
The sister , who did the same , it was mitted in reeducation .
A day he was inverted a hot fascil , a race of Mao and , for this transgresesession , was mitted to seven years .
The Tibet can be insopposite , but the spirit of the people is tener , but the spirit of the people is tener .
And then finally , it &apos;s all the time to a choice .
We want to live in the world monocromatic world or we want to get the world of diversity ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he died , he died that his largest fear was that , in our way to this amorage of the world , we &apos;re not just going to see the whole gamma of human imagination , but a day we &apos;ll be able to see a sleep of thinking , but one day we &apos;ll be able to see a sleep sleeping to the way us that there were other possibility .
And it &apos;s humiliating that our species is there for 600,000 years .
The Neolithic Revolution , which has given us us us to the socking of the seed , and replace the poem of the sevelates , by replace the next of the Cadian , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has to be 300 years .
That shared story not suggests me that we have the answers to all the challenges we have to deal in the millennia , and we &apos;re going to go .
When to these miriades of the world is asked what they want to say to be human , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all refer the possibility of being what we are : a kind of awarem , that has to make all the gardens and all the gardens can train . And there are great moments of optimism .
I took this picture on the north of the north island of Baffin , when I went to the whales with Inuit , and the Olaya , and the Olaya , Olaya , and he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The Chanadese government was not always gentile with the Inuit and the &apos; 50s to stare our supremate , we have them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refused to go .
The family , I feed her life , he took him away all of my wells , and all its equipment .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t feel the cold , they do it .
The packs of the origins were made of fish fish were made of the weather .
The grandfather of this man didn &apos;t intimidnight or the dnight , or the dramatic ddramatic ,
It &apos;s sweet on , it &apos;s hot the pantalones in the background and defected in your hand . When I did it &apos;s fecated , the working working in its hand .
It has sproud up on the top of this clock and when I became solido , and when I became solid killed a dog .
It has a bunch of dog and created a brighter , with the toacy , he had a slitter , he had a sat on the bank , he was disappeared on the bank , the clock .
We want to talk about horarsely with nothing ?
In the aprile 1999 , the canadese government reduced to Inuit &apos;s the total of a larger area of California and Texas .
It &apos;s the new painting . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s an independent territory . They can transform all the minerary resources .
One of a splense example of how a natione-state can reconconfidence with his people .
And , finally , I think it &apos;s rather obvious to the people who are in these remote areas of the planet , and I &apos;m not remote .
It &apos;s house .
They represent the human imagination that they &apos;re at the algrade of the time . And for us all of these children , as the dreams of these children , as the dreams of our children , they become part of the geography of hope .
We &apos;re going to end , we have a few of National Geographic , we &apos;re not going to be able to do anything .
We believe that polements --
&#91; Applausers &#93; not persuausers , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best institution to tell stories about the world . Every month our site has 35 million visits lived .
156 countries transmitted our television canal .
Our rights are lected by millions of people .
Our work is traveling in the ethnosphere to bring our public places in the places of wonderful cultural places that they &apos;re going to go away from how they saw and , hopefully , abbracing for the central reveal of the existing of existing in diversity , and we have to find a life of life in a life , and we have to find a life of life in a world , and we have to find a life in a world , and we have a world of life in a world , and we have to find a life in a life in a life in a life in a life in a life in a life in a life in a
where the wisdom of all the people can contribute to our well-being .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope I call it some other things I &apos;m going to show you some connection , in case you don &apos;t note it .
I love with what I call &quot; the official dogma .
The official dogma official what ?
The westerday of all the Western industrial society . The Western official dogma , &quot; If we want to massive the well-being of our citizens . &quot; The way to do it is massive the well-being . &quot;
The reason is , from one side , in the fact that the freedom is itself a value , it &apos;s precious , useful , essential for human beings .
On the other one is that if we are free , we &apos;re free , each of us can act to do everything that massive our well-being , no one that decide in our well-being , no one that decide in our own .
The way to massive freedom is massive the choice .
The most choices are , more libere , and the more is their freedom , and the more is their well-being .
This , I think , it &apos;s so deeply rown in the society that nobody would dream to be able to put it in doubt .
And it &apos;s also very rown in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m going to allow me a simple note about conditions for injump .
In my supermarket is 175 conducted , without counting the 10 variety of oil extrant and 12 acks hets that you can buy for a huge number of conducts that you can buy to get a huge number of conducts in the cirexpensive cirexpensive cirexpensive cirexpensive cirexpensive circumstances that no longer is your degree .
That &apos;s what the supermarket is .
And then you go to the electronics to buy a stereo : cast , CD , radio , the CD , radio , plifer , light , light , the light , the light , the light bull .
And in this single store of electronics , there &apos;s a great audio number of audio .
We can do six million different combinations using the components that there are in a store .
You have to admit that there &apos;s texting .
Other than the world of communications .
And once I was a kid , they could get all the phone services that they were able to get all the phone services that they were made by mom Bell .
It was noleant the phone , it didn &apos;t buy it .
A consequence of that , in the other , was that the phone never break .
These days are gone .
Now we have a variety of phones , especially in the cell phone .
So , here &apos;s cell cell phone .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , cut the nose of the bird , and forth to the kill me , and forth for the brulells .
If you don &apos;t have seen in the store under the house , you &apos;re very much certain that I &apos;ll get it .
And what &apos;s the answer is that people get in the negotives and does this question , you know what is the answer ? The answer is &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell cell that doesn &apos;t do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the acquiring explosian explosion choices .
Assistence : It doesn &apos;t happen in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor say , what you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; Okay , we could do A , or B , &quot; A has these benefits and the risks . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Dr. , what would I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A has these benefits , and B has these benefits and B has these risks . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebat , &quot; Dr. if she was me , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result of the malattaught , &quot; expression that it looks like a beautiful thing .
But it &apos;s not that a shift the weight and the responsibility to make decisions that somebody knows something , which is a doctor , or something else , and almost certainly is sick -- and almost certainly not , and almost certainly it &apos;s sick -- and it &apos;s not in the ide-making the patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing of drugs , directly to people like me and you , if you think you don &apos;t have any sense , because we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , because they advert them ?
The answer is that they want you to ask them to ask them to ask them to get it .
Something about that fundamental as it is our orequals is a choice , as it is in this vignet , &quot; We don &apos;t want to forget the children . They will go to the right moment , &quot; Don &apos;t want to get it to invent .
And we can reinventing how many times we get it .
And that means that every morning , at the risis , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I &apos;m going to the family and the matriage , a long time the common perspective , almost for anybody , was that it was that there was that there was a more preserved possible , and it was going to be able .
The only real choice was in who , not when , and not even what to do after .
I mean , it &apos;s really to play .
I teach them to very smart students , and I &apos;m going to do for a time .
And not because they &apos;re not very brilliant , because they &apos;re not because they &apos;re not because they &apos;re not because they &apos;re not because they &apos;re not very brilliant , because they &apos;re not because they &apos;re not because they &apos;re not because they &apos;re not so much .
But why are they imbill , I mean , I would say , &quot; I would be going to be ? I should do it now ? &quot;
&quot; I should be married away ? I have to think before the children or the career ? &quot;
They are rogen interrogen .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this implica not complete the companies that assigns and not get a beautiful voice to my exame .
And they have to really do that .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , as Carl underlying it , because the technology allows us to work every day , from every day , from every day , from the Hotel Randolph Randolph .
And in the parentesesesesestholine , and I won &apos;t say to anybody who , where the WiFi Fi works .
I don &apos;t say that , because I want to use me .
What does this incredible freedom of choice we have about this work ? Is that we have to continuously decide , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing calculus , with the cell cell cell cell in a pocket , the Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , tily , on the ginocaque .
And even though they &apos;re all spending , every minute that we see our son , we &apos;re also asking us , &quot; I have to answer this ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? I have to email this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is &quot; no , &quot; all this makes the experience of your son very different than than what it would be in other conditions .
So , anywhere we look at , little things , and the materials and lifetime , life is a question of choices .
And once the world was this : That &apos;s that there was some possibilities , but it was not a question of choice .
The world of today is what this : The dilemma is , &quot; Is it a positive , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Saims .
We were positive layers , we all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative .
All this choice coms two negative effects on people .
The first , paradoxically , it &apos;s that it produced paralysis that it &apos;s going .
With a lot of options that choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I give you a significant example : a study of the volunteer plans .
A connection of my colleague at the data of the Vanguard data , with about a million of pension , with about a million clients in 2,000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offering in more , the percentage of adhesian scenes of two percent .
With 50 sourds , there &apos;s 10 percent in less than a adesions than when they are available to be available .
Because with 50 sources of which choes , it &apos;s sick to decide , and the choice is reduced to intomorrow .
And tomorrow , and still tomorrow , tomorrow , and of course , tomorrow , and of course , tomorrow .
You know that doesn &apos;t just mean that these old who will miss the dogs will miss because they &apos;re not going to say that the decision is so that it &apos;s so dark , that the decision is so that it &apos;s so datories , they &apos;re going to allow the dator dumped on the dator &apos;s work .
Not participating , they &apos;re losing to five dollars for a year from the dator of work , that would be well be true to be .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too much choices .
And I think that makes the world that .
And to end , for the ethernity : ketchup , &quot; or maionese ? &quot;
You would want to do the right decision , if it &apos;s for the ethernity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong bottom , and yet the condition of the wrong thing .
So this is the first effect . The second one is that if we can avoid the parallee and do a choice , at the end of the result of how we would be with less options .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of conducted in which you choose , if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy , you imagine that you could do a different choice that would be better . And what &apos;s going on is that the alternative imagined us to branch the satisfaction , the decrease reed by the decision , and the filled decrew the satisfaction , and the flew de-de-de-made ,
And also when it was a great decision .
The most choices are , more likely to be disappeared to any detail that is inso-displeasing of the option choice .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has clearly well , it &apos;s like the value we &apos;re going to things depends on what we can do .
On the rest of the other way , there are many opposing options , it &apos;s easy to represent the alternative of the option that you have to be less sation-facts of option that it &apos;s choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m sorry with all the ones that are not in New York .
But it &apos;s what you probably think .
There &apos;s this copy in the Hamptons .
A place of lusband .
Splendida . Otma . Otma day . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not missing anything . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , maledition , it &apos;s Agust . &quot;
&quot; All my neighborhood in Manhattan is on . &quot;
&quot; I could park right in front of the house . &quot;
And it goes to two weeks above the idea that is losing -- every day -- the possibility of park where it wants .
The costo-opportunity demining the soddisfation for what we have , even when choice was excellent .
And the more are the options that we have to consider , the most actual actual acities , they will be going to be able to be on what costo-opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a living on it tells us a lot of things .
It &apos;s about the moment , and maybe of the living slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you choose , you choose to not do the other .
The things we don &apos;t choose to attractive that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : the growing of the expectations .
I tried it on my skin buying a new pair of jeans .
I &apos;m almost always jeans .
And once the jeans were just like a guy , bought them and they were dress , they were skied , just after they took them a life and they were going to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple of time when the old who were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
And he said , &quot; You &apos;re going to do it , you know , relaxed , relaxed fit ? &quot;
Do you want to do with the cernier or with the bottons ? &quot; Stonewashed , &quot; or &quot; aciddle &quot; ?
&quot; Would you like the struggle ? &quot;
&quot; See , &quot; See , &quot; Bla , &quot; Continupright , &quot; Continupright .
I was sbaleer , and after a little bit I was able to say , &quot; I want the guy that was the only guy , &quot; he was not , so for a time , I got all the people who had ever ever ever ever ever had .
It was the most . I had the best one .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I said a whole book to understand it .
And the reason I was that with all that choice is that I had to have my expectations , jeans had to be perfect .
I had to minimum waiting . I didn &apos;t expect anything like , when there was a kind of a kind of , but when 100 different , at least one guy had to be perfect .
What I had been buying was good , but not perfect .
After I was paragoned that I was going to try to do the expectations .
The adds of options in the life of the people don &apos;t do that to increase the expeccellence of the options itself .
And this will produce less satisfation , even when the results are good .
No one in the world of the marketing if it &apos;s something that .
Because if they knew it , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more like this .
&quot; The reason was better when it was worse , &quot; The reason was better when it was worse was that when it was worse , you know , when it was worse , you know , you know ,
We &apos;re in the world in which we live -- opulents , industrialized citizens with the expectancy -- the most we can hope is that things are at the time .
You never surprising pleasant because your expectations , and my waiting waiting , and I &apos;m ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Besearlier . &quot;
I mean , small authoring moment -- that I &apos;m really married and my wife is really amazing and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t have any content .
But it &apos;s not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of the bought a couple of jeans when there is only that kind of jeans is that when you &apos;re not sation-facts , and ask you ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot; The answer is clear .
The world is the responsible . What would I do ?
When you have hundreds of kinds of kinds of jeans , and buy a inso-disfacing , and you ask you who is the responsibility , it &apos;s just clear that the responsible , it &apos;s just clear that the responsible you .
You could have done better .
With hundreds of various various , there are no excuse for the insuccess .
So when people make decisions , even though the result is valid , they &apos;re feeling insoddisappeared and they give the cold .
For the last years , depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a factor factor -- not the only , but important -- of this depression is just that people have deludent experiences because the standard are too high .
And when they have to explain this is they think that the cold is .
So the end result is that we &apos;re better , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely phantom . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than having no deal with it , but from this didn &apos;t want to be a lot of choice .
There &apos;s a critical value , I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m pretty sure we &apos;ve got to a piece of the level where the choices choices improved our life .
Now , from the political point of view -- I have almost finished -- from the political point , the nocy is the following .
What it allows all this in industrial society is the wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know about that , where the problem is not that have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too pog .
So the facceness I &apos;m talking about is a sick of modern , re-caught , re-like , what Western society is .
And what it does depressing and angry is this : Steve Levitt told you yesterday , what the expensive seat for bimes , they &apos;re inutilize . It &apos;s a spread of money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and dispendiose , it &apos;s not that they &apos;re just useful .
I &apos;m a deleterie .
They do it worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows you to have a lot of choice , and it &apos;s too few possibilities , it &apos;s not just their life to improve , but our .
This is what economists call a improvement of a improvement .
A re-income re-income revenue revenue replacement that we &apos;ve got it in excess .
To end , you can get it , you can become what you want &quot; --
You , people of culture , you think , &quot; What does that fish ?
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t do anything in a glass of glass . &quot;
&quot; A range imagination , a limited view of the world --
and I &apos;m interested in this , I was so , at the beginning .
But then , I realized that , instead , I realized that that that fish knows the long knows that the long knows that the fish knows that the long knows .
Because the reality is that if you &apos;re missing in frankin , so that it &apos;s possible , &quot; it &apos;s not possible . &quot; You don &apos;t get the freedom . You can &apos;t get the freedom .
If you break the boccia in the way that all you can diminuity so-satisfation .
You get the paralysis , and you reduce the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too strange , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the abunce of some symbolic , it &apos;s a recil for inhappiness and , I &apos;m , for rovine .
Thank you heart .
