Last year I showed these slides to show you that the artica of the artica , which for almost three million years had the size of 48 , the United States of 48 continental United States , reaches .
But this underlying gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice ice of ice .
The glacial calculus is , in a way , the heart button-heart of global climate system .
It expanded up and reverse reverse .
The next slide is going to be a carrelated re-related rapid to the last 25 years .
The glaces are signed in red .
As you see , they go to the blue dark .
That &apos;s the winter ice ice , which is summer ritier .
You can see that the soft ice , five years , or more , is like the blood , that &apos;s like blood , which here was from the body .
In 25 years , it went from that long , so .
This is a problem because the interests that are glacied the land land around the arctic ocean where there are huge amount of fuzzy that , skip , they turn into the arctic , they turn into metane .
I &apos;m going to the total of the pollution of global warming , that amount of waste could be , overwhelming this point of not return .
In Alaska little deep-deep lakes in Alaska the metane is already related from the water .
The Katey Walter of the University of Alaska team was a team prices on a low-to-flood lake ,
Wow : Wow ! Al Gore : Wow is good . The question is if we &apos;re also .
One reason is this is that this termal exchange the Greenland from the north .
This is a river regime .
The ported never had ever ever ever reached the similar of it .
This is the Kangerlussuaimal , in the southest of the Greenland of Greenland .
If you want to know how to look at the sea level for the shelf of the glaces on land , here is where the sea reaches .
These currents are increasingly .
On the other side of the planet : Antarctica , the largest block of the planet .
Last month , scientists have told that the ice balance of ice is in negative , and that the West Antarctica , which pogate on some submarine islands , is particularly harily hly hahead .
It &apos;s about six feet of the water , like Greenland in Greenland .
Sulla Himalayas , the third largest block of ice , you see new lakes , that a few years ago were glaciers .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population received half of the water from the skiest .
Sulle Ande : This glacier is the source of the water of this city .
The ported is increased .
But when it decreates , the same happens to the water .
In California , the snow on Sierra Nevada is decrediminished in the state of 40 percent .
Bidricium water is in crisis .
The predictions , as you read , they &apos;re grave .
The growing security in the world brings to a remarkable increasingly inceness .
The environmental disasters are increasing a pace out of normal and unprecedented .
It &apos;s over the last 30 years I was related to the previous 75 .
This is a whole unsustainable gap .
If you look in the historical context , they can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the top of the Eastern Pacific , from the Americas , in the west and on both of the Indian parts of the Indian subcontinent , where it &apos;s royal roygal root in in the ocean .
The greater cause of global warming , and with deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the fossil use of fossil fuel use .
The oil is a problem , and coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the most emissions , together to China .
And he came to build a lot of other coal centers .
But we &apos;re seeing a change of the way .
These are the annullated projects in the last years , and some alternative vers .
Every way , there &apos;s a politics fight in our own own own own own .
The coal and coal and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year in the last year to promote the coal , which is a bone .
That image would remember me to something --
Verice , in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a loss of 3.8 billion litri waste waste .
Perhaps you saw it on the news .
This is the second largest fllow of supply in America .
It &apos;s happened around in Christmas .
Number Chadvertising one of the coal industrial .
Good ood up ♫ ♫ Frosty the January is a happy ,
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it makes our economy .
Frosty the January is more clean .
It &apos;s good at price , adorable and workers keep working on the waste .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the coal of West Virginia .
The biggest society is Massey Coal . This is the Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I &apos;m going to be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelososy , Harry Really -- they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alliance for the Clime &apos;s Protection of Clime launched two campaign .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : ALergy : At the same thing as a serious threat to our business .
And that &apos;s why we invest a lot of money in a publish publishing in a publishing reverse and confused the coal truth .
In fact , coal is not sports .
We think it &apos;s clean -- it also has a good profumber .
So you don &apos;t pretend of climate change .
Let me go .
Man : The one clean : Carbon -- you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
So let &apos;s make a turn into a look at the avanguard for how clean coal coal coal is .
Straordinarily ! See ! See cars are a little noise , but this is the sound of the pulit fuel .
The coal consumption is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology that you see changes everything .
Take a look . This is the pulit hated fuel technology .
Al Gore : Well , the alternative is connected to economic issue and the national security .
Video : Complplpleter : The economy is the economy , climate crisis .
The films that connections all : our dependency from fossil fuel fuel , like coal and oil .
Now , though , there &apos;s a new , audgmented solution to use .
Really , 100 percent clean energy in 10 years .
A plan to report the America , to make us more secure , and help stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that I joining our problems .
Repower .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It &apos;s about reducing energy to America .
One of the fastest ways of taking the dependency from fuel to rebustible that killing our planet .
Comparsa : The future is here . Very , sun , a new energy network .
New to speak two : Notic : New Yorkers for well-retributed jobs .
Really , America . It &apos;s time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old African African says , &quot; If you want to go fast , go from themselves .
If you want to go away , you go along . &quot;
We have to go far far .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I made a introduction on LHC .
And you promise to return to the back to you how the car works .
So I am there . And for the other time , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever tried -- 27 kilometers of circles .
His task is to rear the conditions that were there less than a billionth of the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
That &apos;s just ambitious .
This is the car under Ginevra .
And we photographs these mini-Big Bang in the results .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- is wide 44 meters and it &apos;s a 22 diameter of 22 meters .
This is a spectacular image of ATLAS in construction so you can see the proportions .
The 10 industry -- 10 of the last year we have push the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLAS .
It was a mess of the flew in the control room .
It &apos;s a picture of the first fascience of particle that he had done all the LHC , and in a deliberately , with a part of LHC , and spread particles inside the magazine .
In other words , when we saw that that 10 / 11 , we realized that the car worked , which is a great victory .
I don &apos;t know if it was this one to make us exulating more or this , when somebody went on Google and saw that the initial page was this .
That means we &apos;ve had a cultural impact beyond that scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the car , just about these files here -- these files .
These files carry 13,000 ampampampampbs when the car works at the most of the power .
Now , the technical of you will look at the files and they will say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . I &apos;m wells too optiles . &quot;
And they can do that because when they &apos;re very cold become the so-called files .
So , at least 271 degrees , at a lower temperature than the space of the space , these files can bring that current .
In one of the giunture between the most of the magnets in the LHC , there was a defecting defect .
So the files come up with a slightly , and the 13,000 ampbs suddenly met a electricity .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think that these magnets are weight over 20 tons , and they moved about 30 inches .
They were damaged about 50 magnets .
We had to take a little bit of it , what we did .
We &apos;ve slowed them to re-clever .
They &apos;re now coming back to the underground .
I finally got a march the LHC , will be a new integrity .
We will accend it , and we expect to get some data , and I go and go and keep that we can see what the morning are the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these crashing crashing the value of science and the frontier of science and comparison the value of science and comparison the value of science and compared to the value of science and compared to the value of the value of science and the frontier .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so difficult , the fact to go beyond the limits , I think this is the value of things like LHC .
I &apos;d like to end with the words of a Inglese scientist , Humphrey Davy , who , I guess , in defense , in defense , his pupillo was Michael Faraday , he said , &quot; Nothing is so dangerous for the progress of the human mind , as the ideas of science , is definitely dangerous , and that our train is complete , and that there are no unfolks in nature , and that our new monds . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to rethink about when you , you play with children , you play with the morning .
And as you could get them and grab them , take them and get them and move , and you know , actually , you know , actually , you know , and to do space relations .
The spacecraft is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , by the information inspired by the useful way of our interaction with physical objects , together to my Pact , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking ask , &quot; And if , when we &apos;re using a computer , instead of having the only mouse , like a computer , but we have a computer , instead of having the only information with both of the hands , and the hands of the mouse , we could say that they die on a desktop , we could have grabbundying , with both information with both ,
and fix it to us ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big interactive computer like a biscanning .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big interactive computer like a biscanning .
You can move with your hand , they can see their hand , they can see their movement and they have a screen and a wireless radio .
But mostly , they &apos;re physical objects , like the morning , you can &apos;t move it down .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physicists , aware of the movement , of the other , and as they become more physicists , of the movement , of the other , how we can look at the new and how we can explore new and fun styles of interaction .
I &apos;ll start with a few simple example .
This Siftable is to show some video : if you &apos;ll get a video , if you &apos;ll go back in a direction , the video is going to rotate like this , if you go back on the other side .
These interactive portraits are aware of the other .
If they &apos;re relying them , they &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re around .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can be a little bit .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can be a little bit .
They also have their movement and check .
We realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the way that we can use communities on the data , for example , &quot; to make a liquid . &quot;
In this case , we have three Siftable , like , you know , and I can use them to go to the central color in the central , where they &apos;re missing .
and I can use them to go to the color in that central , where they missing .
We can get too , we can reach a little bit .
There are also beautiful possibilities , like languages , like languages , the mathematics and logical games where people can try to try things things fast , and see the results .
Now I &apos;m --
This is a Fibonacci sequence I do with a equations .
Here we have a words that &apos;s in the middle of Scarabeo and Boggle .
Basically , at every Turn you got a letter on every Siftable , basically , to every Turn , you got a letter on every Siftable , and you know , you know , he &apos;s looking for him to a dictionary words , I &apos;m going to go to a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you get back , and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
There &apos;s over here of the kids who came to the Media Lab , I made in a way that I tried and took a video .
They &apos;ve liked very much .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is you don &apos;t have to give people many instructions .
You just say , &quot; words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
There &apos;s more people coming it .
This is our beta younger tester , there on the right .
It was actually wanted to be implemented .
They only were in the morning , for him .
Now , this is an applying cartone .
We wanted to build a tool for learning . He &apos;s Felix . He &apos;s Felix .
It can be able to put new characters in the scene , lifestylights .
It can be able to put new characters in the scene , lifestylights .
So , it &apos;s going to go out the sun .
Video : The sun is sweet .
David Merrill : He &apos;s now a treatment in the scene .
Video : The arannic treatment .
BBash ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah !
So , shake the Siftable , and put them in the neighbors can get the characters --
Video : Bau !
by inventing their story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a story with open , and he can decide he as it comes .
DM : It &apos;s a story with open , and he can decide he as it comes .
Video : Will the way , cat .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , which is done recently , to sample and performing music .
It &apos;s a tool , I made of the tool , to sample and performing music .
The Siftable here are agging from sounds like the lower and the battery .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose to use .
You can also get these sounds in a sequence of your pleasure .
And just to change it by by by making a sound and a sequence .
These are actually you can control from alive , like the reverse and the filter .
The attacks to a particular sound , and then you get into the lay .
And then there are general effects as time and volume , which is apply to the whole sequence .
Let &apos;s look at how it works .
Video : We &apos;re going to start a very much in two Siftable &quot; sequence , &quot; we fix &quot; , we fix , we fix them in a series , we added up into the extend , let &apos;s go into the extend , let &apos;s take it , let &apos;s go into a series .
I &apos;ll put a line of a lower line .
DM : Now I added some percussions --
DM : And I &apos;m going to put the filter in the battery , so I can control the effect of the living effect .
DM : I can tell you the whole sequence , I can require the whole sequence , and then on one side or the other .
DM : I &apos;ll now add the bottom line to the bottom line the bottom to give more expression .
DM : I can rebince the sequence of the sequence .
So I didn &apos;t have to plan this first , but I can suddenly make it longer or more court .
And now , finally , I can smoking the whole sequence , I can smoking the entire sequence of the volume .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new human interfaces that they &apos;re more like our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that &apos;s coming this new generation of design objects to interact with digital media , which will lead to our information in our world that we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time to talk to all of you .
I &apos;m a writer .
And I &apos;m going to be a profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the fascinating and my life .
And I don &apos;t look like that can change .
But , I said , something special happened in my life and my career , and my career , which led me to reeating the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called &quot; Mangia , Prega , Ama , &quot; which , diversously , in my previous books , for some reason came out in the world and became a great feeling , the interational bestseller .
And the result is that everywhere now , people treat me treating as if I was convicted .
It &apos;s really -- convicted , convicted !
They come from me all worried , and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t fear you couldn &apos;t do it anymore ?
You don &apos;t fear to go and write all life without being able to be able to create a book that can matter ? &quot;
what can you matter to someone ? &quot;
It &apos;s reassuring , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say , I was a teenage -- I was a teenage -- I was a writer .
I went to the same reaction with the fear reaction .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you feel like he couldn &apos;t get successful ?
Do you fear that the umiliation of refigured you kill ?
You don &apos;t fear to make this mesh for all life without anything that you ever come out and to a dry cumb with sets of dreams ? &quot;
That &apos;s what you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yeah , I fear of all those things .
I always had fear .
And I also have fear of many other things that people wouldn &apos;t have to be inherent .
Like the algae and other things scary .
But , as I was about writing what I thought , and I was wondering , why is it ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logical that anybody should expect to be frightening from a work that you feel that they were born to do .
But what is that particular , in the creative companies to make us nervous about mental health yet elessly other career than the other career reefs don &apos;t they do ?
As my father , for example , he was a chemist engineer , and I don &apos;t remember one time in his 40 years of activity in which he was asked if he was fear to be engineer ?
There was never -- that block of the engineer John , how does it go ?
Wouldn &apos;t it worked that , you know ?
Onestly , chemicals like group have not certainly , in the centuries , in the reputation of being alcohhhit .
We have enough this reputation , we have enough this reputation , and not just creative writers , but we have this reputation of being enormous ununstable to mentally .
And it &apos;s not about anything else that you look at the sad , the stairs of creative magnifies that only in the 21st century , dead people , and often .
And even those who don &apos;t look like they seem to be really disdisappeared by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , &quot; Every book has killed me a little more &quot; A business , I was a little more &quot; I was a business about their life .
But we don &apos;t throw a little bit when we hear this stuff so long that we &apos;ve been heard of these things so long that we &apos;ve completely interiorized and the suffering are in some ways , and the suffering are in some ways that the art , to the end , the end , the end , the end , and the end , and the end , and the end , and the end , and the clothing , and the suffering are always in the corosion .
And the question I want to ask everybody to here today is : Would you agree with this idea ?
It goes well well -- because it also seassume of a distance to me not well for anything that I don &apos;t do that well .
I think it &apos;s hated .
And I think it &apos;s dangerous , I don &apos;t want to see it in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our big creative minds .
And certainly I know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start to fight into that feeling of support support of support , wherever you go to my own own .
That &apos;s -- you look , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;ve been a couple of years old .
I still have about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything I &apos;m going to write about the world , as the work that came out after the world as the work that came out after the very scary success of my last book .
I &apos;m going to be a slicks , because we &apos;re all more or less friends here -- it &apos;s likely to be in my own shelter .
Oh , Geso , thinking !
You know this is the kind of thinking that the door one person to start drink in the morning , and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would keep doing this work that we do this work that we do .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it seems to me , after a lot of reflections , that the way to continue writing is to create a protective psychological construct , OK ?
I have to find a few distance of safety between me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxiety about what I would write to get . And I was trying to try to do this , I started looking through the time , trying to find other societies to look through time , trying to find other societies to see if they could have better and more healthy ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthy ideas .
how to help people creative people to manage the emotional risks of creativity .
And that research brought me to the ancient and ancient Rome .
I &apos;m just follow me and turn back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
They thought creativity was this one that &apos;s a spirit looks divine and that it came to men somewhere from a few distant and unknown for distant reasons .
The Greeks called these beat divine divine divine of creativity .
Socrate , wonderful , he believed to have a deon that elargiva wisdom from far .
Romani were the same idea , but they called the the kind of spirit without a body a genius .
Which is great , because Romani didn &apos;t think that a genius was a genius was a particularly people .
They believed that a genius was this kind of divine that was living in the walls of a artist , a little bit like the artist of a little bit like the wild , and it came out to the work of the work of the artist and to model the output of that work .
Here &apos;s a remarkable -- here is the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological construction that you protect from your work .
And they all knew that was so that he worked , right ?
So the antic artists were protected from certain things , like the too narcism , not ?
If your work was exceptional you couldn &apos;t take it all the merit , everybody knew that you were helped by this genius .
If your failure work , it wasn &apos;t your fail , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a incapable .
And so people have a creativity in the West for a long time .
And then the Renissance came and everything , and it changed this big idea ; we put the human being to the center of the universe on top of all of the universe on the top of the universe on the top of the universe on the divinity .
This was the principle of rational humanity and people started to think that creativity came completely from the idivide .
And for the first time in history , it started to reference this or that artist as a genius , rather than a person with the genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think that allow someone , a simple person , to believe that they &apos;re like a recipient , the essence and the source of all the divine mysteries , creative , unknown and unknown and unknown and unknown and a lot of divine to give the pair .
It &apos;s like to ask someone to enjoyment the sun .
It depending and distores the whole ego and it makes all these ingestimatable expectations on the performance .
And I think it was a pressure for the artists in the past 500 years .
And if that &apos;s true , and I think that &apos;s , the question is , and now ?
Can we do that differently ?
Maybe go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery creative .
Or maybe not .
Perhaps we can &apos;t take 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And they probably have people in the audience in the audience would be legitimate scientific suspects on the notion of , you make people that are going to follow people , I &apos;m going to do with their own projects .
I &apos;m not going to convince you all about this .
But the question I &apos;d like to ask is -- why not ?
Why wouldn &apos;t you think about that way ?
Because it makes more sense of anything that I &apos;ve ever heard to explain the exasperating imprevedibility of the creative process .
And so a process that you know , as anyone who has ever tried to do something -- so , basically , everybody here knows , you don &apos;t coms rationally .
And in fact , it can sometimes seem to be completely paranormal .
I did this , recently , with the extraordinary poeeted Ruth Stone , who has been a poem for all life and said to me in his own childhood and he said to me in his own childhood , and he felt it was in the field , and he felt , and he felt it , in if a poem came from the landscape .
He said he was like a train , it was like a train of air .
And that was going to roling to come into the landscape .
He felt that , because he was doing the land under his feet .
He knew that he was one thing to do at that point and was of his words , &quot; run as a match . &quot;
And he was going to go back home and he was going to come from this poem , and it wouldn &apos;t have to make anything else that they would take a piece of paper and a match enough enough , and he pick it up on the page .
Sometimes he couldn &apos;t be fast enough , so correct and he was going to go and run her and the roll the house and she would continued to roll through the landscape , and she would continue to rating through the landscape , trying , and she said , &quot; another poet . &quot;
And then there were these times -- this is not forget -- I won &apos;t forget about -- there were some times when it was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was trying to paper and the poem passed through , and he was going to go , and he said , he was going , and he said , he was like halling with the other hand and the office .
And he was the poem from the tail and he would repel into his body and transmit on the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page , but the counter-to-first .
So when I felt that -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly the same as it is exactly the same as my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conduction !
I &apos;m a mulo , and my way of working is ; I wake up the same orary every day and work and go on the himself and go on the himself .
But even I , in my testyligin , I striped out of that thing , sometimes .
And I guess a lot of you have the han done .
You know , even if the work and ideas came up to me from a certain source of you , I could not be honestly aware .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it , but rather than we do not make us not lose your head , but rather , than that , that makes us us healthy ?
As I am about , the best contemporary example I have is the musician . Tom Waits , which I interviewed several years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life was the incarnation of the artist tormented the contemporary artist , tomorrow , to domestic , completely completely completely interacted .
But then he invecked , he sed , and he was driving on a highway in Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
He was going fast and everything about a very very much of a sent piece of apelodia , coming in his head as inspiration , and she wants , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the desidera , but you don &apos;t know how to take it .
It doesn &apos;t have a pencil piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a record .
So he starts to hear this species of old anxizing becoming in , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose it from this song even .
I &apos;m not good enough , I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to the panic , he stopped .
And I &apos;ll make the whole mental process and made something completely new .
He just looked at the sky and he said , &quot; Sorry , I don &apos;t see what I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Do you think that can write a song now ?
If you really want to exist , it &apos;s coming back to a more hurt you .
Otherwise , you go to any other today .
You go to Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his work was changed after this .
Not the work , the work was still dark .
But the process , and the fish fish fish that had been released to the genius , the geniuses that came out of him , the geniuses that he was in the problems and freed it back from where it was , and he was doing it that he was made that he was interiorized and tormentally .
But yes , this peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration with a conversation between Tom and this strange and that was not Tom .
So , how I felt that story started to change a little bit of the way I worked and I was saved me once .
This idea , I was saved when I was writing , &quot; Prega , &quot; and fall in one of those dispppair that we cause all have when we &apos;re working on something and we don &apos;t do and you get to think that will be a disaster , that it &apos;s a disaster , that &apos;s the worst book .
Not just bad , the worst book .
And I started to think of of how to throw this project .
But then I remember from Tom who was talking to the air and I tried .
So I got up on my face on the manoscritical and I got my comments to a vacuum of the room .
And I said high voices , &quot; Seir , what we know if this book is not going to be brilliant is not going to be a bunch , I don &apos;t ?
Because as I &apos;m seeing in me , I &apos;m putting everything I have no longer than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to introduce your part .
OK , but if you don &apos;t do that , you know what I don &apos;t do anything .
I &apos;ll go to write the same because it &apos;s because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to me , I was recorded that I was today to do my part . &quot; Because it &apos;s like this , OK -- centuries ago in the deserts of the North Africa of the people were dances , dances and the bright to the clearly dances , dances and the dances and went on hours and the dances of the dances of the clearly .
And they were always magnifigures , because the dancers were fantastic and they were fantastic .
But every once , they rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became actually transmitted .
And I know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know that you &apos;ve all seen , at a point , a performance like this .
It was like the time stopped , and the dancing drinking , and it wasn &apos;t different from the usually , like 1,000 notice before , but it was all standing in .
And suddenly , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s just a sudden .
But he &apos;s going on from divinity and below the fire of divinity .
And when this happened , it was , people knew what was , they called it .
They were all the hands and started to sing , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , God , God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
I was historical notion -- when the More southern invine in the Spanish , I preserved this habits with them and the ready to change in centuries , &quot; Allah , &quot; Allah , &quot; which is a &quot; Ole , &quot; who you can still feel in the corride or flamenc .
In Spagna , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , the guy , and Allah , magnificent , &quot; Alah , &quot; ununcomprehensive , a God .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes next day , for the dancing itself , when you wake up and you wake up and find that are the 11 in the morning , of God is no longer .
It &apos;s just a dead dead with great ginocrates , and maybe they can &apos;t never be able to each other than each one .
And maybe nobody will sing the name of God still as a God still yra , and what he &apos;s going to do with his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most painful reconciliations to do in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so corporate if you can &apos;t believe , well , the most extraordinary aspects of your being being from yourself .
But it just credit you &apos;re in a review of a unimaginable source of this team part of your life that squeeezer than you have to go to someone else when you &apos;re finished .
And , you know , if we think that &apos;s all about it .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s certainly like I thought of for several months during the working of the book that I &apos;ll soon soon soon , the dangerous , and I &apos;ll attempting , and I &apos;m going to attempting to my great success .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel electrized by this is , I don &apos;t have fear .
Don &apos;t flow you . It only your work .
Continua , you will introduce you for your part , any of it .
If your work is dance , you know , you know .
If the divine , absurd genius , absurd you decide to let me get some of wonderful , for a only time through your efforts , then &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Otherwise , you make the same your dance .
And &quot; Oh ! &quot; &quot; to you the same .
I think it &apos;s about it .
&quot; Oh ! &quot; &quot; &quot; to yourself , even for having human love and testygine testing the tlothes to make you very much of you introduction .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Oh !
As you know I &apos;ve talked about some of these human plans on the human genome , about what it can mean , and the new genes .
Now we &apos;re starting a new path : we started digitize biology and now starting from that digital code , we &apos;re going into a new stage of biology , designing and synthesizing .
We &apos;ve always tried to ask big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists , I think they &apos;ve tried to understand how many levels .
We tried different approaches , reducing it to the minimum terms .
We &apos;re going to digitize for almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the analog world &apos;s the digital of the computer world .
Now , let &apos;s regenerating life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome that can authoretry in the lab .
And we tried to reduce reducing the genome to create a little more small .
We can get a hundred genes of the genes of about 500 that are here .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our .
I think I &apos;m theme , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminating , one at the time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this can bring to a cell .
So we decided that the only way to design was synthesize this chromosome in a way that you could change the components to be modify the components to ask some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of &quot; Can we synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Can you have the chemistry you make these big molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create before ?
And , in case , can we make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemical material inert .
The speed with which we &apos;re able to digitize life is growing at the exponential rhythm .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , design rather slowly , but it &apos;s improving .
And our most recent results the results the carrying on a curve .
We started more than about 15 years ago .
And the process required a lot of passages , starting with a bioethical review before the experiments .
But we found that we synthesize DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that produce small segments , of 30 50 letters , and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the more degenerative is that the more mistakes .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments and reacts .
And this was our first attempt , starting to start by digital information from the genome of Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills .
We designed the fragments , we &apos;ve been designed the fragments and get a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material inert and we put it into the bacteria , and they started reading this this genetic code and to produce the gene code and to produce the viral particles .
The viral particles have been released by the cells , come back and they have destroyed .
I spoke about recently with members of the oil industry , and I said that they &apos;re certainly understood this model .
They &apos;ve been sweet more than you .
We think this is a situation where the software can really build its hardware into a biological system .
But we wanted to do things larger .
We wanted to build the whole chromosome of the bacteria .
I &apos;m more than 580 thousand gene code .
So we thought we were to build it into cables of the virus , so that we can change the cassette cassette to understand what the components are of a living cell .
Saction is critical , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard accuracy was a mistake for every 10 thousand basis .
We found out , resequencing it , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence we never be able to do it work .
One of the process is to design segments 50 letters , that they get overwhelming with all the other segments of 50 to build them smaller than 50 to make a 50 to build them smaller underneath the worst of 50 letters , to build them .
Let &apos;s try to take units here .
You &apos;ve probably read that we put in the trillion .
Think of it , we have a gene code on four letters : A , C , Gs and T.
Three of those letters ,
So we can use the gene code to write , sentences , sentences , thoughts .
What we did at the beginning was self-raving .
And some of them were deluser by the fact that it wasn &apos;t poem .
We designed these segments to be able to just join with enzyme .
There are that they relate them and put them together .
And we started to assembling of the parts , starting with the sides , starting with the 15,000 letters to come to them , and they form segments to 4424,000 letters to them .
And each step , we made these sweather dgments so that we could sequence them , because we &apos;re trying to create a very good rooms -- like you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatically automatically .
So , this seems the tabellon a foundation of basket globe .
When we get to these very long chments , more than 100 mies , more than 100 tricks , they won &apos;t grow more directly in E.
You get to the modern molecular biology .
So we &apos;ve looked at other other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called homological recurbination , which is useful to repair DNA to replate DNA to join the DNA .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism called Deinococcur Deinococcus , can absorb three million radiation rad .
You can see in the upper results like his chromosome is destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s just like it was before .
There &apos;s thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms have been no care completely .
They can live under vacuum .
I &apos;m sure that life exists in space , and you can get new environments .
And to say , NASA has shown that this is happening .
This is a molecule that we &apos;ve built , just using these processes , just using the lievated with the design appropriate segments .
The yeah himsemble them .
This image was not taken with an electric microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It &apos;s a molecule , so big that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that they cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the publishing we did a long time .
I &apos;m more than 580,000 letters .
It &apos;s the largest molecule of a definitely created by man .
It has a molecular weight heavy molecular weight .
If we &apos;re going to be a 10 without spacecraft , we would like 142 pages only to transmit this gene code .
Now , how do we work ? How can we do that ?
Of course , you know , you know , a little boy .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s simpler even when it comes eucarily cells as our : you can just get the nuclear , and put another , which is basically the process of clonation .
In the bacterium archaea , but we &apos;ve recently demonstrate that we &apos;re able to do a complete transplant that we &apos;re able to do a complete trapial trapart .
We clean a chromosome parent from a microbial species .
The two of the ones are different than the men .
We added a few genes in a way we could decide what to choose for this chromosome .
And then he skip with the enzyme so that they killing all the protein .
And when we put it in the cell was amazing -- and you &apos;re appreciate our sophisticated graph -- the new chromosome is -- the new chromosome is gone into the cell .
And we were thought that we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to push it beyond .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that that a lot of these species have added a second or a third chromosome , somewhere , I added a second thousands of new traits to that species .
So , who think about evolution as one gene once you change doesn &apos;t understand much of the biology .
There are some enzyme called &quot; restriction enzyme , which even digital DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell , you don &apos;t have one .
The cellular cell phone -- the chromosome we have put it .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other chromosome as a material extreo , and we found with only the cell and the new chromosome .
It became blue because of the genes we have put .
And in a short short time , all the characteristics of a species , and it turned into a new species , based on the new software that we put into a new species , based on the new software that we put the cell .
All the proteins have changed , members have changed , and when we read the gene code that .
Now , this may seem to be genetics , but by allowing DNA , we can change things in a pretty substantial way .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that you don &apos;t talk about genesis -- but of progress from three million years and a half years of evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the Cambriana in which will be new species based on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s obvious , when we think about our necessity .
We &apos;re going to go from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Just to give you an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one existing in 1946 ; 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find food , fresh , fresh and medicine for six billion and a half billion people .
It will be even more hard to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion coal coal , more than 30 billion barrels .
That means a hundred million barrels a day .
When I try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replace , it will be a huge challenge .
We also have to realize the whole CO2 emission from these materials that end up in the atmosphere .
In the day , because of the scientific discoveries in all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the designed for the future .
The electronic industry only only only has a dozen about components , and think about how many different things came out of .
Our limits here are data , principle from reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , because of these methods methods , and to create what we call a genomics combinatory .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think of processing these 20 million different genes or try to optimistic processes to produce optimistic , new vaccines , we can change , because of a little team , and create more molecular biology than in the last 20 years .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemical production or chemical vaccines .
This is a few programmed software instantanezen programmed that we &apos;re working on to be able to seat and design species on the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know , we don &apos;t necessarily know how they &apos;re going to be .
We know exactly what their gene code is their gene code .
We &apos;re focusing on the fourth generation .
You also saw you that extract ethanol from the grain was a bad experiment .
We have depending on the third generation that will use enough to be using fuel zuck enough of higher fuel like they or different butanol .
But the only way biology in which biology can have a big impact without increasing the cost of food and limestone that you can have to turn CO2 into matter , so we &apos;re working to design cells that can achieve this purpose , and we think we can have the first fuel , and we think we can have the first quarter of about 18 months .
War the solar combined CO2 is a metodo--- but in our discoveries around the world , we &apos;ve found different metods .
This is a organism that we described in 1996 .
It &apos;s living ocean in the deep ocean , about 2,500 feet deep to the webollition of water .
It creates metane by CO2 using it as a molecular hydrogen using as energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand whether we can sing CO2 , which can easily be carried through the CO2 , which can easily be carried through the carbon , to drive this process .
So , short we think we could be able to increase what the question of &quot; what life is life is . &quot; We have a real real thing . We have the button of the chemistry of the whole chemistry industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can you do that ?
It would come a main source of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working to use the same methods to create instantly vaccines .
You saw this year with flu , we &apos;re always back of a year and with a dollar in less when it comes from the vaccine .
I think that you can change by building combinable vaccines in anticius .
And that &apos;s how the future might start seeming , now , the tree of evolution , accellating evolution with synthetic bacteria , arches , and finally eucarily cells .
We &apos;re so much like that we can get people .
Our purpose is to make it . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;ll show you , the faster , possible , some fundamental work , of the new technology that we brought to the Microsoft in followed to a bug nearly a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s a environment where you can interact is at the local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data .
So we &apos;re seeing a lot of digital gabyte , with a kind of a kind of weather and continuous , for a fast panoramic , display the images as we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much the amount of information that we see , how big these data crops or images .
Most of the digital photographs , but this for example is a scan from the Library of Congress , and come in to the launch of Congress , and it comes into the gamma 300 megapiel .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that limits its its its prestations of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen at any time . It &apos;s a very flessible architecture .
This is a whole book , no data of not images .
This is the Dickens .
To show you that it &apos;s just about text and not of images , we can do something like that , to really show you that &apos;s a real representation of the text , not a photo .
It could be a little artificial way to read a little electronic book .
I don &apos;t advice it .
This is a more realistic example . This is a number of The Guardian number of The Guardian .
Every image is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the good experience of reading the real heart of a magazine , or a daily newspaper , which is for nature a multiple type of half .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of The Guardian angle .
We created a ad fashion on resolololder than that you use in a normal publishing , and we put in the normal content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminating space on the screen .
And I hope that means to put people on the way to the people and other similar porcheries , I didn &apos;t have to be necessary .
Of course , maps is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say that we have contribution to do this field .
These are all the street in the U.S. overhead of a geospace over a NASA geospace .
So we go to something else .
This is actually live on the web ; you can go to the web ; you can go to see .
This is a project called Photosynth , which fight two different technologies .
One is Seadragon , and the other is a visual computer that was very interesting to Noah Snavely , a student at Steve Seitz of Washington , with the help of Microsoft of Microsoft Rick Szeliski Rick .
And it &apos;s from the webs-management , Seadragon the web .
You can see when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from one image to the other and have this kind of experience to have this kind of experience to multiple it .
But the spacecraft of images here , actually a meaning .
The visualization algorithms of computer computers have recorded these pictures together , so that they corresponding to the real places that the real things that the imagination -- all sorts by the Montagne Rocciose canads -- they &apos;ve been taken out . So here of the Montagne , and these things have been all connected to the space level .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot of space over .
I want to go directly to one of the Noahnaims original from a previous prototynth of the first time , the summer technology , that we &apos;ve done for the first time , the summer technology , Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily evidence that we have put in the website . And it &apos;s not necessarily evident so much evident looking at the environmental time that we have put in the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so forth .
This is a reconstruction of Nothree Dame Cacacactual , and then , Flickr , and you get images of Flickr in Flickr , and you get images of these shirt bandomness and saying . Once one of these boundaries , and saying . And then you get a picture that &apos;s discovery appearing this model .
So , they &apos;re all made by Flickr , and they were all connected to the spacecraft in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to ign this very simple way .
You know , I would never have thought of finish working for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifying to get this kind of accounting here .
I think you can see that this is a lot of different kinds of photocamers : from those cellphone phones . And that &apos;s a significant number , put together in this environment .
And if I can try and try to try to look at those more strange .
Many blocks from the faces , etc .
Somewhere there is a series of photographs -- there is a series of photographs -- there .
This is a poster of Nothree Dame poster .
We can go from the poster physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is taking from the suit -- from the whole memory of how the earth the land , from the visual point of view -- and connecting all that data together .
All those pictures become connected together , more than the sum of the parts .
You have a model of the entire land emerges .
Think about this as a prolungation of Stephen Lawler &apos;s work on the virtual Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as people use it , and the people who use it , and the use that they use it ,
Their photos are marched with meadow by other people .
If someone comes to the idea of contrast all these sets , and I can use it as a photograph of Nobody captured , three Did suddenly visly enries , and I can use it as a way of ingress to dive to immermermersed in that space , in that metaphor , using the photos of the cross-mo-cross-cross-cross-cross-cross-buser and .
Of course , a consequence of all this is very much elaborate virtual models of every interesting part of the land , crops , and they &apos;re satellite images and similar , but from the memory , but from the memory .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I realized what your software will you do is that at some point in the next years , all the photographs , all the photographs that we have been shared by anyone in the whole world will be practice together ?
BAA : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is basically to find .
It &apos;s by creating hyperlink , if you want , in images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the basement of the images .
And what gets very interesting if you think about the wealth of seanti-seanti-seanti-seanti-to-wealth of these images .
As you do a research of images on the web , you have a sentence and the text on the web , it has a lot of information about the images .
Now , what happens if that picture you connect all your photo ?
So the amount of semanation and the amount of semanantial interconnection and it &apos;s really huge . It &apos;s a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible . Compliments .
BAA : thank you very much .
One of the main pleasures when you travels and one of the ethnic research , is the way that you can live in the wanting of the antic traditions , between the hadn , the hits the hole , the touch in the wind , the stone of the wings , the leaving in the leaves of the plants .
I think that the shamane Jaguar travel beyond the Latia Lattea , or that the Inuit &apos;s still the Inuit are still hit of significant , or that in Himalayas , the buddies , they follow the side of the Dharm , to remember the central of anthropology , and the idea that the world we live in there are no assume , but it &apos;s just a reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that we have made , well or bad , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential traits .
We all procrease . We all procrease .
We &apos;re subjects at the initiation .
We have to deal with the inexorability of death , so we don &apos;t surprising if we &apos;re going to sing and we &apos;re --
We all have a art .
What it hits is the particular race of the song , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that they &apos;re the Borneo Penan forests , or the following of the Voodoo &apos;s Borneo &apos;s warrior in Kenya , the Curander in Kenya , Curander , or a camp , or a camp in the heart of Sahara .
And he was my company was a journey in the desert a month , or a yak hallator in Qomolangma , on Mr. Everest , on Mr. Everest , the world &apos;s mother .
All of these populations teach us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And , if you think a second , it &apos;s a concept that it can give you hope .
Together , the miriades of the world create a spiritual , of the world , cultural , which is going to have the planet and it &apos;s important for the planet as a biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural spider as a ethnic , and you can define the ethnic sphere , the total spacecraft of all the concepts , subject , inspirational , intuitions , taken out of being from the human imagination of awareness .
ethnic here is the great potential of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be as as a polite species .
And because biosphere was graved consumer as long came up to the ethnic , and unfortunately much more rapidly .
No biologist , for example , would say that 50 percent of all species is on the ord of the extinction just because it &apos;s fake , or -- in the most optional hypothesis that , in the field of biological diversity -- and you don &apos;t even get close to the most optimistic -- that of cultural diversity .
The surgery of all of that is , of course , the language .
When you &apos;re born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not made by a vocabulary or a vocabulary , or a series of grammatical rules .
A language is the spraking of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle of which the animus of every culture comes in in the world .
Every language is a forest , a body body body , a thought , a spiritual , a spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , while we &apos;re here sitting in Monterey , at least half not come in in Monterey , at least half not come in in the ears of the children .
They don &apos;t get teached , which means , unless campaigns , unless than something , which is already death .
What is more sad than than the being the silence of the silence , of the last talking about a language , the last speaking a language , you don &apos;t have a way of transmit ?
This is a few of the world , it was one in some of the world every two weeks . every two weeks . Every ssillabs of a language .
And I know somebody of you will say , &quot; Is it better ?
The world wouldn &apos;t be a better place if we were going to let all of the same language ? &quot; Well , we all yoruba .
We talk about kogi .
You &apos;ll find a sudden what it means you can &apos;t talk about their own language .
I &apos;d like to give you a journey through the etnic .
a little journey in the ethnic , to give you a taste of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I tell you that when I tell a different way ways of existing .
Let &apos;s take for example of this Barasana child , in the Amazon SS , the people of the anaconda , which creds in the Amazon , which creds in the west panish &apos;s poured panish .
It &apos;s a people who can &apos;t tell the blue blue color from green because the blue blue color from green because the time it is identified in the forest , that it depends on the people .
They have a strange language and a matriable rule , called &quot; exogamic language , &quot; I have to marry a person talking a different person talking about a different person talking about a language .
And all of this has roots in the mitological past , though the particularly , in these extended families where they talk about six or seven languages because of the marriage of marriage .
They &apos;re just listening and they start talking .
So let &apos;s take one of the most interesting tribe with which I lived , Waorans of Ecuador , a incredible people that had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionar-missionar-seven missioned a fatal mistake .
They took them down the top photographs that they react in the poses that they were reduced to the forest that this people of the forest plusive forest .
They crops from the land , they turned them to the research of a form or a shape or a figure , and not out of anything , they have concluse that it was the diavored himself , and killed the five missionaries with lance .
But Waorani didn &apos;t kill only the foreign &apos;t just the foreign .
They killed each other .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We went to eight generations , and we found two natural death , and when we &apos;ve insisted to know , they admit was invited that one of them was invecked , and then they killed him , and then they killed him him . And then they killed him the same .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine , 40 steps and recognize species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned a really interesting task when my Harvard professor , I wanted to go to Haiti to intruly sending the basement of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutput and Tonton Macoutoutes , and Tonton Macoutes , and I impossessor to make the zombies .
And to make sense of the miraculous , I would have to understand Voodoo culture and that Voodoo is not magic .
It &apos;s a very complex metaphor in the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to tell me about the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christianity , Islam , Buddhism , etc .
A continent is always leaving out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no faith . And instead , and the Voodoo is not the distilled of these religious concepts of religious concepts of natives in the tragic diaspora of slavor that .
What makes the interesting thing that it &apos;s interesting to be the relationship between life and death .
So , they live in the beat .
The spirits can be invocated by the Great Acqua , they respond to the race of the dance and replaced temporary to the point of life that , for a briefly briefly the followed to be the god .
And so , for this voodooists love to say , &quot; You know , you know , you know ,
We give them to the temple , and we become God . &quot;
And from the time you &apos;re posing , is the spirit that you , how can you get your bad ?
So you see these incredible events : following the voodoo into state of trance that touch , infuel-demonstration that touch infuel-power of mind in the body when it &apos;s catalyzed in a state of extremely excitement .
And that comes from the Sierra Nevada , I &apos;ve lived the most extraordinary is Kogi Kogi Caman Santa Marta , Colombia .
And they would be on the ancient , the tyrann that once lived on the charge of Colombia on the carric waiting for conquician , the people would be on the volcanic maximum that would be on the charbonary plain .
In a continent of blood blood , this people have never been conquered spread from the spread .
But I &apos;m actually governments from a clever , but they &apos;re actually extraordinary .
The young people are taken from their families to three or four years , and live secret in a dark world in a dark , shading world , in the same way of 18 years .
Two periods of nine years of the way to reproduce the nine months of gestation that they go into the user of the mother , now are metaphor in the user of the Grand Mother .
For all of this time , they &apos;re acculturated to their society , values that pre-layers , and only their prayers and forget their prayers and they keep the cosmic balance .
And so , as this incredible initiation , they &apos;re suddenly carried out and for the first time , to be a dawn . And that &apos;s the moment of awareness , when the sun kiss , when the sun kiss , when the sun kiss , all that have learned in theory , all that they have learned in theory in theory , and he says , &quot; Please a back a step , and says , &quot;
&quot; Good ? Proprio as I said .
It &apos;s now amazing . Now it &apos;s about you . &quot;
They call the greater brothers and say that we , are the rings of the destruction of the world &apos;s destruction .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the indigenous populations and invoke Rousseau and the old history of selver , which is a race concept in its simplicity , or maybe invoke Thoreau and we invoke , and say that these people are closer to the Earth of us .
The Indies , people are not nor feelings , no nor weaker .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the malarial paluds of the Asmat or in the Tibet , but because it &apos;s time and rituals , they created a mystical of the Earth is not about the concept of the Earth is not about the concept of the Earth can live only because it &apos;s infectively close to : the idea : the concept that the Earth can live only live because it &apos;s infected by human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
That &apos;s saying a kid of Ande who goes into the Ande , who &apos;s a mountain is a spirit of the Apu who will lead his destiny to be a human being deeply different with the mountain or that place , and will have a different relationship with the mountain or that place , and it &apos;s going to have a masse of rocks is a lot of rocks in Montana , who &apos;s going to be shown .
Which is dimora of a spirit or a mineral caught is irrelevant .
What &apos;s interesting is metaphor that define the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia Britannica , and they were going to be cut .
And that made me a different human being different from my friends Kwakiutl , who believe that the forests are the Hukukukukukukukukukukukidney , and the cannies that live in the Hamatan initiation we &apos;re going to have to the north of the world , spirits that we &apos;re going to have to get northern rise of the world , spirits that we &apos;re going to have to get norgaint in the world , and the world , and we &apos;re going to the forth , and we &apos;re going to get that we &apos;re going to have
If you start to look at that these cultures can be different , you can start to understand some of them senational discoveries . We take this plant .
I took this picture to open in the nordest Amazon nordest Amazon nordest .
Maybe some of you &apos;ve heard about the ayahuasca , the most powerful psychophical psychophical active repertory .
What makes the waste is not the drugs of the substanti-huash potential of the substance , but the processing . It &apos;s made by two elements .
On one side , this lian liana legning , which contains a bunch of beta charcoal series , harmoline and harmoline , slightly hallucinogen .
And by taking the only plant you have a blueast , and it alter a little bit of the coal , but it put with the leaving of a coffee family &apos;s artment , and they &apos;re called Psychotry is aliridis .
This plant contains powerful , very similar to the serotonin , dithyptamine , dithyptamine , methyptamine .
If you ever see the Yanomami , you &apos;ll have a different species , it &apos;s a different species , it contains methoxyptamine .
Thing that dust on the nose is a little bit like being shown by a little bit of dipinch , and land on a distortion of the wiring . It doesn &apos;t believe a distortion of reality .
I often have to my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who had a broadded was psychedelic , with his discovery of the hallucinogen in the &apos; 30s in Mexico .
And I think there &apos;s no one can be classified to these trippppptamine as hallucinogen . And you can &apos;t tell anybody of being hallucinated . And you can &apos;t be hallucinated by a enzyme that are , of course , in the intestine , and they can &apos;t be ab-by-ab-didash , they can &apos;t be hallucin-butterly .
It &apos;s possible to get the oreally only if you above with other chemicals that are denial .
Now it &apos;s the beautiful : the carbs that are in this lian injury are inblowers of the same kind of need to potentially potentially potentially , in a ptamine . And the question is spontaneously , in a 80,000 species , like they have not similar to not similar , but that if you combine , they &apos;re in this way , they create a biochemical version of the parts of the parts of the parts ?
We use the great eugly females , of the evidence , which can be infruted .
But if we ask Indians , they tell us , they &apos;ll tell us , we know .
What does that mean ?
This tribe , Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuasca , who distinguishelter in the forest , and that of our eyes would come into the same species .
If we ask them how they stabish their toxonomy they &apos;ll tell us , &quot; I thought , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take the 17 variety in a night of moon the filling and they &apos;re going to sing a different tone .
With that you don &apos;t have graduate Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than counting the stami .
Now , in the problem is that even those of us that have to the heart of us that have a heart people who have painting , but in some way reduced to the margins of history of our real world , and it &apos;s going to go .
In fact , the 20th century , it &apos;s not going to remember his 1,000th , it &apos;s not going to remember its own technological innovations , but rather like the one was where we stopped and enabled to account the mass mass destruction of the mass diversity of biological diversity and cultural planet . Now , the problem is not change .
All the cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibilities .
And the problem is not technology .
Indian Sioux have no stop being Sioux when they put from Sioux when they have been arco , and they have stopped out of the horse and heat .
It &apos;s not change or technology that threatening the integrity of the etnic . It &apos;s the power .
The hard dall of the domination .
And if you look at the world , I discovered that these are not destined to disappear .
They &apos;re living and dynamics , spinting out of forces from the existence of forces .
It &apos;s about the Penan : I &apos;m going to be in the Penan --
a nomad of Sarawak , in the Southeast East , a people who lived in the forest to a generation of the forest to a generation ago , and now reducing to the service and the next thing on the rights , where you can see the river river , where you can see the river river , where the ride of the lim , where the black black black black you can see the hotter , where the naked you can see the horizon ,
It &apos;s ready to fill the wooden wooden .
Or in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that have come with the discovery of the gold .
If we marry on the mountains of the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the dall of the political domination .
As you know the genocide , the extinction of a people , is convicted to universal level , but the ethnic of style , but it also also also is not a constyle , but I even even think it &apos;s celebrated in certain environments , because it &apos;s part of development .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of the Tibet until you go from the beginning .
I &apos;ve path the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in the West China in West , coming in Lhasa young man , but only came to Lhasa young connection , but only came to Lhasa young connection , but only came to Lhasa little bit of the statistics that we feel about .
6,000 bits sacred reduced respected ress in dust and centering .
1.2 million people killed by the military in the Cultural Revolution .
The dad of this guy was assume .
That means that it was killed to the time of Chinese invasion .
His uncle to Santial Santiity during the diaspora that led to Nepal .
His mother was imprisoned and his hit was rich .
It was brought to hide in charge to the age of two birth , because he was hidden couldn &apos;t live without him .
The sister , who did the same , it was put in reduction field .
One day he got a snaked , a roll fascience , and , for this transgression , was put to the forced safety for seven years .
The Tibet can be insopportag , but the spirit of the people is from the tener constantly .
And then , it turns out to a choice .
We want to live in the world monocromatic monocromatic or do we want to account the world of diversity ?
The great anthropologa Margaret Mead , before he died said that his greatest fear was that , in our way to this view of the world , we don &apos;t just see the whole gams of the human imagination , but of the human imagination , we &apos;ll see the whole gamort of thinking , but one day we &apos;ll see a sleeping le-by-letting ,
And it &apos;s humiliating that we have been a species in 600,000 years .
The Neolitica Revolution , who gave us agriculture , who has made us restore to the crack of the seed , by replacing the poem of the skyl with the prosa , creating the hierarchy of specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has to be 300 years .
That &apos;s not history , you don &apos;t suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we &apos;re going to have to deal with in millennia .
When to these miriades of the world is asked what it means to be human , they respond to 10,000 different different voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all return the possibility of being what we are : a conscious species , which has to be a way that all the people and gardens can fix . And there are great moments of optimism .
I took this picture on the north of Baffin the end of Baffin , when I went to hung with Inuit , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and this guy , Olaya , and this guy , Olaya story of his grandfather .
The Canadian government has been gentile with the Inuit and the &apos; 50s to stabilire our suprematia , we &apos;ve been rhininated .
The grandfather &apos;s grandfather refused to go .
The family , I theme for his life , he took them all the weapons , and all his tooles .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t feel cold , they do it .
The skin origin origin , were made of fish fish flying in the origin of chargers .
The grandfather of this man didn &apos;t require the artica or the bylizer , and the bylizer .
It &apos;s slowed , it &apos;s socked the pantalones in the skin of focuses and defected in their hand . When I did did it frozen , they work with a fire .
He sprinted salive on the top of this cat , and when it became solid , he killed a dog .
He shake the dog , and he &apos;s made a shelter , with the toracy made a slope , he enliked another dog and it &apos;s disappeared on the banking , and it &apos;s disappeared on the banking , and it &apos;s disappeared to the bank , and it &apos;s disappeared .
Let &apos;s go to the rise with nothing ? &#91; Risate &#93; And this , in different ways , and , in different ways , and Applausers is the symbol of the Inuit and of the world &apos;s Indies and world .
In the open 1999 , the Canadian government replacement of the global land area of the largest land California and Texas .
It &apos;s their new patha . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s an independent land . They &apos;re all the mineral resources .
One beautiful , I &apos;m like a natione-state can reconcilied with his people .
And , finally , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious to the people who have been in these remote areas of the planet , I realize they &apos;re not remote .
It &apos;s for someone is home .
They represent sections of the human imagination that go to the dawn of the time . And for us all , the dreams of these kids , as the dreams of these kids , are part of the geography of hope .
And then we are National Geographic , we are convinced that politicians will never get anything .
We believe that poleman polements --
&#91; Applausers &#93; are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the best institution to tell the world stories . Every month our website has to 35 million visits .
156 countries transmit our television channel .
Our magazines are lets of millions .
Our work is traveling in the ethnic , to bring our audience in places of cultural wonders that they &apos;re going to go away from how they &apos;ve seen and , hopefully , embracing , will be a way of the central revelation of the central world : the merita world of existence in diversity , and we have to find a life in a world pluralist and multicultural world in a world pluralist and multiculticultural world , and multicultural style and mal life in a life in a life in a life in a world in a
where the wisdom of all the people can contribute to our collective well-being well-being well-being .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some of the things that I wrote in this book that I hope , and I &apos;ll call some connections , in case you don &apos;t notice them .
I &apos;d like to start with what I call &quot; the official dogma . &quot;
The dogma official thing ?
The official dogma official society . The dogma offal society . The dogma official , &quot; The official dogma &apos;s well-being of our citizens . &quot;
The reason is , on one side , in fact that the freedom is itself a valuable , is precious , useful , essential for humans .
On the other hand , in fact , if we are free , each of us can act for all that maximize our well-being , no one that &apos;s deciding in our well-one .
The way of massively freedom is massively choice .
The more choices of people , more are more libutterer , and more is their well-being .
This , I think , is so deeply roomed in society that nobody would dream to put it in a doubt .
And it &apos;s also deeply rowed in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you a few examples of what progress made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;ll put a simple note on the conditions for the windows .
In my supermarket , there are 1775 conditions , without counting the 10 variety of oil oil , and the 12 actions that you can buy for a huge amount of conditions that you can buy for a huge conditions in the increscious circumfic that nobody of the 175 resciful .
Here &apos;s what the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronics to buy a stereo , cases , CD lettor CD , radio , plasks , lifer .
And in this single electronic store , there &apos;s a great number of audio components .
We can do six million and a half of different combinations using the components that there are in a store .
You have to admit that there &apos;s a lot of choice .
Also , the world of communications .
Once , when I was a kid , they could get all telephones that were wired by mama , to be a Bell .
He was noleggied the telephone , you didn &apos;t bought it .
A result of that , between the other , was that the phone never break .
These times are gone .
We now have a nearly illimited , specially between cell phones .
Here &apos;s cell phones .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , cut them them them off of the nose , and forb for the kitchen crack ,
If you haven &apos;t seen it still saw in the below housing , you &apos;re very much certain that will come .
And what happens is that people go into the store and they do this question . And what is the answer ? The answer is &quot; No . &quot;
You can &apos;t buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
So , in other ways of life that are much more important than the aquatic aquantum of the choices .
It doesn &apos;t happen to be healthcare : it doesn &apos;t happen in the United States that you go from the doctor and tell you what you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do A , or B , and you know , these benefits &quot; B , these benefits , and these risks . What would you do you do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Doctor , what would I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; Well , these benefits , and B has these benefits , and B has these benefits . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebat , &quot; Doctor if you were , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not like her . &quot;
And we call it &quot; autonomy &quot; the &quot; malate &quot; , that does seem like a beautiful thing .
But in fact , it &apos;s not that you can get the weight and responsibility to make a decision that you know something , which is the doctor , to someone else that knows nothing -- and almost certainly not know -- and it &apos;s not the ideal condition -- and it &apos;s not the ideal condition , and so it doesn &apos;t know .
There &apos;s a huge marketing of drugs , direction to people like me and you , who , if you think about it doesn &apos;t make any sense , because we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why do we advertising them ?
The answer is that they want you to ask them to ask them to require them to change the recipe .
And something that is the same as our identity ever is a matter of choice , as you see in this living . &quot; We don &apos;t want to forget kids to be . I don &apos;t want to forget the right moment . &quot; We don &apos;t think more an identity : we have to invent it .
And we can reinventing us how many times you do it .
Which means that every morning , you have to go back , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
I &apos;m going to the family and the matririmonium , a time time , the most of the time , it was that marriage , and you started to get the most early ones , and you started to get the most early possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not what to do after .
So , it &apos;s really about playing .
I teach students to very smart students , and I do their 20 percent less of work than a time .
And not because they &apos;re not very brilliant , not because they &apos;re less diligent .
But why are I imthouse , you mean , I should say , &quot; I should marry or not ? I should do that now ? &quot;
&quot; Would I get married later ? I think before I was going to get kids or the career ? &quot;
I &apos;m logo-rogative interrogation .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this implement not complete the cites that I sign , and not get a nice voice to my exam .
And they really have to do that . They &apos;re important questions .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , like Carl underneath , because the technology allows us to work every minute , from every day , from the planet , except that from the Hotel Randolph .
And in the parenteseseseself , and I won &apos;t tell anybody what the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t say that , because I want to use me .
What does this incredible freedom of choice that we have about the work ? It &apos;s that we have to continue , on every time , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing soccer , with cell phones in a pocket , Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , typically , on the knees .
And even if they &apos;re all spending , every minute that we see our son roving , we &apos;re asking us , &quot; I need to answer this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? I need to email this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is no , all this makes the experience of your son &apos;s own very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , anywhere we look , small and big things , big , things and it &apos;s life is a question of choices .
And once the world was this : Which was there were some possibilities , but it wasn &apos;t all about choice .
The world of today looks like this : The dilemma is , &quot; Is it a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is . It &apos;s a lot of it .
The positive positive positive layers we know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative .
All this is this : two negative effects of people .
The first paradoxically , it produces paradows that &apos;s paradows .
And so many options that you can get , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I offer you a significant study : a study of volunteer plans .
And my connection has access to Vanguard data , the giant society of pension , with about a million pension of a million clients in a year of a clients .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offering in more , the percentage of adhhesive down , two percent .
With 50 per offer , there &apos;s 10 percent less adhesian adaptive than when they &apos;re only five . Why are they available ?
Because with 50 sources of which you choose , is sick to decide , and choice is replaced to the indomans .
And tomorrow , and tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course they never get .
You know it doesn &apos;t mean only that these old workers will eat food for the dog because they don &apos;t have enough money , they also want to say that the decision is so unlike that they lose the complex sources of the dator of the dwilling .
They &apos;re not participating , they &apos;re losing to five dollars per year from the dator of work , which would be well disposed to be there .
So the parallel is a consequence of the too many choices .
And I think that makes the world .
&quot; And finally , for the ethernity : ketchup , or maiones-sensing ? &quot;
Would you like to make the right decision , if it &apos;s for ethernity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and yet the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can avoid the parallel and make a choice , at the end of how we would have been with less options that they would be with less options .
And that &apos;s about it .
One of these is that with many conditions between which you choose , if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could make a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us , you know , the alternative imagined us to branching the hhammed by the decision , and the repplant reaved by the decision ,
even when it was a great decision .
The more choices there are , easier displeased any detail that is inssatisfaction of the option choice .
And also , there is what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert : It clearly stamaattine , like the value that we give things depends on what we can compare .
And then , when there are many options , it &apos;s easy to represent the characteristics of the option of the option of the option that you have to be a choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I use with all of the ones that are not New York .
But that &apos;s what you &apos;re probably thought .
There &apos;s this couple of the Hamptons .
A luxury .
It fits upon beautiful . Otntim , I day day . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not miss . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , it &apos;s August . &quot;
&quot; Everybody &apos;s my neighbors in Manhattan are away . &quot;
&quot; I could parked right in front of the home . &quot;
And it goes to two weeks on the idea that it &apos;s losing -- every day -- the ability to parking parking where he wants .
The costo-opportunity decrease the sodness for what we have , even when choice was excellent .
And more are the options that we have to look , the more actual features that are going to be refused to be costo-opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a little bit of things .
It &apos;s about the time , and maybe of the living living slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you choose , you to not do the other .
And the things that we don &apos;t choose have a lot of attractive attractive that they do .
Third point : the growing spiral of expectations .
I tried to my skin bought a new jeans .
I &apos;m pretty always about jeans .
Once jeans were one , they bought and dress and dress from bestivate , were uncomfortable , only after they took them a life and they were a lot of times , they started going to go well .
So I went to bought a couple of a new time when the old people were gone , and I said , &quot; You need a couple of jeans , this is my cutting . &quot;
And the commit said , &quot; Would you want to slim it , relaxed fit , fit ? &quot;
Would you want to be a grnightons ? &quot; Stonewashed , &quot; or &quot; acidwashed &quot; or &quot; ?
&quot; Would you like ? &quot;
&quot; Sotto them want or stripped off ? Bla bla ... &quot; Continuate to helencare .
I was stunned , and after a while I was able to say , &quot; I want the guy , that was the only guy , &quot; he didn &apos;t have a idea what it was , so for an hour , I tried all the jeans , and then I came out of the jeans , and I went out the best pair , jeans , and then I had ever .
It was the most of it . I had the best choice .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse is that with all of that choice , my life expectations were altissue , jeans had to be perfect .
I had a little expectations . I didn &apos;t expect anything that exceptional when there was one , it was a great thing when I saw 100 different steps , at least one kind of be perfect .
What I bought was good , but not perfect .
After I compared to the chose with what I was trying to do , I was inssatisfaction .
The added options in life life doesn &apos;t do that to increase the expectations that have respect to the excellence of the options themselves .
And that will produce less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
No one in the world of marketing if it makes it .
Because if they knew , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more to that .
&quot; It was better when you were worse , &quot; The reason why he was better when you were worse was still possible to meet the surprise was still possible to meet the pleasant surprise .
So , in the world where we live -- opulent , industrialized citizens with the expectancy of perfeition -- the most of the expectancy .
You never surprised me me , because your expectations , my expectations , have been ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Baxation , &quot; Yes , you want it . &quot;
I mean , small autobiographic moment -- that I really are married and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t have done better , I didn &apos;t do it .
But , to be not always , it &apos;s a bad thing .
And then , a consequence of the buy a couple of jeans when you have that kind of jeans is that when you &apos;re not satisfied , and you ask , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot; The answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What would I do you do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a satisfaction , and you ask who is the responsible , it &apos;s just so clear that responsible , it &apos;s you .
You could have done better .
With hundreds of variety available , there are no excuse for the insuccess .
So when people make decisions , even if the result is valid , you feel inssatisfifts and give the hit .
In the last years , the depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this wave of depression is that people have deludent experiences because standard are too high .
And when they have to explain this that the breaker is their own .
So the end result is that we &apos;re better , actually better , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely fake . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit better choice than you have any time , but from this doesn &apos;t have a lot better choice .
There &apos;s a magical value , I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve overcome from a piece of level where the level of the level of our life .
Now , from a politician -- I &apos;ve got almost finished by politician , the peanch is the following .
What allows all this to the industrial society is wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know that there is no too much of them .
The problem is that they have too pack .
So , the thing that I &apos;m talking about is a bad evil of modern , recent society , recher .
And what it does depressing and enable is this : Steve Levitt spoke to you yesterday , how the expensive expensive seats are inutilize . It &apos;s a money .
I mean these choices , complicated and dispendit , it &apos;s not that they &apos;re just inutilize .
I &apos;m even deleterie .
They make us worse .
If a while of what we are in our society allows choices to be reversed in those where people have too too much of it , it wouldn &apos;t be the life to improve but also our life .
This is what economists call a partagging improvement .
A redistribution of income redistribution of income re-income re-income re-toilet choice .
To end up , you can get everything you want . &quot;
You , people of culture , you think , &quot; What does that fish believe that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious you can &apos;t get anything in a wild . &quot;
&quot; An imagination , a covered view of the world --
I &apos;m going to do it so , at the beginning .
But then , I realized , I was , I realized that that the long long fish knows the long long long .
Because the reality is that if you &apos;re missing in frantics , so that you can &apos;t have the freedom . You can &apos;t have the freedom . You get the parallel .
If you break the mouth so that everything divents you can divents as a satisfaction .
You get a lot of the paralysis , and you reduce the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too strange , maybe even for the fish , and certainly certainly for us .
But the absence of a few symbolic sphere is a recipe for the inhappiness and I fear for the roll .
Thank you very much .
