Last year I showed these slides to show that the arctic ice calf , which for almost three million years had the size of 48 , the size of the 48 United States continental , it &apos;s retroops 40 percent .
But this underground gravity of the problem because it &apos;s not about the ice of the ice .
The arctic calculus is , in a sense , the heart clean , the clean heart of global climate system .
It &apos;s expanded in the summer and retreat .
The next slide is going to be a carrelevant rapid seven-related .
The glaces are lost in red .
As you see , they &apos;re expanding to the blue .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter , which is a summer ice .
You can see that the so-called ice , five years or more , is like the blood , that &apos;s like a blood , that here fuel from the body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been like this .
This is a problem because the interests are the interests that are the earthquake around the ocean where there are huge amount of fuel coal that , they &apos;re transformed into meters .
I &apos;m going to the totality of the atmosphere of global warming , that would be double , that amount could be double , overwhelming this is not around .
In some of the founding lagues in Alaska the metane is already ribbuling from the water .
The Katey professorse , the University of Alaska &apos;s team , and they took a team print that .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You &apos;re good . The question is if we &apos;re also .
One reason is that this thermal exchange the Groenland from the north .
This is a river in the glacial regime .
He had never been in the same .
This is the Kangerlussuathetheast in the southest of the Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level to the shelter , it &apos;s where it &apos;s where the sea level reaches .
These are currents are rapidly .
On the other side of the planet : Antarctica , the largest block of ice on the planet .
Last month , scientists have been told that the balance of ice is in negative , and the Western Antarctica , which pogate on some underarine islands , is particularly quick in the skiest in the skiest .
It &apos;s six meters from the fight , like in Groenland .
Sulla Himalaya , the third largest block of ice , you see new laghi , that few years ago , they were glacied .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population revenue of water from the skiest .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the power of this city .
The ported is increased .
But when you decrets , the same is going to the water .
In California , the snow on Sierra Nevada is demined .
The hyries are in crisis .
The predictions , as you read , they &apos;re grave .
The growing safety in the world leads to a remarkable increases .
The environmental disaster are increasing to a rhythm outside of the normal and unprecedent .
Four times more of the last 30 years I was relevant 75 .
This is a whole unsustainable .
If you look in the historical context , if they can see the consequences .
In the last five years we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the area of the East Pacific , from the Americans , to the Americans , to the west , and on both parts of the Indian subcontinent , where there &apos;s a radical strip of oxygen in the ocean .
The greater cause of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossils .
The oil is a problem , and coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two of the world with more emissions , together to China .
And he was going to build a lot of other central central central .
But we &apos;re seeing a change of the way .
These are the projects announced in the last few years and some alternative of green .
And , in fact , there &apos;s a fight in our country .
The oil industries have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote to promote the coal , which is a bone .
That picture me , he reminded me something --
Verso Christmas , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a loss of 3.8 billion gers of coal fliers .
You may have seen it on the news .
This is the second largest flows in America .
It &apos;s happened around Christmas .
The Churnicity of one of the coal-coal ,
Video : Singer the carbon is a very happy guy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it &apos;s growing our economy .
Frel carbon dioxide is more and more clean .
It &apos;s at good price , adorable and the workers keep the workers .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the coal of West Virginia .
The greatest miner-mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administrator . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Benship : I &apos;m going to be a clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelososh , don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima &apos;s Protection of Clima launched two campaign .
This is one of them , a part .
Video : Attore : At the next thing . ALergy : At the same thing as a threat to our business .
So our priority is to invest a large amount of money in a publishing plan of money in a public effort to make it and confused the truth on the coal .
In fact , coal is not spork .
We think it &apos;s clean -- it &apos;s also a good profumo .
So you don &apos;t preupside of climate change .
Let me do .
Video : Carbone : Cbone -- you &apos;ve heard a lot of them .
So let &apos;s do a turn into a turn into a look at the avanguard of it ,
Straordinary ! machines are a little noisy , but this is the sound of the puzzle technology .
The coal consumption is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology that you see changes everything .
You look at this : this is the hated hdign technology of pulist .
Al Gore : The positive alternative is connected to economic question and the business security .
Video : America is in crisis ; America is the economy , the national security , climate crisis .
The throbust that connects to all of the : our dependence from fossils , like the spork and oil .
Now , there &apos;s a new , audent solution to use .
Repower : 100 percent clean energy in a decade .
A plan to reach America to the work , make us more secure , and help stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that drinking our problems .
Repower America . You get more .
Al Gore : That &apos;s the last .
Video : It &apos;s about to re-power to America .
One of the faster ways of bringing the dependence of the fuel that killing our planet .
He started , the future is here . Vent , I feel a new network .
So , you know , New esting : New esting investimate for jobs .
Complpling : Repower . It &apos;s time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old African lunch says , &quot; If you &apos;re going to go to the speed , go to the fairly .
If you want to go far , go together . &quot;
We have to go far , fast .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED I did a introduction on the LHC .
And you &apos;re going to return to the back to you to how the car works .
So I am here . And for the other time , the LHC is the greatest scientific experiment we &apos;ve ever tried -- 27 kilometers of circles .
His task is to rear the conditions that were less than a billiondest of a billionlion-second .
Everything is just ambitious .
This is the car under Ginevra .
We &apos;d refer these mini-Big Bang inside the relevators .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- it &apos;s a largo 44 meters and it &apos;s a diameter of 22 meters .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLATLS in building so you can see the proportions .
So , 10 September we &apos;re the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken from ATLAS .
It was cause of immense flew in the room .
It &apos;s a picture of the first band that had done all the way of LHC , and he walked into collision , deliberately , with a part of LHC , and spreading particles inside the reator .
In other words , when we saw that image the 10 September , we realized that the car worked , which is a great vittory .
I don &apos;t know if it was this one to do more or this , when somebody went on Google and saw that the beginning page was this .
That means we had a cultural impact beyond that scientific impact .
About a week after , there was a problem with the car , it had to these filters here -- these dories .
These files 13,000 ampbs when the car works at the most of the power .
Now , the technical of you look at the files and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . They &apos;re too throws . &quot;
And instead of it can do it because when they &apos;re very cold of become the so-called filters .
So , at least 271 degrees , at least a lower temperature in the space between the stars , these files can bring that current .
In one of the gigunture between the most of new magnear the LHC , there was a defect of factory .
So the files came up with a slightly , and the 13,000 ampes suddenly met a electricity .
That was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think that these magnees are weight more than 20 tons , and that has moved about about 30 centimeters .
They &apos;re damaged about 50 magnetic .
We had to take them , what we did .
We sad them down and upstates .
They &apos;re now coming back to their underground .
I &apos;ll end up the march , the end of the LHC will be again .
We will turn it , and we expect to get data to judge or june , and we continue our adventure to find out what the morning are the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these crashing accidents , they &apos;re going to be the valblock of science and the frontier . It &apos;s easy to blow .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s so hard , I think , is the value of the things like LHC .
I &apos;d like to end with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey Davy , which I guess , in defense of experiments of its own clean , his clean was Michael Faraday , he said , &quot; Nothing is so dangerous for the progress of the human mind , the ideas of science as human mind , there &apos;s no mysters in nature , that our triumber are complete in nature , and that &apos;s complete &quot; that we &apos;re not complete in a mong of conquent . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start asking about rethink about when you , you &apos;re playing with the morning .
And as you could get them and grab them and grab them , and you know , you know , actually , you know , actually , and actually , in fact , by the space relationships .
Now , space is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , from the useful information of our interaction with physical objects , together to my own Pact , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking , &quot; And if , when we use a computer , instead of having a computer , instead of having a computer , instead of having the only curator , like the mouse curator , we could have to affect physically information with both hands , and their hands , we could have to affect them ,
and fix it as we go to our pleasure ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the Sifmonetary .
In a few words , a Sifmonkly interactive computer like a biscanning .
In a few words , a Sifmonkly interactive computer like a biscanning .
You can move with your hand , they can see them , &quot; they can see &quot; they &apos;re &quot; and they feel the movement and they have a screen and radio wireless radio .
But they &apos;re physical objects , like the morning , like the morning , you can just get it down .
The Sifmonthly , the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physical , the other people are becoming more physical , the other people , and as they become more physical , the movement , of the other , how we can move them , we can explore new fun style of interaction .
I &apos;m going to start with some simple example .
This Sifmonthly is to show video : if you start it in one direction , it &apos;s going to rotate it so , if you &apos;re incline on the other side back .
These are interactive portraits of the other people .
If I relianm , you &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re around them .
If they &apos;re surrounded , and they can act a little bit .
If they &apos;re surrounded , and they can act a little bit .
They also had their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the way we could use common gesture on data , for example , &quot; to try &quot; to poured a color like if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Sifmonthly configured out of painting and I can use them to pour color in that central , where they &apos;re missing .
and I can use it to pour color in that central , where they &apos;re missing .
We &apos;re too much , we can put a little bit of it .
And there are also beautiful possibilities of learning , like languages , the mathematics and logical games where people can try things very quickly , and see the results that are very quickly .
Now I &apos;m ...
This is a Fibonacci that I do with a balance program .
Here we have a words of words that is in the middle of Scarabeer and Boggle .
Basically , to every Turn every time you got a letter in every Sifmonthly , to every Turn , you had a letter to case on every Sifmonthly , and as you &apos;re looking for a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new set of letters and new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the children came in in the Media Lab , I did so that I tried it and turned them a video .
They were very pleased .
And one of the interesting things that kind of appliances is that you don &apos;t have to give people many instructions .
You just say , &quot; Hi words &quot; , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s other people who try it .
This is our beta younger tester , right there on the right .
It actually wanted to do a lot of impilars .
They were only morning morning for him .
Now , this is a applied of a interactive cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool for learning . He &apos;s called the Plinger . He &apos;s Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , lifestyle , lifestyle .
It can put new characters in the scene , lifestyle , lifestyle .
So , it &apos;s going to go out the sun .
Video : The sun is sun .
David Merrill : Now he took a treer in the scene .
Video : The aranange treatment .
Bobs ! Yes !
So you shake the Sifmonks and put them close them can make the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing their story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a open story with open , and it can decide him like it .
DM : It &apos;s a open story with open , and it can decide him like it .
Video : Vola , cat it .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , to do this , to sample and do music .
It &apos;s a tool , made of a tool , to actually championeer and performing music .
The Siftap up here ags them from sounds , and the battery .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose what they use .
You can also put these sounds in a sequence that we can get into your pleasure .
And it just by making a sound and touch a sound and a sequence .
These are actually you can live , like the reverse and the filter .
It &apos;s acks to a particular sound and then cline for the wild .
And then there are general effects as time and volume , which are applied to the whole sequence .
Let &apos;s look at how it works .
Video : We &apos;re going to start in a two Siftool &quot; in two Siftool &quot; sequence , &quot; we fix them in a series , we add it in a series , we add to it .
I &apos;m going to put a line of a low line .
Video : I &apos;m going to adding some of percussions --
Video : And I &apos;m going to put the video video in the battery , so I can control the effect from the live effect .
Video : I can pop the whole sequence of sequence , to put the whole sequence of the time from one side or the other .
Video : I &apos;m going to add the bottom of the bottom to give the bottom of the bottom to give more expression .
Video : I can reach the sequence of the sequence .
So I didn &apos;t have to plan this first , but I can improvise , making it the longer or the court .
And now , finally , I can smoking the entire sequence of inclining the entire sequence of the volume .
Thank you .
So , as you can see my passion is to build new faces , more like how they work our brain and more looks like how they work our brain and the body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this way , and also some possibilities that we &apos;re trying to bring out of the lab .
So , the concept I want to transmit is that we &apos;re going to transmit with digital media , that will bring information in our world in our world that we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time to talk to everybody .
I &apos;m a writer .
I &apos;m books in order to talk about this , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the band of my life .
And I don &apos;t expect it to change .
But , I said , something particular , it &apos;s been successful in my life and my career , who brought me to report the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is I recently wrote this book , this is a book , this biography called &quot; Mangia , &quot; Prega , &quot; which , &quot; which , &quot; which , &quot; the one of my previous books , for some reason , in the world , and it became a great sensational , welling , interational bestseller .
And the result is that everywhere now , people are treating as if I was convicted .
It &apos;s done -- convicted , conducted !
They &apos;re all been worried about and they &apos;re saying , &quot; Do you not afraid of you couldn &apos;t do better ?
You don &apos;t fear to go on and write all of life without much more to be able to create a book that can matter to somebody ? &quot;
what can it matter to somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s resurrouning , you know .
But it could go worse , except for me that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a writer .
I would go to the same reaction that &apos;s based on the fear .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you feel like he couldn &apos;t get successful ?
Do you not fear that the humiliation of killed you ?
You don &apos;t fear to do this mesh for all of life , and that nothing never came out and to die on a cumple of dreams with the mouth pack of failures ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
I fear of all the things .
I always had afraid .
And I also fear of many other things that people can &apos;t really be uncable .
How the algae and other things scary .
But , as I was writing what I thought and I was wondering about , why is it ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logical that anyone who would expect to be frightened by a work that you feel like to do .
But what is so specifically in the creative companies that are nervous about the mental health as a way that other carriers do they don &apos;t do ?
How my dad , for example , he was an engineer and I don &apos;t remember one once in his 40 years of activities that were asked if he had to be engineer ?
that &apos;s never -- that block of John engineer , how do it goes ?
Wouldn &apos;t it work that , you know ?
Onestly , the engineers like group have not certainly , in centuries , in centuries , earlier the reputation of depressive maniacated .
We &apos;ve been enough to this reputation , and not just creative writers , but creative , all kinds of , we have this reputation of being enormous ununstable to mentally .
And it &apos;s not about looking at the sad , you &apos;re looking at the sad of the magnifies of creative minds that , only in the 21st century , they &apos;re going to die , and often for them .
And the ones that are not suicked to be really disdisdisdisappeared by their dones .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , &quot; Each book has killed me a little bit more &quot; A remarkable to the work of their life .
But we &apos;re not thin , when we feel this is because we heard these things so long that we &apos;ve completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are in some way that creativity and the suffering are in some way that the art , at the end , it will always constraints to the corner .
And the question I want to ask everybody to ask about here today is : are this idea ?
It &apos;s good for this thing -- because it &apos;s also looking at it from a centimeter to me , it &apos;s not good for anything that I would not do .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s dangerous , and I don &apos;t want to see it perpetuated in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our big creative minds .
And certainly I know that , in my case -- in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start to the way I was very dangerous to the circumstances that I &apos;m in my career .
It &apos;s really -- I &apos;m young , I &apos;m young , I &apos;m a lot of a young time , I &apos;m a lot of a little young , I &apos;m a lot of a lot of people , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m a lot of young , I &apos;m young , I &apos;m a lot of young , I &apos;m a lot of a lot of people who are young , I &apos;m a lot of young time , I &apos;m a lot of a lot of a little young time ,
I &apos;ve got about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything I &apos;m going to write about now in the world , like the work that I came out after the world , and the way it came out after I &apos;m afraid of my last book .
I &apos;m going to be a suit , because we &apos;re all more or less friends here -- it &apos;s likely that my big success is to my shoulder .
Oh , Gesus , what thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to drink gin the morning , and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would keep doing this work that we love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it looks like , after a lot of reflect , that the way to work to work to go on and write is to create a protective psychological construct , OK ?
I have to find a security distance between me , I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxiety about what I &apos;m going to write to get this , I was going to look for this year , I started looking for this , I started looking through the time , trying to find other societies , to see if they could have better ideas and more healthcare , if they could have better ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthcare .
how to help people manage to deal with the emotions of creativity .
And that research has taken me to the ancient and ancient Rome .
I &apos;m going to do it because I come in circle and then goes back .
In the ancient Greece and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
It was thinking about creativity was this spirit looks like to be divine and that came to a few people from some distant and unknown for the distant reasons and unknown .
The Greeks were called these spirits guardians of creativity .
Socrates , marvelous , believed he had to have a demon that held wisdom from a long way .
The Romans were the same idea , but they called the the sort of spirit without a genius .
That &apos;s great , because the Romans didn &apos;t really think that a genius were really smart .
They believed that a genius was this sort of a kind of entities that were literally lived in the walls of a little bit like the study of a little bit like the artist , and it came out to see the work of the artist and to model the result of that work .
Here &apos;s a remarkable -- that &apos;s the distance of I &apos;m talking about -- that &apos;s that psychological construct that you protect from your work .
And everybody knew it was so that he worked , right ?
So , the artists were protected from certain things , like the too narcism , for example , too narcism ?
If your work was exctional you couldn &apos;t take it , and all the mermerly , everybody knew that you were helped by this genius .
If your failure work , it wasn &apos;t all your fault work , right ?
Everyone knew that was your genius to be a bincapable .
And so people have han conceived creativity in the West for a long time .
And then the Renissance came and everything , and it changed this big idea ; we put the human being in the center of the universe above all the mysters and no more to leave space to the creatures that are writing detached to the divinity .
This was the principle of rational principle and people started to think that creativity came from the idivide .
And for the first time in history , it started to referring in this or that artist as a rather than a person with the genius that &apos;s a person with the genius .
And I have to tell you that I think was a big error .
I think it allows somebody , a simple person to believe that they &apos;re like a recient as a recient , and being source of all the mysteries that are decades , creative , unknown and unknown , unknown and unknown and etheless , unknown and unknown to the pocket fragile .
It &apos;s like to ask somebody to enjoy the sun .
It deform and it completely distors and it &apos;s completely expectations about all these expectations about performance .
And I think it was this pressure to destroy the artists in the past 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think it &apos;s , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do it diversity ?
Maybe we &apos;re going to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between human and mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t sing 500 years of rational thinking in a talk about 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience who would be reading scientific suspects on the notion of , they do , they follow people straightforward to their own projects .
I &apos;m not going to convince you all about this thing .
But the question I &apos;d like to ask is -- why isn &apos;t it ?
Why wouldn &apos;t you think that in the way ?
Because it has more sense of anything that I &apos;ve ever heard to explain the explanation of the imprevedibility of the creative process .
One process that as anyone who has ever tried to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- knows , you don &apos;t coms rationally .
And , in fact , it can be completely paranormal .
I did this meeting recently recently with the wonderful Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years old , but it was a poem for all life and said to me that during his childhood in the rural Virginia , working in the rural Virginia , and he felt it , in the country , and he felt it , within if a poetry came from landscape .
He said he was like a train of air .
And it was roling to come to her in the landscape .
He felt it , because he was able to do the earth under his feet .
He knew he knew he was to do at that point and was , his words , &quot; run like a match . &quot;
And he was going to run home and he was going to come from this poem , and it wouldn &apos;t have to make any other paper and a match enough , as a pencil , it would collect it and grab it on the page .
Sometimes I couldn &apos;t be fast , so correct and correct and he would have to come to the house and he would run through the house and he would continue to rolling the landscape , looking for like she said , &quot; another poem . &quot;
And then there were those times -- this piece of never forget -- there were times when there were times when there was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was looking for the card and the poetry through , and he was going through the room , and he said , he was like he going to go , and he said , &quot; he was like you would put up with the hand and the card it .
It was going to put poem from the coda and he would put it in his body and translate to the page .
And in these cases , poem would be presented to the perfect page , and the way , and the way , at the end , from the last word to the first one .
So when I was thinking about -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly the same as my creative process .
Not a creative process -- I &apos;m not a conduction !
I &apos;m a mulo , and my way of working is ; I wake up to the same orary every day and work and go through it . And it &apos;s going to work and move on it on the way .
But even I &apos;m just in my testy testing , I strike up against that thing , sometimes .
And I guess a lot of you have the han done .
You know , even if the work and ideas came from me to give me a certain source , I could not honestly unestly know .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it so that we can &apos;t have to lose your head , but rather , that we do healthy ?
As a little bit about it , the best example of the best contemporary I have is the Tom Waits , which I interviewed several years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the major of life was the incarnation of the artist &apos;s toward the candle of the clothing , to domestic species of impulse creative impulse creative impulse creative impulse creative impulse .
But then he was going to hot , he hot was driving on a highway in Los Angeles , he changed everything for him .
It was going to be fast and all of a sent tract of this little framment of melodia , coming in in his head like inspiation , helusiva and halling , and the wants , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and it doesn &apos;t know how to take it .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , it &apos;s not a match , it &apos;s got a recorder .
So he starts to feel this sort of old anxiety in the one , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to go up from this song even .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to the panic , he stopped .
And he put the whole mental process and made something completely new .
He just looked at the sky and he said , &quot; Sorry , don &apos;t you see I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Is it that it can write a song now ?
If you really want to exist , you &apos;re going to be a more hurt , when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , you &apos;re going to import somebody else today .
Go to disturbing Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his work was working after this .
Not the work , the work was still dark as always as always .
But the process , and the heavy of the fish that was released when the genius , the genius that outside of him , he was going to get that he was doing not to be a interhyorized and they were going to be able thing that it wasn &apos;t interiorized and hurt .
But it &apos;s a peculiar , wonderful bizarre , a conversation between Tom and this thing straightforward that was not Tom .
So how that story started to change a little bit of changing a little bit of the way I worked , and I had had a time .
This idea , I &apos;d save when I was writing , &quot; Prega , &quot; Ama , &quot; and fell in one of those despair of the dispppppppy , which we &apos;re not going to do that , and you start to think that it &apos;s a disaster , that &apos;s worse book .
Not just good , the worst book wrote .
And I started to think of how to throw this project .
But then I remember Tom , who was talking to the air and tried .
So I got up in my face on the manoscover and I got my comments to a vacuum angle of the room .
And I said to high voices , &quot; Sprpricing , what we &apos;re going to be brilliant not going to be entirely hit , right ?
Because as I &apos;m seeing here , I &apos;m putting all I have , I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to introduce you and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , I don &apos;t do anything .
I &apos;m going to talk to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to do for that it was recorded that I was presented to do my side . &quot; Because it &apos;s the end is so , OK -- centuries are in the North of people were rooms , dance and music that was going on for hours , and sacred music that went on for hours and so far for hours .
And they were always magnifically , because the dancers were always great .
But every time , it was rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became actually transcendent .
And I know what I &apos;m going to talk about , because I know you all , at a point , a performance .
It was like the time , if you &apos;re stopped , and the dancer walks through a kind of a portal and it was not different from the usually , like 1,000 noticed , but it would be able to come up .
And suddenly , it &apos;s just like a human .
But he &apos;s on the divinity and under illuminate in fire .
And when this happened , he was going to happen , people knew what was , they called him .
They were looking at the hands and they started to sing , &quot; Allah , Allah , God , &quot; God , &quot; God , &quot; God , &quot; God , &quot; God , &quot; God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
I &apos;m note historic note -- when the invest the south of Spain , I was this habits with them and the ready to change in the centuries from &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , &quot; Ole , &quot; the ones , &quot; which you can hear in the corpores or flamong .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , the ones , Allah , I &apos;m really , &quot; uncomcomprehensive , &quot; uncomprehensive , this is a ffflip of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes next day , for the dancer itself , when you wake up and you wake up and find that are the 11 in the morning of God is no more .
It &apos;s just a lot of hurt to the knees , and maybe it &apos;s going to be able to get to that height .
And maybe nobody will sing the name of God &apos;s God &apos;s name as a gira , and what is going to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most sweet reconciliations to do in a creative life .
But it maybe it &apos;s not to be so corosciating if you can &apos;t not believe , well , the most extraordinary aspects of your being from you .
But it just credit that you &apos;re in soon from a unimaginable source of this team of your life that &apos;s part of your life that you have to go to somebody else when you &apos;re done .
And , you know , if we think that way it &apos;s all changing .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s certainly like I thought about it for several months during the working of the book that I &apos;m going to soon , the dangerous , very scary , very scary , I was very much following .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel electrized from this is , I don &apos;t fear .
Don &apos;t fit . It &apos;s just doing your work .
It &apos;s got to introduce you to your side , any of the way .
If your work is dance , if your work is dance .
If the divine , absurd genius , absurd , and I &apos;m going to leave some kind of wonderful , for a moment through your effort , then &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Otherwise , you do the same dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot; &quot; to yourself . &quot;
I think and I think you have to teach it .
&quot; Ole ! &quot; to yourself , even for having the same love and testablished testables to make you present .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can mean and the discovery of new set of genes .
Now we &apos;re starting a new way , we started to digitizing biology and now we &apos;re starting to digital code we &apos;re entering a new stage of biology , designing and synthesizing life .
We &apos;ve always tried to ask big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; It &apos;s something many biologists , I think they tried to figure out out out the layers .
We tried different approaches , and reducing it to the minimum .
We &apos;re looking for for 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the analog world &apos;s biology to the digital world .
Now we &apos;re asking us : can we regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome , which can be the species in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit more small .
We can get a hundred genes of the genes of the about 500 that are here .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our own .
I think , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes we can eliminate , one at the time , it &apos;s very unlikely to bring this can bring into a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to design was synthesizing this chromosome in a way that we could change the components to take some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of the &quot; We can synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Can you make the chemistry consentence to produce these big molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create before ?
And in case , we can make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemicals .
The speed that we &apos;re able to digitize life is growing up to exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , it &apos;s getting a pretty slowly , but it &apos;s improving .
And our most recent results the results on a exponential curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process require a lot of passages , starting with a bioethical review before the first experiments .
But we found that we synthesize of DNA is very hard .
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that producing small segments of DNA , the long length of 30 50 letters and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the more mistakes there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these fragments and correct the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , to start from digital information from the Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a small virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , actually did the courage of the mistakes and get a DNA molecule about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemicals that piece of inert , and we put it in the bacteria , they have started to read this genetic code and to make the viral particles .
The virals in the particles were then released by cells , they &apos;re back and they &apos;re destroying the E.
I talked about a recently with members of the oil industry and say that they were , they certainly understood this model .
They have more of you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build his own hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the bigger things .
We wanted to build the whole chromosome of the bacteria .
I &apos;m more than 580 thousand genetic code .
So we thought we were going to build it in cassette of the size of the virus , so that we can change the cassets of a living .
The design is critical , and if we start with information in a computer , these need to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard accuracy was a mistake for every 10 mies .
We found , resequencing it , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence we &apos;d never been able to do it .
One part of the process is to design segments for long 50 letters that overwhelming with all the other segments of 50 letters to build smaller underounthin 50 letters to build smaller underounthin the way ,
We try to put together together .
Probably you &apos;ve been reading that we put the flourishing .
Think about this : we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters together about 20 amminds , and there &apos;s a specific order of letters , for every amminoacids .
So we can use the genetic code to write , frasases , frasases , thoughts .
What we did at the beginning was authographic .
Some people were delused to do it , which wasn &apos;t poem .
We designed these segments to be able to just join with enzyme .
There are many people that are related to them and put them together .
And we started to assemble of the parts , starting with the parts of five to seven mix them , and unendles , so that we can form segments of 24 mies to them up to make the mokes .
At every step we made these segments that are made in abundance so we could sequence it because we &apos;re trying to create a very roomhhhhhhaside .
We &apos;re looking for automatize the process .
So , this looks like the tellon of a basket .
When we get these very long segments , more than 100 thousand basis , more than 100 thousand basis , it &apos;s not going to grow directly in the E.
You get to the modern limit of the modern biology .
So we looked at some of the other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called the homological receive rewards that in biology is used to repair the DNA that can join the DNA that can join together .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism called Deinococcus , which is a three-million rad rad of radiation .
You can see in the upper riquense like his chromosome is destroy .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s just like it was before .
There &apos;s thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms you can be completely dry .
They can live under a vacuum .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life exist in space , and you can get to get new environments of water .
Actually , NASA has shown that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built using these processes , just using the yeast with the plot segments that we &apos;ve made segments .
The yeast evelated them .
This picture was not taken with a microscope .
It &apos;s a so big molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that they cover a time of six seconds .
This is the publishing that we did a little time .
I &apos;m more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the largest molecule that has ever created by the man .
It has a 30-foot molecular .
If we &apos;re going to do with a 10 without spacecraft , we would take 142 pages to spend this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ? How can we deal with it ?
Of course , you &apos;re going to a virus is a game .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s simpler even when it &apos;s about eucarial cells like our : you just get the nuclear and put another one , which is basically the process of cloning .
In the archaea bacterium , but we &apos;ve been recently demonstrate that we &apos;re able to do a complete trapion that we &apos;re able to do a complete trapion of a cell trapion from one cell to another and to activary it .
We clean a chromosome from a kind of a microbial cromosome .
The two are different than the men from rats .
We add some gene in a way that we could decide what to choose for this chromosome .
And then it skip with the enzymes so that they kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was astonishing -- and you can get our synakes our sophisticated graphicoic -- the new chromosome is gone into the cell .
And we were thinking that we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to get there .
This is one of the major mechanisms .
We found that a tantissim , they add a second or a third chromosome somewhere , add a second thousands of new traits to that species .
So who think about evolution as a single gene at the time you change has no longer understand the biology .
There are enzymes called the restrition enzymes that even digital that we can actually make the DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell , you &apos;re not going to do one .
The cell phone -- the chromosome we put it up .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other chromosome as a material , it &apos;s masticated it , and we found with only the cell and the chromosome .
it &apos;s gone blue because of the genes that we put .
And in a short short amount of time , all the feature of a species , they went lost , and it turned into the whole new software that we put into a new species , based on the new software that we put the cell .
All the proteins have changed , the members have changed , and when we read the genetic code exactly the genetic code exactly what we moved to .
Now , this may seem to be a genetic alchemy , but by by allowing the DNA , we can change things in a substantial way .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that here is not about -- but of progress from three million years and a half years of evolution , and I &apos;ve already said that maybe we &apos;re to create a new version of the Cambriana in which they &apos;re going to be able species that will be create new species based on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty obvious when we think about our need .
We &apos;re going to spend six billion and a half billion people in 9 billion in the next 40 years .
Right to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one in 1946 ; 40 years , there &apos;s going to be four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medicine for six billion and gas for six billion and gas .
It &apos;s going to be even more hard to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion coal-coal , more than 30 billion barrels .
That means 100 million barrels a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to repeat them , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
We have to keep all the CO2 emission from these materials that end up in the atmosphere .
In the day , because of the scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the design future .
The electronic industry has only a dozen about a dozen of components , and think of different things were coming out .
Our limits here are data that &apos;s principle of the biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have some techniques , thank these methods of synthesizing , so we can create what we call a combinatory .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think about how to processing these 20 million different genes or to try to optimize the processes to produce cover , vaccines , we can change , thank you very small team , and create more molecular biology than in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemical production or chemical vaccines .
This is a few software instantanem of some software programmed that we &apos;re working on to be able to sit and design species at computers .
Well , we don &apos;t necessarily know how they &apos;re going to be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
We &apos;re focusing on the fourth generation .
You &apos;ve seen you also saw that extract ethanol from the wheat was an experiment .
We have depending on the third generation that will be used enough to be in the sugar coal , which is that will be used to be more high-speed kind of butanle like the doctor or or different kinds of butanle .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increasing the cost of the food and limbs the cost of the available available to turn CO2 into the first amount of matter , so we &apos;re working to design cells that can achieve this purpose , and we can achieve the first quarter generation in about 18 months .
The solar light combined with CO2 is a metodo--- but in our discoveries in all over the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism we described in 1996 .
It &apos;s living in the deep ocean , about 2,500 feet of the deep to the water .
It creates metane by CO2 using molecular hydrogen as a source of energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can incanalate CO2 , which can easily be transported by tubbbbes , converting that CO2 in fuel , to drive this process .
So we think we might be able to be able to increase what the question of what life is &quot; is what life is &quot; is we , versus the bound goal to repeat the entire oil industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can &apos;t do it from TED ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And we &apos;re working on the way we &apos;re working on the metods to create instantanei .
You saw this year with flu , we &apos;re always forth of a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s about finding the right vaccine .
I think it can change that &apos;s building combinable vaccine in anticius .
That &apos;s how the future might start to look change , right now , the tree of evolution , accellating evolution with synthetical bacteria , archei , and finally cells .
We &apos;re so much to improve people .
Our purpose is to make a living way to try to make it a living . Thank you very much .
I &apos;m going to show you , the flip possible , some fundamental work , the new technology that we took the Microsoft in follow , to a little bit of a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s a environment where you can interact is local level that you can repeat the level of data .
We &apos;re seeing a lot of digital of pictures digital photograph with a kind of digital photograph with a kind of a very quick , for a very quickly panoric , we have disappearing .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much the amount of information that we see , how big these cops are collected of data or the images .
Most of them are common photographs , but this for example , is a scanning that &apos;s from the Library of Congress , and it comes into the gamma .
It doesn &apos;t make a difference because the only thing that limits the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen at any time . It &apos;s a very flessible architecture .
This is a book , for example of not data .
This is the Dickens . Every represents a chronic hit .
To show you that it &apos;s just about text and not of the images , we can do something like that , to really show you that &apos;s a real representation of the textbook , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a little piece of electronic book .
I didn &apos;t do it .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s a number of The Guardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a section .
And really gives you the pleasure and the good experience to read the real carpet , or a daily review , which is for nature a multiple type of a half of a type of half .
We also did something with the corner of this number in particular number of The Guardian .
We created a bunch of high-resolution resolution -- much higher than what you use in a normal publishing -- and we put you in the content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see it .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the space limits of space on the screen .
I hope that it &apos;s going to be the people who were up and to some kind of the people , I didn &apos;t have to be necessary .
Of course , maps is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say we have a contribution to do this field .
These are all the roads in the United States above a geospatial image of NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually from the wellow ; you can go and see it .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , who &apos;s two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research at the very interesting computer that we did from Noah Snavely , a student of Washington , with the help of Steve Seadrolling of Microsoft Rick Szelki of Microsoft Research . A great collaboration .
And it &apos;s from live on the Web , I &apos;m going to go from Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from one image to the other and have this kind of experience of multiple resolution .
But the spacecraft of the images here is actually a meaning .
The algorithms of the computer algorithms have recorded these pictures together , so that they correspond to the real places that they imagine -- all the little bit of the time -- all of the scapes in Montagne . So you see the elements of a slip slip show , and these things are all of a sli-show show or Maring scenic shot .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;m going to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more space .
I &apos;m going to go directly to one of the original set of Noahnaking data set from a previous prototynth of the first time we &apos;ve done this work for the first time , the last summer -- to show you what I think is really the key behind this technology , Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily obvious by looking at the environments that we put in the website .
We had to worry about the legal aspects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of Nothreat to the Nothrethreat to do . Baucucuch Nobody Dame Flickr , and you get images of types in shshoot , other campus and so on . One of these boundaries , and so on . One of these bags , and so on .
So they &apos;re all images made by Flickr and they were all connected to the space level in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this very simple .
You know , I would never think I would have never been going to work for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifically to get this kind of accounting here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of phones that are in SLR , a significant number of those professional professional , a significant number , put together in this environment .
And if I can try it , I try to try and look at the more strangle .
Many blocks , etc .
Somewhere here &apos;s a series of photographs -- there &apos;s a series of photographs -- there .
This is a poster of Nothreat Dame is recorded .
We can go from the physics to the physical of this environment .
The essential is that we can do things with the social environment . This is now taking data from the whole collective memory of how it looks like the earth , from the visual point of visual view -- and connects to all that data together .
All those pictures are become connected , larger than the sum of the parts .
You have a model of the entire land that emerges .
Think about this as the prolungment of Stephen Lawler &apos;s work .
It &apos;s something that is growing in complexity as people are using it , and the whose advantages for the useful people to use it .
Their pictures are married with metaphed metaphed by other people .
If you get somebody is the idea of contrast all these sets , and I said , my photograph of the cattle of Nothing three Dsuddenly visly , he would be able to use it as ingress , and I can use it as a point of ingress for diving me in the space , in that metaphor , using the pictures of the other cross-mooth and cross-user .
Of course , a consequence of all this is very very elaborate models of every interesting part of the earth , you &apos;re not only having seen airplanes and satellite images and similar , but from the collective memory .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I realized what your software software will be done to do is that at a certain point in the next few years , all the time , all the photographs are all the world will be quite quite connected ?
BAA : Yes . What is doing is actually to find .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you &apos;re like , in the images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the basis of the contents .
And it becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of seant information that a lot of these pictures have .
As you do a research of the Web , you get a sentence and the text on the Web page is a bunch of information about the pictures .
Now , what happens if that picture is connected to all your photos ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of wealth that comes from it is really huge . It &apos;s a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise is really incredible . It &apos;s really incredible .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure when you traveling and one of the etnographers , is the way to live between who have no forgotten the antic traditions , among the workers in the wind , it touch in the wind , it is in the wind , it is in the raining leaving , the leaves in the leaves of the hatred plants .
I think that the Jaguar Jaguar , they still travel the Via Lattea , or that the Inuit &apos;s still , in fact , in Himalayas , the budget in Himalaya , the budgets , and they follow the central importance of anthropology , and the idea that the world we live in no solved in sense , but it &apos;s just a model of reality , but it &apos;s a reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stirply has done , well or bad , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential traits .
We all come . We all proat .
We &apos;re strangered to start .
We have to deal with the death of , so we &apos;re not surprising to us to sing and we whales --
We all have an art .
What it hits is the particular rhythm of the song , the dance of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that they &apos;re the forests of the forests of the forests in the Borneo &apos;s Borneo , or the following Kaithorders in Kenya , the Curander in Kenya , the Curander , or a cammeler in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my company company in the desert a month ago , or a yak trainer in the Kyak in Qomolangma , on Mt , MMt Mt , Mr. Everest , the world &apos;s deaths .
All these populations are teaching us that there are other ways of being able to think , other ways of moving in the world .
And , if you think a moment , it &apos;s a concept that it can give you hope .
Teme , the treme , the world &apos;s remarkable to be a spiritual , and cultural , that &apos;s going to start the planet and it &apos;s important to the planet , so it &apos;s important for the planet , as biososphere .
And you can think of this cultural spill a nosphere and you can call the etnosphere and you can call the etnosphere the total of all the concepts , dreams , mits , inspirations , intuition that you can be from the imagination of the knowledge .
The ethnosphere is the great patrimony of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how polite species .
And because biosphere was very very much of the way it happened to the ethnosphere and much more rapidly .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all the species is , or is on the horric aside , because it &apos;s a fake , or -- in the most apocaly -- in the field of biological diversity -- and you don &apos;t even get close to the most optimistic hypothesis -- that of cultural diversity .
It &apos;s all of this is , of course , the language loss .
When you &apos;re born 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not composed to only a vocabulary or a series of rules .
One language is the spraking of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle that the soul of every culture comes in in the world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a kick , a thought , a pystem of spiritual possibilities .
And of those 6,000 languages , while we &apos;re sitting here in Monterey , at least half not being sussurrounded in the ears of the children .
They &apos;re not teached to children , which means , unless than less than we have a dying , which is already dead .
What is more sad than you &apos;re going to be in the silence , of the last to talk about a language , the last few people who don &apos;t have to transmit the wisdom of the good or anticipate the promise of the children ?
This is a few people in some of the world every two weeks . every two weeks . every two weeks . Each two weeks . every two weeks , every old old tle and brands of a language .
And I know somebody who will say , &quot; Is it better like that ?
The world wouldn &apos;t be a better place if we were going to let all talk about yoruba . We all talk yoruba . We &apos;re all yoruba .
We talk about kogi .
You &apos;ll cat a sudden what it means we can &apos;t talk about their language .
I &apos;d like to do a journey through the etnosphere --
a little trip in the etnosphere to give you a assage of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I say &quot; different ways of existing ways of existing . &quot; I really want to be different ways of existing .
Let &apos;s take a look for example , this Barasana , in Amazon sector , the people of the anaconda , who creds in the west of the West in the west &apos;s breakthrough the west &apos;s river &apos;s the sacred panish &apos;s .
It &apos;s a people who can &apos;t tell the blue color from green because the blue color from green because the time celests has identified in the forest time that it depends the people .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rule , and they said exogamia . &quot; &quot; &quot; You have to marry a person who &apos;s talking a different language .
Everything has roots in the mitological past , but the particularly the particularly , in these families , and then they &apos;re talking about six or seven languages because of a language marriage .
They &apos;re just listening to and then start to talk .
We take one of the most interesting tribe that I lived , the Waorans of Ecuador , a incredible people who had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionary , they tried a contact error .
They took them down the photographs that were retrated in the poses that were very friendship , forest that this people had never seen anything about bi-dimensional .
They &apos;ve been taken from the earth , they turned to the research of a form or a shape and , not by found anything , they &apos;ve got concluse that they were the diavily treated that the hell , and they killed the five missionary .
But the Waorans didn &apos;t just kill the foreigers .
They killed between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We were saved to eight generations and we found two of natural death , and when we &apos;ve been put to know , they admitted that one of them was invested that they were invited , and then they killed him him . Athern n &apos;t incredible .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal , that &apos;s a 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned a really interesting task when my professor of Harvard asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti in my work with my my work in a secret secret to the basis of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes , and I imposes of the poison to do the homes .
To make sense of a miraculous , I should have have to understand Voodoo culture and the Voodoo is not magic .
It &apos;s pretty a complex metaphorrified in the world .
Very interesting .
If I asked you to ask the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christianity , Islam , Good , Good , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no faith . And instead of , and it &apos;s not true . And instead , it &apos;s not the distilled to these religious concepts of these religious concepts of nates in the tragic diaspora slaveous .
What &apos;s interesting is that voodoo is the intense relationship between life and death .
So , you live in the bees .
The spirits can be invocated by the Great According to the rhythm of the dance and they replaced time to the living way that for a short active active active active . It &apos;s a bribe that they can become the god .
So , this is what &apos;s like , &quot; You know , you &apos;re going to talk about God .
We give us to the theme and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment that you &apos;re sitting , is the spirit that drives you , how can you do you make you bad ?
So you &apos;re seeing these incredible events . They follow voodoo or station of trance that touch , they touch infueled a rather powerful demonstration of the body when it &apos;s catalyzed in a state of extremely excitation .
I give you all the people that I lived the most extraordinary people are Kogi Cambos . Santa Marta de , in the Colombia security .
And they had to be in the tyranged that once lived on the caraiban planes of Colombia in waiting for the border , the people would retreat the people would retreat on the paralleaf that would be a carbaithian that would be a carried plant .
In a macchipped of blood , this people had never been conquered by the spagnoled .
But I &apos;m now now now being governated by a clero , but their formation is quite extraordinary .
The young people are taken away from families to three or four years , and live secrets in a world of good and shading in a world of stone who were at the bottom of the stone of the payoff the base of the 18 years .
Two periods of nine years I was proposed to reproduce the nine months of gestation that they spend in the user , now they &apos;re metaphor in the Grede , now .
For all this time , they &apos;re accultured to their society , values that are predicting that their prayers and only their prayers the prayers , they keep the balance -- or to say the expense -- or to say the ecological balance .
And then the term of this incredible start , and suddenly they &apos;re brought out and for the first time to life , at the age of 18 , they see a dawn . And in that moment of awareness , when the sun kissing the sun kissing the beautiful valuable valuable , when the splendor . The pret is a step back , and it says , &quot;
&quot; Go ? Right ? I &apos;m like I said .
It &apos;s amazing . Now it &apos;s now to you . &quot;
They call a big brothers and say that we , the rings of the world &apos;s destruction .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the indigenous populations and invoke Roussex , and the old history of the selvage , which is a razes in its simplicity or maybe invoke Thoreau and we say that these people are closer to the Earth of us .
The Indies are not the un-sensitive people are not feelings from nostaly .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the malarial paluds of the Asmat jealids of Tibet , but thank you for the time and rituals , they created a mystical mystical of the Earth is not about a confident , but on a weller intuition of it , but it &apos;s a sense of human awareness .
What does that mean ?
It means that a kid in Ande who &apos;s growing up creating the mountain or the mountain is a bunch of Apspirit will be a human deeply different , and it &apos;s going to have a very different relationship with the mountain or that you can have a very different with the mountain or that place that we &apos;re rising a mountain or that mountain of the rocks are ready to be a rock .
which is a spirit or a mineral or a mineral caught .
What &apos;s interesting is metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia Britannics , believing that forests were sent to be cut .
And that I have a different one of my friends . Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the forests of Hukukukukukukukukukukukug and the downnnnnnn-by-lived , spirits that we &apos;re facing in the Hukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukuk-.
If you start to think that these cultures can actually create different reality , you can start to understand some of them feeling that we can start to understand some of them feeling . We make this plant .
I took this picture to open up in the nordocorle Amazon nordocmental Amazon .
Some of you heard about the ayahuasca , the most powerful psychoactive .
What makes the ayahuascinating the ayahuasks is not the drug potential , but his elaboration . It &apos;s called two elements .
On one side , this legning legning that has a bunch of beta-coal series , harmoline , slightly hallucinogen , slightly hallucinogen , a bunch of hallucinogen , a blegning badly .
And by by by by by by by by the only plant , which alter a little bit of consciousness , but it put with the leaving leaving the leaving of a caffee family &apos;s called Psychotry is .
This plant contains powerful powerful , very similar to the serious , very similar to the serotonin , dimethyptamine .
If you ever see the Yanomami pull on the nose of the nose , the substance that they do from a different set of species , it has methydimethylyptamins .
Tell that &apos;s a little bit of the nose is a little bit of how to be gone from a bumbble bank and landing on a sea sea .
I often have to my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who had been shot the psycheaper , with his discovery of fungi in Mexico discovery in Mexico .
In my thesis , you can &apos;t be able to class these trippptamins , because if you did not tell anybody to be hallucined . &#91; Risate The tripamine tripamine , but they can &apos;t be abunte because they &apos;re denied by an enzyme , you &apos;re actually in the intestine , depressed monthor-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-
It &apos;s possible to absumerely if you absores with other chemicals that would be MAO .
Now it &apos;s the beautiful : the Tibeta-co-co-free , are injury , they injury , the same kind of need to potentially potentially potentially have the tripps . The question is a spontaneous fer of the plants , like these people who are in a two-defologically not similar , but that if you combine in this way , we create a biochemical version that are , you know , but if you combine in the sum of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the
We use the big euuuugly of the evidence and the mistake , which can be infruttifer .
But if you ask Indians , we &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re the Indians , &quot; We &apos;re the Indians . &quot; We &apos;re the people to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Copan , has 17 variety of ayhuasca , who will tell their eyes would come into the forest , and that at our eyes would come into the same species .
If we ask him how they stbipped their toxes will say , &quot; I thought , &quot; I &apos;d say , &quot; I thought , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take 17 variety in a night of moon every night of the fills and each other .
So , you don &apos;t have a Harvard at Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than to count the stami .
Now , &#91; applausers &#93; the problem is that even those of us who have to heart people at heart people have painting to be pitted to the history of our real world , and it &apos;s going to go beyond .
In fact , the 21st century , in 300 years , it &apos;s not going to be remembered to his technology , but rather like the one was we stopped and enabled to embraced the mass destruction of the biological diversity and cultural diversity of biological diversity and cultural diversity of biological diversity and cultural diversity of biological diversity and cultural diversity of biological diversity and cultural diversity of biological diversity and cultural diversity .
All the cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibilities .
And the problem isn &apos;t the technology .
The Soux Indians Six &#93; they have no stopped to be Six when they put up on the arm , as American American people have no stop being American when they put on the horse and hot .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that threatening the integrity of ethnosphere . It &apos;s the power .
The hard hard to do .
And if you look at the world , I &apos;m going to find that these are not cultures .
They &apos;re living and spiny creatures that are living and dynamics out of identificable to come beyond their adaptation .
It &apos;s a disboscampaign in the Penan --
a nomad , a nomad in in the Southeast East , a people who lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to the next reduced and the prostitution of the rights , where you can see the river river river , where you can see the river river of the rights , where you can see the river of the horizon , where the nabapapse to the horizon , where the horizon , where the horizon , and the horizon , and the horizon , and the horizon , and the horizernaptional the horizon , where you can see the horizon ,
ready to fill the designs with the soth wood .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that have come with the discovery of the gold .
If we &apos;re going to go on the mountains where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the hard hard to see the blocks of the political domination .
As you know the genocide , the extinction of a people , is convicted to universal level , but the ethnic destruction of the style of a people , not only is to be celebrated in a people , not only is not constyle , but even celebrated in certain certain environments , because it &apos;s part of the development strategy .
And you can &apos;t understand the Tibet until you first get part of the Tibet until you go from the beginning .
I &apos;ve been the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in the Western China through Western Tibet , coming to Lhasa young connection , but only came to Lhasa young connection , but only came to Lhaking .
6,000 sacred reduced monuments in the powder and we &apos;re going to do .
1.2 million people killed by the military during the Cultural Revolution .
The dad of this guy was ascriteria in the Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed to the time of Chinese invasion .
His uncle at Santity , in Santity , during the diaspora that led to Nepal .
His mother was imprisoned and his blame was rich .
It was brought to hide in caring at the age of two birth of two years , he was born under his gonna because he could not live without him .
The sister , who did the same , was put in in the field of reduced reduced .
A day he reverted a hot Mao and , for this transgression , it was put in forced to the transgression , it was put to the forced for seven years .
The Pain of Tibet can be insopportaable , but the insent ineven-in-the-people is tener .
It &apos;s all all of it reduces a choice .
We want to live in the world &apos;s monocromatic or , or do we want to get the policeman world of diversity ?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he died he said that his greatest fear was that , in our greatest view of the world , we &apos;re not just going to see the whole gamma of the human imagination is reduced to a limited modality of thinking , but one day we &apos;re going to wake up with a sleep to performing until there were other possibilities .
And it &apos;s humiliating that our species is there for 600,000 years .
The Neolitica , who gave us agriculture , who gave us agriculture , who had us socking to the seed , replacing the poetry of the ski with the poetry of specialization , and we &apos;re talking about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has to be 300 years .
That shared history , I don &apos;t suggests that we have to all the challenges that we &apos;re going to deal with in the millennia .
When these miriades of the world are asked what they want to say to be human , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all return the ability to be what we are : a conscious species , that has to make all the people and the gardens can fix . And there &apos;s big moments of optimism .
I took this picture on the north of the island of Baffin , when I went to hung with Inuit , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , and he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The Canadese government wasn &apos;t always gentile with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to stabilize our supremate , we have them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refused to go .
The family , theme for his life , he brought him all the weapons , and all his equipment .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t feel the cold , they exploit .
The patters of the origin were made of fish in origin in skin .
The grandfather of this man didn &apos;t put out from night or the arctic or the clock that was going to sufficious .
It &apos;s been standing , he hhhhot the pantalones in the foca and defected in their hand . When I did the frozen them are frozen , and working on the splplplan .
He &apos;s spraying salive on the punch of this cholder , and when I became solid , he killed a dog .
He shake the dog and created a bright , with the torate chacecraisa sled , he enliked another dog and it &apos;s disappeared to the banking , the crow &apos;s bank , the cockroach of .
We want to talk about horarsely with nothing ? &#91; We want to look at the horses . &#93; And this , in different ways , &#91; Applusers &#93; is the symbol of the world &apos;s Inuit and of all the world &apos;s world .
In the opening , 1999 , the Canadian government reated to Inuit , the total control area of a larger area of California and Texas together .
It &apos;s their new patha . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s an independent land . They all the minerary resources .
One is a beautiful example of how a natione-state can re-re-up with his people .
And , finally , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious to be at least as I think that they &apos;re in these remote areas of the planet , I realized they &apos;re not remote .
For somebody is home .
They &apos;re presenting sections of the human imagination that are coming in at the time . And for us all of these children , dreams of these children , as the dreams of our children , they become part of the geography of hope .
Finally , we of National Geographic , we are convinced that politicians will never come to anything .
We believe that polemics --
&#91; Applausers &#93; are not persuasive , but we think stories can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the best institution to tell the world stories . Every month our website has to tell the stories of the world . Every month our rise .
156 countries transmit &apos;s transmitted our television .
Our magazines are lets of millions of people .
Our work is traveling into the ethnosion to bring our audience in places of cultural , where they &apos;re going to go away from how they &apos;re going to be abbracing for time , for a central reveal , the world will be the central to reveal a life in a pluralist and we have to find a lifestyle in a world and multicultualist , and we have to find a life in a world of life in a pluralist and multicket to find a liver in a world in a life in a world in a world in a life in a world in a
where all the people &apos;s wisdom of all the people can contribute to our collective well-being .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope is going to call some links , and I &apos;m going to try to show you some connected , in case you don &apos;t notice .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the officer dogma . &quot;
The officer of what ?
The officer of all the Western industrial society . The dogma officer , &quot; If we want to maximize the well-being of our citizens &quot; &quot; The way to do it is male the individual freedom . &quot;
The reason is , on the side , in fact that the freedom is itself a value , is precious , useful , essential for human beings .
On the other one is in fact that if we are free , each of us can act to do everything that massimize our well-being , no one of that we had no one decide in our well-being , no one of them deciding in our well-being , no one of them decide in our well-being , no one of us decide in our well-being , and so that if we &apos;re free , all the people can be able to do everything that that we have to do everything that we have in our
The way to male freedom is male to male freedom .
The more choices choices people , more are free , and the largest is their freedom , the greater is their well-being .
This , I think , it &apos;s so deeply roomed in the society that nobody would have to be a doubt .
And it &apos;s also deeply roadiced in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress is possible .
That &apos;s my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m going to allow me a simple note about the standing standing .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without counting the 10 variety of oil , and 12 of the balloons that you can buy for a huge number of condition in the circumstance in the circumstance that nobody &apos;s 175 .
That &apos;s what the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic store to buy a stereo : cash , CD letter , radio , plash , bulletter .
And in this single store , there &apos;s a big deal . There &apos;s a big audio components .
We can do six million different combinations using the components that there are in a only store .
You have to put that there &apos;s a lot of choice .
Other fields : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a kid , they could get all the telephones that were widely telephone services , at the stage that were provided .
It was nolegg the phone , you didn &apos;t buy it .
One of the consequence of that , in the other , was that the phone never made .
These times are gone .
We have now a nearly limited variety of phones , especially among the cell phones .
Here &apos;s cell phones .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , cutting them them on the nose , and forth to the nose for crumble .
If you haven &apos;t seen it still seen in the store under house , you &apos;re very well certain that I will come .
And what happens is that people come in in the store and they &apos;re doing this question . And what is the answer ? The answer is &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the acquished blocks .
Assistence : It doesn &apos;t happen in the United States that you go to the United States that you go to the doctor and say what you have to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; Okay , we could do A , or B , &quot; We could do it , and &quot; Be &quot; B has these benefits . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Doctor , what would I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A has these benefits , and B has these benefits , and B has these benefits . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebesides , &quot; Doctor if you were , what would do you do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result we call it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
But actually , it &apos;s not that a weight and the responsibility of making decisions from somebody knows something , which is the doctor , to someone else I don &apos;t know -- and almost certainly is sick -- and it &apos;s not a matter of course , it &apos;s sick -- and it &apos;s not in the ideal condition to make a patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing of products of drugs , directed to people like me and you , who if you think about it doesn &apos;t make any sense , because we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why do we advertitile ?
The answer is that they want you to call the doctor to require them .
Something that &apos;s so fundamental as our orphanthial , is a question of , how you see in this vignity . &quot; We don &apos;t want to force the children . I &apos;m going to do not stop at the right moment , &quot; We have to invent it .
And we can reinvent us how many times you go .
That means that every morning , in the morning , you have to decide that kind of person want to be .
I &apos;m going to the family and a matririmonum , a time time , the common perspective , almost for anyone , was that married the most soon you could , and you start to get the most soon possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not even what to do after .
I &apos;m doing it , it &apos;s really going to play .
I teach them to very smart students , and I &apos;m going to do them 20 percent in less of work than a time .
And not because they &apos;re not bright , not because they &apos;re not very brilliant .
But why are I imposing , you know , &quot; should be asking , &quot; Should I do do it , or do I do that now ? &quot;
&quot; Should I get away ? I have to think before children , or the career ? &quot;
They &apos;re logorous interrogation .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this is not complete the homework that I teach and not get a great voice to my exame .
And they really have to do it . They &apos;re important questions .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , like Carl underground , because we can work every minute , every day , every day , every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from the planet , except that from Hotel Randolph .
In the parentthesis , there &apos;s a corner , and I &apos;m not going to tell anybody what the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t say that , because I want to use me .
What does this incredible freedom of choice we have about the work ? It &apos;s that we have to continuously decide , at every time , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing hot , with the mobile phone in a pocket , Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , tively , on the knees .
And even though I &apos;m all spending , every minute that we see our son rovating the game , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; I have to answer this call ? &quot;
I have to answer this email ? I have to email this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , no , all this makes the experience of your son very different than the game .
So , anywhere we look at , small things , things , and the materials and lifestyle , life is a question of choices .
And once the world was this : That &apos;s one , you know , there were some possibilities , but it wasn &apos;t a question of that .
The world today &apos;s world looks like this : The world is , &quot; or something positive , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is . It &apos;s a lot of it .
The positive layers we know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative .
All this choice is two negative effects of these two negative effects of people .
The first one , paradoxally , is that produced paralysis that instead of liberation .
With many options between which choose , it becomes very difficult .
I give you a significant example : a study of the volunteer plans .
A colleague had access to the data of Vanguard data , the giant company , with about a million customers in about 2,000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of adhhhhot , the percentage of adhhhits .
With 50 per per per per per pocket , there &apos;s 10 percent in less than we have been available to when they &apos;re only five . Why ?
Because with 50 sources of which choose , is hardly difficult to decide , and choice is replaced to the back to the back .
And tomorrow , and tomorrow , tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course tomorrow &apos;s never coming .
You know , you know , it doesn &apos;t just mean that these guys are going to be a good good time , they &apos;re going to say that the decision is so that they lose the complex sources of the work that they lose the complex datables of work .
Not participating , they &apos;re losing until five dollars a year from the work dator dator , that would be well-disposed to come .
So the parallege is a consequence of the tropes .
And I think that makes the world .
&quot; And finally , for the ethernity : ketchup , maionese send ? &quot;
Would you like to make the right decision , if it &apos;s for the ethnicity , isn &apos;t it ?
You don &apos;t want to pick the wrong wrong , and yet the condition .
So this is the first effect . The second one is that if we can avoid the parallel and do choice , at the end we &apos;re less satissssatisssent in .
And this for several reasons .
One of them is that with a lot of conditions between which choose , if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy , to imagine you could have a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us will be better . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us that &apos;s reavated by the decision , and the decreation reaved by the decision , and the reaching , and it &apos;s not perfect .
even when it was a good decision .
The more choices there are , easier to displeasure any detail that is unsatisfaction of the option .
And there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has clared very well , how we give things that we give things to things that we compare .
All right , when there are many options , it &apos;s easy to represent the characteristics of the option of the option that you have to be a very satisfied .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m sorry with everybody who are not in New York .
But that &apos;s what you would probably think .
There &apos;s this couple of the Hamptons .
A luxury .
Splense . Ottune . Otma day . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not going to be , but what he &apos;s thinking is , &quot; Well , dumped , it &apos;s August . &quot;
&quot; Everybody my neighbors in Manhattan are away . &quot;
&quot; I could park right in front of the house . &quot;
And it goes to two weeks that &apos;s losing -- every day -- the ability to parking -- every day -- the ability to park where she wants .
costo-opportunity , un-decreatures , even when the choice was excellent .
And the more are the options that we have to think , the more attractive acts are going to be going to be able to be constitute to be able to be able to be able to be constitute , are the more of the options we &apos;re going to think about , the more the actual feature that we have to be able to think that we &apos;re going to think about , the most of the options that we have to be considered ,
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a little bit of it says a lot .
It &apos;s about the moment , and maybe of the living slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you choose , you choose to not do the other .
The things that we don &apos;t choose many attractive attractive that can make less attractive what we do .
Three point : the growing of the expectation .
I tried it on my skin bought a new jeans .
I &apos;m almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were one , they bought and clothing that they were bought , and they were disagreed , just after they took them a life and washed a lot of times , they started to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple of jeans , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cutting . &quot;
And the committer said , &quot; You want a slim , do you want to do it slim ? &quot;
Do you want to do it , or with the buttons ? &quot; Stonewashed &quot; or &quot; acidnicle &quot;
&quot; Do you want to be a struggle ? &quot;
&quot; And they want to cover ? Bla bbbbbbbbbble ... &quot; Continupright .
I was unfortunately , and after a little bit I could say , &quot; I want the guy that was the only guy , &quot; he was the only guy , &quot; he was a guy , &quot; He had no idea what it was , so for a hour , I came out of the jeans that I had ever .
It was the most . I had the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse is that all my choice was that all my own expectations were high , jeans had to be perfect .
I was very much expected . I didn &apos;t expect anything that exceptional when there was a kind of them , but when I saw 100 different , at least a kind of , at least a kind of be perfect .
What I bought was , but not perfect .
After I was going to have chosen with what I was really inssatisfacted to the expectations .
The addition of options in the life of people don &apos;t do that to increase the expect these are respect to the excellence of the options themselves .
And this will be less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
No one in the world of marketing if I realized .
Because if they knew it , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth looks more like this .
&quot; He was better when you were worse , &quot; The reason he was better when you were worse is that when you were worse was still able to meet some pleasant surprises .
In the world that we live in -- opulent , in the world that we live in -- opulent citizens with the expectation -- the very most we can hope is that things are at the height of the expectation .
You never surprised to be pleased because your expectations , my expectations , they &apos;ve ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Besprint &quot; Yes , &quot; You want it . &quot;
I mean , small authographical moment -- that I really &apos;m married and my wife is really beautiful .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t contented .
But it &apos;s not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of the jeans , when there &apos;s all the kind of jeans is that when you &apos;re not satisfied , and you ask , &quot; Why ? &quot;
Who is responsible ? &quot; The answer is clear .
The world is the responsible . What would I do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a inssatisfaction , and you ask you who is the responsible , it &apos;s just close to the responsible , it &apos;s just close that responsible you .
You could have done better .
With hundreds of variety available , there are no excuse for the insuccess .
So when people do decisions , even though the result is valido , you feel unsatisfigured and give the blame .
In the last few years , depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only , but important -- of this honey of depression is that people have deludent experiences because standard are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation , they think the blame is ,
So the result is that we &apos;re better in general , we &apos;re better , subtitional , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the officer dogma , what we all get to good and it &apos;s completely unrelevant . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit of choice , and it &apos;s better than having all that , but that &apos;s a lot better choice .
There &apos;s a magical value , I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve overcome from a piece of the level where the choices are improved our life .
Now , from a political point of view -- I almost finished from the political standpoint of political view , the following is the following .
What it allows all this whole choice in the industrial society is wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know pareks , where the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is they have too too pocasian .
So , the next thing I &apos;m talking about is a malaise that I &apos;m talking about is a damn society .
And what it does , and angry and angry is this : Steve Levitt spoke about yesterday , how those expensive and uncomfortable seats are useless . It &apos;s a money spspread of money .
I mean these choices , complicated and dependious , it &apos;s not that they &apos;re just useless .
I &apos;m in a deleterie .
They &apos;re doing worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows a lot of choice to be reversed in those where people have too few chance , it &apos;s not just their life to improve but our .
That &apos;s what economists call a lot of improvement .
A redistribution of the income redistribution of the redistribution of this , excess that it &apos;s going to be done .
To end , you can become everything you want . &quot;
You , people of culture , you &apos;ll think , &quot; What does that fish do you think ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t get anything in a shocch of glass . &quot;
&quot; A castrate imagination , a limited view of the world -- &quot;
and I &apos;m interpreted with this way , in the beginning .
But then , I realized , instead , I realized that that the fish knows the long knows that that the fish knows the long .
Because the reality is that if you &apos;re missing in frantumes , so that you can &apos;t have freedom . You can &apos;t &apos;t get the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you break the bank in a way that everything is divents could decreation satisfaction .
You accept the paralysis , and you reduce the well-being .
Everyone needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too strictly too strict , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of some symbolic sphere is a recipe for the inhappiness and I &apos;m going to do it for the rovine .
Thank you very much .
