I &apos;ve got to show these two two two , which is the abababables , which is almost three million years of the 48 , which has had the size of 48 , the United States , it &apos;s requires , is requires , it &apos;s requires , which is requires to be requires .
And that &apos;s the dangaly of the problem because it doesn &apos;t see the ice of the ice .
The weweight is , in a sense , the heart of the change , the heart of the climate change .
It &apos;s going to be reverse and you get a testing .
The next slide is going to be a remarkable represented to the last 25 years .
The loss of the layers are wited in the red .
As you see , you &apos;re going to go to the blue sheep .
That &apos;s the ice in the ice , which you &apos;re ritizen .
You can see that the foot , five years or more , five years or more , is like the health , which here is how to be on the body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been so so so .
This is a problem because the representation of interviewed the terrap of the ocean , where there &apos;s huge amount of coal , where there are huge amount of coal , which is a lot of the coffee .
I &apos;m going to be at the whole of the inquination of the global warming , that that can be pushed , to the very very much point of not around .
In some lagues in Alaska meters in Alaska meters ,
The professed Katey Walter , and Alaska , and it &apos;s receight-sounds a team at the last last last year .
Video : Wow ! Gore : I &apos;m going to be well .
This is that this scankkkkkkkkenland from north north .
This is a foundation of the regulations .
The pported had never never reach .
This is the Kangerlusually , in the suit , in the soulest of the Groenlanlandia .
If you want to know how the level of the sea for the sea for the gain of the gain , here is where the sea sea .
These are increasing it .
On the other part of the planet : Antartists , the most big bumbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
And the last month , they &apos;ve been been doullation of ice is in negative , and the Anyesterday Western artists , which pogen on some of the ice , which pogen on some of the ice .
Equiver , six feet of the actual acy , as Groenlandia .
Sulle Himalaya , the third biggest bice , you see new lagues , which few years ago , which few years ago , which few years ago .
The 40 percent of the world has been able to be a lot of the world .
Sulle Ands : this stick is the source of water .
The pported is increased .
But when he &apos;s just the same acception , the same accounts .
In California , the natory is about 40 percent of 40 percent .
The bbbbes are in the crisis .
The previsions , like you know , I &apos;m grass .
The growing vent in the world &apos;s door to a remarkable remarkable .
The disasers are increasing out of the normal code and without any any any of the normal .
Four times , the most of the last 30 years of the first of the first year of the time .
This is a band-all inininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininable .
If you look at the context , it &apos;s going to see the consequences .
In the last five years , we &apos;ve got to 222.million -- 25 million -- 25 million -- 25 million tons in the ocean .
Look at the area of Pacific , from the Pacific , from the nest , and on both both both the parts of the subject of the subject , where there &apos;s a oxygen in the ocean .
The most of the global warming , and the deforforforforth , which is 20 percent , is the use of good crecreates .
The oil is a problem , and the coal is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with the most emissions , together to China .
And it was proponed to build a lot of other central coal .
But we &apos;re seeing on a direction of the direction .
These are the planes in the last years and some of the alternative alternative .
And there &apos;s a lot of politics in our country .
The industrial industrial and the industrial oil have 250 million dollars in the last year year for promoting the oil oil , which is a symsymptoms , which is a symsymptomories .
And I was a picture of a --
I know Natal , in Tennesis , where I &apos;m going to be a perspective of 3.8 billion billion billion billion liers .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen on the news .
This is the most foot the biggest of the foot in America .
It &apos;s happened around Natal .
The Pamamamamample of the industrial industriand crisis .
Video : His is the carbon algrade is a kind of algry and happy .
It &apos;s just ababonononone-based on America , and it &apos;s going to be our economy .
Frosroses the carbon alaler is always more .
It &apos;s good for good , adorable and the work of the work of the sounds .
Gore : From here is the West Virginia .
The biggest society is the mountain of the mountains is Massey . This is his own .
Video : It &apos;s just a lot of -- I &apos;m going to be clear -- Gore , Harry , Harry Really -- -- he &apos;s not what they &apos;re talking about .
Gore : So the Allelelelextion for the Prottion of the Clim has two campage .
This is a part of them ,
Video : The second of the From AALergy : The climate change change as a very minute ,
So , this is to our priority is to invest a big amount of money in a forced to make them their own own and confused the truth .
In fact , the coal is not to be .
We think it &apos;s a good good good good .
So , not preratch of change .
Let me do do .
Video : The Carbor : Carbone , you &apos;ve heard very much .
So , you &apos;re going to go into a structure of the heavy for how it &apos;s fleavy for the foot .
Sweeply . The cars are a little rumorose , but this is the sound of technology of technology .
The consumption of the main is between the main represents , but the remarkable technology , but the remarkable technology that you see all .
Date a look at : this is the oodiern technology .
Al Gore : The alternative alternative to the most of the economic extremely connected to the economic security and that &apos;s the most of the nation .
Video : The America is in the crisis in the crisis , the coveroversounds , the covercrisis .
The phililililils , our dependence from the dependence of the walls , like the oil and the oil oil oil .
Now , there &apos;s a new , there is a new , audry for the circles .
Rey America : 100 percent of the crisis , in 10 years .
A plan to reduce America , to work , and to help us to go to the global work , and help to stop the global warming .
And so , a solution that that the basts to solve our problems .
Sweweight .
Gore : This is the last .
Video : It &apos;s about reach energy to the America .
One of the most of the foundation of the dependence from the dependence of our planet .
So , the future is here . I &apos;m here . I &apos;m a new energy .
But , the number of the most of the invesents for places .
So , I &apos;m going to be a lot of time to be a lot .
Gore : A old old , you know , &quot; If you want to go to a lot , you go to the foot .
If you want to go back , you go together . &quot;
We have to go back , quickly .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;m last year at TED I &apos;ve got a reduction on the LC .
And you get back to go back to the back to the car on how it works .
So , I &apos;m going to be here . And the other time , the LHC is the most great experiment .
And his tough is to reach the conditions that were less of a billion billion dollars a billion billion dollars a desert of the universe -- until 600 million times a lot of times the universe -- until to 600 million times the second .
All that &apos;s just a huge .
This is the car under Ginevator .
We &apos;re going to go into the pog Bang in the rights .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ALAS -- is the 44 feet and has a diameter of 22 feet .
This is a picture of ATLATLAAS in build so you can see the proportions .
The 10 sector we &apos;ve got to be the last year .
And this picture was taken by ATLATLATLAS .
It was because of immenmention of the crisis in the sounds of control .
It &apos;s a first image of the first first of particles that had been done all around the LHC , to the LHC , and the LHC , and spread in the LHC , and spread in the LHC , and spread in the reducator .
In other words , when we see that this image of 10 ember , that the car is a big vittory , which is a big vittory .
I don &apos;t know if this is to do that , when somebody went on Google and I &apos;m going to go on Google and I &apos;m going to be this page .
And that means we had a cultural impact on the scientific impact .
And he went to a week after , it was a problem with the car , had to these philils here -- these phililils .
These philils , and we &apos;re going to be the car works at the whole whole whole of potential .
Now , the technique between you look at the philils and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . &quot;
And instead can do that because when they &apos;re very cold to be reflying the superbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbes .
So , to the 271 degrees , to a temperature temperature to the space between the stars , these philils , these philils can take that .
In one of the giunture between the most of the magnenenenewwspaces in LHC , there was a diflight .
So the phililils , and 13,000 pounds , and 13,000 pounds , and 13,000 layed a distinced that .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impression if you think that these magnenenenewwalls , and that they &apos;re coming to about 30 centimeters .
They &apos;re sounds about 50 magnenenewwings .
We had to get them , what we did .
We &apos;ve got to rererereed and the weled .
Now , they &apos;re going back to all the way to the way .
And I was the LHHHC is going to be new integrity .
We &apos;re going to go , and we expect to get to the data to the right , and continue so our own own own , and we &apos;ll see what the universe is that the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these accidents are reported the value of the engineering of the engineering and engineering and engineering .
I think that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that &apos;s done to go beyond the way , I think that is the value of how LHC .
I want to conclude with words of a scientist Institude , which , which , which , which , which , which , I &apos;m going to get to the initizens of his redivent , his redives , his pair was Michael Faray , he said , &quot; No , &quot; is so much much much about the ideas that the whole whole of the ideas that that is not dangerous , and the most of the demony , which is not to the way that we &apos;re not going to be a new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new .
Thank you .
I want to start to ask the roles of the kids , play you &apos;re going to do with the morning .
And as you understand how to reach them and they &apos;re going to take them , and they learn , learn to think and to think and to think and the letter and the polling and the polling space .
The way we &apos;re going to see is the way we understand the way we understand the world around us .
So , by the creates of our interaction with the instrument , together , together to my consequence , and my collaborator , and my collaborator Jevan Kalianthium , I started to ask me , &quot; and if we &apos;re just a computer , instead of the mouse of the mouse of the mouse of the roller--rand-to-to-to-toward , and the hands with a lot of the hands ,
and it &apos;s going to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it ?
The question was so interesting that I decided to explore the answer , building the answer , and we build the Sifair .
In a few words , a Sifair is a computer interactive interactive as a biscankkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkle .
In a few words , a Sifair is a computer interactive interactive as a biscankkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkle .
You can move with the hand , can see the hand , they can see the movement and they &apos;re a screen and have a screen and a screen .
But the way , they are the phones , as the morning , you can move to the morning , you can move them .
The Sifair of a new ecosystem for the new ecosystem for the digital information .
And they become more , the most physicists , and we think about the movement , the other other , and the hand that they become more , and you know , the other , the other of the movement , we can see , we can see new and fun to get new new and fun of interaction .
I &apos;m going to try to do with some simple example .
This is a lot of video is constopped to show the video : if it &apos;s going to show it so , if you &apos;re going to get so , if you &apos;re going to go back .
These reaction are interactive interactive .
If they &apos;re doing them , they &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re around .
If they &apos;re circles , they &apos;re going to be a little bit .
If they &apos;re circles , they &apos;re going to be a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We &apos;ve got to be the most interesting of the interesting thing that is that we can use gain on the data , to use example , &quot; a little bit , &quot; a color like , &quot; a liquid .
In this case , we have three , we &apos;ve got three constates as a bunch of the skin the skin the central , where they &apos;re going to be able .
and I can use them to the color of the central , where they &apos;re going to be .
If we &apos;re too , we can reach a bit bit about it .
I &apos;m also going to take a chance of apeum , as the lingue , the mathematics and you see the mathematics and see the great great and you can try to be able to be able to be .
Now , I &apos;m --
This is a sequence of Fibonacks that I do with a program of equations .
This is a game of words that is at half between Scarry and Boggle .
I &apos;m actually to get a letter to the letter , the case on the Sifty , to every single rich , to every single rich on the rich , and how to try to do that that the rich of the rich .
And then , about 30 seconds of the sounds of the letter , and you have a new new new possibilities to try to try .
Thank you .
And here is the kids came in the Media Lab , I did it in the way that I &apos;ve got a video video .
They &apos;re a lot of sounds .
And one of the interesting things of this is that you don &apos;t have to have to have people in a lot of the people actually actually have to have a lot of the interesting things .
You just say , &quot; How do it , &quot; You know what they &apos;re doing .
And here &apos;s other people who they &apos;re going to be .
This is our own own own own near , there &apos;s the right .
It was actually wanted to be imimpleased .
They just sounds for him .
Now , this is a career of a carrrolon .
We wanted to build a instrument for the linginginged is Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , the rich , they &apos;re going to be using the Sifair .
It can put new characters in the scene , the rich , they &apos;re going to be using the Sifair .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : The sun is .
David Merrist : Now he took a treatment at the scene .
Video : The treat .
Bel work . You know !
So , you &apos;re going to go and put the Sifair and put them the characters --
Video : Bau !
And we &apos;ve inventing your story .
Video : His !
DM : It &apos;s a story with final final story , and it can decide to be like to be like .
DM : It &apos;s a story with final final story , and it can decide to be like to be like .
Vice : I &apos;m on ,
DM : The last example that I have the last example that I &apos;m going to show you a tool , to go and then to the music .
It &apos;s a instrument , to the way , to the campounds and to go .
The Sifair here is a shefore , the bottom and the bacteria .
And you have a lot of these four variations , and you can choose what we use .
You can also put these sounds in a sequence of a sequence to be able to your own .
And it just just doing it a kind of sound and a sequence . &quot;
These are actually you can control from the vivivious , as the reververs and the philils .
The acks to a particular sound and then then incline for the way .
And then there are actually general as time and wanted to take the whole sequence .
We &apos;re going to be how .
Video : DM : We &apos;re going to try to put a very very much in the bottom of Siffair , we put in a series , and we &apos;ll get another .
Now , I &apos;m a bottom line .
Video : Now , I &apos;m going to be a lot of percusussions --
Video : And now I &apos;m going to put the phililillion , so I can control the effect from the wellow .
Video : DM : I can &apos;t make a whole sequence of the whole sequence of time , or another .
Video : And now I &apos;m going to get the phililils to give more expression .
Video : I can get to reach the sequence of the sequence of &quot; &quot; You want . &quot;
So I &apos;m not going to be able to be before , but I can be a long bit more or more ,
And now , I can smobile the whole sequence sequence at the left BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBrippppty .
Thank you .
So , you can see , my passion is build new interinterts , and it &apos;s just more like the way , and it &apos;s going to see , and it &apos;s going to see , and it &apos;s going to see ,
And I had time to show you one of the results of this perspective , and also some possibilities that we &apos;re going to get out from the lab .
The concept I want to put you is that the new generation of design design for the new objects , which will be able to the digital digital , which is going to be information in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;m not going to talk to all .
I &apos;m a scape .
I &apos;m going to go to the talk , but it &apos;s more than that .
It &apos;s also love and the fashion .
And I don &apos;t think that can change .
But , I said this , something particular is happened in my life and my life in my own own own , which has to get me to reach the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I wrote this book , this book called Many , &quot; Prubbor , Prubbbbbbits , which , and I &apos;m going to have a big , and I &apos;m a big , a big sense ,
And the result is that there &apos;s the way , people who are treated as if I was going to stay .
It &apos;s true -- they &apos;re going to be .
They &apos;re going to be now now , and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t have a little bit of them , you don &apos;t have more than ?
You don &apos;t see the continue to write for all life without more to be able to write a book that can &apos;t be able to someone ? &quot;
what can you do you do ? &quot;
It &apos;s race , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember that I remember that I remember that I &apos;m going to say , when I started to say to people -- I want to be a scape .
I was going to put on the same reaction .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t have to be succeed ?
You don &apos;t see that the billion of the rirights .
You don &apos;t have a bank of life without nothing nothing to get out of life without nothing nothing to get out and moral out a cumumber of every rololder , and the boccurred to the bank of the cumums ? &quot;
And so , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot;
I &apos;ve got a lot of all of those things .
I always had a little bit .
And I also have a lot of other things that people don &apos;t have to be able .
As the aleum and other things spaces .
But , why I thought I thought and I thought and I &apos;m going to ask what I &apos;m going to ask , why ?
Is it ?
It &apos;s logic that anybody who would expect to be spread from a work that you &apos;re going to do .
But what &apos;s this particular in the imimpresents to make us nervous health health mental health mental as the way that other career ?
How my father , for example , he was a engineer and I didn &apos;t remember a chemistry and I &apos;m going to be engineering ?
It &apos;s never -- that stick from the engineering of John , how ?
It &apos;s not so that , what ?
And the engineers , the engineers like a group , in the checks , in the sector , the company that &apos;s reputation of being alletter .
We have enough to be a lot of this reputation , and not just creativity , and we have this reputation of all , we have this reputation of the most instability .
And it doesn &apos;t take another that look at the way to look at the mors of the mortalks that , only in the 20th century , the moral century , they &apos;re going to be young and often often often often often often often often often often often often often often often often often often often often people to get a lot of the hotter , they &apos;re going to be able to be able to look at the tristes .
And also those who don &apos;t have been able to be really really , they &apos;re actually going to be really , they &apos;re going to be really disappeared .
Norman Mailer , before he &apos;s going to go in the last interview said , &quot; Each book said , &quot; Even a little bit more , &quot; A very very much more , &quot; A little little bit more ,
But we don &apos;t get the way when we feel like to say why we heard these things , because we &apos;ve been been interviewed that in a way we &apos;re completely interactive and the well-to-up , and the wissues that the art , to the end , and the end , you will get the end .
And the question I want to get to all here here is : you &apos;re all all of this idea ?
I &apos;m going to be good , because it &apos;s also looking at a centireleasure to me not well for anything .
I think it &apos;s a great .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous and I don &apos;t want to see the next century .
I think it &apos;s better encourage our big mit .
And I know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to reach that I &apos;m going to be a lot of time , the most atatch , the circumstumstances , very much much , and the cumumumally , the way , the way I &apos;m in my card .
And I &apos;m going to look , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m pretty a 40 years .
I still have about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that any thing I &apos;m going to be judicted from the world as the work that he went after the work that he went after the last book .
I &apos;m going to go , because we &apos;re all more or less friends here -- is likely that my most success is to my little bit .
Oh , Geso , which thought .
You know this is the kind of thinking that you have a person to start to start in the morning , and I don &apos;t want to do that .
I &apos;m going to continue to do this work we work that we work .
So , the question is , how ?
And so so I &apos;m going to be , which the way to work to work to work to work to write a new protective protective protective protective protective protective protective protective , OK ?
I had to find a distance of security between me , I &apos;m saying , and I &apos;m going to get to be on what I &apos;m going to get to get , and I &apos;m going to get to to look at the time , to find out the time , to find out the time to see if they have more ideas and more and more and more and more ideas to see if they &apos;re going to be better ideas and more ideas to see if they &apos;re going to be the most ideas and more and more ideas to be ideas to be really really ,
on how to help people people are constitude the inerents of creativity .
And that research has been to be a Please and the Rome .
I &apos;m going to go because I &apos;m going to go back .
Nananic Pole and Rome -- people don &apos;t seem to believe that the creativity is that the creativity ?
And it was thought that the creativity was this spirit of the wine and that &apos;s the people who was a few distant to a few people and unknown .
The most depends , they call these dians , &quot; the decades of creativity . &quot;
Soccurred , wonderful , he was a dealing dealing a dealing dealing .
The Romans were the same idea , but they call that a kind of spirit ,
The Romans don &apos;t thought , because the Romans don &apos;t thought a geniium was a lot of intelligent .
They &apos;re going to be a genium of this species of entity that he had had literally in the murs of a artist , a little bit like the way , and that &apos;s a little bit of the work of the work of the work of the work .
Here &apos;s the edge of what I think is the distance of what I think -- that that &apos;s the psychological psychological psychological that protecting the results of your work .
And all they were so that that was so that work , right ?
So the artists were protects from how to try and you &apos;re going to be too nararsism , not ?
If your work was so so that you could not take a little bit , all they were to help them , all they were help to me to this genium .
If your work , you know , it &apos;s not all of your work , right ?
And all they were that your geniiium to be a inposite .
And so people are so much , the creativity in the West for much time .
And then the Rininition went and all , and they &apos;re going to be the human idea ; we &apos;re going to be the human on the universe , and the wirers and the wwalls , and the well-to-toward the creatures .
This was the principle of humanity and people started thinking that creativity is that creativity is that the creativity is that that the creativity .
And for the first time in history , you know , I &apos;m going to reference this artist , which is a very much person to a genium person with genium .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big error .
I think I would put a simple person , a simple person to be like a reciplplease , the essence , the essence and the exist and the people all of the walls , and ununununknown and a responsibility to be a lot of the human beings .
It &apos;s how to ask somebody of inopped out of insun .
It &apos;s actually going to be the ego and creates all these remarkable to the power .
And I think it &apos;s been this pression to destroyed ,
And , if this is true , and I think that is , and I think that is , and now ?
Can we do do that diversally ?
And the most of the relationship between human human relationship between humans and mystation .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can &apos;t see 500 years of thinking about 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people between the audience that &apos;s just a lot of scientific buildings on the noon , you know , you know , you know , you can followed the well-toward .
It &apos;s going to be able to be all about this thing .
But the question I &apos;m going to be -- why ?
Why don &apos;t I think that in this way ?
Because it has more sense of every other thing that has ever heard to explain the experative experative experative .
A process that , as anybody who ever ever taught to do something -- so , so , all here -- you know , you don &apos;t have to be rationally .
And , it can be going to be going to be pretty good .
I did this instrument with the extraordinary ordinary ordinary Ruth Ston , which has been 90s , but that &apos;s been a poetly for all life and he said that in his own own own own own own own own own own , and he was going to be in the surginia , and it &apos;s going to be able to be able to be the fair .
And he was like a frageous frameous .
And that went to the bank of her bank .
I &apos;m going to go , because he he was going to be to be to be on the land on his feet .
He had to have a only thing to do that point and was , his words , &quot; His to be a pair . &quot;
And so it went to home and he went to this poeeeeem , and it didn &apos;t have to take another piece of paper and a piece of paper and a little bit , as a little bit of paper and they &apos;re going to be able to be pair .
Also , even we could be enough to be pretty much , so corrid and corner , and he went to home and the poem and he would just go back to the poeem and she would continued to go through the landscape , trying to go through the landscape , to be a little bit . &quot;
And then there were those times -- this piece of time , I &apos;m going to be -- there were some of the moments that was almost perspective , OK ?
So , he was going to go and he was trying to career and the poeetry through , and then he was going to be a shear in the way , and then he said , that it was like if you &apos;re going to go with the other hand and the office .
And he was the poeeeeda and he went to the body and he went on the page .
And in these parts , the poeem would be presented on the perfect pair , but to the last word to the first word .
So when I feel I thought -- is the flezy , is exactly how to do this process .
Not all my process -- not not a fairs .
I &apos;m a sounds , and my way of work is ; I &apos;m going to go to the same orest , and they &apos;ll get up up and get up on the hit .
But even I was in my testestestors , I &apos;m stract with that thing , I &apos;m going to do that .
And I &apos;m just a lot of you the han made .
You know , even if the work and ideas said said , &quot; I &apos;m not going to be able to be able to be .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we get to be able to be able to do the head , but , rather , rather , which you &apos;ll have to get a head ?
So , the best example of the same example of the Tom I &apos;ve got the music Tom , which I &apos;ve interviewed on a day .
We &apos;re talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the most of life was the instrument of the artist of the artist , trying to control , to control , and trying to control , to get these species of interacting , and trying to control , and to control these species .
But then I &apos;m going to go , and a day when he went to a day , and a day he went to Los Angeles , it &apos;s all all for him .
He was going to go to the very very quickly , that &apos;s a little frament of melodia , which is going to be able to inspiration , that &apos;s so so much , and it &apos;s wonderful , and you want , and you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and it was really really , but it &apos;s wonderful , it doesn &apos;t like to take it .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a sheer .
So , I started to feel this species of old old is to go to him in him , &quot; I &apos;m for perpers , and I &apos;m going to go to this downnaking .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of go to the panic , you &apos;ll go .
I &apos;m going to go to the whole process and he did something completely new .
I just just just the sky and he said , &quot; I &apos;m not going to see ? &quot;
&quot; Ti seems to be a bunch of now ?
If you really want to be able to be a more when I can take care about the time when I can take care of it .
And so , I &apos;m going to importantly , I &apos;m going to be a other today .
I went to the wonard ♫ ♫
And his process of work on the process of this .
Not the work , the work was still a work of the work as always .
But the process , and the process of the hattack that was reduced when the genium , the genium that out of him out of him out , and the genium that &apos;s going to go back to where , and I went back to where , and I went back to where , and they did it was going to be a thing .
but it &apos;s a conversation of a wonderful conversation , wonderful bizaron a conversation of Tom and this thing that &apos;s a lot of Tom and that &apos;s not Tom .
So , how the story that I &apos;m going to change a little bit that I work and I &apos;m going to save a time .
This idea , I &apos;ve got to be when I was to write , Prrich , &quot; and I went to the back in a front of those cumpped in a bunch of the disperation that we &apos;re working on something and we &apos;re not going to think that &apos;s a little bit , which is the worse .
Not just the worst book , just the worst book .
And I started thinking about this project .
But then I remember Tom that I was to Tom that I was going to be .
So I went to my face on the way , and I went to a pair of my comments to a place of the room .
And I said to a high , &quot; Sents , what if you know , what if this book is not going to be interviewed , right ?
Because as I &apos;m going to put all what I &apos;m not more than I have , I don &apos;t have more than this .
So if you want to be better , you have to have to presented and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do that , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
I &apos;m going to write the same because it &apos;s my work because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to play my part of the North I &apos;ve been been working for my part of the North , OK , OK , OK , OK , OK , OK , OK , OK , OK , OK , OK ,
And they were always magniques , because the ballerors and they were fantastic and they were fantastic .
But every , so , you &apos;re going to be , and one of these artists was actually actually actually actually transccccccrisis .
And I know what I know , because I know that you have all , because I know that you have all , a symptoms .
And it was like if the time , and the ballerine , and the ballerine , and it was not doing nothing different from the usually , like 1,000 notice before , but all of the 1,000 noticed .
And I &apos;m not going to be a human .
But it &apos;s going to go from the well-letter in the fuels of divinity .
And when this happened , I was , the people knew what was , people knew what was , they call it with his name .
I went to bunch and hands and they started to bunch , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , God , God , God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curious notice -- when the MMMinvasic Spain , I was this ababstract with their own and they &apos;re going to be in the way , and the rololder , Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , &quot; I &apos;m still going to hear in the rowing in .
In Spain , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , and I &apos;m going to say , &quot; Alah , I was a little bit , &quot; insible , the crisis -- a little bit of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need .
But , the problem goes after , for the day , for the ballerine , when you &apos;re the 11 and see that the 11 , when you &apos;re the 11 and the first of God &apos;s not more .
It &apos;s just a moral moral with a lot of ginoccurred , and maybe it &apos;s never going to be more to each other .
And maybe nobody will be the name of God still , and what &apos;s going to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is a recilizations of the most pacacting life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so much , if you could not believe , the most extraordinary , which the most extraordinary aspects of your life to be .
But I &apos;m just just that you &apos;re in the time , you know , a initizens of this team of your life that &apos;s part of your life that you have to go to a another when you go .
And , you know , if we think about that it &apos;s all about .
And so I started to think , and it &apos;s sure , and it &apos;s just like the whole whole of the book that I &apos;m going to work on the book that I &apos;m going to get , the dangerous , and I &apos;m going to think about my great great didious , and it &apos;s going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able .
And that I &apos;m going to tell me when I &apos;m going to tell me when I &apos;m not going to be able to be , not just just just just just just just to be able .
Not the way . It just just to your work .
Contua presentation for your part , any can be .
If your work is balling , I &apos;m going to go .
If the divine , you get a geniium to be a little bit of just let me take some wonderful time through some wonderful time , for a only time through the forces , then you know , &quot;
And so , you do the same dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot;
I think and I think and I think it &apos;s going to be .
&quot; You &apos;re going to be a human love and also only for had a human love and testestors to get to reach .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June June : Ole !
And as you know about some of some of these projects on the human genome , what can &apos;t expect and discovery of new genome .
Now we &apos;re going to start a new perspective : we started to digalize biology and now now , we &apos;re going to get in a new new fase of biology , and we &apos;re going to have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to digalize the biology and now , we &apos;re going to be able
We always tried to reach the big questions .
&quot; What is the life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists have to figure out of the librains .
We tried different different , reduced , and I &apos;ve tried to minimimes .
We &apos;re digalive by almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was to go from the world analogical world of biology at the biology of the new new biology .
Now , we can regenerate life , or create new life , or to create new life in this universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycopyyo , which is the species from genetic genetic genetic .
And we tried to reduce the genome for creates a little bit more .
We &apos;re able to be able to be able to be able to be here .
But when we go to his map , is very simple to the map , is very simple than our .
It &apos;s simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can see , one of the genes that can take a cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell .
So , I decided that the only one of revertititively this cromosome to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the some important questions .
And so we started the race of &quot; We can synthththroomosome ? &quot;
Can we have the chemical chemical depends that we &apos;ve never never done before ?
And , in case , we can make work a cromosome ?
A cromosome is just a piece of chemistry .
The speed with that we &apos;re able to digalize life is growing to the life is growing .
Our ability to write the code , instead , of design , instead , and it &apos;s a lot of lently , but it &apos;s going to be able .
And our most recent rich the rich rich rich to the curve .
We &apos;ve got more 15 years ago .
The process has to reduce a lot of the reach , we &apos;re going to start with a reach that we &apos;re going to have the first experiments .
But we &apos;ve discovered that synthththize .
There are thousands of cars in the world that we make a lot of DNA , the long bunch of DNA , the letter 30 to 50 to 50 to 50 to 50 to 50 to 50 to 50 , the most errors are .
And we had to develop a new new metic for assembling these framments and reach the errors .
And this is the first attememempt , to start from the genome of Phi 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills the bacteria .
We designed the framments , they &apos;re designed the corretion of the sounds and reduction a molecule of DNA about 5,000 .
The interesting part is when we &apos;ve got this piece of chemistry and we put it in the bacteria , the bacteria have been going to read this code and make the genetic code and make the particles .
The particles are then going to go from cells , are back back and they went back and destroyed .
I &apos;ve talked about the oil industry , and the oil of the oil industry , they have to have a lot of the model .
They have to get more of you .
We think this is a situation where the software can really build his same dedealing in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in the big things .
We wanted to build the whole cromosome .
They &apos;re more than 580 pounds of code .
So we thought we build it in coverovering the size of the dimension of the virus , so that we can change the spread what the whole cell cell cell cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this for first time in 1995 , the first time in 1995 , the rich of a sounds for every 10 10 mimix .
We &apos;ve discovered , 30 errors , 30 errors . If we used to sequence that originally we had never able to do that .
One part of the process is designed cheap for 50 sounds that you &apos;re sovovers with all the other segments of 50 to build a little bit more that work together .
We &apos;re going to have elements here .
You &apos;ve got to read that that we put the flifear .
Think of the so we have a code de of four letter : A , C , CC and Teem .
Those of those lets , and they &apos;re going to be about 20 amminods , and there &apos;s a specific specific specific to every single creatures for every minods .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , fracy , you know ,
What we did we did this .
Some of them have been done .
We &apos;ve designed these segments for poter-up for potential .
There are are reports and they put them together and put them together .
And we started to assembling of the parts , and we &apos;re going to go to seven to 7 , and they &apos;re going to get a sounds of the way to get to the way to get to to the time to get to 72 .
And then we &apos;ve got to the product of the segments in ababononone-sequence that we &apos;re trying to get a very very good extremely -- like you see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatives the process .
So , this seems to be the tabellon a shapes of the foot .
When we &apos;re going to go to these segments , more than 100 100 mimix , not going to be more than 100 mixes in Emmmmmmmmmmit .
You go to the modern tools of modern biology .
So we &apos;ve got to get some of the mechanisms .
We know , we had to have a little bit of the omologists called , which in biology , which is to reach DNA in biology .
Here &apos;s a example .
This organism , called Deinoccurcurs , can move three million of radiation , can move three million of radiation .
You can see in the riquick of the cromosome is destroyed .
In 12 hours , it &apos;s going to be exactly exactly how it was before .
They &apos;re going to be thousands of organisms that I &apos;m going to do that .
These organisms can be completely .
They can live in the way .
They &apos;re not really really really part of the space , and you can find new new new products of water .
And it &apos;s true , NASA has showed that this is .
This is a molecule that we built using these sounds , just using the lieventually , using the lieventually .
The lieveventually .
This image is not been taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a molecule molecule that we can see the microscope with a microscope .
These are photos that code a period of six seconds .
This is the view that we did a little bit bit of time ago .
They &apos;re more than 5000-letic code .
It &apos;s the most great of a definitely structure ever ever made from the man .
It &apos;s a molecular molecular molecular ular .
If we &apos;re going to be a career with a career , you &apos;d like 142 page to transcated this code code .
Now , how do we do this ? How can we see it ?
And of course , I &apos;m a virus is a game of kids .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when they use the bacteria .
It &apos;s a simple thing when it &apos;s about cells , you can just get the nuclear nuclear , you can just just get the nuclear nuclear and put a other , which is actually the process of cloning .
And the bacteria , the cromosome is instead of the skyle , but we &apos;ve got to do a trick , but we &apos;ve got to do a trick traphor to a little bit of a romosome .
We &apos;ve got a cromosome parent , I &apos;m going to go from a microbial species .
The two are different as the men .
We &apos;ve got a few genes in the way that I could decide to decide that cromes for this cromosome .
And then he went to the letter , and then he &apos;s going to go to the prototine .
And when we put in the cell cell is studies -- and we &apos;re also depending our graphical graphical graphics -- the new cromatooid .
And we were thinking we were we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to get more in there .
This is one of the most mechanissues .
We found that tantissongs , a second or a second , or a third cromosome from some of a second thousands of new brain , and a half of new brain .
So , who think about the evolution of the time that &apos;s not really really really really really really really have a part of biology .
And they &apos;re called the rich is called the tough of retrip that is that that is going to be the DNA .
The cromosome that was in the cell , it doesn &apos;t have a .
The phones of the romosome we put it .
It &apos;s exhibbbbbbomosome as a little cromosome , and it has the masticated , and we &apos;re reach with the new cell and the new cell and the new cromes .
It &apos;s become blue because of the genes that we put it .
And in a very short time , all the characteristics of a species are went to perform , and it &apos;s transformed in a new species , the whole new species , the whole new species , that &apos;s going to put in the new .
All the protprotection are changed , and the memes are changed , and when we &apos;re changing the code code of what we &apos;ve got to get .
Now , this could look like alalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalaling the DNA we can change .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that here &apos;s not about gene -- but progress of the world , and I &apos;ve already said that maybe we &apos;re doing a new version of the exploring of the explorosian explosion Cambriana that will be new species on this process .
Why do this ?
I think it &apos;s enough when we think about our need to our need to be .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion people to the next 40 years .
Right to give a example : I &apos;m born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one exist in 1946 ; in 40 years , they &apos;re going to be four .
We &apos;re going to find problems now to find food , water , medicine and the sounds and the sounds for six billion and a half billion people .
It &apos;s going to be more to do that for nine .
We &apos;re going to use more than 30 billion cover-coal , more than 30 billion pounds of the oliiiiiiize .
That means percent million bits day .
When we &apos;re trying to find the biological biological , or any of process for repeek them , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
And we have to get all the emission of the oil of the oil of the atmosphere .
I &apos;m going to be the scientific discovery in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the design of the world .
The electronic industry has only a dozen bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbits out .
Our limited here are data , and the biological principle and the imagination .
Now we have the technique , thank you to these metods , to these metods , able to create what we call a genetic combined .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can produce a million cromes .
And you know , you know , these 20 million genes of try to try to make a little bit , new new vaccines , we can change , we can change , and we can change , and create biology now that in the last 20 million science .
And it &apos;s just a selection .
We can choose for the chance of survival , the chemical chemical and producproducproduction .
This is a lot of a few software of a software programming on which we &apos;re working for being able to be able to be able to the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how it &apos;s going to be .
We know exactly what we &apos;re like genetic code .
Now we &apos;re also also about the reach of the fourth generation .
You &apos;ve seen you that extremely extremely , from the grain was a finished experiment .
We have a four-second generation , and the generation that &apos;s used to be able to be able to the coverezen to the highest value of the cutanle .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increasing the most important impact of food and very very much the food of food and very much the food in the first time , which we &apos;re working on the food that can have been working for the power , and we think that we &apos;re working on the first urururururge of 18 months .
The light light is a metoooodownnards -- but in our discoveries in all the world , we found different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different metods .
This is a organism we &apos;ve got this in 1996 .
It &apos;s going to be a 2,500 feet of the welelation of the water .
They &apos;re using the trees using the oil rogen molecular .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can actually be able to understand the oil , which can be transported to get the oil oil in the energy , to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to understand if we can actually be transported to get this process .
So , we think we can be able to be able to increase what the question is , &quot; which is what what is life , we have the phones , we have the moon .
Exclearly . If you can &apos;t do that TED , where you can &apos;t it ?
It was a main source of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working on the same metods to create vaccines to create vaccines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with the influence , we always go back to a year and a dollar in less when it &apos;s going to find the vaccine .
I think that you can actually build the vaccines in anticiize .
So , this future could start to look at the future could change , now , the alalalthough , the alalalalthough , and they were going to be able .
We &apos;re so so much about the people .
Our purpose is to do it in a way to try to try to try to try to try to try to do . Thank you very much .
So , the most quickly , the most quickly , the most quickly possible , a lot of work , the new technology that we &apos;ve got to go to the Microsoft in the way to be exactly .
It &apos;s a where you can interact the environment that you can interact with a huge amount of data .
And here we &apos;re seeing a lot of a lot of digital digital digital , with a kind of zoom and continue , for a very very quickly , for a very very much , the most of the pictures of how we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big is the amount of information that we see , how big these data are the data or the pictures .
Most of the photographs , but this for example is a scansion for example is a scansion of Congress , and reports in the Biotececttttle .
It &apos;s not a difference because the only thing that &apos;s the presents of a system like this is the number of a system like this is the number of the screen in any moment . It &apos;s also a very flessible architecture very flatible .
This is a whole book , it &apos;s a whole book .
This is Casa desolated of Dickens . Every colonna reach .
So , to show you that is just about the text of images , we can do a thing about , to see that that is a real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little bit of the artificial way to read a book .
I don &apos;t have a lot of the way .
This is a most realistic example . It &apos;s a number of The Wardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a seon .
And it really take a little bit of the good experience of read the real version of a career or a test of a test , which is to nature .
We also have something with the angle of the Wardian .
We created a bunch of the clower to cover that that is a normal normal level of that that it used to be a normal normal normal normal .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automatically , you can see here .
Or other models , even the specific specific that we &apos;re doing the specific .
And this really shows some of these ideas for the limb of the crisis .
We &apos;re going to be able to be able to the people , and to the other ppiteries , not have to be a lot of time .
Of course , the map of the most instrument for this kind of technology .
And on this field , if I don &apos;t want to say that we have to do that that we have to give you to give them in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. sovovers on a geosphere of NASA .
So now we &apos;re going to do something else .
This is now from the Web ; you can go to see it .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which is two different technologies .
One is Seadadadded and the other is a research that &apos;s very interesting by Noah Snavely Savavaving , a student in Washington , with the help Steve Seititkises of Microselkises .
And it &apos;s a bunch of the Web ,
You can see this when we do this kind of screen , which we can go from a second , and we can go to to remarkable to remarkable .
But the spacacacactivity here has actually actually actually a meaningful .
The algorititation of the computer have been recorded these pictures , in how the way that correspond to places that the imagining rich , which the imagining rolololder , and all the scanks of the Magagagon Magagagagues , you see . This is a lot of the subject of the subject of the wnnitation , and these are all the spread of the spread .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;m going to show some other environment .
I &apos;m a lot more more spacacactivity .
I want to go to one of the original data of Noahahs -- and this is that we &apos;ve done to be able to the first time to work for the first time , we &apos;ve done to work for the first time , to show you what I &apos;m going to show you what I &apos;m going to be really going to be a whole whole thing , the technology is not so much much of the way that we &apos;ve got to put in the spread .
We had to get to the sounds of the gain and and and so on .
This is a representation of the cattattattack of Nobody Dr. images from Flicken . Basion . Basion in Flicken , and you get images in the maglip , other other other other other other camlip and he went to the reach .
So , they &apos;re all images from Flickr and they &apos;re all connected to the space in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate in this way .
You know , I would never have thought to get to work for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very grationone-ratives .
I think you see that is a lot of different kinds of different kinds of fotocaming : from those professionals , and the most of those professionals , a very significant ,
And if I can do , I &apos;m going to try to try to try to the more struggles .
Many of the bunch of the sounds , so that &apos;s .
And the part of photographs -- and it &apos;s a series of photographs -- and it &apos;s a series of photographs .
This is a poster of NoDP .
We can go from the view of the physics of this environment .
The point is that we can do things with the social environment . This is now to be looking at the whole memory , from the whole memory , from the whole memory , from the point of the visual view -- and all those data together .
All of those photos are connected together , the most of the parts .
You have a model of the entire land that emerge .
Think about the way to the bunch of the work of Stephen Lawler on Earth on the Earth on the Earth .
It &apos;s something that is that you &apos;re going to be able , and the people are using , and the whose to use the rich of the people are going to be .
They &apos;re mark with metaps with other people .
If you have the idea of contrass all these sets all these sets , my picture of the name of Nobody Dr. three Dr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. r. r. to imimimself in that space , and the way , using the way , and you have a kind of social experience , and to have a little bit , and you have a cross-toward the crosses .
And then , a consequence of all the models are very very very very much , and they &apos;re not just just just just just just just just just to be a lot of the world , and the memory and the memory of the memory .
Thank you .
CA : I realized that well ? What &apos;s what your software will be able to do is that a certain point , in the next few years , all the photographs and if anyone in the whole world are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do is a lot of connected together ?
BAA : Yeah . What is that &apos;s doing is actually find .
It &apos;s a bunch of the hypers , if you want , between pictures .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the images .
The thing is really interesting if you &apos;re going to get the remarkable of information that many of these pictures .
As when you do a research on the Web , you know , it &apos;s a fratory and the text page of the pictures .
Now , what happens if you do this picture of the notice and the picture ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of remarkable to reach that &apos;s really huge . It &apos;s really huge . It &apos;s a classic .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible .
BAA : I &apos;ll give you very much .
One of the main thing when you &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to live between who &apos;s the research that can live between who don &apos;t dimented the traditions , who are going to have the traditions , who are the traditions , and the coverced in the wind , the rich , the famong the plants .
And the way that the samamamean Jaguuule Lattea , or who the Lattea , or who the mouth , which the mouth , which in Himimimalayas , which in Himimimimalyssounds , which is to remember , and the idea that we can &apos;t have the most of the idea , and the idea that we &apos;re not just a sense of the idea that we can &apos;t just a sense , but it &apos;s a sense of the way ,
And the consequence of a particular faller-rich , which our stirts , well , many generations ago ,
And , of course , we all share the exexist .
We all do it . We all all of this .
We &apos;re a lot of the beginning of the beginning .
We have to have the inexist of death , so we don &apos;t take us and let &apos;s go --
We all have a art .
And what the particular is the particular one of the bunch of the gags of all of the culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that the think of the forests of the Borneo , or the following Voodoo Haiti , or the folks in Kenya , or Haiti in Kenya , the Curge , Curand-Sahara heart , the Curandand-heart .
He was my colleagues in the desert of the journey in the desert , or a month ago , or a well--toward , the Lest , the dealing of the world .
All of these are teachers that are the other ways of exist , other ways of think , other ways of think , other ways of the world .
And , if you think a moment , is a concept that you can give you hope .
And then , the mimimix of culture of culture of the world that &apos;s a rich of the well-life , and the planet and it &apos;s important for the planet as the planet as the biological biological .
And you can think about this instrument as a very much in a very nosyynoses , the very very very general of all of the concepts , all the concept , , the inspiration of the human consequence .
The etnosyststone is the great checity of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbols of what we are and what we can be in how we can be in how we can be in how to be in how how to do .
And as the biosphere is been depended as well as a lot of the same time .
Nobody , for example , it would be that 50 percent of all the species was or is the ororest of the orest , because it &apos;s the orest , or in the fact , but in the field of biological biological biological diversity -- in the field of biological biological diversity .
The one of all of that is , of course , the perspective language .
When you &apos;re born with 6,000 linging on this planet .
A language is not just composition from a bocolic bor or a series of rules rules .
One language is is the Saaaking human .
It &apos;s the middle with that that that the soul of all the world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a thought , a thought , a thought , a ecosystem .
And of those 6,000 lings , as we &apos;re sitting at Monterey , at least half the least half the half the children .
They don &apos;t have more teachers , the means , to be less than the ppumbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
What &apos;s the most tristes of the crisis , of the first to talk , the last at the last last at the last of the last at the last of the kids or to put the promising of the kids or to get the promising of the kids ?
This is a few weeks : I &apos;ve been a few few weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks , and it &apos;s going to be in the ptoms , and a language of a language .
And I know what somebody else will say , &quot; It &apos;s not better like this ?
The world would not a better place if we &apos;re all the same language ? &quot;
I &apos;m talking about the houlder .
You &apos;re going to be a tract thing that means to talk to you .
I &apos;d like to do a journey through the journey --
a little journey in the hosyyynosphere to give you a bit .
Many of us dimentally , when I &apos;m going to say , &quot; I &apos;m really really really different ways of exist .
We &apos;re going to take for example , the Barasana , in Amazzzon , the people who believe in the sounds of the cover-foot , which creates to get from the sounds of the test of the gress .
It &apos;s a people that &apos;s not able to be able to distinct the blue blue , because the blue , because the time you &apos;re actually actually actually actually actually actually deficed in the time , which is depends .
They have a struggle and a mouth , dedemonial , dedetains &quot; : &quot; You have to have a different person that &apos;s about a different language .
And all of the past , the past mitological particularly , but the particularly ularly the particularly , and the particularly what you &apos;re going to talk about six or seven , because of the matters of the matters .
They &apos;re going to listening and then they &apos;re talking about .
We have a most interesting people with the most interesting world with the which I &apos;ve been been been , Waaorn of Ecuadador , a incredible incredible that that had the first contact in 1958 .
In 1957 , five , they &apos;ve got a contact act expensive .
They did the top of the photographs that repeeers were going to be repeated , and they &apos;re going to be able to the instrument that this people who have never seen anything about bi-dimensional .
They &apos;ve got the picture from the land , they have to the research of a form or a form of a form or a form , they have no , they &apos;re going to have been able to be the deaves , and they said , and they &apos;ve got the lance .
But the Waorans don &apos;t killed the hurs .
They &apos;re killed between them .
54 percent of mortality was used to their own .
We &apos;ve got to be a generations and we found two of death and when we &apos;ve got a lot of death and they put it a lot of their own invecting that one of them was going to invecting , and then they &apos;ve got to have the same .
The animal were able to recognize the animal is 40 pass and recognize the animal has 40 passion and recognize the species .
And I first &apos; 80 , I &apos;ve been been a very interesting thing when my professor , I &apos;m going to go to Hahead to Haaiti , I wanted to go to Haawn to Haahead of Duvalier and Tonton Mason and Tonton Macon Macon Mactivity , and it &apos;s used to do the wwwwomomomomon .
So , to give a sense of the miracy , I would have to take the culture Voooodoo is not magnia .
It &apos;s quite a complex view of the world .
A lot interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the big religion of the world , what would you do ?
Criririririst , Islam , Glloulder , Ebraism .
A continent is always let me out , thinking that the sub-Saaaaahead . And instead , but they &apos;re not not other religious . And instead , and the Voo is not another very profound of the religious .
And what it &apos;s interesting the vooo is the way to be the way to be a life and death .
So the spirits are going to go .
The spirites can be invocated from Grands , they say to the dance of the dance and they &apos;re going to be going to be to the way that for a very very short , which for a very very short , that &apos;s the follow .
So , this is the wooooods to go to talk about God .
We have to be in the way , and we &apos;re going to be God . &quot;
And from the moment that you &apos;re sitting , is the spirit that you see , how you can do you do that ?
So you &apos;ve got to get these incredible incredible events : followed to the hoothroo in the way that touch the coverovered a very much much than the body of the power when it &apos;s been a lot of the power when it &apos;s been on a whole way .
And in the most extraordinary people with which I &apos;ve been been the most extraordinary ordinary .
I &apos;m going to be the bank of the civilization that once they were in the planets that once they &apos;re going on the hattacking , the people who are going to be able to the rich that you &apos;re going to be able to be the sky .
In a continent that has never been conquid , this people have never been conquated by the spread .
And now , we &apos;ve been been done by a click , but they were so so so so ,
The young people followed to go from the families and three or four or four or four or , and they &apos;re secret in a world , and they &apos;re going to get a world of the guns of the most tuned for 18 years .
Two years of nine years of the nine of the way to rebuild nine months of gestation that translation in the mother , now are metaphor , now are metaphor in the mother .
So , this time , they &apos;re going to be represents of their society , values that they &apos;re going to see that their previous and only their prevest and their previous .
And I &apos;m incredible activity , they &apos;re so so so much to be reported and the first time in 18 years , you see a bunch of 18 years , you see a bunch of the first time , you &apos;ll see the first bunch of the first time , what they &apos;re going to be in the conference , what they &apos;re going to be a conference in the conference .
&quot; Visissed , how I said .
It &apos;s amazing . Now , it &apos;s just to protect it . &quot;
They call the most and say that we &apos;re doing , fraties they say , we &apos;re the cold of the destroyed world .
This level of the intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the most most congenes and the environment we &apos;re going to have Rousseemememempage , which is a concept in his simplicity or maybe invoe , which is a concept , and we can invoded the Earth .
The people are not nosyygabababoll is not not the nosyytaly .
There &apos;s not space for these things in the palubbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbes .
What does it mean ?
It &apos;s going to say that a little bit of Anes that &apos;s going to be a human spirit . It &apos;s a human spirit . It &apos;s going to be a human expensive human . It &apos;s going to be a different different way , and it &apos;s going to be a different different different with the way to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a reach .
That &apos;s the dimit &apos;s one of a mineral , it &apos;s a mineral .
What is interesting is is the metaphor that it &apos;s the relationship between the individuals and the natural world .
I &apos;m going to be been in the forests of the Instealing that forests are to be clearly .
And this has to be a different from my Kwakikiutl that forests are the forests that the forests are the Hukukukuk and the bal is the Hukukkukle and the wwalls that we have to the Hamp , which is the Hammas .
If you start to see that these culture can create different different , you can start to take some of them discoveries .
I &apos;ve got this picture of the Amazzzon the Western n n Western .
Maybe some of you heard of the ayahuh , the most powerful powerful psychooods of the repertitional repertired .
And what it &apos;s a Chinese check is not the potential potential potential drugs , but his elaborate . It &apos;s going to be able to two elements .
From a side , this list is that you &apos;re a series of glass , and the dealine , and a sounds , and a lot of glass .
I &apos;m going to be a comic ic ic bbutter that allowed a little bit of the crisis , but it &apos;s a little bit , it &apos;s so so they would say Please .
This is a lot of potents , very similar to the very similar to the very similar to the very similar , a methyppyppyppyppyppyppyppypppypppppypppypppamine .
If you &apos;ve ever see Yanomoms to the nose , the who are they do a different different species , you know , it &apos;s a different different species , you &apos;re going to see the methypyppyppyppppypppppypppypppamine .
Tiring that pollue for nose is a little bit like to be shapes from a fuel of a caretic fuels and reach on a sea of electricity .
I &apos;m going to often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who had gotten the man who got the ppockets , with his discovery of the funny of the funny .
Second my tis not to the classificate of these trippamine as as you &apos;re going to tell one of the tunes because if you &apos;re going to tell one of the tripppamine , but they can &apos;t be a lot of course , because you &apos;re going to be a very very very much , of course , but of course , of course , the flexyggogs .
It &apos;s possible to be possible to be able to the other depending with other depending , which densssounds that foreign MAO .
Now , it &apos;s the good : the magazine that you find in this liana lian instruments are ininstruments to potential to potential to potential the tripamine . The question is that in a 80,000 species , as they &apos;re going to be able to be a 80,000 species , they &apos;re going to have a lot of the way , but that &apos;s a lot of the way , if they &apos;re going to be a little bit of the most of the street of the cost of the way .
We &apos;re the great euuubbbor and the error , which can rereach .
But if we ask the Indians , you know , we say , &quot; The plants are going to talk . &quot;
What does it mean ?
This stick , the Chan , has 17 variety of ayahuh , which distinct they have to get in forest , and that we &apos;re going to have in the same species .
If you ask how to do it as a lot of them , they say , &quot; I &apos;m going to understand the world , of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the world , &quot; No .
The solution is : you get 17 various age in a night of the lets and all the pain and all a bunch of a different different different .
With this is not rerere-Harvard , but it &apos;s very interesting that I &apos;m going to do the stick .
Now , in the way , the problem is that also the problem is that also those people who have heart people who have a heart people who are pitted and some way to reach the way to the world , and it &apos;s going to be able to be able to be beyond the real world , and it &apos;s going to be beyond .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , not going to be remember for his innovations , but as a lot of technology , but as a lot of the technology , but as the way we &apos;re going to go and we &apos;re going to get a passion of biological diversity and cultural technology is not the problem . Now , the problem is not the problem . Now , it &apos;s not the problem . Now , the problem is not the problem .
All the culture through the instruments have been in a dance for new possibilities of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The American Boux doesn &apos;t have to be Sioux when they put on the bunch of the Americans have to be Americans have to be Americans , they have to be Americans when they put on the hot and .
It &apos;s not the change of technology that minds the integrity of the implicity of the power . It &apos;s the power .
The double of the domination of the domination .
And if you go to the world , I &apos;m going to see that these are not destroy to sweight .
They &apos;re living and dynamics and dynamics out of the exist from forces that go beyond their capacity of adaptment .
I &apos;m going to be refairs in the check --
a people who have to be like to be like to be like , in the sounds , a people who have been a role in the forest to a generation ago , and now reach to a generation , and repaid to the back to the reach of the reach that &apos;s going to see the reach that &apos;s going to see the reach that &apos;s going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the Maptonishing , where the Micicicicicicicicicicican , and where the people , and the people in the way , and the sub-Sweasional Munteteteteeness , where the way ,
I &apos;m going to rerereach the bums with the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that are coming with the discovery of the ones .
If we put on the mountain of the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the double of the domination of the politics .
As you see the genocide , the inintion of a people , it &apos;s actually fair to universal the clower , but the destroyle , the destroyed , not only only has to be a few years , but it &apos;s not just a lot of the way , because of the generating part of the development .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of the Tibet , because you don &apos;t know about the beginning .
I &apos;ve got the 6,000 miles from Chutdu in China through the Western Sweaaatheater , and you just go to Lhasa young jobs , but only went to Lhass , but only went to Lhasasn , but just went to Lhasn ,
6,000 monuments are pped in pollue and foreign .
1.11,,500 million people killed if the Again .
And the father &apos;s been ascritical at Panchen Lama .
The thing that means that it &apos;s been killed to the time of invasion .
And I was going to go to Santity in Santity in Santity in the Santity in Nepal .
And she was impossible . It was ememployeed and his hahead was going to be reach .
It was brought to the age of two years , and it was brought to the age of two years , because he could not have to live without him .
The ununknown , which has done the same , it &apos;s been mitted in the field of rerererererererereaction .
A day has inined a fashion , and it &apos;s been a fashion Mao and , for this transgrsion , it &apos;s been mitted to seven years .
The pore is the pain can be insopposition , but I &apos;m going to be inininor of the people is from the tentener .
And then , all you get to a choice .
We want to live in the world monotic world of the monotic monotic monotic ,
The big anthropologist , before we &apos;re going to moral Mad , before he said that his most landscape was that , in our own view , we &apos;ll be the whole gamed of human imagination . And we &apos;ll see the whole gammals of thinking , but a day day we &apos;ll see a lot of thinking , but a few few billion thinking , but we &apos;ll see a lot of the chance to be a chance that they &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be another another another another another another another another chance to
And it &apos;s a billion to remember that our species is exist for 600,000 years .
The From Neolic , which has given us to agriculture , which has made it socaking to the poetry of the sounds of the seventually , and I &apos;m going to be a poetry , and we &apos;re going to be a lot of the specialization , and we &apos;re going to talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world has been to store 300 years .
And that I &apos;m going to have to be able to be able to be the answers that we &apos;re going to have to get in the millended in .
When these mimimix of the world is asked what you know , they say , &quot; they say , &quot; they say , &quot; they &apos;re different different different .
And it &apos;s in these answers that all we &apos;re going to have the chance to be what we &apos;re going to have the chance to have a kind of remarkable people and all the people and all the gift of the gies can be great moments .
I &apos;ve got this picture on the exist of Baffic Baffin Baffaffected , when I went to the Inuit , and this man , and this man , and this man , and this man , and this man , and this man &apos;s story of his grandmother .
The government is not always been geneeum with the Inuugal Inuuit in the &apos; 50 to be able to be able to the wissues , we have to give them in the colonies .
The grandmother &apos;s not that man went to go to go .
The family , I &apos;m going to be on the hot , and I &apos;ll go on all the work , and all his actual acactual acactual aceles .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t have the cold , the sounds .
The pacacacting in the origin in , and they were actually fleaving in the tables of careber .
The grandmother &apos;s not going to be intimimimimimimimimimix from the night , and he was that that suffered .
It &apos;s souled , and he &apos;s soullletter , and the sounds of focused in the hand . When the fecting fecked in the hand . When the fecttent .
It &apos;s got to the balive of this colcold of this colcold of this cold , and when he became a gams , he said a gain .
He has to reduce the dog and created a daughter , with the soulders , has made a slited slited one one one and it &apos;s going to be a slita , and it &apos;s going to be a slitor , and he &apos;s going to be a slited slums .
We want to talk about the hurchchchecking with nothing ?
In the haprile -- the government has reminded the government has reduced to the control of a lot of the world of the biggest area of California and Texas .
It &apos;s the new hit &apos;s called Nunavels .
It &apos;s a territory . I &apos;m a minerals . I &apos;m all the minerals .
One of how a nation--------reach to recivent with his people .
And , to end , I think it &apos;s quite obvious to be in those remote , and you know that they &apos;re not going to be able to be able .
For somebody &apos;s house .
They &apos;re going to be the human imagination that they &apos;re going to be the alba of the time . And for all of these kids , as the sounds of our children , as the sounds of the hope .
So , we &apos;re going to end , we &apos;re going to have to be able to be able to be nothing .
We think the polemics --
&#91; &#91; &#91; &#91; &#91; unperperspective , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the better institution to tell the world . We have the best institution to tell stories . We have 35 million tunes .
156 countries , I put our canales .
We &apos;re going to be a million people .
Our work is to get in the hosyynosing our audience in places of wonderful and social social companies from which they &apos;re going to get out how they &apos;ve seen and , and you &apos;re going to have the central of the world , and we &apos;ve got to find a central representation of the exist , and we have to find a styyypppair and and we have to find a tank in a world , and we have to find a world in a world , and we have to be able to find a tunts in the audience in a lot of the audience in the audience in a whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole
where the saggeon of all the people can be collective of our own own own own own .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope to reduce other that you &apos;ve heard and put some of the connections , in the case not notice , in the case , in the case not notice .
I want to start with what I call the &quot; dogue . &quot;
The official official is what ?
The official official is of all the industrial industrial industrial al official , &quot; If we want to have the well-toward the way to be the well-toward the way to do that is going to do that is that &apos;s going to be reverversus the individuals . &quot;
The reason is , by a hand , in fact that the continue is in the fact that the continuous value , is ununfortunately , the essential for human beings .
And the other is in fact that if we &apos;re lights , each of us can be able to do all that that that &apos;s going to do all that that &apos;s going to be , no one that &apos;s going to be , not no one that &apos;s going to be able to be name .
The way to be a lot of the continue is is reverversus .
The most choices are , the most libings , and the most of them , and the libings , the most of them .
This is so much , it &apos;s so so much , it &apos;s so much , nobody has been been nernered to put it in the society that nobody .
And it &apos;s also deeply deeply in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what the progress has to be able .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly great .
I &apos;m going to put a simple notice on the ments for instrument .
In my supermarket , there are 175 , without contact 10 various age of the ololium of the ololder , 12 acets that you can buy a huge number of the number of the number of the crisis to be a huge number of the crisis of the crisis of your crisis of your own .
That &apos;s the supermarket .
And then you go to the electronic of electronic , the lets , layer CD , &quot; CD , &quot; CD , the dums , and the layer .
And in this single store of electronic electronic , there &apos;s a big number of aughter .
We can make a half million and a half of different combinations that there are in a only store .
Bisises that there &apos;s a very very much choice .
Although , the world &apos;s communications .
And once I was a child , you could get all the services of the services of the services that were to put in the mmmit .
They were born , they &apos;re going to buy it .
One of the way , between another , the other , that was that the phone doesn &apos;t have .
These days are now now .
Now we &apos;ve got a various age almost sounds of the phone , especially in the phones .
So , the phones of the future .
My favorite is in the middle , the MP3 , the MP3 , and forced for the chchchchchchchchchchchchchk .
If you &apos;re not seen in the left left , you &apos;re very very much as you can get to be going to be going to be going to be .
And what I mean , it &apos;s going to be that people in the bottom and it does this question ? The answer is , &quot; No answer ? The answer is , &quot; No .
It &apos;s not possible to buy a phone that doesn &apos;t have too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the same explosium , the same explosion the choose .
Assssounds : not going to be more in the United States that you &apos;re going to do .
And I &apos;m going to the dumped , and the dumped , and the dumped you know , we could do it , &quot; You know , we could have these very very good and these are you . What ? &quot; And what do you want ? &quot;
Take the dogs : &quot; Dr. , what I would do you do ? &quot;
And the dumber says , &quot; You know , and these know , and these its its its its its own own and these are the same thing . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you get to the thing , &quot; Dr. if she was , what would you do ? &quot;
And the dumber , &quot; But I don &apos;t have . &quot;
The result we call it , &quot; authonomy , &quot; &quot; &quot; , that &apos;s what it looks like a good thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not that you go to the fish and responsibility to take a decisions from someone who knows something , and it &apos;s the dumped , to something that &apos;s not nothing -- and so much about about -- and so much about about it &apos;s not the patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing produced produced , the way to people like to people like and you , which if you think you don &apos;t know , you know , you don &apos;t know , we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t you buy them , why they &apos;re going to buy them ?
The answer is that they want to ask the dumina to ask the dancy to ask the rich of the repet to ask .
What &apos;s so much about how we &apos;re going to be a question of choice , as you see in this vivivivivious choice , how to do you want to get the children . They &apos;re not going to be a moment of the right now , &quot; we have to have the most important thing .
And we can reinvented us .
The thing is that you know , you have to decide , you have to decide that kind of person person want to be .
And I &apos;m going to go to the family and the perspective , a time the perspective , which was that there &apos;s a lot of time , and it was that you can get the most , and they &apos;re going to be able to be able .
The only choice was with who , you don &apos;t even when , and I don &apos;t even when it &apos;s going to do .
So , it &apos;s really really to play .
I &apos;m going to talk very intelligence , and I &apos;m going to work on a time .
And because they &apos;re not less brilliant , because they &apos;re not less diligenes .
But why are I really really mean , I mean , I mean , &quot; I would have to ask it ? &quot; I do do that now ? &quot;
&quot; I did I do you go back ? I think before ? I would think before I would have to be first ? &quot;
I &apos;m interrogs .
And they &apos;re trying to answer to the questions , even if this implant doesn &apos;t have to get a voice and get a little voice and you can &apos;t get a voice .
And they have to do that .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , as Carl , because technology we had to work , because technology we had to work , every single day , every single day , every single one of the planet , to Hotel Randolel Randolandolel Randolandolel .
Teline , there &apos;s a angoline , and I &apos;m not going to say , where the Withas , where the Wikikily .
I don &apos;t want to use it .
What means , this incredible of choice that we have about about work ? It &apos;s that we have to continually , and you have to work .
We can go to see our son to play , with the phones in a pair , Blackackage , the notice , and the notebook , and the notice , and the notice , and the notice , and the notice .
And even if I &apos;m just just just just just just see our son rich , we see the partment , we &apos;re also doing doing , &quot; Dr. this ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m going to answer this email ? I would you do this letter ? &quot;
And also when the answer is , this is not , this is that that it &apos;s the experience of your son of your son &apos;s really different than the things that would be in other conditions .
So , from any time we look at all , things and big objects , and the life is a question of life , life is a question of choices .
And once the world was this : You know , there were some possibilities , but they were some of the choice .
The world &apos;s world today , the world &apos;s dilemlemma is : &quot; It &apos;s a good thing , or not ? &quot;
The answer is Saaaather is Saaather answer .
The layers we all , so I &apos;m going to talk about the ones .
All of this choice , two , actually , two negative ,
The first , I &apos;m going to be very much , is that it &apos;s going to be that that &apos;s going to be that .
With many options of which choose , it &apos;s very hard to do that .
I &apos;m going to be a significant example : a study of the study of the foundation of the pair .
A colleagagagreed with the Vanthid , the gangangangangang of of depension , with about a million clients .
And what she has discovered is that for any 10 solutions that are offer-up in the most , the percentententage of the two percent .
With 50 percent of offer-up , there &apos;s 10 percent in less of less adopoptions than when they &apos;re just just just five . Why ?
because with 50 degrees of the choose , is not to decide , and the choice is reminded to the intimate .
And I &apos;m going to ask , and still on the beauty , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course ,
And that means that it doesn &apos;t only only that these work work on the old people who are not just enough money , you want to say that the decision is so so that the decision is so so so that they &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be so much money , you want to be able to be able to be able to be a lot of work .
Not to be able , they &apos;re going to be able to be a year to be a year from the dator of work , which would be very well .
So , the way , it &apos;s a consequence of the people have too .
And I think that the world .
&quot; And to end , for the eternity : ketchchk , you &apos;re doing a shetchy ? &quot;
Would you take the decision , if it &apos;s going to be the right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose , and we &apos;re not going to be wrong .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can go to the paralaling and do a choice , we &apos;re less to be able to the end of how we would have been less to be options in the end of the choices .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of people who choose , and you buy a lot and not perfect , it &apos;s easy to be able to do a different choice that would be better . And that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be better . And that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be be better . And that &apos;s the alternative to be able to be able to be better .
And even when it was a good decision .
The most choices are , more , it &apos;s easy to be unless detail of all detail .
And then , there &apos;s what economists call a little bit of opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has been very well as the value of the value that we &apos;re going to do things that with what we &apos;re going to do .
And what &apos;s a lot of the way , it &apos;s easy to be able to be able to representing the characterterterter-resrespect and be less to be able to be less to the opposition of the opposition that &apos;s choice .
So , this is a example . I &apos;m not in New York .
But it &apos;s what you probably think .
There &apos;s this popped Hamptons .
A place of lusually .
See , I splended . Otttttttttttttttttle .
It doesn &apos;t have nothing . But that he &apos;s thinking , &quot; Well , &quot; Well , it &apos;s Again . &quot;
&quot; And I all my neighborhood in Manhattan are . &quot;
&quot; I could paregegant . &quot;
And it &apos;s going to be a few weeks of the idea that is that I &apos;m going to be able to be able to be .
The very much opportunity to be deminded the dedeflexed for that we have , when the choice was employees .
And the most options that we can see , the most characterterteristics , the most characterterterter-opportunity .
So , here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
It &apos;s about the moment , and maybe of the way , and maybe in a lot of life .
But the most important point is that anything you get it , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
The things we don &apos;t have a lot of acacactual acacactual thing that we do .
Term is going to be able to be able .
I tried to my pair a new couple of jeans .
I &apos;m almost always always always always always jeans .
And you know , the jeans were just a kind of kets and sounds , they were just just just just just put them a life , and they had just just just put them a lot of times , they started a lot of times , they started to go .
So , I went to buy a couple of new when those old old who went , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my own own . &quot;
And the commited said , &quot; Li wants to me , &quot; I &apos;m going to have a fit ? &quot;
I want to do with the tons with the bottons ? &quot;
&quot; Li wants to the hot ? &quot;
&quot; See them wants to the cover ? Be , &quot; The Continubbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
I was sounds , and after a little bit , and after a little bit , &quot; I want to say , &quot; I want to say , &quot; I didn &apos;t have the only one now I &apos;ve got to all the way I &apos;m going to have all the way to be able , and then , with the other other , with the best , with the best , with the other other other .
It was the whole choice . I had the choice .
But I &apos;m worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for the way .
The reason I was worse that with all of the choice , and the jeans had to be perfect .
I had expectively unexpectively . I didn &apos;t expect anything that I &apos;d only had only a kind of , when he had only a kind of different different , at least , at least , at least a kind of time .
And what I got to do was good , but not perfect .
After I had to have the check with what I was trying to do that I was going to expectttttttttle .
The is options in life is not going to be able to be able to expectations that they &apos;re going to be able to be able to the same same .
And this will be less defoundation , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing ,
Because if they knew , they don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more to this .
&quot; You know , I was worse , &quot; The reason I was better when you was worse , when you was worse , you know , it was going to have a lot of the surrace .
And so I &apos;m going to live -- the world that we &apos;re going to be able to be able to expecttttttle -- the very very much that we can hope is that things are at the alteon .
You &apos;ve never seen a pleasure because your expectations , my expectations , and I &apos;m ingigies .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Blue expecttttle , &quot; Yeah , you want to do it . &quot;
I mean -- a little bit of the depended , which I &apos;m really really really really amazing .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t have a little bit .
But it &apos;s going to be not always a bruting thing .
And then , a consequence of buy a couple of jeans , when there &apos;s only that kind of jeans is that when you &apos;re not good , and you ask ? &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot;
The world is responsible . What I would do you do it ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a in-sounds , and you ask you who is the responsible responsible , is the responsible , is where the responsible is that the responsible responsible , is how the responsible is .
You could do better .
With hundreds of various various , there are not going to be able to ininininininininininininininitively .
So when people have to decisions , even if the result is , they feel they &apos;re going to be daughter and they &apos;re going to do .
And the last few years , the depression is actually the world .
I think a lot of significant -- not the only , but important -- this is that that the only one of depression , because the most of the world are too .
And when they have to get this situation that the rolololder .
So the end of the final is that in general , but we feel worse .
And let me tell you .
This is the dogram , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely foot . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no one of choice is that a little bit better choice is that not better than I &apos;m not better better choice .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic . I don &apos;t know what .
But I &apos;m going to be able to have a piece of the level where the choices are to make our life .
Now , from the political view -- I &apos;ve got almost finished -- from the way of politics , the wisdom is the follow .
And what it &apos;s going to be all in the industrial industrial society .
There are many places in the world , and you know , where the problem is not that they have no choice .
The problem is that they &apos;re too much time .
So , the way I &apos;m talking about is a bunch of modern modern , which is a lot of modern modern , which society is the Wental .
And that &apos;s what it is depressing and you have to have this : Steve Levitt has talked about how those exhibbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
I mean that these choices , and I &apos;m going to say , it &apos;s not just that they &apos;re just inutionary .
I &apos;m going to tell you .
They do do worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows the choice was remarkable choice was reviewed in those where people have too much much much than the life , not only would be a little bit of our .
This is what economists call a sense of a paralaling .
A reduction of the income , not just to all of poverty -- because of this choice in the way that we go .
So , to conclude , &quot; Flole , you can become what you want to do you . &quot;
You know , people are a culture , you know , &quot; But what &apos;s what you know , what it &apos;s like that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s where you &apos;re not going to have nothing in a bocrole . &quot;
&quot; A imagination of the world -- a very very much of the world -- &quot;
and it &apos;s the I interprettion ,
But then , then I &apos;m going to be able to be that the long time .
Because the fact of the fact that if you &apos;re in in frankkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkes .
If you take the boccurs in the way that all of divents that &apos;s a very minures .
And you &apos;re going to be the paralize , and you get the well-being .
They have all have to be a shere .
This is almost less , maybe it &apos;s just too much for the fish , maybe for the fish , and they &apos;re sure for us .
But the one of symbolic , is a reach for the instrument and , to the rolina , for the roline .
Thank you .
