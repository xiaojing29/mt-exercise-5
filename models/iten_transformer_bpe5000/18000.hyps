Last year I showed these slide slide slide to demonstrate that the arglacial calculus , which is about three million years has had the size of 48 United States continents , the size of 48 percent .
But this underground underground gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show it in the ice of the ice of ice .
The artica is , in a sense , the heart of global climate system .
It &apos;s inverse and retreat the summer .
The next slide is going to be a related carrying on the last 25 years .
The glaces are reached in red .
You can see , you see , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
That &apos;s the inverter , which is a summer , which is a summer ritier .
You can see that the constitute of five years or more , or more , is like the blood , which is there &apos;s a blood , which is like the body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s gone from that , so .
This is a problem because the rewarming land around the artic ocean , where there are huge amounts of coal ocean where there are huge amount of coal , which , skiing , they &apos;re transtransform in meters .
I &apos;m going to be able to the total of the atmospheric pollution to global warming , that amount of could doubling , super-point point of not around .
In some lahi , very deep in Alaska metan is already refer from water .
The Katey Walter Walter of the University of Alaska is recently print , it &apos;s recently with a low-to-to-winter team .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Wow &apos;s good . The question is if we &apos;re also going to be that .
And that &apos;s why it &apos;s the ground , the Groenland from north .
This is a river in regime .
And the portation had never reached levels like .
This is the Kangerlussuademic , in the south-overs .
If you want to know how the sea level of sea , you &apos;re going to know how the sea reference on land , here is where the sea .
These currents are increasing fast .
On the other part of the planet : Antares , the largest block of ice on the planet .
Last month scientists have delared that the balance of ice is in negative , and that the West Antarctttica , which pogy on some submarine , is particularly quick in the sun .
That &apos;s a half meters of the foot , like Groenland .
Sull Himalayas , the third largest block of ice , you see new lakes , which a few years ago was glaciers .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population revenue of the water water from that smom .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of water water .
The ported is increased .
But when it decreates , the same happens to the same happens to the power .
In California , the snow on the Sierra Nevada is deminuity of 40 percent .
The hyries are in cripes .
The predictions , as you read , they &apos;re graces .
The growing safe in the world leads to a remarkable increase in inceness .
The environmental disaster are increasing to a rhythm out of normal and without previous .
Four times more more than the last 30 years I was going to be the last 30 years I was going to be the last 30 years I was going to be the last 30 years I &apos;m going to be more than the last 30 years I &apos;d respect to 75 years than the last 30 years I &apos;d respect to 75 .
This is a kind of unsustainable .
If you look at it in the historic context , you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the time , the Pacific area , the Americans , from the Americans , to the United States of the subcontinent , where there &apos;s a royal root of the subcontinent on the ocean .
The greater cause of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossil fuels .
The oil is a problem , and coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two of the more emissions , and China .
And it was to build a lot of other central central central .
But we &apos;re seeing a change of direction .
These are annullate projects in the last years and some alternative proposes .
At any way , there &apos;s a political in our country .
And the coal and oil industrial is speso 250 million dollars in the last year to promote coal , which is a bone .
And that picture would reminded me something --
I &apos;m Natal , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion liers of coal .
You may have seen it on the news .
This is the second largest flow of the last flow in America .
It &apos;s happened around Natal .
And the coal ads of one of the industrial industrial .
Video : See , the carbon ♫ ♫ is a kind of allegry and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and growing our economy .
It &apos;s more clean and more clean is more clean .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and the working working on the world .
Al Gore : From here is a big part of the West Virginia .
The largest minerary society is Massey Coal . This is his administrator . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I &apos;ll be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosy , Harry Reid Pelosy -- don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima Protection of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Attore : At the TALergy we see the climate change as a threat at at our business .
And so , for our priority is to invest a large amount of money in a public effort to make public and confused the coal truth on .
In fact , coal is not spork .
We think it &apos;s clean -- it also also a good profumo .
So you don &apos;t pre-climate change .
Let me go .
Video : Attore : Carbone clean -- you &apos;ve heard about it very much .
So , let &apos;s take a turn in a structure at the avanating for how to pulit coal .
Straordinarian !
The coal consumer is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology that you see changes everything .
Take a look at : this is the hdiern technology .
Al Gore : The end , the positive alternative alternative . You can connect to economic security .
Video : America is in crisis ; the national security , the national security , climate crisis .
The filter that the link that the link to all of our dependence from fossil fuels , like the coal and oil .
Now , there &apos;s a new , audace solution to use circuit .
Real America : 100 percent clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to remate to the work , to make us more safe , and help stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that basts to solve our problems .
Real . You &apos;re more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Complan : It &apos;s about re-energy to America .
One of the faster ways of getting the faster dependence of fuel that killing our planet .
Comparsa : The future is here . Good , the future is here .
Comparsa : Nice investing for well-retributed jobs .
Complan : Real America . It &apos;s time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old African proverbio says , &quot; If you want to go fast , go to the faster , you go to the faster .
If you want to go away , you go together . &quot;
We need to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I did a introduced on the LHC .
And you promising back to the back to you to the way the car works .
So , I &apos;m here . And for those other time , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever tried -- 27 kilometers of circumconference .
His task is to re-re-re-presents of a second second from the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
That &apos;s just environmental .
This is the car under Ginevra .
We &apos;re going to be the rhythm of these mini-Big Bang inside the rilevators .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLATLAS -- is largo to 144 meters .
This is an show of ATLATLAS in construction that you can see the proportions .
The 10 September of last year we have acceso the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken from ATLAS .
It was because of immense festhate in control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first fascinating of particles that had done all around the LHC , deliberately , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles inside the LHC , and spreading in the styer .
In other words , when we see that image the 10 September , we realized that the machine worked , which is a great vittory vittory .
I don &apos;t know if it was going to get us to exduce more or this , when somebody went on Google and saw that the page was this .
That means we have had cultural impact beyond that scientific impact beyond that scientific .
About a week later , there was a problem with the car , had to just these filters here -- these dored files .
These files bring 13,000 ampampating when the car works at the very much of the power .
Now , the technical technical , and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . I &apos;m just too much , I &apos;m too good . &quot;
And instead of doing it because when they &apos;re very cold of become the constained superconducted .
So , at less 271 degrees , to a lower temperature at that space between stars , these files can bring that current .
In one of the giunture between the most novel magnetic in the LHC , there was a fair defect .
So , the files that are surrounded up , and the 13,000 ampards suddenly met an electricity .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think about think that these magnees are more than 20 tons , and that moved from about 30 centimeters .
They &apos;re damaged about 50 magnetic magnetic .
We had to take them , what we did .
We have repristine and wandering .
They &apos;re now coming back to their underground .
I &apos;m going to be a new integrate .
We &apos;re going to go , and we expect to juggling data or the dry , and continue to continue our adventure to find what the universe is .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these crasing crasing the value of science and engineering engineering engineering . It &apos;s very easy to confuture . It &apos;s easy to contain .
I think the fact that &apos;s so hard , the fact that &apos;s the value of things like LHC .
I &apos;d like to end with the words of a scientist Inglad , Humphrey Davy , which , I guess , in the defense of his clean , his clean , his clean was Michael Faray , he said , &quot; Nothing is so dangerous for the progress of human mind as the human mind as the reritenenenenenenenenenencountery , and that doesn &apos;t have a new monic , and that doesn &apos;t have a quick mong . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start asking for rethink about when , by children , you play with kids , you play with the morning .
While you &apos;re caped as reaching them and reach them , and move them , and you know , you know , you know , actually , and by manipulating relations .
The spatial reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , by the useful information of our interaction with physical objects , with physical objects , together to my consultant , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking asking me , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of having the only treatment of mouse as a pass , we can have the only treatment of mouse as a digital , we can deflow on a desktop , we can actually have to be able to affect sure that it &apos;s because it &apos;s actually made of information with both of both of both hands on a desknifution-insum ,
and it to our pleasure ?
And the question was so interesting thing that we decided to explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big interactive computer as a biscan .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big interactive computer as a biscan .
You can move with your hand , you can see , &quot; you can see , &quot; in their own , feel the movement and they have a screen and a radio wireless .
But overwhelmed , they &apos;re physical objects , like the morning , you can just move them to do it .
The Siftable is an example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physical , aware of the right movement , and as they become more physical , and as they become more physicists , aware of the movement , of other , of the other , of the other , of how we can explore them , we can explore new and fun of interaction .
I &apos;m going to try to start with some simple example .
This Sifty is configured to show video : if you cline it in a direction , the video will rotate it so if you start from the other hand back back .
These interactive portraits are aware of other .
If I relief them , they &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re going to be around .
If they &apos;re surrounded , and they can act a little bit .
If they &apos;re surrounded , and they can act a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting interesting implications of the interaction was able to use common gestures on data , to say , &quot; a color as if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurate like green , and I can use them to use them to use it in the central , where they &apos;re missing .
and I can use them to use it to the color in that where they &apos;re missing .
And there &apos;s too , we can get a little bit of it .
You &apos;re also becoming to learning , as the languages , like the languages , the mathematics and logic games where people can try and see the results immediately .
Now I &apos;m --
This is a Fibonacks that I do with a a equations program .
Here we have a game of words that &apos;s in half of Scarabeo and Boggle .
It &apos;s basically , to every turn one of the Sifkily , Prtually , in every Siftool , and you &apos;re trying to get a letter to case on every Siftttextent . And while you &apos;re trying to understand him on a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds remissing , and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
There &apos;s the kids came to the Media Lab , I did it in a way that I went and I went to a video .
They were very much .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of applied is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
You just have to say , &quot; You know , &quot; You know what to do .
There &apos;s other people who try it .
This is our beta younger tester , there on the right .
And it was actually just flip them .
They &apos;re just morning , for him .
Now , this is an apapplan of an interactive cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool for learning . He &apos;s called Felix . He &apos;s Felix .
It can be able to put new characters in the scene , solving the Siflavery .
It can be able to put new characters in the scene , solving the Siflavery .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : The sun is sisting .
David Merrill : Now he took a treatment in the scene .
Video : The arananange treatment .
Bel work ! Yes !
So , you shake the Siftip and put them close them , can be able to interact characters --
Video : Well , you know , you know .
-- by inventing your story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a very open story with open , and it can decide him as you go .
DM : It &apos;s a very open story with open , and it can decide him as you go .
Video : Vola , gat .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , to do a recent , to take to championing and execting music .
It &apos;s a tool , which is a recently , to championing and execting music .
The Siflower here ags like the bottom , and the battery .
Each one of these four different variations , and you can choose what .
You can also also also put these sounds in a sequence to compose your pleasure .
And then we just change it by doing touch a sound and a sequence . &quot;
These are actually that you can control from alive , like the reverse and the filter .
The acks to a particular sound and then incline for a particular .
And then there are general effects as time and volume , that are applied to the entire sequence .
Let &apos;s look at how it works .
Video : We &apos;re going to try and put a base in two Sifkiftning , &quot; we put it in a series , we put it in a series , we add , we add other basic .
I &apos;m going to put a low-line .
Video : Now I adding of percussions --
Video : And now I &apos;ll put the filter of the battery to the battery effect , so I can control the effect of alive .
Video : I can &apos;t quick to the entire sequence of inclining the entire time from one side or another .
Video : And now I &apos;m going to add the bottom to the bottom to give more expression .
Video : I can remate the sequence &quot; to the volo .
So I didn &apos;t have to planning it before , but I can suddenly , make it more , or more corta .
And now , finally , I can smoking the entire sequence of inclining on the left Sifkiftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new human interfaces , more more more more resemble as the brain work .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab .
And the concept I want to transmit is that we &apos;re going to get this new generation of objects that we want to interact with digital media , which will bring information in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the now of talking to everybody .
I &apos;m a writer .
I &apos;m going to write about this is my profession , but it &apos;s more of that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the fascinating of my life .
And I don &apos;t look like it can change .
But , said , something that particular happened recently in my life and my career , which led me to reef to recalibrate the entire relationship with this work .
And the particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called &quot; Mangia , Prega , &quot; which , diversity from my previous books , for some reason came out in the world and became a big , sensational , bestseller .
And the result is that everywhere now , people treatment like I was conducted .
It &apos;s true -- conducted , conducted !
They are now all concerned about me and they say , &quot; You didn &apos;t fear to do it better ?
You don &apos;t fear to continue to write all of life without the more to be able to create a book that can importance to somebody ? &quot;
what can you care about somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s resurrounding , you know .
But it could go worse , at that part of that I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was an adolescent .
I was going to be based on the same reaction .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you have success to have success ?
You don &apos;t fear that the uliance of refer you killed ?
You don &apos;t fear to do this to be constitute for all of life out of a sevil of dreams with the bow of every infrond with the mouth of failure ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
I &apos;m afraid of all of those things .
I always had fear .
And I also fear of many other things that people can &apos;t inform .
And as the algae and other things .
But , as I write that what I thought and I ask me , and I ask me , what &apos;s why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logic that anybody who should expect to be frightened by a work that you &apos;ve been born with to do .
But what &apos;s there so particular , in the creative companies to make us nervous about the mental health health as as a few other carefully they do they don &apos;t do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don &apos;t remember one only in his 40 years of activity in which was asked if he had to be engineer ?
There was never -- that stuck of the engineer John , how do it goes ?
It wasn &apos;t working like this , you know ?
Onestly , chemicals like a group don &apos;t have certainly in the centuries , which is reputation of being alolized maniacate depressed .
We have a writers , we have enough to this reputation , and not just a writers , but we have this reputation of being enormous instabonally unstable instabgmentally unstable instabove .
And it &apos;s not going to look at the trad of the magnification of creative magnifies that , only in the twentieth century , they die , and they &apos;re often going to die and often .
And the ones that don &apos;t seem to be really sophistories seem to be really disappeared by their dones .
Norman Mailer , before to die , in the last interview said , &quot; Every book has killed me a little more . &quot; A great business about my work .
But we don &apos;t throw when we feel it because we heard these things so long that we heard of these things that we &apos;ve been all all all the way we have completely interiorized and clearly are in some way , and that art , at the end , will always constraint to the corn .
And the question I want to take to take everybody here today is : you agree with this idea ?
That &apos;s what -- because it &apos;s also about it , because it &apos;s also about a distance to me not well for anything that supposition .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous , and I don &apos;t want to see the perpepepeoples in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better encourage our big creative creative minds to live .
And I know that , in my case -- in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start to fight to my own own bone of the surrounces , whose surrounces , I &apos;m in my career .
That &apos;s -- you look , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m like 40 years .
I &apos;ve got about four work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely to write what I &apos;m going to write about now , and then it &apos;s going to be judicted from my last book .
I &apos;m going to be slavor , because we &apos;re all more or less friends here -- is likely that my greatest success is to my big split .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thought that &apos;s going to take a person to start dating in the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would keep on doing this work that we work that we love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it seems to me , after a lot of reflective , which is to work to continue to write is to create a psychological construct , OK ?
I have to find a distance of security between me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxiety of what I &apos;m writing is going to get . And while I was trying to look for all last year , I &apos;m trying to look through the time , I &apos;m trying to see if they could have better better , and I &apos;m trying to find more and more subject ideas and more and more and more and becoming ideas .
about how to help people to deal with the unerents of creativity .
And that research has taken me to the ancient Great and ancient Rome .
You &apos;re going to do it because I come back .
In the ancient ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity sell creativity sell from men , OK ?
And it was thinking that creativity was this spirit looks like , and that sell men from a few distant different , and unknown for men from a few distant and unknown .
The Green called these spirits divins the looks at creativity .
Socrate , wonderful , he believed to have a demon that elargive saggees from away .
Romani were the same idea , but they called that kind of spirit without a genius .
The Romani is great , because Romani didn &apos;t really think a genius was a intelligent .
They believe that a genius was this kind of divine entity that was living in literally living in the walls of a neighborhood , a little bit like the elsewhere element is constrained , and that came out of the work of the artist , and to model the output of that work .
Here &apos;s a big thing -- here , that &apos;s the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological construction that you &apos;re protected by your work .
And everybody knew it was so that it worked , right ?
So , the antic artists were protected by certain things , like the way , too narcism , right ?
If your work was excetional , you couldn &apos;t take it all the deserved , everybody knew that she was helped by this genius .
If your failure work , it wasn &apos;t all your fault , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a incapable .
And so people have to concept creativity in Western &apos;t do much time .
Then the Renhaissed and everything , and it &apos;s going to go and nacure this big idea ; we put the human being in the center of the universe over all of the mysters and without more to leave space at the mitic creatures that write detailed by the divinity .
This was the rational principle and people started thinking about thinking that creativity came to think creativity came from from idivide .
And for the first time in history , you start to reference this artist , as a rather than a genius , rather than a person with genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think it allow somebody , a simple person to believe that they &apos;re like a recient as a source , and sistence and sistence the source and sisters of the mysters , unknown and unknown etherns and a lay too big to give to the pite pite of human pounds .
It &apos;s like to ask somebody of ingoing the sun .
It &apos;s details and destores all of the ingrestations on the performance .
And I think it was that pressure to destroy artists in the past 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think it &apos;s , and I think it &apos;s now , and now ?
Can we do it diversity ?
You can go back to a more ancient understanding of human relationship between humans and mystery creative .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can &apos;t get to be able to excellate 500 years of thinking in a 18 minutes .
And probably people in the audience that solving would be reading scientific suspects on the notion of the notion of , they make people fit on their own projects .
And I &apos;m probably going to convince you all about this thing .
But the question I &apos;d like to take is -- why isn &apos;t it ?
Why don &apos;t you think about this way ?
Because it has more sense of anything else that has ever heard to explain the exasperating imprevedibility of the creative process .
And so , as anyone who has ever attempted to do something -- so , basically , you don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t know rationally .
And in fact , it can sometimes seem to be very paranorormess .
I did this very recently , with the wonderful poetry of the wonderful poetry of the Ruth Stone , which has now been a pot for all life and said to me in his childhood in the Virginia , and he heard it in the fields , and I heard it in the fields , and I heard it in the landscape .
He said , it was like a train of air .
And that was roling to the landscape .
And it was able to be , because he could make the land under its feet .
He knew to have one thing to do to do at that point and was , his words , &quot; run like a matta . &quot;
And so correcal goes back to the house and it was followed to this poetry , and it wouldn &apos;t have to take a piece of paper and a math faster , as the trapp , and it &apos;s going to pick it up and erring it on the page .
Sometimes I couldn &apos;t be fast , so correcal and correcal , and correcal without getting getting to go to home and correcal poetry and get it so he would continued to rotate through and her performed through the landscape , looking for , as she said , &quot; another few few . &quot;
And then there were those times -- this piece I won &apos;t forget that -- there was moments where it was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was trying to paper and the poetry and card it up , and he said , that she was going , and he said , that she was going on , and then he said , that it was like halling with the other hand and the office .
And it was a poetry from and put it in his body and transmitted it on the page .
And in these cases , poetry is presented on the perfect page and intact , but at the contrary , from the last word to the first word .
So when I heard it -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly ugual to my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- it &apos;s not a conducucucucucture .
I &apos;m a mulo , and my way of working is ; I wake up to the same orary every day and to work and work on the sweet .
But I &apos;m just just in my aggin , I strike up against that thing , sometimes .
And I guess , even a lot of you , the han done .
You know , even though the work and ideas came to me from a certain source , I couldn &apos;t honestly know it .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it to it , and , rather , that , what makes us to stay up to us ?
And as I think about , the best example of the same contemporary example I have is the Tom Waits , which I interviewed different years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the largest part of of life is the incarnation of the artist of life was reported , to control , to be able to control , to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to interiorized .
But then invecked , he hot , and he was driving on a self-building in Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
And it was fast and all of a sudden , and it &apos;s a little piece of melodia , which comes in his head as a inspiration , and it &apos;s halling , and you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the desider , but it doesn &apos;t know how to take it .
It doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a mature .
So it starts to feel this kind of old anxiety of the old anxiety , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose it .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to be in the panic , you &apos;ll stop .
And I &apos;ll put the entire mental process and made something completely new .
He just looked at the sky and said , &quot; Sorry , don &apos;t see that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Do you look at a song ?
If you really want to be able to be able to be more than you can take care of it .
Altrain , you &apos;re going to importing somebody else today .
You can disturbing Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And the work process changed after this .
Not the work , the work was still still still hoscure .
But the process , and the fish that was removed that the genius was removed when the genius , the genius who was going to be able to get it -- and I went to go back to where it was , making it was not interorized thing that it was interorized , and I was doing it was interized , and I was able to be an interorized thing .
But it &apos;s got this peculiar , wonderful , wonderful , a conversation between Tom and this thing that &apos;s kind of strange and that &apos;s outside .
So , as I felt that story how to change a little bit of the way I worked and already saved me once .
This idea , I &apos;ll save me when I was writing , &quot; Man , &quot; and fall in one of those cave of the disperation of the cave of the disperation we &apos;re all working on something and we don &apos;t have and we can &apos;t start thinking that that will be the worst book .
Not just bad , right ?
And I started thinking about this project .
But then I remember to Tom that I talked to the air and I tried to do it .
So I got my face on on the manoscritical and I took my comments to a room of the room .
And I said , &quot; Well , you know , what &apos;s going to both know that if this book is not going to be brilliant , it &apos;s not going to be a blame , right ?
Because I &apos;m seeing I &apos;m putting all that I &apos;m not going to do more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to talk and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what I don &apos;t do it .
I &apos;m going to use to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I would like to be recorded that I &apos;m presented to me to do my part , &quot; because , at the end is so , OK -- centuries does in the deserts of the North Africa people were dance , the people went on on on the host of the dance of lone , dance and I &apos;d like to say , &quot; I &apos;m going to be recorded that I &apos;m going to be recorded that I &apos;m going to be recorded that I &apos;m going to be recorded that I &apos;m going to be recorded that I &apos;m going to be recor
And they were always magnifigures , because the ballerers were and fantastic .
But every single , rare , something happened , and one of these artists became actually transcendent reality .
And I know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know that you &apos;ve all seen , at a point , a performance .
It was like the time stopped , and the ballerin , and it was not doing anything different from the usual , and it was not something else else else , but all of it was going to be able .
And suddenly , you know , you know , it &apos;s a human .
But it &apos;s accurate from the divinity in the fire of divinity .
And when this happened , people knew what was , people knew what was , they called it .
They said , &quot; Allah , and they started to sing , &quot; Allah , Allah , God , God , &quot; God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curious note historic -- -- when the Mororest of Southern , I preserve this abitude with them and the ready to change in centuries , Allah , Allah , &quot; Ole , &quot; I &apos;m still able to hear in the corride or flash-famenco .
In Spagen , when a artist did something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , I got , I &apos;m like , &quot; Allah , I &apos;m like , &quot; unlike , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Haly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Haly , I &apos;m going to be able and magic , &quot; Alah , &quot; I &apos;m going to be a magic , &quot; Man , &quot; Go , I &apos;m going to be able artist , &quot;
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But the problem comes next day , for the dance of the same , when you wake up and find that are the 11 of Martedday , and I found it was the last last morning and I don &apos;t have more .
It &apos;s just a big dead with a lot of ginoccurred , and maybe it &apos;s not going to be able to each other .
And maybe nobody will dg the name of God still while , and what &apos;s going to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most pain reconciliations to make in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so corosciant if you can &apos;t believe , advanced , which is the most amazing aspects of your being .
But just believed that you &apos;re data in prestired by a unimaginable source of this team of your life that &apos;s where you have to go to somebody else when you ended up .
And , you know , if we think of this way it changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s certainly like I thought for different months in the working of the book that I &apos;m going to be able to preserve , the dangerous dangerous , I attespan , I &apos;m going to be able to be able to be able to my great great great deal with my great great deal with .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel electrized from this is , I don &apos;t fear .
Not at the end . It &apos;s just your work .
Continua present-arts for your part , whatever it can be .
If your job is to balling , you &apos;re dance .
If the divine , absurd on you get a decide to leave some of wonderful , for a few wonderful time , for a only time through your effort , then &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Otherwise , you do it same dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot; to you . &quot;
I think it &apos;s weak to teach it .
&quot; Ole ! &quot; to you that same , even only for having the testablishesty of testables to show you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
And as you know , I &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects on the human genes , on what can mean and the discovery of new set .
We &apos;re now beginning to digital ital , we started digitize biology and now now starting from that digital code in a new phase of biology , we &apos;re coming in a new phase of biology , designing and synthesizing life .
We &apos;ve always been trying to take big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists , I think they &apos;re trying to find various levels .
We &apos;ve tried different approaches , reducing it to the minimi .
We &apos;re digitized by almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the analogy world &apos;s biology in the digital world .
Now , we ask , we can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is a map of a small organism , the Mycoplasm genitalium , which is the smallest species from the smallest genome that can authoreplicate in the lab .
And we tried to reduce that genome to create a smaller more small .
We can actually take a hundred genes of genes that are here .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our .
Credemic , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can get out , one at the time , it &apos;s very improbable that it can bring to a living cell .
So we decided that the only one on designers to synthesize this chromosome chromosome in a way to change the components to take some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of &quot; Can we synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Can you have the chemical to make these big molecules that we never have been able to create before ?
And in case , we can make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemical material .
The speed with which we &apos;re able to digitize life is growing up to exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , designers , instead , it &apos;s going to be improving .
And our most recent results the exponential curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
And it required a lot of passages , starting with a bioethics before we start with a bioethics before we start .
But we found out that synthesize is very difficult .
There &apos;s tens of thousands of cars in the world that producing small segments , of the long of 30 to 50 letters and it &apos;s a degenerative process : more segment is , more mistakes there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments and correct the errors .
And this was our first attempty , to start by digital information from the Phi 174 .
It &apos;s a small virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the framments , we &apos;ve designed the correction of errors and get a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
And the interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material , and we put it in bacteria , the bacteria have started reading this genetic code and make it a viral code and make viral particles .
The viral particles were then left from cells , and they &apos;re going back back and they destroy .
I talked about recently with the members of the oil industry to say that they have certainly started to understand this model .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build its hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things larger .
We wanted to build the entire chromosome .
They &apos;re more than 580 thousand genetic code .
So we thought we &apos;re thinking to build it in casses of the size of the virus , so we can change casses to understand what the components of a living cell .
The design is critical , and we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard of a mistake for every 10 midst of the basis .
We found , resequence it , 30 . If we used that original sequence . If we used that original sequence we didn &apos;t have ever been able to work .
One part of the process is designing slow-to-to-to-to-to-to-grasses with all of other segments of 50 letters to build smaller underounity that working together .
We &apos;re going to take unic elements here .
You probably have read that we &apos;ve read that we put the fligrgrain .
Think about it . We have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters together , they &apos;re going to get up about 20 amminoacids , and there &apos;s a specific order of letter to every amateur .
So we can use the genetic code to write , frass , thoughts .
What we did was self-done in the beginning is self-reformed .
Some are delused by the fact that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
We designed these segments to be able to simply simply join with enzymes .
There &apos;s a enzymes that they &apos;re going to get them together .
And we started assembling parts , and we start with segments from five to seven to seven to a letters , to be a segments of 24 mile to the gasses of 24 mile , to put them to 72 .
And we &apos;ve made these segments in abundance , so we can sequence them because we &apos;re trying to create a very good process that we &apos;re trying to create a very good process that we &apos;re going to see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems to be the tabellon of a baskin .
When we get these very long segments , more than 100 basis , more than 100 basis , they &apos;re not going to grow more directly in E.
You get to the modern molecular biology .
So we &apos;ve considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called reomologist called reomologist , which is useful to repair the DNA to be able to keep the DNA that can be able to keep segments .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , named Deinococcus radiodurans , can absorb three million rad .
You can see in high high riquick as his chromosome is destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours it &apos;s reassembled exactly as it was before .
There &apos;s thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be completely secure .
They can live under vacuum .
They &apos;re absolutely absolutely sure life in space , and you can find new remarkable environments .
And it &apos;s going to say , NASA showed that this is .
This is a picture of molecule that we built using these processes , simply using the lievity with the appropriate design of the appropriate design .
The hell them automatically .
This picture was not taken taken with a microscope microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It &apos;s a very big molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the publishing publishing that we did a little time ago .
They &apos;re more than 580,000 letters .
It &apos;s the largest molecule of a defined structure that ever created by man .
It has a high molecular weight .
If we &apos;re pass it with a careage 10 without spaces , you would like 142 pages only to transform this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ? How can we acknowledge it ?
Of course , of course , you know , you know , it &apos;s a game .
It &apos;s a little more complicated when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s easier to do it , even when it &apos;s eucariote , you can just get the nuclear and put another , which is basically the process of clonation .
In the archaea , chromosome is instead of integrated inside the cell , but we &apos;ve recently demonstrate that we &apos;re able to do a complete trapion of a chromosome from one to another and acting it .
We can clean a chromosome from a microbial cromosome .
The two are different than men from mice .
We add a few gene in a more way to decide what to choose for this chromosome .
And then he skip with the enzymes in a way to kill all protine .
And when we put it in the cell is studied -- and you open our graph -- and you &apos;ll open up our so-the-the-ic-exhibition is gone inside the cell .
And we were thinking that we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried it anymore in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that tantissim , they add a second or a third chromosome somewhere , I add in a second thousands of new traits to that species .
So , who thinks about evolution as a only gene to change that it doesn &apos;t understand much much of biology .
There &apos;s a enzymes called &quot; restrial frestrial that to make digit .
The chromosome that was in the cell , it doesn &apos;t have one .
The chromosome that we have put it on the hell .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other chromosome as a material , and it got it , and we found out with only the cell and the new chromosome .
It &apos;s become blue because of the genes that we put it .
And in a short short lash of time , all the characteristics of a species , and it turned around around a new species , based on the new software that we put in the new software that we put in the cell .
All protected is , memories are changed , and when we read the genetic code exactly exactly what we &apos;ve transfer to exactly what we transfer you &apos;ve transfed .
Now , this could seem to be genetics , but by allowing the software can change things in a very substantial way .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that here is not about genesis -- but progress from three million years and a half years of evolution , and a half of evolution , and I said , maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion that &apos;s going to be created new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s very obvious when we think about our needs .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right ? For example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for every one of the planet for 40 years , there &apos;s four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find food , fresh and clean , medical medical and gas for six billion people .
It &apos;s going to be even more to do it for nine billion .
We &apos;re going to start more than five billion coal , more than 30 billion barrelates .
That means percent million barrelates a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replace them , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
And we need to understand all of CO2 emission from these materials that end up in the atmosphere .
And in today , thank you to the scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the components of the future .
The electronic industry has only only only one dozen about components , and you think about how many different things came out .
Our limits here are data in the biological reality and from our imagination .
Now we have now , we have to these techniques of synthesization , able to create what we call a combinatory genomics .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think about processing these 20 million genes of different genes of trying to optimize the processes of making it options , new vaccines , we can change , because of a small team , and create more molecular biology than over the last 20 years .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemical production or fuel production , or fuel production , etc .
This is an ancient instant of some software programmed on which we &apos;re working on to be able to seat us and design species at computers .
Well , we don &apos;t necessarily know how they &apos;re going to be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
We &apos;re now concentrating on the fuel coal .
You also see that extract on the grain was an experiment , it &apos;s been a hurt experiment .
We have a second second and third generation that &apos;s using a lot of zuck , which is going to be on on the sugar , or different types of butanol .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increase the increase of the food and limestone of them , and limestone of it would be to turn the CO2 in matter before , so we &apos;re working on to design cells that can achieve this goal , and we think we can have the first coal of fourth generation in about 18 months .
The combined sunlight with CO2 is a metododowntown -- but in our discoveries around the world , we have found different metods .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It &apos;s going to be in the deep ocean , about 2,500 meters of the water .
They create metane from CO2 using molecular hydrogen using molecular energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand whether we can incanalate CO2 , which can easily transported through your bones , convert that CO2 in coal , to drive this process .
So , we think we might be able to increase what the question of what life is , &quot; what life is &quot; is &quot; where we , versus &quot; is we , versus -- we have the modest goal of the entire chemistry industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can you do you do it ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And so we &apos;re working on to use the same methods to create instantaneous vaccines .
You know , you know , we &apos;re always forth of a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s about to find the right vaccine .
I think that you can change change building combinable vaccine in anticize .
That &apos;s how the future may start to look change , now , the tree of evolution , accellate evolution with synthetic bacteria , arches , and then then then enjoy cells .
We &apos;re so much to improve people .
Our purpose is to do in a way of living enough to try to do it . Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
Before all I &apos;m going to show you , the most quickly possible , some fundamental work , the new technology that we took Microsoft in the follow of a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s a environment where you can interact is local level that remode with a huge amount of visual data .
Here we &apos;re seeing a lot of digital photograph with a kind of digital photograph with a kind of a constant and continue , for a fast panoramic , by the images as we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these collects data are , or images .
Most of the digital photographs , but this for example is a provenient from the Biary of Congress , and I &apos;m going to go to the Congress , and I get into the gamma of 300 megapixel .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that limit the presents of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any moment . It &apos;s also a very flexel architecture .
This is a whole book , for example of data doesn &apos;t have images .
This is the Chestry of Dickens . Every column . Every column .
To show you that it &apos;s just about textbook and not to show you that , to see what &apos;s about a real representation of the textbook , not of a photo .
It may be a little artificial way to read a little artificial book .
I don &apos;t have the advice .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s about a number of The Guardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you a pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading the real carronic version of a journal , which is for a multiple kind of a half of a half .
We also have something with the corner of this number of The Guardian .
We &apos;ve created a high-resolution resolution resolution -- -- much more high than what it uses in a normal publishing is -- and we put it in the content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to get out of the limits of space on the screen .
And we hope that it means to put people in the people , and to get some of them to the people , I didn &apos;t have to be able .
Of course , mapaps is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say that we have to give you even in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States subrapted over a geospatial picture of NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually from alive on the web ; you can go to see it .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which fight two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and another is a visual research at the other side of the Nah Snavely , a student of the University of Washington , with the help of Steve Seadrice and Research Szeliski Research . A great great collaboration .
And it &apos;s from the webs-up , I &apos;m in the web .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from another and have this kind of experience of resolution and have this kind of simpest experience .
But the spatial location of images here actually a meaning .
And the algorithms of the computer , they recorded these pictures together , so that correspond to the re-places that the remain places that the imagined in which imagined -- all sorts close to the Grasis on the Montagne Roccious . So you see , you see . So , you see , you see , and these things are all spatial level .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There &apos;s a lot more spatial .
I want to go directly to one of the original data set of Noah-year-old data &apos;s going to work for the first time prototosynth that we &apos;ve done to work for the first time the summer -- to show you what I think is really the key behind this technology , Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily evidence that we &apos;ve put in the website .
We had to worry about the legal aspects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of Nobody &apos;s Caan &apos;s reconstruction of Nobody Damond &apos;s &apos;s digit . You can have three Damond in Flickr , and you get pictures of these campus and and then on . Once one of these boundaries , and then you &apos;re looking at one of these boundaries that &apos;s discovering this model .
So , they &apos;re all images made from Flickr and they were all spatial level in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this very simplicity .
You know , I &apos;d never thought to end to work for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifically receiving this kind of accounting here .
I think you can see that this is a lot of different types of photocamers : from those phones of the professionals . A significant number , a significant number , that they have a significant number , to put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to try to look at those more strange .
Many stuck by faces , etc .
There &apos;s a series of photographs -- and there &apos;s a series of photographs --
This is a Nobody poster of Nothing .
We can go from the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is taking data from the entire collective memory of how to appear the Earth , from the entire collective memory , from visible point -- and link all of those data together .
All those pictures become connected together , more than the sum of parts .
You have a model of the entire land that emerge .
Think about this as the prolungation of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as people use it , and the advantages of people use it .
Their photos are marched with admit from other people .
If you &apos;re looking at all these data , and then I &apos;m going to say , my photograph of the Nothing &apos;s photograph of Nobody &apos;s cattedge , and I can use it as a sudden stairs , and I can use it as a place to be ingress in that space , in that metaphor , using the photograph of the other kind of a little bit of a cross-mode and cross-used .
Of course , a consequence of all that are very much of the interesting virtual models of every interesting part of the land , collecting you &apos;re not just by planes and satellite images and similar , but from collective .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I realized right ? What is your software is going to be that at a certain point , in the next few years , all the photographs that shares from everybody in the entire world will be very connected with anybody in the entire world will be prints with anybody in the entire world will be prints with anybody in the entire world will be prints with anybody in the entire world will be practice .
BAA : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is doing is actually discovering .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , you want , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the images .
And what becomes very interesting is about the reward of seant information that many of these images have been able .
As you do a research of images on the web , you &apos;re digit a frase and the heads on the web has a lot of information about the pictures .
Now , what happens if that picture is connecting to all your picture ?
So , the amount of seant connectivity and the amount of wealth that comes out is really enormous . It &apos;s a classic network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really amazing .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure of the main pleasure of the ethnogical research is the way to live in who has forgotten the ancient of the people in the wind , and you can touch it in the wind , and you touch it in the wind , and you can touch it in the wind , and you can put it in the wind , and the path in the waste of the world .
And I think the sciamani Jaguar travel , even beyond the Lattea , or that the old old old old , or that the old old old old old , or that &apos;s still the most significant , or Himalayas , the distinct buds still follow the Dharer , but to remember the most of the most of the anthrology of anthropology , and that the world we live in which we live in in which we live in in which we live in a sense , but it &apos;s just ,
the result of a particular set of choices that our stirpful has done , good or bad , many generations ago .
And of course , we all share some essential strength .
We all all of the hide .
We are subjects to reach of beginning .
We have to deal with the inexorability of death , so we don &apos;t smile ,
We all have an art .
What it &apos;s the particular rhythm of song , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that the Penan of Borneo , or the follow of the Voodoo of Haiti , or the desert warriers of the desert Kaithuban , or a Charian , or a Charian , or a a cammelt in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my journey of my journey in the desert a month ago , or a yak haller in Qomolangma , on Everest , the Mest , Everest , the mother &apos;s mother .
All of these populations teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving around the world .
And if you reflect a active active , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
And with , the miriades of cultures the world create a spiritual and cultural life that has the planet and cultural , which is important for the planet and it &apos;s important for the planet , and it &apos;s important for the planet .
And you can think about this cultural randomness and you can definitely define the ethnosphere , the total sphere , the whole whole whole of concepts , dreams , with ideas , inspired , inspired , the inspired intuition of human consciousness .
Eetnosphere is the great patrimonium .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we &apos;re and what we can be in how to inquisitive species .
And because biosphere was very , very much more , as it &apos;s happened to be on ethnosphere and unfortunately , too quickly .
No biologist , for example , would say that 50 percent of all species is , or it &apos;s been on the horrilo because it &apos;s filled , or -- in the most open apocalitty -- in the most open field -- and you don &apos;t even get close to hypothesis -- that &apos;s the most optional diversity -- that is what &apos;s been -- that &apos;s about the most optical diversity .
The example of all of that is , of course , the language .
When you &apos;re born 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not composed to only from a vocabulary or from a series of rules ,
One language is the spraking of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle of which is the soul of every culture comes in the world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a kill , a thought , a spiritual ecosystem .
And of those 6,000 languages , while we &apos;re here sitting in Monterey , at least half not being subsurrated in the ears of the children .
They &apos;re not teaching to children , which means , less I don &apos;t want to do something , which is already dead .
What is more sad than being the most sad of being being in silence , of being the last last to talk a language , of the last last one of the last last to talk about a language , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the last one of the last to talk about a language , of the last to talk about a language ,
This is a few years old is the state of somebody in some part of the world every two weeks .
And I know somebody to say , &quot; Is it better ?
The world would not be a better place if we &apos;re going to talk about all the same language ? &quot; So we &apos;re talking to the yoruba . We talk about the candial .
We talk about kogs .
You &apos;ll find a sense of a sudden what it means you can &apos;t talk to your language .
I &apos;d like to do you make a journey through the ethnosphere --
a small journey in ethnosphere to give you a little bit of what we &apos;re lost .
Many of us forget that when I say &quot; different ways of existing . &quot; I mean , really different ways of existing .
We take for example this Barasana bimbe , in Amazon Sininininstruments , the people of anaconda , which makes a midst of the latte of the waste in the severe of the greatest pends .
It &apos;s a people who can &apos;t distinguish the color from green because the time it &apos;s identified because the time it &apos;s identified in the forest , where you depends on the people .
They have a laming language and a matrimonial rule , called &quot; exogamia language , &quot; You have to go to a different person who talks about a different language .
All of that has roots in the mitological past , though the particularly , in these summitological families where they talk about six or seven languages because of the matters are a language .
They &apos;re just listening and then start talking about .
We take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived , Waorani of Ecuador EEEEEEEEEEEEastern , a incredible populations that had first contents in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionary missionary missionary , and it &apos;s a fatal mistake .
They made up from the top photographs that they retrait in the room that they were going to love , forest that this people in the forest pluvial forest .
They collected the photograph from land , they turn to research , or a shape or a figure , and not found out , they have a conclused that they had treated the diavian , and they killed five missionary missionary .
But Waorani doesn &apos;t have only killed foreign .
They killed between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We &apos;re risallowed to eight generations and we found two natural death , and when we &apos;ve done done it , they admitted that one of them was invecked , and then they killed it . And then they killed it .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine for 40 pass and recognize the species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned to be an interesting job when my Harvard was really interesting when my Harvard asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti in the basic secret of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes , and I sten in the first &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; 80s , and I was an exter-su-su-su-sum .
To give sense of a miraculous , I should have to understand Vodd culture and that Vodoo is not magic .
It &apos;s kind of a complex metaphor of the world .
Very interesting .
If I asked you to tell me about the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
There &apos;s a half , Islam , Buddhism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no faith . And instead , and the Voodoo is not any other than the distilled of these religious concepts .
What makes interesting is the voodoo is the intense is the intense of life .
So , alive they &apos;re born .
The spirits can be invocated by the Grande Act , respond to the rhythm of the dance of dance and replace it , so that for a short active active active active active , it becomes the heart .
And so , for this voodooists say , &quot; You &apos;re going to talk about God .
We say in the theme and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re posite , is the spirit that you , you can do it wrong with it ?
So you see these incredible events : following voodoo in the state of trance that touch impunizones who touch impunizations , unfairly , the body &apos;s when it &apos;s catalyzed in a state of extremely exciting .
And in all the people with which I have lived the most amazing Kogi Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta City , in the Colombia in the City of City , in the entrional City , in the entrional City .
They have to be a tyrange of ancient civilization that once lived on the careers of Colombia in the charge of the people who were going to be retreated on the volcanic masses , which is to be on the volcanic massure that you can get on the heart plant .
In a maceags of blood , this people have never been conquised by spagnololy .
But I &apos;m government government government from a cler , but their formation is so extraordinary .
The young people follow are taken from families to three to four years , and they live secret in a buy world , and they &apos;re in a good world , and shadow for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years choices of the nine months of gestation that transform in the user of mother , now are metaphor , now are metaphor in the user of the Grande Mother .
For all of this time , they &apos;re acculturated to the values of their society , values that predicts that their prayers and only their prayers to keep the constitute of the cosmic balance .
And the term of this amazing beginning , it suddenly brought out and for the first time in life , at the age of 18 , they see an alba . And in that moment of the first bull , when the sun kets the first balls , when the sun kingdom of the beautiful landscape , all that they &apos;ve learned in a step back and says , &quot; I think it &apos;s a step back and says : : : I think it &apos;s a step step back and says :
&quot; Gist ? Right ? I said to you .
It &apos;s amazing . Now it &apos;s now . &quot;
They call the largest brothers and say that we , brothers , are the colpairs of the world &apos;s destruction .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about Indigene and and the old environment we call Rousseau and the old history of selvessable , which is a race in its simplicity or invoon his simplicity or maybe invode Thoreau and we say that these people are closer to the Earth .
The Indies are not nor feelings are not severe sentimental sentimental .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the sick of Asmat Asmat or in the Tibet , but because of time and I was made a mystic mystic mystic , not on the concept of the Earth &apos;s notion of the Earth is not aware of the world . The concept that the Earth can live only because it &apos;s infected to be awesome .
What does it mean ?
It means that a kid of Ande who is growing up creating that the mountain is an Apspirit that will be an Apspirit will be a depth different , and it &apos;s going to have a deepdifferent relationship with the mountain or that place that you can create a lot of a boy of a rock of the Montana who grow up to be scaves .
That &apos;s a spirit or a mineral or a mineral is irrilevant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that define the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forest of Columbia Britannica believing that forest you were going to be cut .
And that has made me a different human being different from my friends Kwakiutl that believe that the forest are dimora of Hukukukukukukukukukukukuk and the balls of the world , which we live in the Hamsa .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of them feeling that . We take this plant .
I took this picture to open up in the Amazon the Western Amazon .
Maybe some of you heard about ayahuased , the most powerful substance psychoactive repertory .
What makes it fascinating with the ayahuask is not the potential of the substance , but his elaboration . It &apos;s what &apos;s called two elements .
On one side , this liana legning that containing a charcoal , and hardly leaves , hardly hallucinogene .
And then you &apos;re going to take the only planning of a blue-in-bone-in-bone-of-called Psycheck &apos;s family said , &quot; Psychchchchcheck &apos;s &apos;s told Psychchoptry is .
This plant contains , very similar to the serotonin , very similar to the seriotonin , dithyptamine , dithyptamine .
If you ever see Yanomami thyppped on the hidden , you know , you know , it &apos;s a methyppputs .
Take that dust on the nose is a little bit like being gone from a little bit of a pinch of paints and land on a sea of electricity . You can &apos;t believe a distorsion of reality .
I often told my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has taken the psich-flood , with his discovery of hallucinogen , in Mexico .
And I &apos;m going to be trained . You can &apos;t classification as hallucinogens because if you &apos;re made , you can &apos;t tell anybody to be hallucinated .
It &apos;s possible to be above all the time with other chemicals that denian MAO .
Now it &apos;s the beautiful : the Tibetoline that are injecbors in this liana is MAO , the same kind of need to be able to power trtrade triptamine . The question is , in a 80,000 species of plants , like these people are doing these people to find two defologize defologically , but that if you combine in this way , believe a biochemical version that is high high high high high high susum in the sum of parts ?
We use the big eufemism of evidence and error , which can reveal infruted .
But if we ask Indians , we say , &quot; The plants talk about it . &quot;
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuasks , which distinguish neply in forest , and that we would come into the same species .
If we ask them how they stopped their tables will say , &quot; I thought , &quot; I thought I &apos;m going to say , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take 17 variety in a night of moon , and each other . And each other .
With this is not graduate to Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than stami .
Now , &#91; applausers &#93; the problem is that also the ones that have to heart people have to be pitted , but in some way I reduced to margins in the sea sea sea sea sea sea sea sea sea sea gins in the real world , and it &apos;s passing over .
In fact , the 21st century , between 300 years , it &apos;s not going to remember his wars or of technological innovations , but rather like the one was where we stop and enmitted acting and we used actively abstract with the mass destruction of biological diversity and cultural .
All cultures are involved in a dance for new possibilities of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux didn &apos;t stop being Sioux when they put from the arco and frecce like Americans have no stop being Americans have no stop being Americans when they put away away from horse and calm .
It &apos;s not change or technology that threats the technology that threats the integrity of ethnosh . It &apos;s the power .
The hard hard hard to domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you &apos;ll find that these are not destined to disappear .
They &apos;re living creatures and spint dynamics out of identified forces that go beyond their adaptment .
This is that it &apos;s disbosament in Penan ,
a nomade of Sarawak , in the East East East , a people who have lived in the forest to a generation of a generation ago , and now reduced to a generation , and now reducing on the rights , where you can see the river river , where you can see the river &apos;s river , where the river is that sounds like a giaphorized , where the nationte that they &apos;re going to be a woning ,
You &apos;re ready to fill the wooden is soth to the forest .
Or in the case of the Yanomami , are the disease that have come with the discovery of gold .
And if we put on the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you see the hard hard hard hard to domination .
As you know the genocide , the extinction of a people , is constitute to the universal level , but the ethnic destruction , the destruction of a people , not just addiction , but I adopted , but I also adopted , but I also adopted , but I also addiction to strategy , because part of the development of the strategy of development .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of Tibet until you go from the beginning .
I &apos;ve been spent 6,000 miles from Chengdu in China , Western Tibet through the Sorastern Tibet , coming to Lhasa young connection , but only came to Lhasa young connected , but only came to Lhasa young man .
6,000 monuments sacrice reduces in the powder and centers .
1.2 million people killed from military during the Cultural Revolution .
And this guy was ascritical in the Panchen Lama .
The Chinese to say that was killed to the investment of Chinese invasion .
Suo uncle is founded with Sua Sainity during the diaspora that led the people in Nepal .
His mother was imprisoned and his cold was replacement .
It &apos;s been brought to hide in charity to the age of two to hide in the age of the gonna because it couldn &apos;t live without him .
The sister , which did the same , has been mitted in reeducation .
A day has inverse hot a bunch of Mao and , for this transgression , has been mitted to the transgression , was mitted to seven years .
The Tibet can be insopporable , but the spirit of the people is from the presents of the people is from tener .
And it &apos;s going to reduce a choice .
We want to live in the monocromatic world or we want to get the policy world &apos;s policy ?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead , before we die said that his largest fear was that , in our whole whole whole whole of world , not only we &apos;ll see the whole gamma of human imagination that is reduced to a limb of thinking , but a day we &apos;ll see we &apos;re going to go to a sleep sleep of thinking , but a day we &apos;ll see we &apos;re going to see it from a sleep to a sleep of a sleep of of of of the world ,
And it &apos;s uliant to remember that our species is there for 600,000 years .
The Neolitica , which has given us agriculture , which has made us to socking to be seed , by by replace , by by replace , by by making the next of the button of the next of the Caaaerian of specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has to be 300 years .
And that sharp story doesn &apos;t suggests me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we &apos;re going to have to deal with the millon-year-old .
When to these miriades of cultures the world is asked what they want to say to be human , respond with 10,000 different different voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all reflights that we &apos;re all about a conscious species , that has to be able species , that has to make all the people and all gardens can train .
I took this picture on the north of Baffin , and when I went to cover of the whales with Inuit , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and the man , Olaya , and the man , Olaya , and this man , Olayan , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olayers , and this man , Olayan , and this man , Olayan , and this man , Olaya , and this man , and the man , and the man , and this man ,
The Chanadan government has been gentile with the Inuit and the &apos; 50s to stabilize our sprematia , and in the &apos; 50s to be able to be in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refused to go .
The family , theme for his life , and he took them to all of my towns .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t feel the cold .
The packs in origins were made of fish fish in origins are made of weight in the waste of carier .
The grandfather didn &apos;t intimidnight , or the bylie , or the blizer that suffering .
It &apos;s been missing , it &apos;s hot the pantalones in the focus and defected in their hand . When I did it was filled , and when I did it was frozen , and they work creating a lamp .
It &apos;s got salive on the dog of this clock , and when I became solid , and when I became solid .
It &apos;s got to shake the dog and created a bright , with the tower , he has a sell , has a samp , has embranch another dog , and it &apos;s gone on on the banking , and it &apos;s gone on on the banking , and it &apos;s gone on on .
Do we want to talk about horses with nothing ? &#91; Risate &#93; And this , in different ways , &#91; Applausers &#93; is the symbol of the resilience of the Inuit and of all the Indies and the world .
In the aprile 1999 , the Chinese government reduced to Inuit &apos;s control of a larger territory area of California and Texas a larger area of California and Texas a set .
It &apos;s their new paria . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s an independent land . They &apos;re all minerary resources .
One of the splendido as a natione-state can re-concilie to re-concilie .
And , to end , I think it &apos;s kind of obvious to be at least to those remote areas of the planet , I realized that they don &apos;t remote .
For somebody &apos;s home .
They represent the human imagination that they &apos;re going to the alge of the time . And for us all of these children , as dreams , as dreams , they become part of the geography of hope .
We &apos;re convinced , we are convinced that political political political will will never be .
We believe that polemics --
And so , we believe that stories can &apos;t lose , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the best institution to tell the world &apos;s stories . Every month , every month , we have to return 35 million visits .
156 countries transmit transmit to our television canal .
Our magazines are lected by millions of people .
Our work is traveling in the ethnosphere to bring our public in places in the future , in places that they go away away from what they &apos;ve seen and , hope , it will be abled for the central reveal of the central reveal of the central reveal of the exist in life , and we have to find a lifestyle in a pluralist world and multicultural life in a pluralist world and multiculative , to get a
where we &apos;re wisdom of all the people can contribute to our well-being .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope you &apos;ve heard and I &apos;m going to try to see some links , in case you don &apos;t notice .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the official dogma .
Dogma official what ?
The dogma official official society . The Western industrial society . &quot; If we want to massive the well-being . &quot; If we want to massive the well-being of our citizens . &quot;
The reason is , from one side , in fact that the freedom is in itself a value , is useful , for human beings .
And on the other thing that if we &apos;re free , each of us can act for all of that that massive massive our well-one , no one that I decided to do .
And the way to massive liberty is massive .
The more choices of people , more libing , and more is their freedom , the largest thing is their well-being .
This is , I think , it &apos;s so deeply radicated in in society that nobody would dream to be able to put it in doubt .
And it &apos;s also deeply rown in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m going to allow me to be a simple note about conditions .
In my supermarket is 175 conditions , without contact the 10 variety of olium extreme of olive extreme , which is a huge number of whom whom you can buy for a huge number of condition in the circumstance that nobody of the 175 .
Here &apos;s what &apos;s supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic store to buy one stereo : cast , the CD , radio , fastra , radio , plastra , radio , piastra , light , light ,
And in this single store , there &apos;s a big big number of audio components .
We can make six and a half million different combinations using the components that there are in a only store .
You need to admit that there &apos;s tanti-the-the-the-the-the-grain .
Other fields : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all of the desiable cell services , to the shapes that were proved by mom Bell .
It was noleged the phone , didn &apos;t buy it .
One of that , in the other one , was that the phone didn &apos;t break .
These days , they went .
We have a nearly limited variety of phones , especially between phones .
Here &apos;s phones of the future .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , cut MP3 , cut the nose of the nose , and forth for the brulphonos .
If you didn &apos;t see it still saw in the store under home , you &apos;re very much certain that I &apos;ll get to get it .
And what &apos;s going on on the end of the people come into the store and it &apos;s what is the answer ? The answer is &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t make it too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the acquished , the same explosion of choices .
And there is health : not happen to the United States that you go to the doctor and the doctor , and the doctor &apos;s say what you have to do .
Instead , you &apos;re from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do A , or B , &quot; You can have these benefits of benefits and these risks . &quot; What has these benefits and these risks . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Dr. , what should I do I should do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; You have these benefits , and B has these benefits , and B has these benefits and risks . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; Dr. if she was me , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not like her . &quot;
And we call it &quot; autonomy of the malate &quot; , &quot; expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But in fact , it &apos;s not to be that you can get the weight and responsibility to make decisions from somebody knows something , which is the doctor , to someone else that doesn &apos;t know -- and almost certainly , it &apos;s sick -- and it &apos;s certainly not a condition -- and it &apos;s certainly not a condition --
There &apos;s a huge marketing of pharmaceutical products , direct people like me and you , which if you think you have no sense , because we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why do we advertising them ?
The answer is that they want to ask them to ask them to ask them to ask them to ask them to change the received .
And so , what &apos;s like this is our identity is a question of choice , as you see in this vignity . &quot; We don &apos;t want to forced children . I don &apos;t want to forze the children . I don &apos;t want to get it to be an identity : we have to invent .
And we can reinventing us as many times we &apos;re going to reinventing us .
That means that every morning , at the saving , you have to decide what kind of person want to be .
I &apos;m going to be a family and matrimonium , a long time , I was , I content almost for anyone , was that there was that there was a more pressive possible , and then you start to get kids .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not even what to do after .
So , it &apos;s really really to play .
I teach very smart students , and I &apos;m going to be a lot of work than a time .
And because they &apos;re not not because they &apos;re less diligent , not because they &apos;re less diligent .
But why are they immersible , you know , &quot; Do I shit or not ? &quot; I should be going to do it now ? &quot;
&quot; Do I should be worse later ? I have to think before children or to the career ? &quot;
They &apos;re logoring .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this implement not to complete the companies that asseats and not get a good voice to my exame .
And they need to really do that . They &apos;re important questions .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , as Carl underground , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from every day , from every day , from the Hotel Randolph .
And there &apos;s a coroline , there &apos;s a coroline , and I won &apos;t say to anybody where the Within the Fi works .
I don &apos;t say that , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , this amazing liberty of choice we have about this ? Is it going to continuously decide , continuously in every moment , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing hot , with the phone , the Blackberry in other , and the notebs , and the notebs , and the notebs , and the notebs .
And even though they &apos;re all spending , every minute that we see our son , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; I have to answer this ? &quot;
&quot; I need to answer this email ? I have to email this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is &quot; no , &quot; all this makes it experience of your son &apos;s very different , that would be in other conditions .
So , anywhere we look at , small and big things , things , life is a choose question .
And once the world was this : That , there were some possibly possibly , but it wasn &apos;t all of choice .
The world of today is what about this : dilemma is , &quot; Is it a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is to be a lot of it .
The positive positive sites we know , we &apos;re all going to talk about the negative .
All this choice is two negative effects of two negative effects on people .
The first paradoxically , is that produced paralysis that produced paralysis that it &apos;s going to be liberation .
And so , with many options that choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I give you a significant example : a study conducted on the voluntary pensive .
And my connected has been access to Vanguard data , the gigantank company , with about a million of pension , with about a million customers in 2,000 different companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of adesiesion two percent .
With 50 offer , there &apos;s 10 percent in less than adesions than when they &apos;re available only five . Why ?
Because with 50 source of which choose , is sick to decide , and choice is refinding to the doman ination .
And tomorrow , and tomorrow , tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course , domain never coming .
You know , you know , it doesn &apos;t only mean that these old work on the old people will be food because they &apos;re not going to say that the decision is so unlikely to say that the decision is so unforth that lose the funny dator &apos;s work .
Not participating , they &apos;re lying to five dollars for a year from the work , which would be well well disposure to be there .
So the paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think that makes the world .
&quot; And to end , for ethernity : ketchup , &quot; or maionese ? &quot;
You would like to make the right decision , if it &apos;s for ethernity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong wrong , and yet the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even though we can avoid the paralive and do a choice , at the end , we &apos;re less sation-one choice , as we would be able to choose .
And that &apos;s about a different reasons .
One of these is that with many condition of which choose , you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could imagine that it would have been better . And what happens is that alternative to be better . And what happens is that the alternative to be better . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us , and the repair return to the decreation , and the reference ,
even when it was a great decision .
The more choices there are , easier to be more detail than any detail is insatisfaction of option .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has clearly been very well stamp as the value of things depends on what we &apos;re council .
And the rest of the other , when there are many opposite , it &apos;s easy to represent the alternative of alternative shot and being less sation-made option .
Here &apos;s an example . I use with everybody who are not New York .
But that &apos;s what you probably think .
There &apos;s this couple of Hamptons .
A lusse place .
Spian dida . Otttle day . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not missing . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , it &apos;s Agust . &quot;
&quot; All my neighborhood to Manhattan is on . &quot;
&quot; I could park right right in front of the home . &quot;
And it &apos;s going to be going to be losing -- every day -- the ability to park where it wants .
The costo-opportunity to demining the sod-demining opportunity for what we have , even when choice is excellent .
And the more are the options that we have to consider , the more attractive characteristics are going to be constitute to be constitute to be a costo-opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a living on it tells us a lot of things .
It &apos;s about living the moment , and maybe of living slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you choose , you choose to do not do the other .
And the things we don &apos;t choose many attractive attractive attractive that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : the growing expectations .
I tried to my skin bought a new pair of jeans .
I &apos;m just always jeans .
And one time jeans were just just like , they bought them and vestivate them , they were skied , just after they took them a life and washed a lot of times , they started going to go well .
So I went to buy a couple of new when the old ones were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
And then , the committed me , &quot; Li wants to be fit , and axed ? &quot;
Do you want to do it with the cernier , &quot; Stonewashed , &quot; or &quot; aciddle &quot; or &quot; ? &quot;
&quot; Would you like it appears ? &quot;
&quot; S8 : You want them to be large or stretch ? Bla , &quot; Continua .
I was salord , and after a little bit , and after a little bit , and I want the one guy didn &apos;t have any idea of it was , so for a moment I was going to go to all the sick , I &apos;m going to go out of the sun , and I went out the best pair , I &apos;m ever ever ever ever ever .
It was the very very much . With that I got the best one .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse is that with all of that choice my expectations were altissive , jeans had to be perfect .
And I had to minimum wait . I didn &apos;t expect anything excetional when there was just a kind of time , but when I saw 100 different , I had to be perfect .
What I had been purpose , but not perfect .
After I started to chose with what I was going to try and I was insation-made .
The adds of options in life of the people don &apos;t do that to increase the expectations that are respect to excellence of the options of the same .
And this will produce less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
No one in the marketing world makes it .
Because if they knew it , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more to that .
&quot; It was better when it was worse , &quot; The reason it was better when it was worse , it was worse that when you was worse , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , &quot;
In the world we live in the world in which we live -- opulents , industrialized citizens with the expectancy , which we can hope is that things are at the althetic .
You &apos;re never surprised to pleasant because your expectations , and I &apos;m ingigantes , and I &apos;m ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Baswait . &quot; Yes , &quot; You want it . &quot;
I mean , I mean , I &apos;m really very married and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t have to be able to do it ,
But it &apos;s not always a good thing .
And then , a result of the bought a couple of jeans , when there &apos;s just that kind of jeans is that when you &apos;re not satifying , and you ask , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who &apos;s responsible ? &quot; The answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What could I do you do it ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a insatisfaction , and you ask you who is responsible , is the responsible , is just clear that responsible , is , it &apos;s just like you .
You could have better .
With hundreds of variety available , there are no excuse for insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even though the result is valid , they feel insatisfacfacts and damage the cold to their cold .
In the last years , depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this honor to depression is just that people have deludent experiencing because standard are too high .
And when they need to explain this situation think that the cold is .
So the end result is that we &apos;re better , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely fake . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little choice is better than it &apos;s better than it . It doesn &apos;t have any more choice than a little choice .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic . I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s .
But I &apos;m sure we have overcome from a piece of the level where the choices improvement of our life .
Now , from the political point -- I almost finished -- I almost finished by political view , the nocy is the following .
What allows all this to be in industrial society is the wealth of material .
There are many places in the world , and you know about that , where the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too page .
So the faccenters that I &apos;m talking about is a sick to be exclusive of modern , re-larger society .
And what makes depressing and angry is this : Steve Levitt Levitt has talked about yesterday about how much those expensive seats are inutives . It &apos;s a money .
I mean , these choices , complicated and dispendious , is not that they &apos;re just useful .
I &apos;m deleteries .
They make it worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows to be reverse in those where people have too few people too few chance , it &apos;s not just their life to make it better , but also our .
This is what economists call a improvement of this .
A redistribution of income re-income re-income re-income reproduction that it takes us to be .
To end up , &quot; You can get everything you want to be , &quot;
You , people of culture , you think , &quot; What does that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t get anything in a glass of glass . &quot;
&quot; A Man &apos;s imagination , a limited view of the world --
and I &apos;m interpreted it so , at the beginning .
But then , I realized that that that fish knows that that that fish knows the long time .
Because the reality is that if you &apos;re missing in frankly , you know , &quot; everything is possible . &quot; You don &apos;t do freedom . You don &apos;t get freedom . You can &apos;t get freedom .
If you break the boccia in the way that everything diminues can decrease satisfying .
You get to get the paralive , and you reduce the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too stretched , maybe even for fish , and certainly for us .
But the abuncore of any sphere is a recipe for inhappiness and , I &apos;m going to do it for the rovine .
Thank you .
