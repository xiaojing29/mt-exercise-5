Last year showed these slides to show that the arctic ice , which is the arctic ice , which for almost three million years has the size of 48 United States , 48 , the continental United States , it &apos;s retrofit of 40 percent .
However , this underlying gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice of ice .
The arctic calculus is , in a sense , the clean heart of global climate system .
It &apos;s expanded and revern expanded .
The next slide is going to be a carrying reid to be a carlying revenement last 25 years .
The glaces are signed in red .
As you see , they &apos;re going to go to the blue dark .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter , which is the summer ice .
You can see that the cosiddle , five years or more , is like a blood , which is like a blood , which is like a blood , which is like it &apos;s from the body .
In 25 years , it went from that , so .
This is a problem because the warming interests , you know , the land around the arctic ocean where there are huge amount of fuzzy that , melting , they turn into the arction into the arction .
I &apos;m going to the totality of the atmospheric pollution , that amount could be double , that amount could be double , so that you can get , overwhelming this is not around .
In some of the lakes in Alaska little deep-in-to-water lakes .
The professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska was a team at a low-to-lake lake lake ,
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You &apos;re good . The question is if we &apos;re also going to be .
And that &apos;s a reason is that this thermal surrise of the Greenland from the north .
This is a river at the ice that is the glacial regimes .
The ported never reached that .
This is the Kanger-Southeoral River , in the southest of Groenland .
If you want to know how to the sea level to the sheets of the sea level to be shoot , here is where it &apos;s where the sea is reaching .
These currents are growing rapidly .
On the other side of the planet : Antarctica , the largest block of ice on the planet .
Last month , scientists have told that the ice is the bilange of ice is in negative , and that the Western Antarctica , which pogy on some underarine islying , is particularly quick in the skiest in the shoulder .
It &apos;s about six feet of the water , like Groenland .
Sulil Himalaya , the third largest block block of ice , you see new lakes , which a few years ago .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population is half of the wasting water from the melting .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the water of this city .
The ported is increased .
But when it demines , the same happens to the water .
In California , the snow on the Sierra Nevada is declined for 40 percent .
The hymmmmmums are in crisis .
The previous previous , as you &apos;ve read , they &apos;re grave .
The increasingly safe in the world leads to a remarkable increase in incended .
The environmental disaster disaster , we &apos;re getting a return out of normal and unprecedented .
Four times more of the last 30 years I &apos;m going to be able to be the previous .
This is a unsustainable ,
If you look in the historical context , they can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day .
Look at the highly Pacific area , from the Eastern Pacific , and on both parts of the Indian subcontinent , where there &apos;s a radical radical radical root in the oceans .
The largest cause of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , it &apos;s the use of fossil fuels .
The oil is a problem , and coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two of the most emissions , together to China .
And he proponed to build a lot of other coal central central .
But we &apos;re seeing a change of direction .
These are the annullated projects in the last few years and some of the verse alternative .
In any way , there &apos;s a fight policy in our country .
The industrial and oil has spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote to the last year to promote fuel the coal , which is a hosymphony .
That picture of me , was reminds me --
Verice Natal , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a loss of 3.8 billion liers of coal supply .
Maybe you have seen it on the news .
This is the second largest flows in America .
It &apos;s happened around Natal .
The advertising at one of the industrial and of coal .
Video : Stop of the carbon is a very happy and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it &apos;s growing our economy .
Frosing carbon is increasingly clean .
It &apos;s good for price , adorable and the workers keep working on the world .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest society is Massey Coal . This is the Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I &apos;ll be clear . Al Gore , Nancy Pelosy , Harry Re--- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima has launched two campaign .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Social : At the next ALergy : At the same time , as a business serious deal with our business .
So , for our priorities is to invest a lot of money in a public effort to make and confused the truth to charcoal truth .
In fact , coal is not spork .
We think it &apos;s clean -- it &apos;s also a good profumo .
So , not prehocuption .
Let me do .
Video : Carbon : Carbon -- you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
So let &apos;s make a turn into a structure at the avanguard for the pulit .
Sinordinarily ! The machines are a little noise , but this is the sound of the sound of the puzzle technology .
The charcoal consumption is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology that you see changes all .
You look at : this is the hdigggain technology .
Al Gore : I finally , the good alternative is connects to economic question and the national security .
Video : America is in crisis ; the economy , national security , climate crisis .
The filter that connects all : our dependence from fossil fuels , like the sports and oil oil .
But now , there &apos;s a new , auduty solution to go .
Repower : 100 percent clean energy , in a decade .
A plan to re-put America to make us more safe , and help stop global warming .
And finally , a solution that I &apos;m going to solve our problems .
Repower . Scoprite more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It &apos;s about re-energy to America .
One of the fastest ways of getting to the dependence from the fuel that killing our planet .
Comparsa : The future is here . Very , Sun , a new energy network .
Comparsa : New aging aging aging aging for jobs .
Complant : Repower . It &apos;s time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old African , he says , &quot; If you want to go to the speed , go to the faster .
If you want to go far , you go up , you go together . &quot;
We have to go far , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I did a LHC introduction .
And you promise to return to the back to you on how the car works .
So I &apos;m here . And for those that the other time , there was not , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever tried -- 27 kilometers of circumconference .
His task is to re-reating the conditions that were present less than a billionth of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
That &apos;s just ambitious .
This is the car under Ginevra .
And we would take a Big Bang in the results .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLAS -- it &apos;s a largo to .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLTLATLATLATLATLAS TLAS TLATLATLATLAS in construction so you can see the proportions .
So , 10 September of the last year we have pushed the car for the first time .
And this was taken by ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLTLATLATLATLATLAS .
It was because of immense , in the control room .
It &apos;s a picture of the first particles that had done all around the LHC , and getting into collision , deliberately , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles inside the relever .
In other words , when we see that picture the 10 September , we realized that the machine worked , which is a great vicugly .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to make us more or this , when somebody went to Google and saw that the beginning page was this .
That means we had a cultural impact beyond that scientific impact .
And it was a week later , there was a problem with the car , to just these files here -- these dorships .
These files 13,000 ampes when the car works at the maximum .
Now , the technical between you will look at the files and they say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . I &apos;m films too good . &quot;
And they can do it because when they &apos;re very cold , they &apos;re going to be deeply , you know , you know , you know , you know , because when they &apos;re very cold , they can do it because when they &apos;re very cold , they can do it because when they &apos;re very cold , they can do it because when they &apos;re very cold , they &apos;re very cold of getting the costs .
So , at least 271 degrees , at less , at the lower temperature to the space between stars , these files can bring that current .
In one of the giguntures between the most of the magnets in the LHC , there was a defect of factoration .
So , the files get climbed slightly , and the 13,000 ampes suddenly met a electricity .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think these magnets are weight over 20 tons , and they moved about 30 inches .
They &apos;re damaged about 50 magnets .
We had to take them , what we did .
We &apos;ve reinated them and wandering them .
Now , they &apos;re going back all to their underground .
I finally finally of march the LHC is going to be a new integrity .
We &apos;re going to account it , and we &apos;re going to take data or jeck , or I go and go and go and I keep our adventure to discover what the morning is the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents are going to take the dibonds of science and the frontier engineering engineering .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s so hard , I think it &apos;s the value of things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of a Inglese scientist , Humphrey Davy , who , I guess , in defense of injecutilize his own , his clean was Michael Faraday , he said , &quot; No is a lot of dangerous to the progress of the human mind , which is a lot of dangerous , and that there are no mysties in nature , which is the complete mons are complete to us , and that there are complete to be conquered , &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to rethink about when you , you play with kids , you play with them .
As you could get to reach and grab them and grab and you can get them , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , what I think , and you know , you know , and you know , you know , you know , you know , what do , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
Now , the space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , by the useful information about our interaction with physical objects , together to my physical objects , together to my Pact Pacacts , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking asking , &quot; And if when we &apos;re using a computer , instead of having the mouse , like we could have the only a computer , instead of having the mouse , we could actually reach information with both hands , and their hands out , we could actually reach information with both hands , and their hands ,
and fix it to our pleasure ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big interactive computer like a biscope .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big interactive computer like a biscope .
You can move with them , they can see them , &quot; they can see &quot; they they just hear their movement and they have a wireless radio .
But above all , they &apos;re physical objects , like the morning , you can just move them .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physical , aware of the movement , the other people , and as they become more physical , to be more physical , to the other people , as we move them , we can explore new and fun styles of interaction .
I &apos;ll start with a few simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show video : if you &apos;ll cline it in one direction , it will rotate it as if you get on the other htorn back .
These reports are aware of the other people .
If I put them , you know , they &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re around them .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can agitate a little bit .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can agitate a little bit .
They also have their movement and the clination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was that we could use communities on data , for instance , &quot; I &apos;ll put a color like if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configured out of painting , and I can use them to pump in the central color , where they &apos;re missing .
and I can use them to pump the color in that central , where they &apos;re going to be able to use them to push the color in that central , where they &apos;re going to get it .
We can put it too , we can put a bit of it .
And also , you know , you know , the mathematics and the mathematics and logic games where people can try things fast , and see the results that are very quickly .
Now , I &apos;m --
This is a Fibonacks that I do with a equations program .
Here we have a words that is in half of Scarabeers and Boggle .
Bically , at every Turn n n n n recipe for every Siftable , Pressically , at every Turn , you had a letter to reach letter to the words , and while you try to understand him to understand it a dictionary .
And then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the kids came to the Media Lab , I did this , I did so that I tried them and turned them to a video .
They &apos;re very much pleased .
And one of the interesting things that kind of applied is that you don &apos;t have to give people many instructions .
You just say , &quot; Humber &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Here &apos;s other people who try it .
This is our Tibeta younger than a young man , there on the right .
It actually wanted to get a lot of them .
They were only morning morning , for him .
Now , this is an applied of a interactive cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool for learning . He &apos;s Felix . He &apos;s Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , lift the Siftable , they &apos;re associated with .
It can put new characters in the scene , lift the Siftable , they &apos;re associated with .
So , it &apos;s going to get out .
Video : The sun is sun .
David Merrill : Now , he &apos;s got a trewer in the scene .
Video : The arange treatment .
Bel job ! You know .
So , you shake out the Siftable and put them close them out , can make the characters --
Video : Bau !
by inventing their own story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a very open story , and it can decide him as you turn .
DM : It &apos;s a very open story , and it can decide him as you turn .
Video : Go , throw .
DM : The last example I have the time to show you is a tool , I made to championing and performing music .
is a tool , I realized that , to championeering music .
The Siftable here is agging from sounds , and the battery .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose which to use .
You can also put these sounds on a sequence that you can compose to your pleasure .
And just to change it just by making a sound and a sequence .
These are actually you can control from alive , like the reverse and the filter .
And you attach it to a particular sound and then cline to fix it .
And then there are general effects as time and volume , which is apply to the whole sequence .
Let &apos;s look at how it works .
Video : We &apos;re going to start putting a base in two Siftable . &quot; We put them into a series , we put them in a series , and we go into a series , and we add to a series , and we add to it , add to a series , and we take another base base .
I &apos;ll put a line of low .
Video : I &apos;m going to add percussions --
Video : And I &apos;m going to put the battery to the battery , so I can control the live live live .
Video : I can I make the whole sequence to recline the whole sequence to the whole sequence of time , or on the other .
Video : I &apos;ll now add the bottom line to the bottom to give more expression .
Video : I can re-re-reverse the sequence of the flying .
So I don &apos;t have to plan this first , but I can suddenly make it longer or more court .
And now , finally , I can smoking the whole sequence to the left Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new human interfaces and more resembling to how our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that &apos;s coming up this new generation of objects to interact with digital media , which we want to bring information into our world that we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time to talk to you .
I &apos;m a writer .
I &apos;m going to write about books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that .
It &apos;s also love and the fascinating of my life .
And I don &apos;t look like to change .
But , I said , something particular , it &apos;s happened in my life and my career , which led me to reezing the whole relationship with this job .
And the particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called &quot; Mangia , &quot; Prega , &quot; which , &quot; which , diversously , in fact , in some reason , for some reason , and it became a great senational , willing .
And the result is that everywhere now , people treat me as if I was convicted .
It &apos;s true -- convicted , conducted !
They &apos;re all going to be now , and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t fear you couldn &apos;t do it ?
You don &apos;t fear to keep writing all of life without being able to create a book that can matter to someone ? &quot;
what can you matter to someone ? &quot;
It &apos;s reassuring , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember more than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a written .
I &apos;d go to the same reaction based on the fear .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you know , &quot; Don &apos;t you succeed ?
You don &apos;t fear you you have to do ?
You don &apos;t fear to make this mill for all life without anything that is ever outside and to die on a cumb cule with the mouth of damage with the mouth of failures .
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is : &quot; Yeah . &quot;
Yeah , I &apos;m afraid of all that .
I &apos;ve always had fear .
And I also have a lot of other things that people can &apos;t inform .
And as the algae and other things .
But , as I &apos;m talking about writing what I thought and I asked myself , is why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logical that anyone should expect to be frightened by a job that you &apos;re born to do .
But what is that particular in the creative companies to make us nervous about the mental health as elsewhere in a way that other careers do they don &apos;t do ?
As my father , for instance , he was an engineer and I don &apos;t remember one time in his 40 years of activity in which was asked if he fear to be engineer ?
John &apos;t there was never -- that that stuck of the engineer , John , how does it go ?
It wasn &apos;t working like that , you know ?
Onestally , chemicals are not certainly , in the centuries , the reputation of being alclearly depressed .
We have a writers , we have enough to this reputation , and not just creative writers , but we &apos;re creative in all that , we have this reputation of being huge instabove .
And it &apos;s not about looking at the trads of the magnifies of creative minds that only in the 21st century , they died young people who , died young people and often .
And the ones that don &apos;t seem to be really disdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisappearing .
Norman Mailer , before he died , before he died , &quot; Every last interview , &quot; Every book &apos;s killed me a little bit more . &quot; A wonderful affermation about their life .
But we don &apos;t throw up when we feel like to say because we heard these things so long to do , because we &apos;ve been heard about the notion that creativity and suffering are in some way of the connecting and the suffering are in some way and that art , at the end , it will always constraints to angosize anges .
And the question I want to ask everybody today is today : Do you agree with this idea ?
It &apos;s good for you -- because it also looking at a centimeter to me , it &apos;s not good for anything to this support .
I think it &apos;s hdious .
And I also think it &apos;s dangerous , and I don &apos;t want to see it perpetuated in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our big creative minds to live .
And certainly I know that , in my case -- in my situation -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start to fight into that feeling a dark of support of support , especially you give the circumstances where I &apos;m in my career .
That &apos;s -- you know , I &apos;m very young , I &apos;m a very young age , I &apos;m a lot of time .
I &apos;ve got about four work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything I &apos;m going to write about now in the world , as the work that came out after the world as the work that came out after the last book .
I &apos;m going to be suck , because we &apos;re all about , I &apos;m going to be a little bit of success is in my own shoulder .
Oh , Gesu , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads to a person to start drink in nine morning , and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would keep doing this work that we work that we do .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it looks like , after a lot of reflections , that the way to work to continue to write is what to create a protective psychological construct , OK ?
I have to find a security distance between me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxiety where I reaction that you can get . And as I was trying to do this for all last year , trying to find other societies , to see if they could have some of the best ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthy ideas and more human human ideas and more healthy and more heal
how to help creative people to run the creative risks of emotional risks of creativity .
And that research has brought me to the ancient Great and ancient Rome .
Secting me because I &apos;ll come up and then goes back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
And it was thinking that creativity was this spirit looks like divin-looking divin-svenisse and unknown for a distant reasons .
The Greeks called these spirits guardians of creativity .
Socrate , wonderful , he believed to have a dealing for a very long time .
Romores were the same idea , but they called that kind of spirit without a genius .
The one that is great , because the Romorrow was really thought that a genius was somebody particularly smart .
They believed that a genius was this kind of divine that believed was living in literally in the walls of a little bit of the artist , a little bit like the wild . And that was a little bit of a hidden extension of nose ose ose ose work and modeling the out-the-the-work .
Exctitional -- here , that is the distance of which I talk about -- that that &apos;s the psychological construct that you protect from your job .
And everybody knew it was how it worked , right ?
So , antic artists were protected by some things , like the too narcism , right ?
If your job was exceptional , you couldn &apos;t take it all the deserved , everybody knew that you were helped by this genius .
If your failed job , it wasn &apos;t your own all your fake , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a unable .
And so people have made creativity in West for a long time .
And then the Renaissance came and everything , and it changed , and it &apos;s a great idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe on the middle of all of the mysteries and without getting more to space to the creatures and destroyed detap .
This was the rational principle and people started to think that creativity came to think creativity came out of creativity .
And for the first time in history , and it started to referred to this , or that artist as a genius that artist as a person with the genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think it allows somebody , a simple person to believe you &apos;re like a recipient as a source , as a source of all the mysteries , creative , unknown and unknown and unknown and the source of all the divins and a responsibility for a very big one for the human pagile .
It &apos;s like to ask someone to enjoy the sun .
And it &apos;s a whole ego and it &apos;s completely and it makes all these kinds of engineers .
And I think it was a pressure to destroyed the artists in passed .
And , if that &apos;s true , and I think it &apos;s , the question becomes , and I think it &apos;s right now ?
Can we do it diversously ?
Maybe you go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between human and mystery .
or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t take 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And probably people in the audience who would be legitimate scientific suspects on the notion of , you do , you make people get their own their own own own own .
I &apos;m probably not going to convince you all about this thing .
But the question I want to ask is -- why why is it ?
Why don &apos;t you think it in this way ?
Because it makes more sense of anything that I &apos;ve ever heard to explain explanation of the imprevediability of the creative process .
And a process that , as anyone who has ever tried to do something -- so , basically , all here -- you know , you don &apos;t really understand rationally .
And in fact , it can seem to be completely paranormess .
I &apos;ve done this recently , recently with the wonderful poeeted Ruth Stone , who has been a poet for all of life and said to me that during his life and said that during his childhood in the rural Virginia , working in the fields , and he felt , in fact , when a poetry came from the landscape .
He said to me that it was like a train , for the train .
And that was going to roling to the landscape .
It felt it , because he was doing the land under his feet .
He knew that I had one thing to do to do at that point and was , &quot; running like a matta . &quot;
And he was going to home and he was going to go to this poem , and it wouldn &apos;t have to make any other paper and a match enough , and it was going to pick it up , foragement and grab it , foragement and grab it on the page .
Other time , you couldn &apos;t be enough , so correct and correct , and he was going to go to home and poem the house and she was going to rolling her through the landscape , trying to go , and she kept roll through the landscape , trying to say , &quot; another poet . &quot;
Then there were those times -- this is not going to forced -- there were some moments when it was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was trying to paper and the poetry and paper passed it through , and he said , &quot; He was going to go , and he said , &quot; He was like to go , and then he said , &quot; He was like to go to the other hand and the office .
And he was the poetry from the tail and put it into his body and moved to the page .
And in these cases , poetry would be presented on the page and the counter-page page , and the last word to the first word .
So when I felt I thought -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly the same same as my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a constitute .
I &apos;m a mud , and my way to work is ; I wake up to the same orary every day and sweat and work and passing it .
But even , I &apos;m just in my aggin tuned Tag , I &apos;ve got got pushed up against that thing , sometimes .
And I guess that a lot of you have the han .
You know , even if the work and ideas came to me from a certain source of you , I wouldn &apos;t know .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it in a way to do not get us to lose their head , but rather , that , that makes us healthy ?
As I think , the best example of the contemporary Tom Waits , I have a Tom Waits , which I interviewed several years ago .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the most of life was the incarnation of the artist &apos;s remarkable contemporary , trying to control , management these species of impulses creative impulses .
But then he invecked , he sat , and he was driving on a highway in Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
It was going to be very quickly and all this little melodia , this little melodia , which comes to his head as inspiration , elusiva and the wants , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the desidera , but it doesn &apos;t know how to get it .
It doesn &apos;t have a pend of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a pend .
So he starts to hear this kind of old is growing up in him , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;ll just go up with this song even .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to the panic , he stopped .
I &apos;ll give the whole whole whole whole new process .
He just looked at the sky and said , &quot; Sorry , don &apos;t you see that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Do you look like to write a song now ?
If you really want to exist , it &apos;s going to be a more closely by one when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , you &apos;ll go to importantly a other today .
You &apos;re seeing Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his work process changed after this .
Not the job , the work was still dark as always .
But the process , and the fish that was reduced him when the genius was released when the genius , the genius that came out of him -- the genius that was going to have to be interhyorized and went to revenue that it was not to be a interhyorized thing and tories .
But yes , this peculiar , wonderful bizarre , wonderful bizarre , a conversation between Tom and this strange thing that is in the outside , but it wasn &apos;t Tom .
So , how I felt that story started to change a little bit of the way I was working on and I was already saved me once .
This idea , I &apos;m saved when I was writing , &quot; Mangia , &quot; Prega , &quot; and fall in one of those despair that we &apos;re causing all of when we &apos;re working on something and we can &apos;t do and you start thinking that will be a disaster , which is the worst book .
Not just bad , just the worst book .
And I started to think of this project .
But then I remember Tom I was talking about Tom that I was talking to it .
So I got up my face on the manoscritical and I &apos;d refresh my comments to a vacuum angle .
And I said , &quot; Social , what we know , you know , you know that if this book is not going to be a brilliant is not going to be a hot hot , right ?
Because I &apos;m putting all in here , I &apos;m putting all I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to present and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what I don &apos;t do .
I &apos;ll go to write the same because it &apos;s my job .
And I would like to be recorded that I was today to do my part . &quot; Because -- at the end is so , OK -- -- I finally , OK -- centuries do it in the deserts of the North Africa people were going to be on the middle of moon and the dance and the grand dance and dance and music that went on for the dance .
And they were always magnified because the dancers were professional and they were great .
But every time , it was rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became actually transcending .
And I know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know that I know that you &apos;ve all seen , at some point , a performance .
It was like the time to stop , and the dancer walks up through a kind of portal and nothing else , you &apos;d like to do it , like 1,000 noticed , but it was it in the way , it was going to run .
And suddenly , it doesn &apos;t just like a human .
But he accese from diamong and under light on the fire of divinity .
And when this happened , it was , at time , people knew what was , called him in his name .
They were to sing their hands and they started to sing , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
I &apos;m going to be historic note -- when the invest the south of the Southern of Spain , soon , I soon have this habits to change in centuries from &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , &quot; Ole , &quot; you can still hear in the corride or in the corride or in the flame .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , the ones , Allah , they , Allah , and I &apos;m just a great , &quot; uncomprehensive , &quot; a God .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes up the day after , for the dancer itself , when you wake up and you see them , and then you find out that &apos;s 11 in the morning , it &apos;s not more .
It &apos;s just a very bad to the chest chest , and maybe it can &apos;t be able to ever ever get to that altitude .
And maybe nobody is going to sing the name of God still while it &apos;s going to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most painful re-porous re-doing in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so corosciant if you can &apos;t believe , you know , it &apos;s most extraordinary aspects of your being being .
But just believe that you &apos;re given to a remarkable source of this team from a unimaginable source of this team in your life that team in your life that you have to go to somebody else when you &apos;re finished .
And , you know , if we think it &apos;s all about it .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s certainly like I thought about it for several months during the working of the book that I &apos;ll public public , and dangerous , and I &apos;m going to be doing it , and I was the dangerous , and I was followed to do it for a few months on my great success .
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel electrized by this is , I don &apos;t have fear .
Don &apos;t cross you . It &apos;s just your job .
You &apos;re going to present you for your side , whatever it can be .
If your job is dance , you know , you know , you know , you know , if your job is dancing .
If the divine , absurd genius , you know , I &apos;ll just take some of wonderful , for a only time through your effort , &quot; you know , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Otherwise , you do the same dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot; to yourself .
I think and I think it &apos;s to teach him .
&quot; Ole ! &quot; to yourself , even for having had human love and testing , so that &apos;s the gads to make you present .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can mean and the discovery of new set .
We &apos;re now starting a new course : we started to digitize biology and now we start digital the biology and now we &apos;re coming from that digital code , designing and synthesizing .
We &apos;ve always tried to get big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists , I think we &apos;ve been trying to figure out the number levels .
We tried different approaches , reducing it to the minimal terms .
We &apos;re going to be doing by almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the analog of biology to the digital of the computer .
Now , we ask : can we regenerate life , or create new from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome between those who can authoreplicate in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a smaller even smaller .
We can eliminate a hundred of genes about 500 of the genes that are here .
But when we look at its metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our own .
I think , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this can bring to a living cell .
So , we decided that the only way to design was synthesize this chromosome in a way that we could change the components to bring them into the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of &quot; Can we synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Can the chemistry consenent to produce these big molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create before ?
And , in case , we can make a cromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemical material that is inhert .
The speed with which we can digitize life is growing up to exponential rhythm .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , design , rather slowly , but it &apos;s improving .
And our most recent results the results on a exponential curve .
We started more than we started more than about 15 years ago .
The process has required a lot of passages , starting with a bioethic review before the first experiments .
But we found that synthesize of DNA is very hard .
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that producing little segments of DNA , and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the more segment is a degenerative process : the more mistakes .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these fragments and corgging the mistakes .
And this was our first attempty , to start by digital information from the Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a small virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , actually , acted the courcourtage of errors and get a DNA molecule .
And the interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material that &apos;s inherent material , and we put it into the bacteria , and they started to read this genetic code and to make the viral particles .
The viral particles have been released by the cells , they come back and they destroy the E.
I &apos;ve talked about recently with the members of the oil industry , and I say to them that they have certainly understood this model .
They have been on more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things larger .
We wanted to build the entire chromosome of the bacteria .
I &apos;m more than 580 thousand genetic code .
So we thought we were to build it in cassette of the size of the virus , so that we can change cassette cassette to figure out what the components of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , in 1995 , the standard accurate was a mistake for every 10 thousand basis .
We found it , resequenced it , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence we wouldn &apos;t be able to work .
One part of the process is designing long as 50 to create them long as a result , and it &apos;s a lot of other segments of 50 to build smaller smaller sounits working together .
We take some things together here .
You &apos;ve probably read that we put in the flygrain .
Think of it that : We have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , Gs and T.
Three of those letters , put together about 20 amminds acids , and there &apos;s a specific order to letters for every ammindset .
So we can use the genetic code to write , sentences , fraskves , thoughts .
What we did at the beginning was self-roll .
Some of them have been delused by the fact that it wasn &apos;t poem .
We designed these segments to be able to just join with enzymes .
There are people who are repair and put them together .
And we started to assembly of the parts , starting with the parts of five to seven thousand to seven thousand to seven thousand and and letters , and they make them to make them to make them to get 72 to them to the letters to get 72 to the letters .
In every step , we made these sets down segments so that we could sequencing them because we &apos;re trying to create a good process process .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this looks like the tabellon the basket of a foundary gassignment .
When we get these little segments very long , more than 100 thousand basis , it &apos;s not going to grow it directly in the E.
You get to the modern molecular biology .
So we &apos;ve seen other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called the reomologist reomologist , which in biology , which is useful for repair to join the DNA .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism called Deinococcus , can absorb three million radiation of radiation .
You can see in the upper riquick of the way of his destroyed is destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s reassembled exactly as it was before .
There &apos;s thousands of organisms that they can do it .
These organisms can be a whole thing .
They can live under vacuum .
I &apos;m absolutely sure life exist in space , and you can find new environments of water .
Actually , NASA showed that this is happening .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built using these processes , just using the lieven-appropriate design .
The yeast , put it automatically .
This picture was not taken with a very very regular microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It &apos;s a so big molecule that we can see it with a little bit of a light microscope .
These are pictures that they cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the publishers we did a long time ago .
I &apos;m more than 580,000 letters , of genetic code .
It &apos;s the largest molecule that &apos;s a defined structure that &apos;s ever created by man .
It has a 300 million to the molecular weight .
If we pass it with a carat 10 without spaces , you &apos;d like to 142 pages only to transform this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ? How can we do it ?
Of course , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , obviously , let &apos;s obviously a young box .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s even easier when it comes to eucarily cells as our : you just can just get nuclear nuclear and put another , which is basically the cloning process .
In the bacterium of a chromosome is integrated inside the cell , but we recently demonstrate we &apos;re able to do a complete trapial trapial trapial trapial trapial trapp .
We clean a chromosome from a microbial crumbing from a microbial species .
The two are different than men from mice .
We add some gene more in a way we could decide what to do for this chromosome .
And then it &apos;s sholed with the enzymes , so that they kill all proteins .
And when we put it into the cell was amazing -- and you &apos;ll open our soft graphic graphic , the new chromosome has gone into the cell .
And we were thinking that we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried it anyway .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that tantissir have added a second or a third chromosome somewhere , add in a second thousands of new traits to that species .
So , who think about evolution as one gene at the time that you can change it doesn &apos;t understand much of biology .
There are enzymes called the restriction enzymes that even digital DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell , you didn &apos;t have one .
The phone : The chromosome that we put it up .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other chromosome as a material extraneous , and we found with just the cell and the new chromosome .
It became blue because of the genes that we put in .
And in a short short amount of time , all the characteristics of a species , you &apos;ve gone lost , and it turned into a new species , based on the new software that we put into a new species , based on the new software that we put into the cell .
All the proteins have changed , members have changed , and members have changed , and when we read the genetic code exactly what we &apos;ve moved you .
Now , this may seem to be like genetics , but by alchemy , but by by allowing the DNA , we can change things in a very substantial way .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that here is not about genesis -- but progression from three and a half million years of evolution , and I &apos;ve already told that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion where they &apos;re going to be created in this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s obvious enough when we think about the necessity .
We &apos;re going to go for six and a half billion people to 9 billion people to 9 billion in the next 40 years .
I &apos;m born for example : I was born in 1946 .
Now , there &apos;s three people on the planet for each other in the 1946 ; it &apos;s going to be four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medicine , and gas and gas for six and a half billion people .
It &apos;s going to be even more hard to do it for nine .
We use five billion coal-billions of fuel barrels , more than 30 billion barrels .
That means a hundred million barreles a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to repeat them , it will be a huge challenge .
And we have to keep in the most of CO2 from these materials that ends up in the atmosphere .
In today , because of the scientific discoveries around the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they &apos;re designing that are the design that are the things that are designed for the future .
The electronic industry has only a dozen about components , and you think about how many different things came out .
Our limits here is data from biological reality and from our imagination .
Now , we have now , because of these methods of synthesization , to create what we call a combinatory genomics .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a million a day .
Think of the 20 million genes or you could optimize the processing to produce optimize processes , new vaccines , we can change , because of a small team , and create more molecular biology that over the last 20 years .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemical production or fuel , or fuel production , etc .
This is a few software instantaneal of some software programmed that we &apos;re working to be able to sit and design a computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how they &apos;ll be .
We know exactly how their genetic code .
Now , we &apos;re focusing on the fourth generation .
You also saw you who extract ethanol from the grain was a bad finish experiment .
We have depending on the third generation that will be used to be very soon to the zucchererereral fairer than the opposite or different kinds of butanle .
But the only way biology in which biology can have a great impact without increase the cost of food and limb and limb the available to turn CO2 into a matter before , so we &apos;re working to design cells that can achieve this goal , and we think we can have the first charge of the first fourth generation in about 18 months .
The solar light combined CO2 is a metodododowntown -- but in our discoveries around the world , we found different methods .
This is a organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , about 2,500 feet deep deep to the ebollion water .
It creates metane by using using molecular CO2 hydrogen as a source of energy .
We &apos;re trying to figure out if we can incanal CO2 , which can easily be carried through tubes , convert that CO2 in charcoal , to drive this process .
So , we think we could be able to increase what the question of &quot; what life is &quot; is &quot; as &quot; is &quot; We , versus &quot; what life is &quot; is , versus -- we have a modest of the entire oil industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do this for TED , where can you do ?
It would be a main source source of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working for using the same methods to create instantly vaccines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with flu , we &apos;re always back of a year and with a dollar in less when it comes to find the vaccine right .
I think that can change combinable vaccine in advanced ,
Here &apos;s how the future might start to look at changing , now , the tree of evolution , accelling evolution with synthetic bacteria , and finally cells .
We &apos;re so much from improving people .
Our purpose is to make a long enough living long enough to try to make it . Thank you very much .
I &apos;m going to show you , the most quickly possible possible , some fundamental work , in the new technology that we brought to the Microsoft in the following to a buy almost a year exactly . This is Seadragon . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s a environment where you can interact is at the local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data .
Here we &apos;re seeing a lot of gigabyte photographic gigabs of digital photographs with a kind of a very quick , despite the images .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much the whole whole thing is that we see , how big these crops are of data or images .
Most of these are communities photographs , but this for example is a scan from Congress Library of Congress , and it comes into the 300 megamma , and it comes into the gamma of the Congresses .
It doesn &apos;t make a difference because the only thing that limit the presents of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen at any time . It &apos;s also a very flexible architecture .
This is a whole book , for a whole book , not data .
This is the Dickens . Every column . Every column is a check .
To demonstrate that it &apos;s just about text and not about images , we can do something like that , to make a really really look at what &apos;s a real representation of the tisit , not a picture .
It may be a little artificial way to read a electronic book .
I don &apos;t give you .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s a number of The Guardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a section .
And really gives you the pleasure and the good experience to read the real carroneer version of a magazine , or a daily spappler of a half of a kind of a half .
We also did something with the corner of this number in particular number of The Guardian .
We created a high-resolution resolution resolution -- much higher than what you use in a normal advertising -- and we put in the content of the extra .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the space limits of space on the screen .
I hope that it means to put people on the households and other similar porcheries , not to be necessary .
Of course , of course , maps is one of the obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say we have a contribution to do this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. overhead of a geospace over a NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually a living on the web ; you can go and see it .
This is a project called Photosynth , which fighting two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research at very interesting computer made by Noah Snavely , a student at the University of Washington , with the help of Steve Seadrich and Rick Seads . It &apos;s a very good partnershipping collaboration .
And it &apos;s living on the web , I was running from Seadragon .
You can see when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from one image to the other , and have this kind of experience of experience to be multiple resolution .
But the spacecraft of images here is actually a meaning .
The algorithms of visualization , have been recorded these images together , so that they correspond to the real places where you imagine -- all over to the Roccies on Montagne Montagne &apos;s Montagne &apos;s been taken . Here &apos;s a few few few slides , and these things have been all connected to the elements of a slightly deal-stable , and these things have been all connected to space level .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;ve time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more spacecraft .
I want to go directly to one of the original data set of Noah-original data prototype from a previous prototynth that we did work for the first time , to show you what I think is really the key behind this technology , Photosynth technology , Photosynth technology , Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily evident by looking at the environments that we put in the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of Nothree Dame reconstruction took by Flickr . Bauck Nothree Dame in Flickr and you get images of types in shirt , other campaigment , and so on . Ognr one of these boundaries , and so on . You know , you know , a picture that &apos;s discovery to the model .
So , they &apos;re all taken by Flickr and they were all connected to space level in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to ign this very simple .
You know , I would never be thought of finish working for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifically to get this kind of accounting here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of photocaming : from those cell phones to the SLR professional , a significant number , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to try the more strange .
Many of them are blocks by facing , etc .
Somewhere there is a series of photographs -- there .
This is a Nothree Dame poster .
We can go from the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is taking data from a whole whole collective memory of how it looks like the land , from visual point of visual view -- and connects all that data together .
All those pictures become connected together , larger than the sum of the parts .
You have a model of the entire land that emerges .
Think about this as the prolungment of Stephen Lawler on Earth virtual Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as people are using it , and the whose advantages for people who use it , and the use .
Their photograph are marched with meaders by other people .
If someone is is the idea of contrast all these sets and saying , my name , my picture of the Cathetic , I can use it as a picture of the Nowisdom , and I can use it as ingresses of ingresses , and I can use it as ingress in space , in that metaphor the way , using anyone else , and having a social experience of the kind of , to have a social experience of the kind of the cross-mood and cross-use of the cross-mood and cross-use of the cross-motherwise .
Of course , a consequence of course , is extremely virtual models of all interesting virtual models of all interesting land by seen airplane and satellite images and similar , but from the collective memory .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I &apos;m going to figure out what your software is going to do is that at some point in the next few years , all the photographs are all about people in the entire world will be basically connected with ?
BAA : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is actually doing is to discover .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the basis of the content of the images .
And what becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of the semant information that many of these images have .
As you do a research for images , you know , a sentence and the heads on the web page is a lot of information about the images .
Now , what if that picture is connected to all your picture ?
So the amount of semaned interconnection and the amount of wealth that comes out of it is really a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really amazing .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the main pleasures when you travel and one of the extra delication for the ethnographic research is the one of the people who you have to have the antic traditions , among the workers , touch it in the wind , touch them , touched in the raildating , the driver to the plants .
I think , the shamoring Jaguar also travel beyond the Lattea , or that the elderly of the Inuit &apos;s still cold , or that the Inuit &apos;s still cold of significant , or that in Himalayas , the world &apos;s most important important important , and the idea that the central importance of anthropology , and the idea that the world we live in which we don &apos;t exact in a sense , but it &apos;s just a reality , of reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our own stirp-made , good or bad , many generations ago .
And of course , we all share of the essential strongly .
We all all come . We all all of the .
We &apos;re subjects to re-initiation .
We have to face the inexorability of death , so we don &apos;t surprised it and we drop and we dg --
We all have an art .
What &apos;s the particular thing we &apos;re the particular rhythm of the song , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that they &apos;re the forests of Borneo , or the following follow of the Voodoo &apos;s trouble , or the desert warrior desert wareors in Kenya , Curanderies , or a camp in Ande , or a camp in the heart of the Sahara .
And he was my journey of journey in the desert a month ago , or a yak allowed by Qomolangma , on Everest , on Everest , on Everest , the demonstrate demonstrate .
All of these populations are teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of moving around the world .
And , if you reflect a moment , it &apos;s a concept that it can give you hope .
And together , the miriades of the world create a spiritual spiritual , which is a spiritual . And that &apos;s important to the planet and it &apos;s important to the planet , as biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural spider as a ethnososphere and you can call the etnosphere and you can call the etnosphere , the ideas , inspirations , ideas , inspirations , intuitions , brings , intuitions , you bring out of being imagination from the human awareness .
The etnosphere is the wonderful potential of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we &apos;re and of what we can be as unless species .
And because biosphere was very much of the biosphere , as a long as it was successful in the etnosphere and unfortunately too much more rapidly .
No biologist , for instance , would say that 50 percent of all species is or is on the east of the extinction simply because it &apos;s fake , or -- in the most apocalyptic diversity -- and you don &apos;t even get closer to hypothesis -- that &apos;s the cultural diversity of cultural diversity -- that &apos;s cultural diversity .
The survey of all that is , of course , the linguistic loss .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not just a vocabulary or a vocabulary , or a series of rules .
One language is the spraking of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the half of the animous that the animate of every culture comes in in the world .
Every language is a rainforest , a stick , a thought , a thought , a very spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we sit here in Monterey , at least half not is subsurrounded in the ears of the children .
They don &apos;t get you taught children , which means , unless we have a lot of camps , which is already died .
What is more sad than you have flying from silence , of being the last talking about a language , the last talking about a language , you don &apos;t have a language of transmit , or anticipating the promise of the children ?
This is a bit of a bit of people in the world in some of two weeks : every two weeks of the world are moving and brings with them in the grasp the last sillabor of a language .
And I know somebody who &apos;s going to say , &quot; Don &apos;t that better ?
The world would not be a better place if we &apos;re going to let all talk about the same language ? &quot; We &apos;re all yoruba .
We &apos;re talking about kogi .
You &apos;ll find a sudden what it means you can &apos;t talk to your own own own own .
I &apos;d like to give you a journey through the etnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a assage of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I say &quot; different ways of existing ways of existing . &quot; I mean , I &apos;m very different ways of existing .
So let &apos;s take for example , Barasana , in the Amazon System , the people of the window , which creds to the mit of provening from the latest breakthroughs in the west panish panish &apos;s the bulk of the waste in the package of serious respect .
It &apos;s a people who can &apos;t distinguish the blue color from the green because the time it &apos;s identified black black black in the forest of the forest , which depends on the people .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rule , called &quot; exogamia language : You have to marry a person talking about a different person .
All of this has roots in the mythological past , though , though the particularly , in these families , and they &apos;re talking about six or seven languages because of a marriage .
They &apos;re listening to and then start talking about it .
We take one of the most interesting tribe tribes with whom I &apos;ve lived , the Waorans of Eastor , a incredible people who had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionar-seven missioned contact .
They &apos;ve done by the top photographs that they react them in the case that was retracing that they were advising that this people of the forest that people of the forest that they had never seen anything about bi-dimensional .
They &apos;ve been taken from the land , they turned to research for a shape or a shape and , not by finding nothing , they &apos;ve concluse that they were treated to the diavian , and they killed five missionaries with the lance .
But the Waorans didn &apos;t kill just the foreign &apos;t just the foreign &apos;t killed the foreign &apos;t just the foreign of the Waorans , they didn &apos;t just kill the foreign &apos;t just the foreigers .
They killed between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by their own .
We were saved to eight generations , and we found two natural death , and when we went to know , they had a lot of them was invecked by , and then they killed him , and then they killed it . And then they killed it itself .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps and recognize species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned a really interesting task when my Harvard professor , asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti between the secret societies to the basis of the power of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes , and Tonton Macoutes , and I impossessor to do zombie .
I would make sense of a miraculous , I would have to understand Vodoo culture and that Voodoo is not magic .
It &apos;s a very complex metaphorrified vision of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to tell me about the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christianity , Islam , Buddddhism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no religious faith . And they did , but the Voodoo is not other than the distilled of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of n-slavery ,
What makes interesting is that voodoo is the intense relationship between life and death .
So , you live , they &apos;re born .
The spirits can be invocated by the Great Act , they respond to the race of dance and replace that for a short moment , to the follow soul of living in a way that you can get the god .
So , you know , you know , &quot; You know , you &apos;re going to church to talk about God .
We give God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re sitting , is the spirit that you &apos;re going to be , how can you do it ?
So you see these amazing events : following the voodoo in state of trance that touch impunized , &quot; very strong , &quot; very strong , very strong infuric demonstration of the body when it &apos;s catalyzed in a state of extremely excited excited .
And the people who I &apos;ve been in which I have the most extraordinary , is Kogi Santa Marta de , in the Santa Marta , in Colombia .
They were to the ancient civilization that once they lived on the charge carac plant of Colombia in the carrying carrying on the willing , the people would retreat the charge of the vast of the carrying plant on the charge of carrying plant .
In a blood continent of blood , this people have never been conquered by the spagnoled .
But I &apos;m actually government government government , but their formation is a very remarkable .
The young people are taking away from families to three or four years , and they live secret in a good world and shadow in a good world and shadow in the head of stone of the ice for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years , by the way to reproduce the nine months of gestation that transmate into the user of the mother , now , metaphor usually .
For all of this time , they &apos;re acculated to the values of their society , values that predict that their prayers and only their prayers and forced their prayer , or to say the ecological balance .
And so that &apos;s amazing , you know , suddenly they &apos;re taken out and for the first time to live , at the age of 18 , they see an alard . And that &apos;s the moment of awareness , when the sun kissing the remote of all that they have learned in the theory is a conferred back and says : the pret it &apos;s a step back and says : &quot; The pret is a step of step back and says : : : &quot; You know , &quot; You know , &quot;
&quot; Go ? Right ? I &apos;m like I said .
It &apos;s amazing . It &apos;s now to you . &quot;
They call them the most of the most people and say that we , the minors of the destruction of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the indigenous populations and aging the environment , and the old history of selvage , which is a razy concept , which is a razes concept of its simplicity or maybe invoating Thoreau and we say that these people are closer to the Earth .
Indies , people are not feelings , no feelings from nor indebate .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the malarial paluds , or in the Tibet , but because of time and the rhythththanks to the time and rituals , they created a mystical mystical idea of being aware of closer , but to a very good intuition of it . The concept that the Earth can live only because it &apos;s infused by human aware .
What does that mean ?
That &apos;s a guy who &apos;s growing Ande credit that grows into the mountain is a spirit of the Ande that will lead his destiny is going to be a different human being deeply different with the mountain or that place a lot of different with the mountain or that place that &apos;s increasing to a Montana of the Ande that you can make a rock of rocks up .
which is the dimon-the-three-in-three-in-mineral cat is irrelevant .
What is interesting is the metaphor that report the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia Britannica believe that forests they needed to be cut off .
And that &apos;s made me a different human being from my friends . Kwakiutl that believe that the forests are the dimora of Hukukukukukukukuknibal , and the downnnnnnnn-willilling with the Hamatsa .
If you start to consider that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of them all about the sensational discoveries .
I took this picture to open up in the norony of the norony of Western Sorony .
Some of you have heard about the ayahuask , the most powerful substance psychophical submit .
What makes the waste is not the pharmacological power , it &apos;s not the potential of substance , but his processing elaboration . It &apos;s a two elements .
On one side , this legian , leaving a series of Tia-coal series , harmoline and harmoline , slightly hallucinogen , slightly hallucinogen , slightly hallucinogen , a lian of the legian , that &apos;s leaving lian and harmoline , harmoline and harmoline , and harmoline , and harmoline , slightly hallucinogene , and it &apos;s a little bit of the hallucinogen ,
And by by by by the only plant , you know , it &apos;s a smoke that alter a little bit of a coffee family arcaffecting by a coffee , Psychoptry , and the viridis called Psychotry and alien viridis .
This plant contains powerful powerful , very similar to the serotonin , dithylonin , dithypppppyyyyyptamine .
If you ever see Yanomami , and you &apos;ll get on the bird of the substance that make from a different species , it contains methydimethydimethyyptamine .
To take that dust on the nose is a little bit like being shot from a fucile card and land on a bark pinch of the waste .
I often know , I often have to my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who took the psycheek , with his discovery of the fungi hallucinogens in Mexico .
In my thesis , you can &apos;t get these trippppptamines as hallucinogens because if you can &apos;t tell anybody to be hallucinated . And , you know , the tripamines can &apos;t be abunte to be hamine , because you dency it &apos;s obviously in a enzyme that &apos;s obviously in the entire entire extinct , demonetary monoin-looking handed oxyyydasn &apos;t get to be handed oxyn-inated .
It &apos;s possible to get the orally if you abunts with other chemicals that they dency MAO .
Now , it &apos;s the beautiful : the Tibeta-coal that you find in this lian injury , they have MAO , the same kind of need to potentially potentially potentially . The question of the source of plants , like these people have to find them two defologically not similar to the amount of plants , but that if you can see two defologically not similar defologically , but that if you combine to the whole parts of the parts ?
We use the great eugly of trying to figure and mistake , which can be infruted .
But if we ask Indians , they &apos;ll tell us , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We know , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We know , &quot; We know , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We know , &quot; We know , &quot; We know , &quot; We know , &quot; We &apos;re &quot; We &apos;re the &quot; We &apos;re the plants . &quot; We &apos;re the plants . &quot; We &apos;re the plants . &quot; We know , &quot; We know , &quot; We &apos;re
What does that mean ?
This tribes , Copan , has 17 variety of ayahuask variety of ayahuask , and that at our eyes would come into the forest species .
If you ask them how they stabilize their toxonomy will say , &quot; I was going to understand it of plants , the rest of the rest of you don &apos;t know everything ? &quot; I &apos;ve said , &quot; No .
The solution is : You take 17 varieties in a night of moon the filling with a different tone .
So , you don &apos;t graduate at Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting to count stami .
Now , &#91; applausers &#93; the problem is that even those of us that have to heart people who have to have their heart people who have to be painting , but somehow reduced to our real world , and passes over .
In fact , the 21st years , it &apos;s going to be reminded for its or its technological innovations , but rather like the one was where we &apos;re stopped and we used very active active , or passionate accepted the mass destruction of the mass of the biological diversity of the planet . Now the problem is not change .
All of the cultures through cultures are involved in a dance for new possibilities .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux Indians have no stop being Sioux when they put on their arc and freceived as American didn &apos;t stop being American when they put on horse and hot .
It &apos;s not change or technology that mining the integrity of ethnososphere . It &apos;s the power .
The hard hard :
And if you look at the world , you find that these are not been destined to disappear .
They &apos;re living creatures and dynamics , which is that go beyond the adaptation of forces that go beyond their adaptation .
Which is a disboscampaign in the Penan --
a lot of Sarawak , in Sarawak , in the Asian East , a people who lived in the forest to a generation of a free free to the servitery and the prostitution on the ridumb of the ridm , where you can see the river river &apos;s river from the lim that the free to the lim , where you can see the ride of the horizon , where the window , and you know ,
You ready to fill the fashion the forest .
Or , in the Yanomami , are the diseases that came with with the discovery of the gold .
If we &apos;re going to move on the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the hard dumb to domination .
As you know the genocide , the extinction of a people , is convicted to universal level , but the ethnic destruction of the lifestyle of a people , not only is it &apos;s not only done , it &apos;s not only about it , but it &apos;s a part of the development strategift .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of Tibet until you start off at the beginning .
I &apos;ve taken 6,000 miles from Chengdu in the West China through Western Tibet , coming to Lhasa with a young link , but only arriving only only came to Lhahead with a young college , but only came to Lhasa young age , I realized what we feel about .
6,000 monuments sacred reduced in dust and lights .
1.2 million people killed by the military in the Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was assigned to the Panchen Lama .
The Chinese to say that it was killed to the time of Chinese invasion .
His uncle fuised with Sua Saint during the diaspora that led people to Nepal .
His mother was imprisoned and his blame was rich .
It was brought to hide to carch at the age of two hidden birth under his gonna because he couldn &apos;t live without him .
The sister , who did the same , it was put in reducing education .
One day , he was stopped a rumed fascivil Mao and , and , for this transgression , has been put to the forced to the forced jobs for seven years .
The pain of Tibet can be insopportable , but the insopportable .
And it &apos;s all over the end , it &apos;s going to reduce a choice .
We want to live in the world &apos;s world , or do we want to take the world policeman or we want to get the policy ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before we died , before he died that his greatest fear was that in our view of the world , we &apos;re not just going to see the whole gamm of the human imagination , but one day we &apos;ll see the whole gamm of thinking , but one day we &apos;ll see them from a foreignment of the human imagination .
And it &apos;s humiliating that our species is exist for 600,000 years .
The Neolitica Revolution , who gave us agriculture , who gave us agriculture , who has made us resting the poetry of the seed , by replacing the poetry of the specialization , creating the gerarchy of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has to be 300 years .
That &apos;s not suggests me , I don &apos;t suggests that we have to all the challenges that we &apos;re going to have to deal with in the millennia .
When to these miriades of the world is asked what it means to be human , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all refer the chance of being what we &apos;re : a aware of a conscious species , which has to make all the people and the gardens can track .
I took this picture on the north of the Baffin , when I went to check with Inuit , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and the Olaya , and he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The dog government is not always gentile with the Inuit &apos;s been in the 1950s to stabilize our supremimidden people .
The grandfather of this man refused to go .
Hopefully for his life , he took them to all the weapons , and all of his equipment .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t have the cold , they do it .
The pills in origins were made of fish flying in origins in skin .
The grandfather of this man didn &apos;t reward from the night or the arctic or the dard that suffieled .
It &apos;s flew away , and it &apos;s hot the panthot in focus and defeced in their hand . When you did it frozen , and they work with them with a frozen .
It &apos;s got salive on the downtown , and when I became solid , and when I solid solid , he killed a dog .
He shake the dog and created a bright , and a bright , and the dog made a slums , he enliked another dog and it &apos;s disappeared on the banking , the cutting on the banking , and the cacy .
We want to talk about horarselling with nothing ?
In the open-downnn-downtown reduced to Inuit &apos;s total control area of a larger territory area of California and Texas maps .
It &apos;s their new pathy . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a independent territory . They all the mineral resources .
One beautiful , an example of how a natione-state can re-re-up with their people .
And , to end , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious to the people who we have been in these remote areas of the planet , realizes they &apos;re not remote .
For someone is home .
They represent the sections of human imagination that go to the dawn of time . And for us all , the dreams of these kids , like the dreams of these kids , become part of the geography of hope .
To end , we of National Geographic , we are convinced that politicians will never get to nothing .
We believe that polemploy --
&#91; Applausers &#93; are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month , 35 million visits site . Every month , 35 million visits .
156 countries transmit our television channel .
Our magazines are lets from millions of people .
Our work is traveling into the ethnososphere to bring our public to to the public to bring into the places of cultural and hopefully , abbracing for the central reveal , the central world : the world of extremely living in diversity , and we have to find a life of life in a world pluralist in a world pluralist and multiculticular world in a world pluralist and multiculticular world , and we have to find a life in a life in a world in a life in a life in a world of life in a life in a life in a life
where the wisdom of all people can contribute to our collective well-being .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope , and I &apos;ll take some college of the college , and I &apos;ll try and highly highly links , in the case you don &apos;t notice .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the official dogma . &quot;
The official dogma official what ?
The official dogma official society . The dogma official society . The dogma official dogma : &quot; If we want to maximmize the well-being of our citizens . &quot;
And the reason is , on one side , in fact that the freedom is itself a value , is precious , useful , essential for human beings .
On the other one , if we &apos;re free , each of us can do that if we &apos;re free , each of us can do everything that massimize our well-being , without any one that deciding in our own .
The way to massively freedom is massizing choice .
More choices choices , more they &apos;re free , and the more is their well-being .
This is , I think , it &apos;s so deeply radicated in society that nobody would be going to do it in a question .
And it &apos;s also deeply radicated in our lives .
I &apos;ll show you some examples of what progress made .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;ll make me a simple note on the stairs for the winds .
In my supermarket is 175 conditions , without counting the 10 variety of oil oil oil oil oil oil , and 12 acres of the oil oil , and 12 acets you can buy a huge number of conditions in the circumstance that nobody of 175 already ready , is that one of the 175 already ready for your own degrees .
Here &apos;s what the supermarket is .
And then you go to the electronic store to buy a stereo : cast , if , CD letter , radio , pire , lifer , amplifier .
And in this single electronic store , there &apos;s a great audiences .
We can make six and a half million different combinations using the components that there are in one only one store .
You have to admit that there &apos;s a lot of choice .
Other fields : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all the telephones , to the cat the time , to the cat that they were supposed to be Bell .
He was born the phone , you didn &apos;t buy it .
One of the way , in the other , was that the phone was not going to break .
These times are gone .
We have now a almost limited variety of phones , especially between cell phones .
Here &apos;s cell phones of the future .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , MP3 , cut them off of the bird , and forth for crust crust .
If you don &apos;t have it still seen in the store under the house , you &apos;re very soon to get .
And what happens is that people come into the store and they do this question . And what is the answer ? The answer ? The answer is &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
So , in other ways of life that are much more important to the acquire the same explosion .
Assistence : It doesn &apos;t happen to the United States that you &apos;re going to go from the doctor and the doctor , you know , what you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do A , or B , &quot; You can do it , and this &quot; B has these benefits and the risks . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Doctor , what should I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; You know , and the B has these benefits , and B has these benefits , and B has these benefits . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you &apos;re , &quot; Doctor if she was me , what do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not like her . &quot;
And we call it &quot; autonomy of the malarious , &quot; expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But it &apos;s not that you can move the weight and responsibility of making decisions from someone who knows something , which is the doctor , to someone else that knows anything -- and almost certainly sick -- and it &apos;s certainly sick -- and so it doesn &apos;t know -- and so it &apos;s not in the ideal condition to make a sense of a patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing of products of drugs , direct to people like me and you , who , if you think you don &apos;t have any sense , given that we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , because we advertising them ?
The answer is that they want to ask him to ask them to ask them to make a recipe .
Something that &apos;s how we &apos;re our identity is a question of choice , as you see in this vignlue . &quot; We don &apos;t want to forced kids . I &apos;ll give them their sex at the right moment . &quot; We don &apos;t really do it . &quot; We have to invent it .
And we can reinventing how many times you get us .
which means that every morning , at the risake , you have to decide that kind of person .
I &apos;m going to the family and the matririmonium , a time time , it almost for anyone , was that there marriage as much as you can , and start to get kids the most soon possible possible .
The only real choice was to who , not when , and not what to do after .
So , it &apos;s really to play .
I teach students very smart students , and I &apos;m going to be 20 percent in less of work than a time .
And not because they &apos;re less bright , not because they &apos;re less diligent .
but why are they imperperpert , you know , &quot; I should do it or not ? &quot;
&quot; I should get married later ? I have to think before children or the career ? &quot;
I &apos;m logoring .
And they &apos;re trying to answer these questions , even though this implical not complete the tasks that I teach , and not get a nice voice to my exam .
And they really have to do that . They &apos;re important .
Now , the job : we &apos;re lucky , as Carl underlying Carl underlying , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , by every day , by every day , from the Hotel Randolph .
And in the parenth , there &apos;s a corner , and I don &apos;t say to anyone where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , this amazing freedom of choice that we have to continue on the work ? It &apos;s that we have to keep on any time , if we have to work or not .
We can go to our son play , play with the calcium , with a mobile phone , Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , tily , tily , on the knees .
And even if they &apos;re all spending , every minute we see that we see our son to roving , we &apos;re asking , &quot; I have to answer this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? I have to email this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is no , it makes the experience of your son very different than what would be in other than it would be in the conditions .
So , anywhere we look at , small things and big , materials and it &apos;s hard , life is a choices of choices .
Once the world was this : Whereas there were some possibilities , but it wasn &apos;t all about choice .
The world of today looks like this : The world is : The dilemma is , &quot; Is it a good thing good thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is , it &apos;s a lot .
The positive layers we know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative .
All of this choice is two negative effects of people .
The first , paradoxically , is that produced paradoxygen , but it &apos;s a lot of liberation .
With many options between which choose , becomes very hard to do it .
I give you a significant example : a study of volunteer for volunteer .
A colleagues had access to the data from Vanguard data , the giant society , with about a million customers in about a million clients .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offer , the percentage of adhesive scenes of two percent .
With 50 sources , there &apos;s 10 percent in less than adhesions when they &apos;re available to when they &apos;re available ?
Because with 50 sources that choose , is sick , it &apos;s sick &apos;s hard to decide , and the choice is returned to the back to the domans .
And tomorrow , and tomorrow , tomorrow , tomorrow , and of course tomorrow .
You know that it doesn &apos;t mean only that these old workers are to eat for dogs because they don &apos;t have enough money , even want to say that decision is so hostica that they lose the complex sources of the dator dunk .
Not participating , they &apos;re losing until five dollars a year from a jobs dator , which would be well-disposed to versaries .
So the parallel is a consequence of the having tropes .
And I think it makes the world .
&quot; And to end , for the ethernity : ketchup , or maionese ? &quot;
You would want to do it to make the right decision , if it &apos;s for ethernity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong background , and yet the condition .
So this is the first effect . The second effect is that even if we can avoid the parallel and make a choice , at the end of the result of how we would be with less options between which choices .
And that for a different reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions between which choosing , if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine you could have a different choice that would be better . And what &apos;s happening is that the alternative . And what &apos;s happening is that the alternative imagined us to the choice , and the repair decreasing on the decision , and the decredit decrease the reaving from the decision ,
even when it was a very good decision .
The more choices choices , the more , you &apos;re easier than any detail that is unddispleased of the opoption .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has clear , very well , how we value we give things we give things to things depends on what we &apos;re count with .
From the rest of the options , when there are many options , it &apos;s easy to represent the actual characteristics of the option that you have to be less sation-made opition .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m sorry with all of the ones that are not in New York .
But that &apos;s what you &apos;re probably going to think .
There &apos;s this couple of Hamptons .
A laming place .
It &apos;s all about splendida . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not going to be . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , damn &apos;t , it &apos;s August . &quot;
&quot; All my neighbors to Manhattan are away . &quot;
&quot; I could park right in front of the house . &quot;
And it goes to two weeks away from the idea that &apos;s losing -- every day -- the chance of parking -- the chance of parking , where it wants .
costo-opportunities demining the soddisfation for what we have , even when choice is excellent .
And the more are the options that we have to consider , the most attractive characteristics will be rewire against how we consciousness .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
It &apos;s about living at the moment , and maybe of living slowly .
But the most important point is that whatever you choose , you choose to not do other .
The things that we don &apos;t choose to attract that they can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : the growing of expectations .
I tried it on my skin buy a new jeans .
I &apos;m almost always always jeans .
Once jeans were just like , you buy them and dressed them and dressed up , they were disagreed , just after they took them a whole life and they were all all , they started to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple new when those old old old people went , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
The committed me , &quot; You want to slim , you know , relaxed fit , relaxed fit ? &quot;
I want them to take a certain time or with the buttons ? &quot; Stonewashed or &quot; acidnal &quot; ? &quot;
&quot; Was you want to put them ? &quot;
&quot; Sotto li wants to bull , &quot; Bla , &quot; Continupright to helencare .
I was skip , and after a while I was able to say , &quot; I want the guy that -- that was the only guy , &quot; I didn &apos;t have what it was , so for a moment , I got all of the jeans , and then I came out of the jeans , and the best couple of jeans I &apos;ve ever had .
It was the maximum . I had the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse is that with all of my choice is that with all my own expectations were altissue , jeans had to be perfect .
I had waiting for the beginning . I didn &apos;t expect anything that exceptional when there was one , you know , 100 different steps , you know , at least a kind of thing that was a perfect thing .
What I did was good , but not perfect .
After I was talking about the chose with what I was trying to do was I &apos;m very unrelated to the expectations .
The addition of options in the life of people don &apos;t do that to increase the expectations that they have respect the excellence of the options of the options of the options of the options of the people in life , it doesn &apos;t make it to increase for the excellence of the options of the options of the people who do not get to
And it will produce less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world &apos;s world &apos;s supposed to be able .
Because if they knew , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more to that .
&quot; He was better when you were worse , &quot; The reason he was better when you were better than when you were worse is that when you were worse was able to meet some pleasant pleasant .
So , in the world that we live -- opulent , industrialized citizens with the expectancy -- the most we can hope that it &apos;s that things are at the altitude of the expectative .
You never surprised you ever surprises because your expectations , my expectations , they &apos;ve been ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Baxative &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I mean -- small autobiographic moment -- which I &apos;m really married and my wife is really beautiful .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t do it .
But it &apos;s not always a bad thing .
And finally , a result of jeans , you know , when there &apos;s just that kind of jeans is that when you &apos;re not satisfied , and you ask , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot; The answer is clear .
The world is the responsible . What would I do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a insodisfacing , and you ask who is the responsible , it &apos;s a clear clear clear that your responsible , it &apos;s just clear that responsible you are .
You could have done better .
With hundreds of varieties , there are no excuse for the insuccessful .
So when people take decisions , even if the result is valid , you &apos;re feeling satisfacfaction and give the hit to them .
In the last years , depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this wave of depression is just that people have experiences have deludent experiences because standard are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation , they think the blame is .
So the final result is that we &apos;re better , actually , but we feel worse .
Let me remember it .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely fake . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit of choice than it is better than it has not to have any of it , but it doesn &apos;t take a lot better .
There &apos;s a magic value , magic value . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve overcome from a piece of piece of the level where the choices improves our life .
Now , from a political point -- I &apos;ve got almost finished -- from the political view , the most of the political view , the following .
What it allows all this to the industrial society is wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know that the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too pocaine .
So the faccenda I &apos;m talking about is a damn exclusive of modern , rich Western society .
And what does depressing and angry is this : Steve Levitt Levitt spoke yesterday about how those expensive and comfortable seats are useful . It &apos;s a money path . It &apos;s a money path . It &apos;s a money spread .
I mean that these choices , complicated and dependious and it &apos;s not just that they &apos;re useful .
I &apos;m also a deleterie .
They &apos;re doing it worse .
If a little bit of what we do is that in our society allows you to have a few people too much possibly possibly , it &apos;s not just their life to improve but our .
This is what economists call a lot of improvement .
A redistribution of income re-income redistribution of the people -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in excess .
To conclude : &quot; You can get it to become everything you want . &quot;
You &apos;re , you &apos;re going to think , &quot; What does that create that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t get anything in a glass . &quot;
&quot; A Mr. imagination , a limited view of the world -- &quot;
and I &apos;m interpretation of that , at the beginning .
But then , I realized , I &apos;m realized that that that fish the long knows that that the fish can see the long long long knows ,
Because the reality is that if you &apos;re missing in frantumes , so that &quot; everything is possible . &quot; You can &apos;t get freedom . You get the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you break the mess that you can divents you can divents sodisfation .
You get the paralysis , and you reduce the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too strange , maybe even for fish , and certainly certainly for us .
But the absence of a symbolic symbolic , is a recipe for injury and , I &apos;m , for the rovine .
Thank you very much .
