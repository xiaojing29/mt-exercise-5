Last year I showed these slides to show that the glasses to demonstrate that glacial calculus , which is almost three million years had the size of 48 , the continental expensive , it &apos;s restretch of 40 percent .
But it &apos;s the gravity of the problem because it &apos;s not going to be spext of the ice .
The artal glacial hythic is , in a sense , the heart of the global climate system .
It expansion of invern and retreated of summer .
The next slide is going to be a carrelated reveness of the last 25 years .
The glaciers are signed in red .
You see , you see , they go to the blue box .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter , which is a summer ice .
You can see that the cosmic ice that is perenjoy , of five years or more , is like a blood , which here was in the body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been so , in 25 years , so .
This is a problem because the rewarming demonstrate for glacious land , where there are huge amounts of fuel that , they go into the artic , they turn into metan , they turn into meters .
I &apos;m going to the total-warming of atmospheric inquate to global warming , that amount could double , super-up , super-point point of not around .
A few laws , a little profound of the metan is already refence from water .
The professored Katey Walter of the University of Alaska has taken a team print a team of the Alaska team .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You &apos;re good . The question is if we &apos;re going to be .
One reason is that this is that this thermal exchange the Groenland .
This is a river at regime .
The ported one never reached levels like that .
This is the Kangerlussuaims , in the southern west of Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea level of the glacial level of the sea , here is where the sea .
These currents are rapidly increasing .
On the other hand of the planet : Antarctica , the largest block of ice on the planet .
The last month scientists have delared that the ice of ice is in negative , and the Antarcttle of the West , which pogy on some of the submarine , is particularly related with some submarine islands , is particularly related in the shoulder .
Equival at six feet of the foot , like Groenland .
Sull Himalaya , the third largest block of ice , you see new lake , which few years ago was glasses .
40 percent of the world population is the fleather of the water is .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of water .
The ported is increased .
But when you deminds , the same happens to water .
In California , the snow on the Sierra Nevada is 40 percent .
The hyriririries are in the crisis .
The predictions , like you know , you &apos;re grasses .
The growing safe in the world leads to a remarkable increase in the world .
The environmental disaster are increasing a race out of normal and unprecedented .
Four times more of the last 30 years I was going to be at the last 30 years I could be before 75 .
This is a lot of unsustainable .
If you look at it in the historical context , you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the moment the Pacific area of Pacific , the Americans , to the United States and both both of the subcontinent , where there is a radical impoverment of oxygen in the ocean .
The greater causes of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossils .
The oil is a problem , and the coal is even worse .
The United States are one of the two of the more emissions , together to China .
And it was going to build a lot of other central central .
But we &apos;re seeing a change of direction .
These are the annullated projects in the last few years and some alternative of the versus .
At any way , there &apos;s a politics in our country .
The industrial and oil has spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the fuel , which is a symbol .
That picture I thought I was something --
I &apos;m going to be Natal Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.3.8 billion litri waste .
Maybe you have seen that on the news .
This is the second largest flow of the flow of the last flow in America .
It &apos;s happened around Natal .
The public of one of the industrial industrial industrial .
Video : You know , you know , &quot; Good carbon is a kind of happy and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it &apos;s going to grow our economy .
Frosty carbon is more and more clean .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and the workable and the workidding the fuel .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The largest minerary society is Massey Coal . This is its administrator . This is its administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I &apos;ll be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelos: not know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima Protection of the Clima has been launched two campaign .
This is a one of them , a part .
Video : The ALergy : At the climate change , we see climate change as a weird , as a weird serious threat our business .
So , for this is to invest a lot of money in a public effort to make public and confused the truth of the coal .
But actually , coal is not spork .
We think it &apos;s clean -- it &apos;s also a good profumo .
So you don &apos;t prepreocuption of climate change .
Let me do .
Video : The one : The one of you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
So you &apos;re going to do a turn around into a structure at the avanid structure for how to pulit .
Strordinarily ! cars are a little rumorous , but this is the sound of the pulit technology .
The fuel consumption is between the major causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology , but the remarkable technology that you see changes everything .
You look at the look at : this is the odial odial technology .
Al Gore : The end , you know , the positive alternative , you know , the national security .
Video : America is in the crisis , the economy , national security , the climate crisis .
The filter that the links all of this : our dependence from fossil fuel , like sports and oil .
Now , there &apos;s a new , audace solution to use it .
Really , 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to re-America work , to make us more safe , and help stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that basts to solve our problems .
Really , America . You get more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It &apos;s about re-energy .
One of the faster ways of getting to get to dependence from the fuel that killing our planet .
Comparsa : The future is here . I &apos;m , a new energy .
Comparty number two : New York , we have to do well well well well retributed .
Complement : Really , America . It &apos;s time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old lunch Africans say , &quot; If you want to go fast , you go to the speed , go to the way .
If you want to go back , you go back , you go together . &quot;
We have to go far , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year TED I did a LHC :
And promises to come back to you to get back to you to how the car works .
So I &apos;m going to get . And for those that the other time there were no , LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever attempt -- 27 kilometers of circles .
His task is to reate the conditions that were at least least one billion of a second from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
This is just ambitious .
This is the car under Ginevra .
I did this little bit of the rhyth-Big Bang in the relevers .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- it &apos;s a foot of four meters and has a diameter of 22 feet .
This is a ATLAS picture in building so you can see the proportions .
The 10 secember last year we have paid the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAAS .
It was because of immense of immense in control .
It &apos;s a picture of particle particle that had done all around the LHC , entring into collision , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles in the welder .
In other words , when we saw that 10 secember , we realized that the car worked , which is a great vitty .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to make us more or this , when somebody went on Google and I saw that the page was this .
That means we have had a cultural impact beyond the scientific impact beyond the scientific .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , just to these filters here -- these dored filters .
These files take 13,000 ampampating when the car works at the most potence .
Now , the technicians between you will look at the files and they say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . They &apos;re too good . &quot;
And instead can do it because when they &apos;re very cold to become the constantly superconducucucuction .
So at least 271 degrees , at least 271 degrees , in the space between stars , these files can bring that current .
In one of the gigyle of the magnetworks in the LHC , there was a defect of facbrication .
So the files surveys are slightly , and 13,000 ampampating a sudden , they &apos;ve met a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think these magnetworks over 20 tons , and that they have been moving about 30 centimeters .
They are damaged about 50 magnetic magnetic .
We had to take them , what we did .
We &apos;ve been re-re-updragoned .
Now , they &apos;re going to be back to their underground .
I &apos;m going to the LHC is will be new integror .
We &apos;ll look at it , and we expect to get the data or the right , and we continue so our adventure to find out what are the morning in the morning that we &apos;re constitute the universe .
Now , of course , in some way , these crossing crossing the dibatch of science and engineering with frontier . It &apos;s easy to confuture . It &apos;s easy to confuture .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s so hard , I think it &apos;s the value of things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of a Inglese scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , I guess , in the defense of inutionary initious experiments of its clean , his clean was Michael Farrol , he said , &quot; Nither is so dangerous for human mind . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start asking for rethinking when you , you play with children , play with the morning .
While you know how to reach them and grab them , and you know , you know , actually , you know , and to think and to be able to deal with and manipulating relationships .
The spatial reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , by the useful uses of our interaction with physical objects , with the physical objects , with my consultant , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanii , I started asking , &quot; And if , when we use a computer , instead of having the only sore of the mouse as a little digital , which is that we can move on a desktop , we could , you can actually have the same same thing with both , with hands on a desktop , we can actually have a little bit of sure ,
and fire we fix it ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big interactive computer as a biscope .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big interactive computer as a biscope .
You can move with your hand , they can see with your hand , they feel their own , feel the movement and they have a screen and radio wireless .
But overall of the physical objects , like the morning morning , you can just move it down .
The Siftable are the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physical , conscious of their movement , other other people , and as they get more physical , and as they become more physical , the other other , of the other things , of how we can explore new and fun and fun of interaction .
I &apos;ll try to look at some simple example .
This is configured to show video : if you &apos;re going to show video : if you &apos;re going to get this in a direction , if you get on the other hand .
These remarkable remarkable .
If you affize them , they &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re around .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they see it and they can agitate a little bit .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they see it and they can agitate a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was that we could use common in the data , for example , &quot; a color like if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Sifaily configured like to the versus and I can use them to be able to use them to be .
And I can use them to pack color of that in that central , where they get .
If we &apos;re too too , we can get a little bit of it .
And you &apos;re also beautiful , you know , like the languages , like the languages , the mathematand joke of logical and games where people can try things quickly , and see the immediately results .
Now , I &apos;m --
This is a sequence of Fibonacs that I do with a equations program .
Here we have a game of words that is half between Scarabeo and Boggle .
Basically , at every Turkish , in every Siftons , of course , at every Turns , in every Turnce , and as you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , he &apos;s control the words on a dictionary .
And then , after about 30 seconds remixing , and you have a new set of trying to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the children came to the Media Lab , I did so that I try and turned them a video .
They are very much pleased .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of applied is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
You just say , &quot; You know , &quot; You know what to do .
Here &apos;s other people who try it .
This is our mobile pester , there on the right .
It actually wanted to be impllary .
They were only morning , they were only morning .
Now , this is an interactive applied of a interactive cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of the languages . He &apos;s Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , solving the Siflavor associated with .
It can put new characters in the scene , solving the Siflavor associated with .
So , it &apos;s going to get the sun .
Video : The sun is surgender .
David MMerrill : Now it has taken a treatment in the scene .
Video : The arange treatment .
Good job !
So you shake the Siftons and they can make it closely to --
Video : Well , you know .
-- by inventing your story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide him how you get to do it .
DM : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide him how you get to do it .
Video : Get , shake .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , made of recent , to sample and to make music .
it &apos;s a tool , and they &apos;ve been doing a remarkable tool , and they can make music .
The Siftable here are these are roughly , and the battery .
Every one of these four different variations , and you can choose which to use .
You can also put these sus on a sequence to compose your pleasure .
And it just to make a sound and touch a &quot; sound and a sequence . &quot;
These are actually that you can control from alive , like reverse and the filter .
The acks to a particular sound and then incline for a particular , and then they &apos;re going to get it .
And then there are general effects as long and volume , that you &apos;re appapply to the whole sequence .
Let &apos;s look at how it works .
Video : We &apos;re going to try and we &apos;re going to start with a number in two Siftons , we put it in a series , we add to a series , we add to a series , we add to a series , we add to a series ,
Now , I put a lower line .
Video : Now , I &apos;m going to add to the percussions
Video : And now I &apos;m going to put the philet on the battery , so I can control the effect from the vive .
Video : I can require the whole sequence of inclining the whole sequence of the sequence of one side or the other .
Video : And now I &apos;m going to add the lowest filter to the lowest expression .
Video : I can reach the sequence of the sequence . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to plan before , but I can suddenly make it more , and it &apos;s more corporate .
And now , finally , I can smoking the whole sequence of inclining the whole sequence of the left the Sifty &quot; . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new human human interfaces and more looks like how they work our brain work .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the results of this path , and some possibilities that we try to get out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that &apos;s coming this new generation of design objects to interact with digital media , which will be information in our world .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the hour of talking to all of you .
I &apos;m a writer .
I &apos;m going to write books is the more of this , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the fascinating of my life .
And I don &apos;t look like that it could change .
But , I said this , something that particular has been recently in my life and in my career , which has to me to report the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called &quot; Mangia , Prega , Aggain , &quot; the which , diversously , for some reason to come out in the world and become a great , smoke , the wearing , and bestseller , interational , and wearing a great , interational , and he &apos;s a lot of the time , and it &apos;s a great , inter
And the result is that everywhere now , people treatment as if I was convicted .
It &apos;s true -- conducted , conducted !
They are all worried about me and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t fear to do better ?
You don &apos;t fear to continue to write all life without being able to create a book that can matter to someone ? &quot;
that can matter somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s roughly , you know .
But it could go worse , at the part of that I remember 20 years ago , when I started to say , I was a writer .
I would go to the same reaction of the fear .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you have successful ?
You don &apos;t fear that the ulililighting you ?
You don &apos;t fear to make this to make all of life without anything that you ever come out and to die on a cumb of any inframe cumber of wild cumbling .
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I fear of all those things .
I always had fear .
And I also fear of many other things that people can &apos;t ininate .
And as the algate and other things very scary .
But , as I think about writing what I thought and I would ask me , is why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logical that anyone who should expect to be frightened by a job that you have been sent to do .
But what is there so particular in the creative impressive , to make us nervous about the mental health health care for any other carefully they don &apos;t do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemical engineers and not remember one one of a time in his 40 years of activity in which he was asked if it fear to be engineer ?
There was never -- that block of the John engineers , how do it ?
It didn &apos;t work so , you know ?
Onestly , chemicals like a group don &apos;t have certainly , in the centuries , in the centuriputation of being allowed manipulate .
We have a writers , we have enough this reputation , and not only not only creative writers , but creatives of all of these things , we have this reputation of being huge instable .
And it &apos;s not even even looking at the tristes of the magnifies of the magnifies of creative minds that , only in the 20th century , they die and often .
And the ones that are not suicked seemed to be really disfed by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , &quot; Every , I &apos;m a little bit more &quot; A little bit more wonderful fascinating about their life .
But we don &apos;t throw when we feel it because we &apos;ve heard these things so long that we &apos;ve been completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and accepted the notion that creativity and the art , at the end , it will always be at the end , and the art , at the end ,
And the question I want to ask to ask all of this is , you agree with this idea ?
It &apos;s good for you , because it &apos;s also looking at a little bit of distance to me not well for anything about this support .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous and I don &apos;t want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our big creative minds to live .
And certainly I know that , in my case -- in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start to be able to start to be able to start to be able to start to be in my career .
That &apos;s true -- you look at , I &apos;m quite young , I &apos;m a young time .
I still have about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything I &apos;ll write about the right now , and then it &apos;s going to be judicted by the world as the work that after my last book .
It &apos;s going to be slavor , because we &apos;re all more or less friends here -- it &apos;s likely that my big success is to my shouts .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thought that &apos;s a person to start to blow up in the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would continue to do this work that we do this work that we do .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it seems , after a lot of reflective , which way to work to continue to write is to create a protective construct , right ?
I have to somehow to find a security distance between me , I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxy on which reaction , and I was trying to look through the time , trying to find other societies to look through time , trying to find more societies to see if they could have better ideas and more and more , to find other societies and more , to see if they could have better ideas and more and more , and I &apos;m trying to see if they could have a lot of the best ideas and the
how to help people have creative people to manage the emotional inerents of creativity .
And that research me brought me to the ancient Great and ancient Rome .
I &apos;m going to go to circle and then goes back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity creativity from the men , OK ?
It was the creativity was this spirit looks at the divine and that sold men from a few distant and unknown , for some of a few distant and unknown , for unknown .
The greatest they were called these divini dians creativity . &quot;
Socrate , wonderful , he believed to have a demon that elargive wisdom from far .
The Romans were the same idea , but they called the spirit of the body .
The one that is great , because the Romans didn &apos;t think that a genius were a particularly intelligent .
They believe that a genius was this kind of divine that was living in literally in the walls of a neighbor , a little bit like an ellow elected , and it turns out to see the work .
Here &apos;s east -- here , that &apos;s the distance of which I &apos;m talking about -- that &apos;s the psychological construct that you protect from your work .
And everyone knew it was so that it worked , right ?
So the anti-antially artists have protected for example , like , for example , the too narcism , not ?
If your work was exceptional , you could not get it all the mermeritely , everyone knew that you were helped by this genius .
If your failure work , it was not all your hit , it &apos;s not all your hit , right ?
Everyone knew it was your genius to be a incapable .
And so people have been conceived creativity in the West for a long time .
And then the Rinhaissance came and everything changed , and they &apos;re going to be the human at the center of the universe above all of the mysteries and without to leave the decreatures and even even more space to the creatures that they write devices from the divinity .
This was the principle of the rational principle and people began to think that creativity came completely from idivided .
And for the first time in history , you know , you know , you know , that artist as a rather than a genius that artist with a genius .
And I have to tell you that I think was a big mistake .
I think that allowed someone , a simple person to believe that they can believe that it &apos;s a recipient , the essence and the source of all the mysteries , creative , unknown and etherns and etherns of the pieces of human .
It &apos;s how to ask somebody to ingoods the sun .
It &apos;s detax-up and create all these ingestimates that are expectations about performance .
And I think it &apos;s been this pressure to destroy artists in passed 500 years .
And if that &apos;s true , and I think it &apos;s , and I think it &apos;s going to be , and now ?
Can we do it diversously ?
Maybe back to a more ancient understanding of human relationship and mystery creative relationship .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t get 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience that would be linked to the scientific notion of the notion of , insuit , you do that people are going to do with people , they &apos;re going to do their projects .
I &apos;m probably not going to convince you all about this .
But the question I &apos;d like to ask ask is -- why not ?
Why wouldn &apos;t you think about this way ?
Because it has more sense of anything else that has ever heard to explain the explanation of the creative process .
And one process that , as anyone ever attempt to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- you don &apos;t comfortable to be rationally .
And in fact , in fact , it can sometimes look completely paranorful .
I did this meeting , I &apos;ve been doing this very poetry of the wonderful Ruth Stone , which has now 90 , but that was a poetry for all life and said in his childhood in the Virginia , and he felt it , in the camps and felt it , and I felt it , in the back of the landscape .
She said it was like a frageous train of the air .
And that was going to rotate of her landscape .
It was going to be , because he would tremendous land under his feet .
He knew it was one thing to do at that point and was , his words , &quot; to go like a match . &quot;
And it &apos;s going to home and then then it was following this poetry , and not have to do anything else that take a piece of paper and a match , and it would be done , to collect it , and then , and it &apos;s page to the page .
And over three times , he couldn &apos;t be fast enough , so correcrecrecent and correcrecent , and correcrecent the poetry and keep the pair through and she would continued to rotate through the landscape , trying , like , &quot; she would , &quot; another poet . &quot;
And then there were those times -- this piece of not the size that I will never be -- there were some moments where it was almost lost , right ?
So , it was going to home and was trying to paper and poetry through , and he was going to go , and he said , it was like , and then he said , it was like , and then he said , it was like to hit with the other hand and the hand .
It was poetry from the code and reported it in his body and transcandle on the page .
And in these cases , poetry would be presented on the perfect page and intact , but at the end , at the last word at the first word to the first word .
So when I thought -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly the same equal to my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- not a conducucucucucucucture .
I &apos;m a moving , and my way to work is ; I wake up to the same orar every day and work and work to go up and work on the whole day and to get up with it .
But even I , in my testyard testyard , I &apos;ve got strike up against that thing , sometimes .
And I guess a lot of you have the han made .
You know , even if the work and ideas were going to be able to be sure .
And what is this ?
And how can we relate to it , but , rather , rather , what do you don &apos;t do any of us ?
And as I am about , the best contemporary example I have is the Tom Waits , which I interviewed several years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of the life was the incard of the contemporary artist , trying to control , to control , to be able to manage , to keep these species of impulses that are totally interacts .
But then invecked , he &apos;s hot , and a day , and a day he was driving on a highway in Los Angeles , it changed everything for him .
It was going to be fast and all of a sudden this little framment of melody , which comes in his head as inspired , and it takes , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the desider , and the desider , but it doesn &apos;t know how to take it .
It doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a recorder .
So it starts to hear this kind of old anxiety in him , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose it , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;ll be able to hear this , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to be able to lose ,
I &apos;m not enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to the panic , they &apos;ll stop .
I &apos;ll put the whole mental process and made something completely new .
He just looked at the sky and said , &quot; I &apos;m not going to see that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Do you know , it seems to write a song now ?
If you really want to exist , you get a more more than one when I can take care of you .
Altrain , you &apos;re going to importantly something else today .
You can disturbing Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And its work after this .
Not the work , the work was still unless and work .
But the process , and the fishermen that was released when he took the genius , the genius that came out of him , the genius that was made out of it , and I &apos;ll go back to where , he did not have to be a thing interorized , and horized .
But it &apos;s not a lot of peculiar , wonderful bizarre , and this strange and that straight out , but it was not Tom .
So what story I was going to change a little bit of change a little bit of the way I worked and already saved me once .
This idea , I &apos;d save when I was writing &quot; Mangia , Prega , &quot; Am , &quot; and fall in a cave of the disperation that we &apos;re all working on and we &apos;re working on something and we don &apos;t get to see that it &apos;s a disaster , which is the worst book .
Not just good , just the worst book .
And I started to think of gecting this project .
But then I remember Tom I talked to the air and I tried to get it .
So I got my face on the manoscriticized and I made my comments to a vacuum angle of the room .
And I said , &quot; Snebody , what we know , both know that if this book will not be brilliant for that will not be any of my , right ?
Because I &apos;m going to see I &apos;m going to do with all I have , not more than I have .
So if you want to be better , you have to get your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what I don &apos;t do anything .
I &apos;ll talk to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to please that was recorded that I &apos;ve been presented to do my part &quot; because -- at the end is so , OK -- centuries in the deserts of the North of the people had been on the dances of a , dance and the alba .
And they were always magnifigured , because the ballerini were professional and they were fantastic .
But every single , I &apos;m going to have something happened , and one of these artists became actually transcending .
And I know what I &apos;m going to talk about , because I know you all , at a point , at some point , a performance .
It was like the time , and the ballerine walked through a kind of portal and it was not anything different from the usually different from the usually , like 1,000 noticed before , but all you get to hit .
And suddenly , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
But it &apos;s accounts from the divinity of divinity .
And when this happened , you know , people knew what was , they called it .
They were going to the hands and they started to dog , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , God , God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
I mean , I &apos;m noticed historic -- when the invest the southern of the Spna , I was this abitude with them and the ready to the centuries , Allah , Allah , Allah , &quot; which you can still hear in the corride or flamenk in the famenco .
In Spna , when a artist did something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , I haucs , Allah , the magic , &quot; unable , &quot; unable , &quot; unable , &quot; it &apos;s a God .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes the day after the wellow , when you see it , when you see it &apos;s 11 in the morning , and I found that are 11 of God &apos;s the middle of God there is no more .
It &apos;s just a lot of bad ginoccurs , and maybe it can &apos;t be able to each other to that altitude .
And maybe nobody will be the name of God &apos;s God still while a gira , and what &apos;s going to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most reconciliations to make a creative life .
But maybe it &apos;s not to be so angosciant if you can not believe , advancy , that the most extraordinary aspects of your being being .
But it &apos;s just believable that you &apos;re data in a reimaginable to a source of this team of your life that has to spend any other time when you &apos;ve got to get something else when you &apos;ve got .
And , you know , if we think of this way it changes .
And so I started to think about it , and it &apos;s certainly like I thought for several months in the working working in the work that I &apos;ll soon soon soon soon , the dangerous , the dangerous , and I &apos;m going to think about my great success .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I I feel electrized from this is , not to fear .
Not at the end . It &apos;s just your work .
You have to show you for your hand , any of any of them can be .
If your job is to balling , you know , you know , you know , if your work is balling .
If the divine , aburd genius to you decide to leave some kind of wonderful , for a wonderful time through your wine , so , &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Altrain , you do the same dance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do that .
I think we have to teach it .
&quot; &quot; Ole ! &quot; You know the same , even for having the human love and testestyard to make a tal testestyate to make you continuously .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
And as you know I &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects on the human genome , what can significant and discovery of new genes .
Now we &apos;re starting a new path : we started digitizens and now now start to digitize biology and now we &apos;re going to a new biology , design and synthesizing and synthesizing life .
We always have been trying to ask big questions .
&quot; What &apos;s life ? &quot; It &apos;s something many biologists , I think we &apos;ve been trying to figure out out of various levels .
We &apos;ve tried different approaches , reducing it to the minimi terms .
We &apos;re digitizing about 20 years of this .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to spend from the analogical world &apos;s the digital world .
Now , we wonder : can we regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome between those that can authored in the lab .
And we tried to reduce more more than the genome to create a little bit more small .
We can eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 of the genes of about 500 that are here .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our own .
Credetemi , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one one at the time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this can bring to a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to design that was synthesizing this cromosome in a way to change the components for some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of &quot; Can we synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Can the chemistry consend these great molecules that we never have been able to create before ?
And , in case , we can do a cromosome , we can make a cromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemical material inerte .
The speed that we are able to digitize life is growing up to exponential life is growing .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , and rather slowly , but it &apos;s improvement .
And our most recent results the results of a exponential curve .
We &apos;ve been more about 15 years ago .
The process has required process , starting with a bioethic review before experiments .
But we &apos;ve discovered that we &apos;ve found that synthesizing of DNA is very hard .
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that produce small segments in the world that produce small segments , in 30 to 50 to 50 to the world , the most mistakes .
So we have to develop a new method to assembly these framments and correct the mistakes .
And this is our first attempt , to start from the digital information of the genome of Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the framments , effectively the courses of mistake and get a molecule of DNA molecule .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material inerte and we put it in bacteria , bacteria , bacteria have started to read this genetic code and produced them virals .
The virals have been reported by cells , they &apos;re back and they &apos;re going back and they &apos;re destroying .
I &apos;ve talked about recent with the members of the oil industry industry , they say , they &apos;re certainly understood this model .
They have more of you have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build its same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things more in big .
We wanted to build the whole chromosome of the bacteria .
They &apos;re more than 580 mile to the genetic code .
So we thought we &apos;re going to build it in cassasses of viruses , so that we can change the cassasses to understand what the components are the components of a living .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , in 1995 , the fairly fit .
We found it , resequenced , 30 . If we used that original sequence we &apos;ve been able to work .
One part of the process is designing segments 50 to make a lot of 50 to these other segments of 50 to make small-based on the whole whole whole lot of 50 to build a little little bit more small working together .
We try to take it unic elements here .
You probably have read that we have read that we put in the fighting .
Think of it so : we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those to letters together , and there &apos;s about 20 amminoacids , and there &apos;s a specific order to lect each amminds .
So we can use the genetic code to write , frass , thoughts .
What we did at the beginning was authograin .
Some have been deluser by fact that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
We designed these segments to do just with them with the enzyme .
There are me that they repair them together .
And we started to assembly of the parts , starting with the sisegments from five to seven to mix , to seven to a thousand to a half of 24 mila , to the 24 mila , to get to 72 , to the moon .
And we &apos;ve made these segments in abunents so we could sequence them , because we &apos;re trying to create a very very much robble -- like you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems a tabellon a player of a basket .
When we get these very long segments , more than 100 , 100 basis , they &apos;re not going to be directly more directly in the Eations .
You get to the same tools of molecular biology .
So we &apos;ve looked at other mechanisms .
We knew another mechanism called the homologist called the homologist , which in biology , which in biology , in biology , to uncore the DNA .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinoccurred Deinoccurred , it can be three million radiation .
You can see in the upper riquader as his chromosome is destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours , 24 hours , it &apos;s just like it before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely completely .
They can live under empty .
It &apos;s absolutely certainly that life in space , and you can get new environments in space , and you can find new environments .
In fact , NASA showed that this is .
This is a molecule picture that we built using these processes , just using these processes , just using these processes with the segments that we &apos;ve built with these processes .
The lieventually assembly .
This image was not taken with a electronic microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It &apos;s a very much molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that they coprint a period of about six seconds .
This is the publishing that we &apos;ve done a little time ago .
They &apos;re more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the largest molecule of a structure ever created by the man .
It has a higher molecular weight for 300 million .
If you &apos;re passion with a 10 without spaces , you &apos;d like 142 page only only to transmate this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ? How can we take it ? How can we take it ?
Obviously , you know , you take a virus is a game .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria .
It &apos;s more simple when it &apos;s eucarily cells like our : you can just get the nuclear , and put another , which is basically the clonation process .
In the archaea , the chromosome is instead of integrated inside the cell , but we &apos;ve been recently demonstrate that we are able to do a complete trapiant of a cell to another and to activote it .
We have clean a chromosome from a microbial species .
The two are different than men from tops .
We &apos;ve added some gene in a way that we could decide what to be to choose for this cromosome .
And then he &apos;s shells with the enzyme so that they kill all protein .
And when we put it in the cell is amazing -- and you &apos;ll open our graph , and you &apos;ll open our graph , the new chromosome is , the new chromosome is went into the cell .
And we were thinking that we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we &apos;ve tried anymore more .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that tantissix-six-and-species , in a third chromosome somewhere , add a second thousands of new traits to that species .
So , who think about evolution as a single gene once you can change not have any of biology .
There are some of the enzyme of remarkable restrials that to tell you the DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell not possible one .
The cell cell phone -- the chromosome that we have put it .
It &apos;s expressed , and they recognized the other chromosome as a material , it has masticated , and we &apos;ve been in only only the cell and the new chromosome .
It &apos;s become blue because of the genes that we have put .
And in a short amount of time , all the features of a species are gone , and it turned out of the whole new species , based on the new software that we put in the new software that we put in the cell cell .
All the protein , the membrane are change , and when we read the gene code , and when we read the genetic code exactly what we &apos;ve spent .
Now , this might look like genetics , but by allowing the software , we can change things in a very substantial .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that you don &apos;t talk about genesis -- but progression from three million years and a half million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re to create a new version of the Cambriana in which they will be new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s enough when we think about our necessity .
We &apos;re going to spend six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one in the 1946 ; it will be four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medicine and welline for six and a half billion people .
It &apos;s even more to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion fuel bars .
That means 100 million barrels a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to repet them , it &apos;s a huge challenge .
We have to keep more we have to keep all of CO2 emission from these materials that finds in the atmosphere .
At the day , thank you to the scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they &apos;re designed components for the future .
The electronic industry has only only a dozen about components , and you think about different things are out .
Our limits are principles here are data and our imagination .
Now we have now some techniques , thank you to these methods of these synthesization , able to create what we call genomics combinatory .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think of this 20 million genes of different genes or to try to optimize the processes to produce optimize them , new new new , we can change , to change , and create more biology molecular now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemical production or chemical production , production of vaccines .
This is an instantany of some software programming that we &apos;re working to be able to seat and design species .
Well , we don &apos;t know how they &apos;re going to be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
Now , we &apos;re focusing on the fuel of fourth generation .
You also see that extract on the gram of the gram was a bad end .
We have been depending on the third generation and third generation that will use enough to be on the ground , more than the value of the higher value as a different type of butanol .
But the only way biology can have a great impact without increasing the cost of food and limited the cost of food and limited the energy of the energy , and we &apos;re working for a lot of money , and we &apos;re working on their own , and we can think that we have the first coal of the fourth generation in about 18 months .
The solar light combined with CO2 is a metodownntown , but in our discoveries in all over the world , we &apos;ve found different metods .
This is a organism that we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
It &apos;s going to the deep ocean , at about 2,500 feet of deeply to the windulness of water .
It creates from CO2 using hydrogen using molecular hydrogen as a source of energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can incanaling CO2 , which can easily be transported by toubbbes , to lead this process .
So , we think we could be able to increase what the question of &quot; what &apos;s life is &quot; is &quot; We can , versus what life is life . We have the proof of replacing the entire oil industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do it for TED , where you can ?
It would be a major source of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working to use the same metods to create instantanei .
You &apos;ve seen this year with influence , we &apos;re always going back to a year and a dollar in less when it &apos;s about to find the right vaccine .
I think what you can change by building combinable vaccines in anticips .
So , this is how the future might start to look at it , now , the tree of evolution , accell-evolution with the globe , arches , and finally eucucariote cells .
We are so much of improvement .
Our purpose is to make it to live enough long enough to try to make it . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the faster , some fundamental work , some fundamental work , the new technology that we &apos;ve taken to the Microsoft in following a year . This is Seadragon . This is Seadragon . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s a environment where you can interact is local level that remode is that remode with a huge amount of visual data .
So here we &apos;re seeing a lot of digital photos with a kind of digital photos , continuous , for a very quick panoramic , despite images as we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these data are , or the images .
Most of them are common digital photographs , but this for example is a provening scanning from the Big of the Congress of the Congress , and it in the gamma 300 megapiel .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that &apos;s the only thing that &apos;s the number of pixel on your screen . It &apos;s also a very flexel architecture . It also a very flexel architecture .
This is a whole book , for example of data not .
This is the Casa desolate of Dickens . Every column represents a cape .
So to show you that it &apos;s just about text and not images , we can do something like that , to see what it &apos;s a real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a little electronic book .
I don &apos;t give you a lot of it .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s a number of The Guardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you a pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading the real chart , or a daily , which is a multiple type of a half of a kind of a half of a kind of a half .
We also have something with the corner of this particular one of the Guardian .
We &apos;ve made a lot of resolution that &apos;s very high solving -- much higher than what you use in a normal advert -- and we put a content on the extra .
If you want to see the features of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specifically technical .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that this means to put people , and to other porcheries , not have to be able to do that .
Of course , maps is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say we have to help you do this .
These are all the roads in the United States , over a geospatial image of NASA .
So now we &apos;re going to spend something else .
This is actually a living in the web . You can go to see it .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which fighters two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual to the computer that &apos;s very interesting computer made by Noah Snavely , a student of Washington , with the help Steve Seadragon the Microsoft Rick Szelki &apos;s Microsoft Rick . It &apos;s a great collaboration .
And it &apos;s from the websan , management from Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can spend from a picture of the other and have this kind of experience to be constitution .
But the spacectively of images here is actually a meaning .
The algorithms of the computer , they &apos;ve been taken these pictures together , so that they correspond to the re-places that imagined -- all sorts of a shot , all sorts of a shot , and these things are all connected to the elements of a slippping , and these things are all connected to the elements of a slipping , and these things are all connected to the spspread of a stable .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot of space .
I want to spend directly one of the original set of Noah-. And this comes from a very previous prototype of the first time , the last last last summer -- to show you what I think is really about the key to show you what I think is really the key to see the environments that we &apos;ve been looking at at the environments that we &apos;ve made in the website .
We have to worry about those legs and so on .
This is a reconstruction of the Nobody &apos;s reconstruction of the Nobody made by Flickr . Bauct Nobody Dame in Flickr and you get images of these kinds of guns and you get images of these kinds of wears and you get out of a picture that &apos;s discovery that is discovery that you &apos;ve been looking at this model .
So they &apos;re all pictures made from Flickr and they &apos;re all linked to the space level of this way .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this very simple way .
You know , I would never think of work for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifically to get this kind of accounts here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different kinds of photocamers : from those cell cell cell cell phone in the professional SLR , a significant number , that had a significant number , to this environment .
And if I can try to try to try those more strains .
Many of them are faces , etc .
There &apos;s a number of photographs -- you have a series of photographs -- you know .
This is a Nobody of Nobody .
We can go from the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do with social environment . This is taking data from the whole memory , from the whole memory of the whole memory of the view -- and connected all those data together .
All those photos become connected together , the largest of the parts .
You have a model of the whole land that emerge .
Think about this as a prolungment of Stephen Lawler &apos;s work on the virtual .
It &apos;s something that grows in complex complex as they are using , and the whose people are using it , and the advantages to get to use .
Their photos are marked with metaded with other people .
If somebody is the idea of contrast all these subjects to contrast all these subjects saying the name , my picture of Nobody &apos;s three Dad suddenly , you know , and I can use it as a refed way of ingress in that space , in that metaphor , with the picture of anyone else , and have a social experience of the kind of a modity of cross-moot-and cross-.
Of course , a consequence of all that are virtual models of any interesting interesting land , and it &apos;s very much interesting than any interesting airplanes and satellite images and satellite images and similar , but from the collective .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understood ? What your software will you do is that at some point in the next few years , all the pictures of the next years , all the photographs that everybody in the whole world will be very well well ?
BAB : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is basically about it .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , you know , you know ,
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the images .
What it becomes very interesting if you think about the semant require of simplant information that many of these images have .
As you do a research research of the web , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the photo of the pictures .
Now , what happens if that picture is connected to all your picture ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of remarkably remarkable to get it is really huge . It &apos;s a classic .
CA : Well , it &apos;s really amazing . It &apos;s really amazing .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the main pleasant when you travel and one of the dolpherant , is the way to live between who have no forgotten the traditions of the anti-person person person who have the past in the wind , the hooode , the falls in the wind , the falls in the wind of the plants .
Well , you know , the shamani Jaguar , they still still beyond the Via Lattea , or the old Inuit &apos;s still cold of significantly , or Himalaya , or the subsignificance of the subject of the Dharm , the central respect of the central of the anthropology of the anthrology , and that the idea that the world we live in a sense of solute , but it &apos;s just a reality , but it &apos;s just a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stirpe has done , well or not , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential strength .
We all of the hide .
We are reflights to the initiation .
We have to deal with the inexorability of death , so we don &apos;t surprising us to blow and we &apos;re allowing .
We all have an art .
What it &apos;s the particular is the race of the particular song , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that the PenPenan of the Borneo , or the follow of the Voodoo &apos;s warriers , or the desert warriers in Kenya , the Curander &apos;s Curge , or a cammelt in Kenya , or a cammelt .
He was my company in the desert a month ago , or an alevator of the yak in the Kyak values in Qomolangma , Everest , the More &apos;s mother of the world .
All these populations teach us that there are other ways of existing other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And if you think a moment , it &apos;s a concept that it can give you hope .
Togogs , the miriades of cultures are creating a spiritual lipping of the world , and it &apos;s important for the planet , and it &apos;s important for the planet as a biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural roughly a cultural roughly the ethnosphere and you can defining the total sum of all concepts , dreams , with ideas , inspired , the ideas , inspired , the inspirations , you know , the human imagination .
The ethnosphere is the great patriage of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we are and what we can be as as a kind of inquisitive species .
And because biosphere was very , for the biosphere has been very much more , as well , as much more quickly .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all the species is or is the ord of the sumsumness , because it &apos;s been , or -- in the most apocalyptic diversity -- in the most optic field of biological diversity -- and not even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even a little mystical --
The one of all of that is , of course , the language loss .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not compost by a vocabulary or a series of grammmmal rules .
A language is the springing of human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle of which is every culture comes in the material .
Every language is a forest , a shelf , a thought , a thought , a spiritual of spiritual possibilities .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re sitting in Monterey , at least half half not being subsurrated in the ears of the children .
They don &apos;t get more taught children , which means , less than camps something that are already dead .
What is more trister of being a silence of being the silence , to be the last last to talk a language , the last to talk about a language , the wisdom of the wisdom of the kids ?
This is a few years old is the one of some of the world every two weeks . Every two weeks .
And I know somebody of you will say , &quot; Is it better that ?
The world would not be a better place if we were going to be a better place if we &apos;re going to talk about yoruba . We talk about canese .
We talk about kogs .
You &apos;ll find a sudden what it means you can &apos;t talk to your language .
I &apos;d like to do a journey through the ethnosphere --
a little trip in the etnosphere to give you a little bit of what we &apos;re lying .
Many of us forget that when I say &quot; different ways of existing exist . &quot; I mean , very different ways of exist .
Let &apos;s take for example this bimbe Barasana , in Amazon sectors , the people of anaconda , which creatures to the midst of the milk of the milk of the milk of the wild .
It &apos;s a people that can &apos;t distinguished the blue color from the green because the color from the green because the time birth , you know , which is identified in the time of the people .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rule , called &quot; exogram language , &quot; exogram &quot; &quot; you have to move a different language .
This has been in the mitological past , but the particularly the particularly , it &apos;s in these familiestables that they talk about six or seven languages because of the midden matririage , because of the mist of the midden , one language .
They &apos;re just listening and then they start talking about .
We take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived , Waorani of the Ecuador , a nordorial that had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionariarian made a contact of a made made of mistake .
They &apos;ve been taken out of the upper photographs that they return them to make a lot of people who were going to love that this people in the forest that this people in the forest of the forest .
They &apos;ve taken the picture of the land , they &apos;ve been taken on a form or a figuring and , not find anything , they have been concluse that the deaving of the hell , and they have to be killed the five missionarily .
But Waorani didn &apos;t kill only the foreign .
They kill them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by their own .
We &apos;re been on eight generations and we found two natural death and when we &apos;ve been born for know , they have a great invest that one of them was invecked , and then they kill it . And then they kill it . And then they kill it .
The caccidators were able to recognize the animal urine for 40 pass and recognizes the species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was an interesting task when my Harvard professor , I was asked to Haiti , if I wanted to go to Haiti with the secret to Haiti the basic potence of Duvalier and Tonton Macy , and the Tonton Macy , and I was a little bit of the poison .
To make a sense of the miraculous , I should have understood the Vodd culture and that Voodoo is not magnera .
It &apos;s quite a complex method of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christianity , Islam , Ebraism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no faith faith . And they , but and Voodoo is not more than the distilled to these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious concepts .
What makes the voodoo is the intense relationship between life and death .
So the beds are going to hide the spirits .
The spirits can be invited by the Great Accord , they respond to the rim of the dance of the dance of the vive , so that for a short active active active , becomes the end of the folder .
So , this is the woodooists like to say , &quot; You know , you know , you know , &quot; God .
We give the temple and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment that you &apos;re post , is the spirit that you can do it ?
So you see these incredible events : following the voodoo in the state of trance that touch impunizones , you know , the infuel of the body when it &apos;s catalyzed in a state of extremely exciting .
I &apos;m all the people who have been in the most extraordinary are Kogi Kogi SSanta Marta Santa Marta , in the Colombia security .
They have to be a great great , the tiranna , which once they lived on the aid card on the aid of Colombia in the conquician , the people have to the plant that you get on the volcanic , which you know , the plant plant that you get on the plant plant .
In a continent of blood , this people who &apos;s not conquered by spagnoll .
But I &apos;m not today , they &apos;re government , but their formation is very extraordinary .
The young people following their own own in three or four or four years , and they live secret in a buying world , and they live in a buying world , they have stone of the stone of the glaciers for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years , by the nine months of gestation that transfer to nine months of gestation that transported into the modity of the Grande Mather .
For all of this time , they &apos;re acculultured to their society , values that are going to see their prayers and only their prayers , they keep the constantly , or to say the ecological balance .
And the term of this incredible initiation , all of the time in life , at the age of 18 years , at the age of 18 , they see an algrade . And in that moment of the first bulb , when the sun kidnun , when the sun kiss , everything that have learned in theory is all of his slowor . The prints of the things that have learned in the whole lot of his splendor .
&quot; Good ? Proprid , how I said you .
It &apos;s amazing . Now it &apos;s an amazing . &quot;
They call them the majority and say that we , brothers and they say that we , brothers in the destruction of the destruction of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about Indigene popular popular popular Rousseau and the old history of the selvable , which is a remote , which is a repete in its simplicity or maybe invoon the Earth .
The Indies are not no sensitive sentimental sentimental , they have to be ununless unless .
There is no space for these things in the Again , or in the Asmat the Asmat the frozen of the Tibet , but because of the time and the round , they have created a myth of essentially ununexpected to the one , but on a lot more substantially , but on a lot of intuition of the human evolness .
What does that mean ?
It means that a little bit of Ande that Ande that a little bit of the Ande that the mountain is an Apu that will lead its destiny , it &apos;s going to be deeply different , and it &apos;s going to be deeply different with the mountain or that place that you can create a mountain , or that place that you can be a rock of rock .
which is the dimmmill or a mineral or a three-.
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between individuals and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia , believe that forests were going to be cut .
And that I made me a human being different from my friends Kwakiutl and the forests are the dimmmora of Huk and the buttons of paradise and the downnnnbal dog , which we live in the Hamatch , the world , the world that we live in the Hamatammer .
If you start to look at that these cultures can actually start to understand some of them , you can start to understand some of them , you can start to understand some of them ,
I took this picture to open up in the Amazon the West Amazon the western Amazon the western Amazon the western Amazon the West Amazon .
Maybe some of you have heard about the ayahuash , the most powerful substance of the repertoire .
What makes the payahuasks is not the pharmacological of the substance , but its elected . It &apos;s compost for two elements .
On one hand , this liana legning that contains a series of mobile charcoal , harmoline and harmoline , and harmoline , slightly .
And by trying to take the only plant , you know , it &apos;s a smoke that allowing a little bit of consciousness , but it &apos;s mixed with the leaving of a coffee , and they &apos;re called Psychoption .
This plant contains powerful powerful , very similar to seriotonin seriotonin , dimethyptamine .
If you ever see the Yanomami pulling up for the hide that they make a different set of species , anchment is a different set of species , it &apos;s a methyptamine .
You can see that dust for bird is a little bit like being shoot of a painted of dipinch and land on a little bareyes and land on a electricity . &#91; Risate &#93; not believe a distorsion of reality .
I often asked my professor with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has taken the pitch was a , with his finished hallucinogen , in Mexico .
And so I &apos;m going to my thesis not a classification , because if you &apos;ve done no one of being hallucined .
It &apos;s possible to be abunte , if they &apos;re just abunte with other chemicals that denian MAO .
Now it &apos;s the beautiful : the mobile mode that are in this liana are ininjury of MAO , the same type of chemistry , as a triptamine . The question is is spontaneous . The question is is spontaneous , like these people have to find two defologically not similar , but that if you &apos;re combined in this way , create a biochemical chemical version that is higher to the sum parts ?
We use the great eufemism of the middden and the mixed , which can revealed .
But if we ask Indians , they &apos;ll tell us &quot; The plants talk about it . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuash , which can tell nectly in the forest , and our eyes would reentrance in the same species .
If you ask them how they stick their tasses will say , &quot; I thought , &quot; I think of the plants , the rest of the rest of it ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take 17 variety in a light of the moon , and each other will be a different tone .
With this doesn &apos;t graduate Harvard at Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting that you can count the stami .
Now , &#91; applausers &#93; the problem is that also those of us who have to heart people who have to have a heart people in the history of the history of the history of our real world , and passes beyond .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it &apos;s not going to remember her or its technological innovations , but rather like the one was where we stopped and have abbraced and , and we have abbraced and a lot of biological diversity and cultural .
All culcultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibilities .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux have no stop being Sioux when they put it from the arco and frecovering as the American American American , they have no stop being American when they put on the horse and calving .
It &apos;s not the change or the technology that threatenable integrity of ethnosphere . It &apos;s power .
The surround of domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you &apos;ll find that these are not destined culcular cular .
They &apos;re living and dynamic creatures outside exist from the forces of the forces that go beyond their adaptance .
I think it &apos;s disboscampaign in the Penan --
a nomads of Sarawak , in the southern EEast , a people who lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to a generation , and now reducing the rights and the refer on the rivers , where you can see the river the river from the lim that seems to take a half of the Mison the horizon , and the wearth of the wave , and the ylonm ,
ready to repair the wild is with the lenards to the forest .
Or , in the Yanomami , are the diseases that have come with the discovery of the gold .
If we &apos;re going to move on the mountains of the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research .
As you know , the genocide , the extinction of a populations , it &apos;s convicted to universal level , but the ethnocide , the destruction of a people , not only is constantly , but it &apos;s also a celebrated , but even part of the development strategy , because it &apos;s part of the development strategy .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of the Tibet until you first .
I &apos;ve spent 6,000 miles from Chengdu in China through the Western China through the Southern , coming to Lhasa with a young connected , but only came to Lhasa young connected , but only came to Lhasa with a young linear , and I realized what we &apos;re talking about .
6,000 monuments are sacred in the dust and centers .
1.2 million people killed from the military during the Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascriticized to the Panchen Lama .
The one means that it was killed to the time of Chinese invasion .
I mean , the uncle is flew in South Saint during the diaspora that has brought the people in Nepal .
His mother was imprisoned and her her her cold was being rich .
It &apos;s been brought to hide in two years of hidden bird of two years .
The sister , which has done the same , it was a meant in reeducation .
A day has inverted a bunch of Mao and , and in this transgression , and , for this transgression , it was a seven-year-old .
The pain of the Tibet can be insopposable , but the spirit of the people is tener .
And it was all , it &apos;s all reduces to a choice .
We want to live in the world &apos;s monocromatic world or we want to get the policy world &apos;s diversity ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he died he died that his largest fear was that , in our way to this vision in the world , not only we &apos;ll see the whole gamma of human imagination , but a day we can see a sleep for a sleep of thought , but a day we &apos;ll see we can see it from a sleep to perying to us that there were other other possibilities .
And it &apos;s equipment that our species is exist for 600,000 years .
The Neolitica Revolution , which has given us us us to agriculture , which has been wearing to cross of the seed , replacing the poetry of the specialization of the sketch , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has been 300 years .
That sharing story not suggests me that we don &apos;t suggests that we have to all the challenges that we &apos;re going to deal with the millenses to come .
When to these these miriades of the world is asked what they want to say to be human , they respond to 10,000 different different voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all refer the chance of being what we are : a kind of conscious species , that has to do all the people and the gardens can fire . And there are great moments of optimism . And there are great moments of optimism .
I took this on the north of the island of Baffin , when I went to core whales with the Inuit , and the man , Olaya , and the man , Olaya , and the man , Olayers , and the man , Olaya , and the man , Olayer , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Only , and this man , Olayer , and the man , Olayer , and the man , Olayers , and the man , and the man , and the man , and the man ,
The canadods not always been gentile with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50 to staff our southern , we have to give them in the colonies .
The grandfather of this man refused to go .
The family , I theme for her life , and everybody &apos;s got all of his toxes .
You have to know that the Inuit don &apos;t have the cold , they do it .
The patters of the sliters were made of fishermen .
The grandfather of this man didn &apos;t put up to the night or the byzard that suffering .
It &apos;s been tired out , it &apos;s been stopped the pantalons in the foca smoons of focused in their hand . When I did it &apos;s frozen , the working creating a moke .
It has sproud up on the punch of this cold , and when I became a dog , and when I became a dog .
It has a bright shake the dog and created a bright , with the toracy , has a sliter , has imbrired another dog and is disappeared to the bang , and it &apos;s been on the banchisa , and it &apos;s been on the bright .
We want to talk about horrise with nothing ?
In fact , in 1999 , the government has reduced to Inuit , the total control of an area of the larger California and Texas , the Texas , and Texas they have together .
It &apos;s their new pathria . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a independent land . Controllate all the minerary resources .
One of the snatione-state of nation-state can reconciliating with its people .
And , to end , I think it &apos;s quite obvious at least at least least the people of us have been in these remote areas of the planet , make sure they &apos;re not remote .
For somebody is home .
They have a search for human imagination that they &apos;re going to the alba times . And for us all these kids , like dreams of these children , like dreams of these children , become part of the geography of hope .
To end , we of National Geographic , we have to convince that politicians will never come to anything .
We believe that polemc --
&#91; Applausers &#93; are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month our website . Every month our website .
156 countries transmate our television canal .
Our magazines are licenses from millions of people .
Our work is traveling in the ethnosphere to bring our public to the public in places of wonderful and cultural reveals that they have gone away from how they saw and , hopefully for the central reveal , the world &apos;s deserve for the central reveal in a life , and we have to find a life of life in a pluralist and the turnal world in a pluralist and multiculticulticultical world , and multics in a life in a lifestyle and the world in a life in a life in a life in a life in a life in
where the wisdom of all the people can contribute to our well-being collective .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope to call some other things that I &apos;ve heard and try to evidence some links , in case you don &apos;t notice .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the official dogma . &quot;
The dogma official what ?
The dogma official of all the West industrial society . The dogma official is , &quot; If we want to massize the well-being of our citizens . &quot; The way is to do it is massive . &quot;
The reason is , on one hand , in fact that freedom is itself itself , in fact that the freedom , essential , essential for human beings .
On the other one one of us can do that if we are free , each of us can do everything that we have to do everything that massix-being , no one that decide in our well-name .
The way to massize freedom is massized the choice .
The more choices have , more choices are more free , and the greater . It &apos;s their freedom , is their well-being .
This , I think , it &apos;s so deeply rown in the society that nobody would dream to be dream in doubt .
And it &apos;s also deeply rown in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progression has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly great .
I &apos;m going to allow me to reach .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without contar the 10 variety of olium extreme lense and the 12 whales that you can buy a huge conditions of conditions that no one of the 175 already .
Here &apos;s what the supermarket .
And then you go to the electronic store .
And in this single store of electronic electronic , there &apos;s a great audiences .
We can make six and a half million different combinations using the components that are in one store .
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice .
Other camps : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a baby , they could get all the telephone services , at the shapable , at the pact that they have to mode .
They noleged the phone , not buy it .
A consequence of that , one of the other , it was that the phone never made .
These times are gone .
Now we have a variety of phones , especially between phones .
Here &apos;s the cell cell phone .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , the MP3 , cut the nose of my favorite , and forth to the brulum .
If you don &apos;t have the case you still saw in the store under the house , you &apos;re going to get .
And what happens is that people get to the store and does this question . And you know what is the answer ?
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t make too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the acquissues of the same explosion of choices .
There is healthcare : : not happen in the United States that you &apos;re going to go from the doctor and the doctor you know what you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do it , or B , or B , &quot; A has these benefits and these benefits these benefits and these benefits these benefits and these benefits these benefits and risks . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Dr. &quot; Dr. , what should I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A has these benefits and these risks , and B has these benefits and these risks . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you reach , &quot; Dr. if you were me , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result we call it &quot; autonomy of the malate , &quot; expression that it looks like a good thing .
But it &apos;s not that one move the fish and responsibility to make decisions from somebody knows something , is a doctor , which is the doctor , which is a doctor , which is almost certainly , and almost certainly is bad -- and almost certainly is , and so not in the ideal condition -- and so not in the ideal condition --
There &apos;s a huge marketing of products for drugs , direct to people like me and you , if you think about it doesn &apos;t have any sense , because we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why they public them ?
The answer is that they want to ask them to ask them to ask them to ask them to make it recipe .
Something that is how we &apos;re going to be our own identity is a matter of choice , how you see in this vignet . &quot; We don &apos;t want to forcing kids . They &apos;ll be more a identity : we don &apos;t get to get a chance : we have to invent .
And we can reinvented how many times we &apos;re aggrade .
The one that means that every morning , you can see , you have to decide that kind of person with being .
I &apos;m going to the family and the matrimonium , a common time , it almost for anyone , was that it was that you had to get the most pressed possible , and they started to get kids the most preserved possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not when you know what to do later later .
I mean , it &apos;s really going to play .
I teach them 20 percent in a very smart students , and I &apos;m going to be a lot of work than a time .
And not because they &apos;re less brilliant , because they &apos;re not not because they &apos;re less diligent .
But why are they immense , you know , &quot; I should be going to ask , &quot; I should do it now ? I do it ? &quot;
&quot; I should I get later ? I have to think before children or career ? &quot;
They are logical interrogative .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this implica not complete the homework that I don &apos;t get a great voice to my exame .
And they really have to do that .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , as Carl underlying , because technology allows us to work every day , from the Hotel Randolph .
I &apos;m going to be a angle , and I won &apos;t tell anybody what the Without , where the Wim Fi works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this amazing liberty of choice that we have about this work ? It &apos;s that we have to continuously decide , continually at any time , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our child playing calcium , with cell cell phone in a pocket , the Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the bynthrow , and the notion , and the notion , and the button .
And even if they &apos;re all spending , every minute that we see our child &apos;s son , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; I have to answer this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? I have to email this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is &quot; no , &quot; that makes the experience of the game of your child very different than what it would be in other conditions .
So , any of the look at , little and things , things and the materials and lifestyle , life is a choose .
And once the world was this : That &apos;s the one , it was a chance , but it wasn &apos;t all about choice .
The world today today is a dilemma is : The dilemma is , &quot; Is it a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is .
So the positive laws we all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative .
All this choice is two negative effects two negative effects on people .
The first , paradoxally , it &apos;s produced paralysis that it .
With many options between which choose , becomes very hard to do it .
I give you a significant example : a significant study of the volunteteer .
A lot of my connected to Vanguard data , the giant society of pension , with about a million customers in 2,000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offering in more , the percentage of adesive two percent .
With 50 sourds , there &apos;s 10 percent in less than adesions than ads when they &apos;re only available to five . Why ?
Because with 50 sources of which choose , it &apos;s malededefed to decide , and choice is reached to the intomorrow .
And tomorrow , and more tomorrow , tomorrow , and of course tomorrow .
You know , it doesn &apos;t only mean that these old people are going to be able to dog , because they &apos;re not going to have enough money , even want to say that the decision is so that they lose the complex defounding on the work .
Not participating , they &apos;re lying until five dollars a year from the dator of work , which would be going to be able to be able to be able to be .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too many choose .
And I think it makes the world that &apos;s so .
&quot; And to end , for the ethernity : ketchup , send or or maionese ? &quot;
You would like to take the right decision , if it &apos;s for the ethernity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and yet the condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that , if we can avoid the paralysis and to be a choice , at the end of how we would be on the result of how we would have been on less options between the one of which we would have been with less options .
And this for several reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions of which choose , if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have better better . And what &apos;s what happens is that the alternative . And what happens is that the imagined alternative to remarkable , and the repider decrease the satisffffation of decreatures that has been better . And that &apos;s refence ,
even when it was a great decision .
The more choices are , more , it &apos;s easier than any detail that is insosoddispleased of the option of the choice .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call costs .
Dan Gilbert has been very well , how we &apos;re going to get things depends on what we &apos;re going to do .
On the rest , when there are a lot of possible options , it &apos;s easy to represent the alternative features of alternative shot and be less sation-made option .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m sorry with everyone who are not New York .
But that &apos;s what you &apos;re probably going to think .
There &apos;s this pairs to Hamptons .
A snarrow place .
He &apos;s all for them . Otttle . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not miss anything . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , no matter , it &apos;s Agust . &quot;
&quot; Everyone my neighborhood to Manhattan are away . &quot;
&quot; I could park right in front of the home . &quot;
And it &apos;s going to spend two weeks from the idea that &apos;s perdying -- every day -- the ability to park where it wants .
The costo-opportunity demining , the soddisfation for what we have , even when the choice was excellent .
And the more are the options that we have to look , more the acaents will be constantly to be constantly to be constantly to how the costo-opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
It &apos;s about living the moment , and maybe of living slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you choose , you can &apos;t do the other .
The things that we don &apos;t choose many attractive attractive that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : the spiral of expectations .
I tried it on my skin bought a new couple of jeans .
I &apos;m almost always jeans .
Once jeans were just a type , they buy them and wress they were snap , they were scomcomcomfortable , only after they brought a lot of times , they were beginning to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple of new when those old were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
And I said , &quot; You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , fit ? &quot;
You want to do it or with the buttons ? &quot; Stonemark and &quot; or &quot; or &quot; acid &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; acy &quot; ? &quot;
&quot; Do you want to be struggle ? &quot;
&quot; You know , you know , or stretch ? BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBe . &quot;
I was sballoon , and after a little bit of them could say , &quot; I want the guy that -- that &apos;s only the guy . &quot; He didn &apos;t have any maledeaths , and then I came out of the sore , I came out of the store , and then I came out of the store , I &apos;m going to get out of the jeans that I had .
It was the most of that . With all the choice .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse that I was that with all of my expectations were altising , jeans had to be perfect .
I had to have minimum expectations . I didn &apos;t expect anything except when there was a kind of different , but when I saw 100 , at least one kind of had to be perfect .
What I had to buy was good , but not perfect .
After I was going to have chose with what I was insodly , I was going to confronted to expect to expect .
The adds of options in life of people don &apos;t do that to increase the expectations that these have respect to the options of the same .
And this will be less satisfation , even when the results are good .
No one in the marketing world &apos;s made it .
Because if they knew it , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more to that .
&quot; It was better when you were worse , &quot; The reason why it was better when you were worse when you were worse , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , &quot;
We &apos;re living in the world where we live -- opulents , industrialized citizens with the expectation of perfetion -- the most we can hope is that things are at the expectations .
You &apos;ve never surprised to pleasant because your expectations , my waiting , you &apos;re ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Blulue . &quot; Yes , you want it . &quot;
I mean , I mean , little authographic moment -- which are really sposted and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t have any more actized .
But it &apos;s not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of a jeans of a jeans of when there is only that kind of jeans is that when you &apos;re not sationffed , and you wonder why ? &quot;
Who is responsible ? &quot; The answer is clary .
The world is responsible . What could I do you do ?
When you have hundreds of jeans , and you buy a insoddisfacing , and you ask you who is responsible , it &apos;s responsible , it &apos;s okay , it &apos;s okay .
You could do better .
With hundreds of variety available , there are no scans for the insuccessful .
So when people make decisions , even if the result is valid , they feel insodent and they give the cold cold to their own .
In the last few years , depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only , but important -- of this honor of depression is just that people have deludent experience because the standard are too high .
And when they have to explain this that the cold is their fake .
So the final result is that we &apos;re better better , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely fake . It &apos;s not true .
There is no doubt that a little choice of it is better than having any of choice is better than a lot of choice is better than a little bit .
There is a critical value , magical value . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we overed from a piece of the level where the choices are improving our life .
Now , from the political point -- I almost finished -- I &apos;m a political point of view , the noclothing is the following .
What allows all this to the industrial society is the wealth of the material .
There are many places in the world , and you know about it , where the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too pocked .
So the faccenters I &apos;m talking about is a malleaving of modern , re-society , the Western society .
And what it makes you depressing and angry is this : Steve Levitt has talked to yesterday about how those expensive and smop for a little bit of money . It &apos;s a spinning of money .
I mean these choices , complicated and dispensive , it &apos;s not that they are just inuseful .
I &apos;m also deleterie .
There are worst worse .
If a little bit of what we in our society allows our society to be reverse in those where people have too few possibilities , it &apos;s not only their life to improve , but our .
This is what economists call a better improvement .
A redistribution of income distribution of income redistribution , not only to poor -- because of this choice in excess .
So to conclude , &quot; You know , you can become what you want to &quot; --
You , people in culture , you think , &quot; What do you think about it ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t do anything in a glass of glass . &quot;
&quot; A range imagination , a limited vision of the world --
I &apos;m interested in this , I &apos;m interpret .
But then , I think , instead , I realized that , instead , I realized that that the long knows the long knows .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you &apos;re missing in the phantom , so that &quot; everything is possible . &quot; You don &apos;t get the freedom . You don &apos;t get freedom .
If you break the boccia in a way that everything is possible possible to decrease the soddisfation .
You get the paralysis , and you reduce the well-being .
Everyone has to be a sphere .
This is almost certainly too strange , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of some symbolic sphere is a recil for inhappiness and , I &apos;m going to rovine .
Thank you .
