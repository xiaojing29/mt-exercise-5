Last year I showed these slides to prove that the glacial hythic calculus , which for almost three million years had the size of 48 , the United States has 48 size , has retrofed the size of 48 .
However this underground gravity of the problem because it &apos;s not showing the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice .
The glacial ice is , in a sense , the heart of the global climate system .
It &apos;s got to winter and reverse retreated .
The next slide is going to be a remarkable remarkable remarkable rates in the last 25 years .
The glaces are reported in red .
As you see , they &apos;re going to the blue blue .
That &apos;s the winter ice , which is summer ice .
You can see that the so-called ice , five years or more , is like a blood , that &apos;s like a blood , which here was from the body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s gone from that , so .
This is a problem because the interests that are glacious land around the arctic ocean where there are huge amounts of fuzzy that , they turn into the melting , they turn into metan .
I &apos;m going to the total of the atmospheric pollution to global warming , that among the amount would be doubling , through this point of not return .
In some snippper in Alaska a little lagues already on the water .
The Katey professor Katey University of Alaska has been taken at a low-lake team at lake .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You &apos;re good . The question is if we &apos;re going to be .
One reason is that this exchange thermal southermal exchange from the north .
This is a glacial river regime .
The ported never had ever reached like that .
This is the Kangeradicsuaq river , in the southest of the Greenland of Greenland .
If you want to know how the sea level to be shrimp to the glasses on land , it &apos;s where the sea .
These currents are increasing rapidly .
On the other hand of the planet : Antarctica , the largest block of ice on the planet .
Last month , scientists have told that the balance of the ice is in negative , and that the West Antarctica , which is sent on on some submarine islands , is particularly hanging on the skiest .
It &apos;s six feet of the water , like in the Groenland .
Sulla Himalayas , the third largest block of ice , you see new lakes , which few years ago were glacied .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population was going to half the water from that shoulement .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the water water of this city .
The ported is increased .
But when it decreates , the same is going to fold in the same way .
In California , the snow on Sierra Nevada has been 40 percent .
Bini hyrichins are in the crisis .
Sectivivives , as you read , they &apos;re grasses .
The safety increasing in the world leads to a remarkable increasing inceness .
The environmental disassume , are increasing to a rhythm and unprecedented .
Four times more of the last 30 years I was relievant 75 .
This is a wanting of the whole unsustainable .
If you look at it in the historic context can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the highest the area of the East Pacific , from the Americans , to the Americans , and on both parts of the Indian subcontinent , where there is a royal oxygen in the ocean .
The largest cause of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossil fuel use .
oil is a problem , and the coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two with more emissions , together to China .
And he proponated to build a lot of other fuel centers .
But we &apos;re seeing a change of direction .
These are the annullated projects in the last years and some vers alternative vers .
In the way , there &apos;s a politics fight in our own country .
The industrial and oil industrial , they spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the pulit coal , which is a hosymphony .
And that picture would reminded me something --
Verice , in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion of gotten waste .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen it on the news .
This is the second largest flow in America .
It &apos;s happened around the Christmas .
Next advertising one of the coal industrial .
Good : Huer &apos;s a lot and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it makes our economy .
Frosty the carbon is increasing .
It &apos;s good at price , adorable and workers keep working on the workers .
Al Gore : From here &apos;s most of the coal of West Virginia .
The largest society is Massey Coal . This is the Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I &apos;m going to be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelososy , Harry Re-Children are talking .
Al Gore : So the Alliance for the Clima has launched two campaign .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : The next thing : At the same with ALergy , see the climate change as a threat to our business .
For this priority is to invest a large amounts of money in a public forth to make public and confused the coal truth on the coal .
In fact , coal is not spork .
We think it &apos;s clean -- it &apos;s also a good profumo .
So don &apos;t preupon climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Attore : Cone pulit -- you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
So let &apos;s make a turn into a look at the structure for a pulit , for a pulit ,
Straordinarily ! Curan cars are a little noisy , but this is the sound of the pulit fuel .
The fuel consumption is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology of pulit that you see changes all .
You look at this : this is the pulist technology of pulist fuel .
Al Gore : So , the good alternative is connected to the economic question and the national security .
Video : America is in the crisis ; national security , climate crisis .
The wilo that connects all : our dependence from fossil fuels , like coal and oil and oil imported .
But , if there is a new , audgment , you know , there &apos;s a new audences .
Repower : 100 percent clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to report the work , to get more section , and help stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that to solve our problems .
Repower .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It &apos;s about reating energy to America .
One of the fastest ways of taking the dependence from fuel that killing our planet .
Comparsa : The future is here . Sun , a new energy network .
Comparsa : two : New aging for well-retributed jobs .
Complease : Real . It &apos;s time to be realististic .
Al Gore : A old African lunch , say , &quot; If you want to go fast , you go to the faster , go from the same .
If you want to go away , you go together . &quot;
We have to go far quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I introduction to the LHC .
And you promise to return to the way back to you go back to how the car works .
So I am here . And for the people that the other time was there , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever tried -- 27 kilometers of circumconference .
His task the task is to reate the conditions that were at least than a billiondest of a second from the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
That &apos;s just ambitious .
This is the car below Ginevra .
We photographs these mini-Big Bang in the detectors .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- is a large 44 feet and it has a diameter of 22 feet .
This is an ATLATLAS in construction so you can see the proportions .
The 10 September 10 years of the last year we have a car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLATLAS .
It was causes immense in the control of the control room .
It &apos;s a picture of the first fascion of particles that had done all the LHC , coming in collision , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles inside the detector .
In other words , when we see that 10 September 10 , we realized that the machine worked , which is a big vitty .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to make us exulating more or this , when somebody went on Google and saw that the initial page was this .
That means we had a cultural impact on the beyond that scientific .
About a week later , there was a problem with the car , had just these walls , and they were these dorates .
These files took 13,000 ampampampampate when the car works at the very much of the power .
Now , the technicians between you will look at the files and they will say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . They &apos;re too good . &quot;
And instead of doing it because when they &apos;re very cold become the so-called the superconduction .
So , at least 271 degrees , at least a temperature temperature at that of the space between the stars , these files can bring that current that current .
In one of the giunture between the most of the magnetic in the LHC , there was a defect of factory .
So the files surrise skim , and the 13,000 ampampates had a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think these magnees weight over 20 tons , and that they moved about 30 centimeters .
They &apos;re damaged about 50 magnetic .
We had to take it , what we did .
We &apos;ve skipping them and wanders .
They &apos;re now coming back to their underground .
I end the marze LHC LHC will be a new integrate .
We &apos;re going to go , and we expect data or July , and we &apos;re expected to juice or July , and we continue to find out what the universe are .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents are reating the value of science and the valbuttingering of science and frontier . It &apos;s easy to confutures .
I think the fact that &apos;s so hard , the fact that &apos;s so hard , I think that &apos;s the value of things like LHC .
I &apos;d like to conclude with the words of a English scientist Inglese , Humphrey Davy , which , I guess , in defense experiments of his pupillo , his pupillo was Michael Faraday , said , &quot; Nothing is so much for the progress of human mind as the ideas of science as is definitious , that &apos;s not mystery for the progress of our own monks are complete , and that there are not new consequent to us . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start asking about rethink about when you , as children , as you play with kids .
While you &apos;re able to reach them and grab and grab them , take them and you &apos;re actually learning about and to think and solve space problems .
Sweationation is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , as an inspired by the useful information of our interaction with physical objects , together to my Patoes , and at my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking asking asking a computer , instead of the only mouse , as we &apos;re using a computer , instead of having a computer , instead of the mouse , like a digital pass , we could deflew up with both hands , and dededede-an information with both hands ,
and fix it ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable , a big interactive computer like a biscope .
In a few words , a Siftable , a big interactive computer like a biscope .
You can move with your hand , they can see their hand , &quot; they can see their motion and they have a screen and a wireless radio .
But mostly , they &apos;re physical objects , like the brick , you can just move them out .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physical , conscious of the motion , the other , the other , and as they become more physicists , and as they become more physicists , of the motion , the other , of how we can explore new and having a style of interaction .
I &apos;m going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show video : if you &apos;ll incline it in a direction , the video is going to rotate it so , if you go back .
These portraits interactive are aware of the other .
If they &apos;re hung them , they &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re going to them .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can act a little bit .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can act a little bit .
They also have their own and they also get their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the implications of the interaction was that we could use common gestures on data , for example , &quot; to put a color like it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configured like a versus of painting , and I can use them to pour color in that central , where they &apos;re missing .
and I can use it to pour color in that central , where they &apos;re missing .
We can actually get too much , we can put a little bit .
And there are also beautiful possibilities of learning , like languages , the mathematics and logic games , where people can try things things quickly , and see the results that are immediately .
Now I &apos;m --
This is a Fibonacci sequence that I do with a equations program .
Here we have a game of words that is in half between Scarabeo and Boggle .
Basically , at every Siftable , you get a letter on every Siftable , you would have a letter to every Siftable , and when you &apos;re trying to start him to start him by talking about a dictionary .
And then , after about 30 seconds , you have a new letter to a new letter and new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s children came up to the Media Lab , I did so that I tried it and I took a video .
They were very much pleased .
And one of the interesting things like this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people many instructions .
You just have to say , &quot; You know , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s other people who are trying to do it .
This is our beta younger tester , there on the right .
It actually wanted to be implement .
They were only only morning for him .
Now , this is an interactive charge .
We wanted to build a tool for learning . He &apos;s Felix . He &apos;s Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , liftable the Siftable .
It can put new characters in the scene , liftable the Siftable .
So , it &apos;s going to get out .
Video : The sun is surprising .
David Merrill : Now he took a treatment in the scene .
Video : The arange treatment .
Bobs ! Yeah ! Yeah .
So , shake the Siftable , put them in the Siftable can get the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing your story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a final story , and it can decide him as he gets .
DM : It &apos;s a final story , and it can decide him as he gets .
Video : See , cat it .
DM : The last example I have time to show you a tool , which is made to sample and perform music .
it &apos;s a tool , which is made of a tool , to sample and performing music .
The Siftable here are being on the ground as a base , low and the battery .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose to use .
You can also get these sound sound in a sequence to your pleasure .
And you just modify it just by making a sound and a sequence .
These are actually you can control from alive , like reverberation and the filter .
The attacks to a particular sound and then cline for a foot .
And then there are general effects as time and volume , which you can apply the whole sequence .
Let &apos;s look at how it works .
Video : We &apos;re going to start a very much in two Siftable , &quot; sequence , we fix them in a series , we we extend to extend to , add it to a series , we we added it , add to it , add a lot on the very number .
I &apos;m going to put a bottom line .
DM : Now I add some percussions --
DM : And now I &apos;m going to put the filter to the battery , so I can control the effect from alive .
DM : DM : I can require the entire sequence to the time on one hand or the other .
DM : DM : And now I &apos;m going to add the bottom to the bottom to get more expression .
DM : DM : I can reinating the sequence of the flying flying .
So I didn &apos;t have to plan it before , but I can suddenly , making it longer longer or more corner .
And now , finally , I can finally smoking the whole sequence to the left Siftable , the Siftable to the Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new human human interfaces and more resemonant as our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some possibilities that we &apos;re trying to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmate is that &apos;s coming this new generation of objects that are coming in with digital media , which will lead information in our world that we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see this now to talk to all of you .
I &apos;m a writer .
And I &apos;m going to go out books is the most of this , of course .
It &apos;s also the love and the fascinating of my life .
And I don &apos;t look like it .
But , you know , something that particular has happened in my life and the career , which led me to reezing the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called &quot; Mangia , Prega , &quot; which , diversously from my previous books , for some reason came out in the world and became a big , inter-sensational , interational bestseller .
And the result is that everywhere now , people treat me , as if I was convicted .
Really -- conducted , conducted !
They &apos;re all been working on me and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t have any feed more than they could do better ?
You don &apos;t fear to write all life without being able to write all life without being able to create a book that can matter ? &quot;
that can &apos;t matter to somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s reassuring , you know .
But it could go worse , except that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a writer .
I would go to the same reaction based on the fear .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you feel like he couldn &apos;t succeed ?
You don &apos;t fear that the humiliation of refused you ?
You don &apos;t fear to make this mill for all life without anything that you ever come out and to a dry of a seven-filled with the mouth of failure ?
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : &quot; Yeah . &quot;
Yeah , I &apos;m afraid of all those things .
I always had fear .
And I also have a lot of other things that people can &apos;t insulate .
How you can algae and other things very friendly .
But , as I think I &apos;m writing what I thought and I would ask myself , is why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logic that anyone who &apos;s had to expect to be fried by a work that you &apos;ve been born to do .
But what is that special in the creative companies to make us nervous about mental health as as in one way that other carriers don &apos;t they do ?
As my father , for example , he was a chemist engineer and I don &apos;t remember one time in his 40 years of activity in his 40 years of activity in which he was asked if he was afraid to be understood ?
There was never -- that block of the engineer John , how does it go ?
He didn &apos;t work that , you know ?
Onestly , chemicals like group have not certainly , in the centuries , earn the reputation of being alcohhhacy .
We have enough this reputation , we have enough this reputation , and not just creative writers , but creative in all kinds of unstable to be enormous unununstable to mentally .
And it &apos;s not about the other than looking at the sad deaths of creative minds that , only in the 21st century , they &apos;re going to die and often .
And even the ones that don &apos;t seem to be really suicked by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , &quot; Every book book said , &quot; Every book book has killed me a little more &quot; A fashion about their own life .
But we don &apos;t beat it when we feel that saying because we &apos;ve heard these things so long that we &apos;ve completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and the suffering are in some way , and that &apos;s going to be in the end .
And the question I want to ask all to ask to everybody here today is : Would you agree with this idea ?
It &apos;s all right to me -- because it also looking at it from a meter of distance to me not that &apos;s good for this .
I think it &apos;s hateful .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous and I don &apos;t want to see it perpetuate in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our big creative minds .
And certainly I know that , in my case -- in my situation -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start fuge into that feeling of the support of support of support , where I &apos;m in my career .
That &apos;s -- you look at , they &apos;re pretty young , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m about 40 years .
I still have about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything I &apos;m going to write about the world as the work that came out after the world as the work that came out after the last book .
I &apos;m going to be a little bit , because we &apos;re all more or less friends here -- is likely that my greatest success is in my back .
Oh , Gesu , what thinking .
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to a person to start drink in the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would keep doing this work that we do this work that we love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it looks like , after many reflective reflect , which the way to work to continue writing is to create psychological psychological construct , right ?
I have to find a few security distance between me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxy about what I &apos;m going to write to get . And as I was trying to look through the time , trying to find other societies to look through time , trying to find other societies to have better ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthy ideas and more human human ideas and more healthy ideas and more human human ideas and more
how to help creative people who are able to manage the emotional risks of creativity .
And that search led me to the ancient and old Great and old Rome .
I &apos;m just perform because it &apos;s going to go back and then it goes back .
In the Great and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity svense from men , OK ?
They thought the creativity was this spirit looks like this spirit looks like , and that came to a few distant and unknown , for distant reasons .
The Greeks called these spirits divins that we have creativity .
Socry , wonderful , they believed to have a demon that elargive wisdom from far .
Romans were the same idea , but they called that kind of spirit without a body genius .
The thing that is great , because the Romans didn &apos;t think that a genius was somebody who was particularly intelligent .
They believed that a genius was this kind of divine that had lived in literally the walls of a neighborhood of a neighborhood , and a little bit like the elected , and the result of that , and to come out of that work .
Here &apos;s a remarkable -- here , that &apos;s the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological construct that you protect from your work .
And everybody knew it was so that it worked , right ?
So the antic artists were protected by certain things , as a example of narcism , not ?
If your work was exceptional , you couldn &apos;t take it all the merity , everybody knew that you &apos;d been helped from this genius to encourcourporum .
If your failure work , it wasn &apos;t your fake , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be an incapable .
And so people who have been a creativity in West for a long time .
And then the Renaissance came and everything , and it was born this big idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe on top and the mystery and no longer to leave space at the mitic creatures and descent creatures .
This was the rational principle and people started thinking that creativity came to think that the creativity came out of the idividitous .
And for the first time in history , you started to reflew this or that artist as a genius rather than a person with the genius .
And I have to say that , I think it was a big error .
I think that allows somebody , a simple person to believe that they were like a recipient like a recipient , and the smile and the source of all the divine mystery , unknown and unknown and ethical and unknown and housing and a lot of human payoff .
It &apos;s like to ask somebody to send the sun .
It deforms and distorce and detap all these ingestiestimates on performance .
And I think it was this pressure to destroyed the artists in the 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think that &apos;s , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do it differently ?
Maybe you would go back to a more ancient understanding of between human and mystery creative .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t sing 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And probably there is people in the audience who would lighting scientific suspects on the notion of the notion of the notion of their own projects .
I &apos;m not sure you all about this .
But the question I &apos;d like to ask is -- why isn &apos;t it ?
Why wouldn &apos;t you think that way ?
Because it has more sense of anything that has ever heard to explain the exasperating imprevedibility of the creative process .
One process that , as anyone ever tried to do something -- so , basically , all of this , basically , all of the way , you don &apos;t coms .
And , in fact , it can sometimes be completely paranormad .
I did this meeting recently with the extraordinary poeetsy Ruth Stone , who has been a pot for all life and said to me in his own childhood and said to me in the rural Virginia , working in the fields , and he felt it , in the fields , and it felt , inside if when a poem came from landscape .
He said he was like a train of air .
And that was roling to the landscape .
He felt that , because he could make the land under her feet .
He knew he had one thing to do to that point and was , he said , &quot; run like a matta . &quot;
And it was going to home and it was going to be following by this poem , and he would not have to get a piece of paper and a match enough , as the trapart .
And over three times , he couldn &apos;t be fast , so correct and correct without being able to come up in the house and she would continue to roled her through and the performed and she would continue to rating through the landscape , looking for , as she said , &quot; another poem . &quot;
And then there were those times -- this is not going to forget -- there were some moments when they were almost losing , right ?
So , he was running through , and he was trying to the card through , and he was trying to get through , and he said , &quot; He was going , who was like he slowed with the other hand and he said , &quot; He was like he hanging with the other hand and the office .
And it was the poem from the tail and repair it in his body and transmitted it on the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the page perfect perfect , from the last word at the first .
So when I felt thought -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly the same as it is exactly the same as it is at my creative process .
Not my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conduction .
I &apos;m a mud , and my way to work is ; you see me at the same time , and sweating on the same time and work and get us and get it over there .
But even I , in my my aggin tesardaggin my Spanish testing , at that time .
And I guess a lot of you in the han .
You know , even if the work and ideas came to me from a certain source of you would not know .
And what is this ?
And how can we relate to it in a way to not get a losing your head , but rather , that , that will remain healthy , but rather , that , that will remain healthy , but rather , that , that will remain us us us ?
As I think , the best example of the best contemporary example that I have is the musician musician who I have a different years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the most of the life of life was the incard of the art of the art of the tormented the contemporary , to control these species of impulses creative impulses .
But then he invecked , he socks , and one day , he was driving on a highway in Los Angeles , changed all for him .
He was going fast and it all was a very quickly , this little fragment of a melody , coming in in his head as inspired , elusiva and halling , and the desidera , and the desidera , but not knows how to get it .
He has no piece of paper , has no matched , it has no matched recorder .
So I start to hear this kind of old anxizing , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose it , and I &apos;m going to lose it from this even even song .
I &apos;m not enough , I &apos;m not enough , I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to go into the panic , he stopped .
And I &apos;ll make the whole mental process and made something completely new .
He just looked at the sky and said , &quot; Sorry , don &apos;t you see that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Do you look like to write a song now ?
If you really want to exist , it &apos;s going to be more hurn , when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , you &apos;re going to get somebody else today .
You can disturbing Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his work was changed after this .
Not the job , the job was still dark as always .
But the process , and the anxiety , the anxy that was released when the genius , the genius out of him , the geniuses outside he was going back to the place where he was , realized that he didn &apos;t have to be a thing that they had to be a very interiorized and reminds .
But it really does this peculiar , wonderful bizarre , wonderful , a conversation between Tom and this thing strange and foreign thing that was not Tom .
So , as I was a little bit about changing a little bit , the way I worked and already saved me once .
This idea , I &apos;d save me when I was writing , &quot; Mangia , Prega , &quot; and fall in one of those desperation of the cave of the desperation we &apos;re all working on and we don &apos;t have to do that and we don &apos;t have a disaster , which is the worst book .
Not just bad , the worst book .
And I started thinking about to throw this project .
But then I reminminded of Tom that was talking to the air and tried .
So I got up with my face on the missing missing missing and I got my comments to a vacuum of the room .
And I said high voices , &quot; Sent , what we know , both of them know if this book won &apos;t be brilliant not going to be blame , right ?
Because I &apos;m putting all the way I &apos;m putting all that I have , I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to introduce you and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , I don &apos;t do it .
I &apos;m going to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I would like it was recorded that I was today to do my part . &quot; Because -- at the end is so , OK -- centuries do the North Africa in the deserts of the North Africa , people were going on for the dance of the moon , dance and the dance of the dance of the dance of the dances of the dances of the dance of the people were going on for hours .
And they were always magnified because the dancers were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every once , they rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became actually transmitted .
And I know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know that you &apos;ve all seen , at a certain point , a performance like this .
It was like the time stops , and the dancer walks through a kind of portal and it wasn &apos;t doing anything else from the usually , like 1,000 noticed before , but it was all aligned .
And suddenly , not just like a human .
But he got on the divinity in the fire of divinity .
And when this happened , at time , people knew what was , they called it .
They were looking at their hands and they started to sing , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , God , &quot; . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
I &apos;m not historic notes -- when the Mori invather the south of Spanish , preserve this habits with them and the ready to change in the centuries , Allah , Allah , &quot; which you can still hear in the corride or in the flames .
In Spagna , when a artist has done something that &apos;s impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , the bodies , Allah , snippping , and there -- a shortttcut of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes after , for the dancy itself , when you wake up and wake and you see that are the 11 in the morning , the God is no longer there is no longer .
It &apos;s just a dead to the ginocate , and maybe it &apos;s not going to each other to that height .
And maybe nobody will sing the name of God still as a gira , and what so has to do with his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most painful reconciliations to do in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so corosciating if you can &apos;t believe , you know , the most extraordinary aspects of your being being from yourself .
But it just credit that &apos;s come to a remote source of this team from a unimaginable source of this team part of your life that you have to go to somebody else when you &apos;re finished .
And , you know , if we think that way it all changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s certainly like I thought it for several months in the working of the book that I &apos;ll soon soon , the dangerous , and I &apos;m going to attempted , and I &apos;m going to attempted .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel electrized from this is , I don &apos;t have fear .
Don &apos;t shortcut . It &apos;s just your work .
And it &apos;s going to introduce you to your hand for your hand , any one can be .
If your work is dance , you know , you know , you know ,
If the divine , absurd genius , they &apos;ll decide to you some kind of wonderful , for a moment , for a moment , you know , then &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Otherwise , you do the same dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot; to you the same .
I think it &apos;s got to teach it .
&quot; Oh ! &quot; &quot; &quot; to you the same , even for having human love and testing tabgine tal to you introduce you to continually introduce you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : You !
As you know , I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what it can mean and the new set of genes .
We &apos;re starting a new path : we started digital biology and now we &apos;re starting to digital the biology and now we &apos;re going to a new phase of biology , designing and synthesize .
We always tried to ask big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; That &apos;s something that many biologists , I think they &apos;ve been trying to understand how many levels .
We tried different ways , reducing it to the minimi terms .
We &apos;re digitize for almost 20 years ever .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the analog of the biology in the digital of the computer .
Now , we ask , we can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the smallest species from the smallest genome between those who can authoretite in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little smaller .
We can actually get a hundred genes about 500 of the genes of the about 500 that are here .
But when we look at the metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our .
Credetails , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at a time , it &apos;s very unlikely to bring it to a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to design was synthesize this chromosome in a way that they could change the components to ask some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of the &quot; can we synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Can the chemistry constant to produce these big molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create before ?
And , in case , can we run a chromosome ?
A chromosome is simply a piece of chemical material inert .
The speed with which we can digitize life is growing at exponential rhythm .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , design disruptive , but it &apos;s improving .
And our most recently reultimate the results the results on a very exponential curve .
We started more than about 15 years ago .
The process has required a lot of passages , starting with a bioethic review before the first experiments .
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that producing small segments of DNA , the length of 30 to 50 letters , and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the more mistakes .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these fragments and correct the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , to start with digital information from the Phi 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills .
We designed the fragments , we &apos;ve designed the fragments , and we got a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemicals that inert and we put it into the bacteria , the bacteria , the bacteria have started reading this genetic code .
The viral particles have been released by cells , come back and they destroy .
I talked about recently with members of the oil industry and say that they certainly understood that they &apos;ve been able to understand this model .
They &apos;ve been seven-by-wrapped .
We think this is a situation where the software can actually build their own hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the largest things .
We wanted to build the whole chromosome of the bacteria .
They &apos;re more than 580 thousand genetic code .
So we thought we built it in the cassette cassette size of the virus , so that we can change the components of a living cell .
The design is critical , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the first time in 1995 , the basis of a mistake .
We discovered it , resequencing it , 30 errors . If we used that we had to use that original sequence would never be able to work .
One of the process is to design segments 50 letters , which are wrappond with all the other segments of 50 letters to build smaller underounge of small suburbia working together .
We &apos;re trying to units here .
You &apos;ve probably read that we put a train .
Think it like this : we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters together code about 20 amminds , and there &apos;s a specific order to letters for every love .
So we can use the genetic code to write , sentences , thoughts .
What we did at the beginning was autographic being done .
Some of them have been deluser from the fact that it wasn &apos;t poem .
We designed these segments to be able to just join them with enzymes .
There are people who are related them and put them together .
And we started to assemble in the parts , starting with five to seven mix them , and then they put them together with a fixing segments of 24 mies the letters to them , and then they get to 72 mies .
At every step , we &apos;ve made these segments in abundance so we could sequence them because we &apos;re trying to create an extremely good processing -- as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems a basket , of a basket globe .
When we get these very long , more than 100 basis , more than 100 basis , more than 100 basis , they &apos;re not going to grow more directly in the E.
You get to the modern molecular biology .
So we &apos;ve been considered more mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called the homologous romologist , which in biology to repair DNA to repair the DNA to join the segments .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism called Deinococcur Deinococcur , can absorption three million rad rad of radiation .
You can see in the upper restrict like his chromosome is destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours , exactly it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely security completely .
They can live under a vacuum .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life exist in space , and you can get new rich than water .
Actually , NASA showed that this is happening .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built , just using these processes , just using the platory with the design appropriate segments .
The yeast evelate them .
This picture was not taken with a regular microscope , but with a regular microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It &apos;s a molecule so big that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the publishing that we did a little time .
They &apos;re more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the largest molecule structure that &apos;s ever created by the man .
It has a molecular weight weight .
If we &apos;re going to get a 10 without spacecraft , we would take 142 pages to only transmate this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ? How can we activate it ?
Of course , you &apos;re going to have a gotten game .
It &apos;s a little more complicated when they use bacteria .
It &apos;s simpler even when it is eucarily cells like our : you can just get the nuclear nuclear or and put one more , which is practically the process of clonation .
In the bacterium archaea is instead of integrated inside the cell , but we have recently demonstrated that we &apos;re able to do a complete transplant to a complete transplant to another and vast it .
We can be a little bit of a micbial species .
The two are different than the tops .
We added some gene more so we can decide what to choose to this chose .
And then he skip with the enzymes so that they killed all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was astonishing -- and you &apos;re apprecisely our so-sticking graph -- the new chromosome is went into the cell .
And we were thinking that we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to get there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that they were a second or a third chromosome , one second or a third chromosome , somewhere , add in a second thousands of new traits to that species .
So those who think about evolution as one gene at the time that it &apos;s got a lot of biology .
They have enzymes called &quot; restriction enzymes that even digital DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell , no one .
The phone -- the mobile phones that we have put it on .
It &apos;s expressed , and they recognized the other chromosome as a material extraneous chromosome , and we found with only the cell and the new chromosome .
It became blue because of the genes that we put .
And in a short short amount of time , all the characteristics of a species are persued , and it turned around into a new species , based on the new software that we put in the cell .
All of the proteins have changed , members have changed , and when we read the genetic code exactly what we &apos;ve moved to you .
Now , this may seem to be genetic alchemy , but by by the DNA alchemy can change things in a very substantial way .
Now , I &apos;ve been explained that this is not about genesis -- but of progress from three million years and a half years of evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion Cambrian explosion this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s quite obvious when we think about our necessity .
We &apos;re going to go from six and a half billion in the next 40 years .
Right to give one example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one existing in 1946 ; 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find food , fresh , fresh , drugs and gas for six and well-and-a-half billion half half of people .
It &apos;s going to be more hard to nine .
We use more than five billion fuel barrel , more than 30 billion barrels .
That means a hundred million barrels a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replace them , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to report of all the CO2 from these materials that ends up in the atmosphere .
On today , because of the scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the design future .
The electronic industry only has a dozen about components , and think about how many different things came out .
Our limits here are data here are principle data and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , thank you very quickly , because of these methods of synthesization , to create what we call a combinatory .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think of the 20s , you think about the 20 million different genes or to optimize processes to produce optick or pharmaceums , we can change , because of a small team , and create more molecular biology that over the last 20 years .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemical production or chemical production or fuel production .
This is an instantaneous of some software programmed we &apos;re working to be able to sit and design species at the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t necessarily know how they &apos;re going to be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
We &apos;re focusing on the fourth generation .
You &apos;ve seen you also extract ethanol from the grain was a final experiment .
We have depending on the third generation that will be used enough to be on the higher fuel zugar to higher fuel than than they get or different butanol .
But the only way biology can have a big impact without increasing the cost of food and limestone of food and limestone that would transform CO2 into matter , so we &apos;re working to design cells that can reach this purpose , and we think we can have the first fuel that we can have the first fuel of fourth generation in about 18 months .
War combined CO2 is a metodo--- but in our discoveries all over the world , we found different metods .
This is a organism that we described in 1996 .
It &apos;s living in the deep ocean , about 2,500 feet deep to the webollion the water temperature .
It creates that are from CO2 using hydrogen by the way .
We &apos;re trying to understand whether we can incanaling CO2 , which can easily be taken through tubes , convert that CO2 in fuel , to drive this process .
So we can think that we could be able to increase what the question of &quot; which is what life is we are , veramenteating the entire oil industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can you do it ?
It would come a major source of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working to use the same methods to create instantanezing vaccines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with flu , we &apos;re always back to a year and with a dollar in less when it is about to find the right .
I think what you can change is building combinable vaccines in anticipe .
So this is how the future might start to look , now , the tree of evolution , access to the evolution with synthetic bacteria , arches , arches , and finally eating cells .
We &apos;re so so much from improving people .
Our purpose is to make it a long enough to try to make it it . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the faster , some fundamental work , the new technology that we took the Microsoft in the following , at a bug almost a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s a environment where you can interact is at the local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data .
We &apos;re seeing a lot of digital gigabyte photograph with a kind of zoom and continue , for a fast panoramic fastly , despend up the images as we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much the amount of information that we see , how big these are these crops of data or images .
Most of the digital photographs , but this for example is a scan from the Library of Congress , and coming in in the launch of the Congress , and it comes in the gamma twice .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the one thing that limit the prestations of a system like this is the number of payon on your screen at any moment . It &apos;s also very flessible architecture .
This is a book whole , example of not images .
This is the Dickens . Every column represents a check .
To prove you that it &apos;s just about text and not of images , we can do something like that , to actually actually see that it &apos;s a real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a little electronic book .
I don &apos;t advice it .
This is a more realistic example . This is a number of The Guardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading the real version of a magazine version of a magazine or a daily kind of a half of a type of medium .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of The Guardian .
We created a wrap-fashionable advertising -- much higher than what you use in a normal advertising -- and we put you in the content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the space limits of space on the screen .
And we hope that this means to put the people on the similar to the people and similar door , they didn &apos;t have to be necessary .
Of course , maps is one of the poorest applications for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say that we have a contribution to this field .
These are all the roads in the United States overhead a geospace image of the NASA .
So now we &apos;re going to something else .
This is actually live on the web ; you can go to the Web ; you can go to see .
This is a project called Photosynth , which fought two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting computer research at the very interesting computer that Noah Snavely , a student at Steve Seitz of Washington , with the help of Steve Seitz of Microsoft Rick Szeliski Rick Szeliski Rick Seadragon . It &apos;s great collaboration .
And it &apos;s from the window , the Seadragon the web .
You can see when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from one image to the other and have this kind of experience to multiple resolution .
But the space of images here has actually a meaning .
The visualization of the computer algorithms have these images together , so that they correspond to the real places where the imagination -- all sorts close to the Grasks on the Montagne Roccies -- have been taken up . So here you see the elements of a slides of a sli-stable , or a framework , and these things are all connected to the space level .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot of them much more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data set of Noahnal data set , and this is from a previous prototosynthrow that we &apos;ve done for the first time , the summer -- to show you what I &apos;m really the key behind this technology , Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily evident by looking at the environments that we have put in the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of Nothree Dame &apos;s reconstruction of Nothree Dame made by Flickr . Bauct three Damamamamamong these guns , and you get images of these samongs and so on . Once one of these bounks , and so on . Once one of these bounts , which is discovering a picture that &apos;s been discovering to appear .
So they &apos;re all images taken from Flickr and they were all connected to space level in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to igate this very simple way .
You know , I would never think of finish working for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifying to get this kind of accounts here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of photocaming : from those cellphone phones . The one of those cellphone .
And if I can , I try to look at those more strange .
Many stuck from the faces , etc .
Somewhere you have a series of photographs -- there .
This is a poster of Nothree Dame pecugly Nothree Docrrettly .
We can go from the poster to the physical view of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is taking it susuper suit -- from the whole memory collective memory of how it looks like the Earth , from visualizing a visit -- and connecting all those data together .
All those pictures became connected together , more than the sum of the parts .
You have a model of the land that emerge .
Think about this as a prolungation of Stephen Lawler on the virtual Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as people use it , and the people who use it , and the advantage of the use .
Their photos are marched with meadow by other people .
If somebody comes to the idea of contrast all these sets , you know , my picture of the Cedral , my picture of Nobody , three Dsuddenly visly rats of all that data , and I can use it as a way of dive to that space , in that metapapapapaphor , using the photos of the cross-user and cross-user .
Of course , a consequence of all that are virtual models of all interesting virtual models of every interesting in the Earth , collecting you &apos;re not just seen airplanes and satellite images and similar , but from the memory collective .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What ? What &apos;s your software will be doing is that at some point in the next years , all the photographs that are all over the world will be practically connected ?
BAA : Yeah . What is doing basically is to find out .
He &apos;s making hyperlink , if you want , you know , you know , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of semantial information that many of these images have .
As you do a images of the web , you have a sentence and the text on the web page has a lot of information about the images .
Now , what happens if that picture is connecting all your picture ?
So the amount of semanantic interconnection and the amount of wealth that comes in is really enormous . It &apos;s a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible .
BAA : thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure when you travels and one of the ethnographic research is the one of the hetnographic research , the people who have been forgames in the window , the hits the stone of the past in the wind , it is in the waves , it &apos;s driven by the chair , and the leaves it &apos;s plants .
I think that the skiamoring Jaguar Lattea , or that the Lattea , or the Inuit still , the Inuit &apos;s still the significed , or that in Himalayas , the budgets , and the idea of the world , to remind the central of anthropology , and the idea that the world we live in in which we have no solved in a sense , but it &apos;s just a reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of adaptive set that our stirpful stopped , very well or , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share essential strength .
We all all procreation . We all all procrease .
We &apos;re subjects to start with the initiation .
We have to face the inexorability of death , so we don &apos;t surprised us and we &apos;re hungry and we &apos;re talking --
We all have an art .
What it hits is the particular , the pace of the song , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that the Penan &apos;s forests in the Borneo , or the following the Voodoo &apos;s warrior in the Sahara Sea warrit in Kenya , the Curanderies , or a camerlier in the Sahara .
He was my journey of journey in the desert a month ago , or a yaak alevator in Qomolangma , on MMMs , MMMMs &apos;s mother .
All of these populations are teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And , if you reflect a moment , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
Together , the miriades of the world are a spiritual , cultural , which is a spiritual , which is important to well-being on the planet , and it &apos;s important for wealth to the planet , as biososphere .
And you can think about this cultural spider as a ethnostic , and you can define the ethnososphere , the total of all concepts , dreams , mites , ideas , inspired , intuitions , taken out of being from the human imagination of consciousness .
ethnosphere is the great pathy of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we &apos;re and what we can be as inquititive species .
And because biosphere was very , very much more , it was very much more , it happened to the ethnic , and too much faster .
No biologist , for example , would say that 50 percent of all species is on the east of the last last last , because it &apos;s flex , or -- in the most ophically -- in the field of biological diversity -- and you don &apos;t get close to the most optile to the most optional hypothesis -- that of cultural diversity --
The survey of all this is , of course , the language loss .
When you &apos;re born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just a vocabulary or a vocabulary , or a series of rules .
One language is the spraking of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle with which the animate of every culture comes in in the world .
Every language is a forest , a kissing , a thought , a spiritual ecosystem .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re here sitting in Monterey , at least half no longer is subsurrated in the ears of children .
They &apos;re not teaching to children , which means , unless cameras , not cameras , which are already death .
What &apos;s more sad than the people in silence , the last to talk , the last to a language , the last speaking , the last to talk about a language , you don &apos;t have a wisdom of anticipate or anticipate the children ?
This is the state of somebody in the world in some of the world every two weeks , every two weeks , every two weeks , every two weeks , every eld they &apos;re sillabor of a language .
And I know somebody who will say , &quot; Don &apos;t it better ?
The world would not be a better place if we talked about the same language ? &quot; Well , we all talk about yoruba .
We talk kogi .
You &apos;ll get a sudden what it means you can &apos;t talk about their own language .
I &apos;d like to do a journey through the ethnososphere --
a little journey in the ethnic , to give you a assage of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I say &quot; different ways of existing that when I say &quot; different ways of existing .
So let &apos;s take for example , this Barasan bim , in SSSweet Amazon , the people of the anaconic anaconic , which creds in the west panish pants .
It &apos;s a people who can &apos;t distinguish the blue color from the green because the time the celests &apos;s reached in the forest , where the people depends the people .
They have a strange language and a matriage rule , called &quot; exogy language , &quot; exogy language , &quot; You have to marry a person talking about a different person talking about a different person .
And all of this has radical in the mitological past , but the particularly , in these households where they &apos;re talking about six or seven languages because of mistone language .
They &apos;re limb to listen and then they start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribes with which I have lived , the Waorans of Ecuador , an incredible people that had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionary , they tried a very failed contact .
They &apos;ve been going on on the top photographs that retrend them in their shoulder , forest that they were going to have never seen anything about bi-dimensional forest .
They &apos;ve been raised by the land , they turned out to the search of a shape or a figure and not out , they have the diavolder , and they killed the five missionary .
But Waorans didn &apos;t kill the foreign &apos;t just the foreign of the Waorans .
They killed each other .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by their own .
We were eight generations and we found two natural death cases , and we &apos;ve insisted to know , they admitted to their own , they admitted by by the time that they were invecked , and then killed it the same .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal as 40 steps and recognize that species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was an really interesting task for my Harvard professor , asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti in , to intrusted with the basic secret of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes , and impossessed the poison of the poison of the poison to do bie zomes .
To make a sense of the miraculous , I would have to understand Vodoo culture and the Voodoo is not magic .
It &apos;s pretty much about a complex metaphorrified vision in the world .
Very interesting .
If I asked you to tell me about the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christianity , Islam , Buddhism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no religious faith . And instead of the Voodoo is not the other that the illustration of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious concepts .
What makes interesting is that voodoo is the relationship between life and death .
So the bees are going .
Sspirits can be invocated by the Great Acqua , they respond to the dance of the dance and replace temporary to the live of the living way so that for a short active active active is following .
For this voodooomic vast woodooists , you go to talk about God .
We &apos;re going to say in the temple and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re posing , is the spirit that you , how can you get you wrong ?
So it &apos;s got these incredible events : following voodoo in state of trance trance that touches infuzzes a very strong demonstration of the body when it &apos;s catalyzed in a state of extremely excitement .
Back in all the people that I have the most extraordinary lived are Kogi Kogi Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta Colombia .
They were as the ancient timeself civilization that once lived on the charge of the car-the-Colombia on the windurge , the people would retreated on the volcanic massassassassassassassassassassassassassassassassassassassassassassassassy plant .
In a continent of blood , this people had never been conquered by the spaghetti sauce .
But I &apos;m not today , they &apos;re governated by a clero , but their formation is very extraordinary .
The young people are taken from the families to three or four years , and they live secret in a good world , shading in a good world of stone , in the basic glacious fold for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years of the proposal that they &apos;re going to reproduce the nine months of gestation that they &apos;re metaphor , they &apos;re metaphor in the laws .
For all of this time , they &apos;re acculturing to their own society , values that they see that their prayers and only their prayers and they just keep the foreign balance -- or to say the Cilibrium balance .
And so we &apos;re about this incredible initiation , they suddenly carried out and for the first time to life , at the age of 18 , they see a dawn . And that was the first butterness of the first butterly landscape , everything that they &apos;ve learned in theory is constuck all of his beautiful landscape , all that they have learned in theory , and says , &quot; pret it &apos;s a step back and says :
&quot; Visto me as I said .
It &apos;s amazing . Now it &apos;s now to you . &quot;
They &apos;re called the greater brothers and say that we , brothers , are the black-dest hits of the destruction of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the indigenous populations and the environment we call Rousseau and the old story of the selling sevble , which is a race concept in its simplicity or maybe we invoThoreau and we say that these people are closer to the Earth of us .
Indies are not feelings , no sentimental feelings , no indebate .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the malarial paludes or the vents of the Tibet , but because of time and rituals , they created a mystical of the Earth is based on not about the concept of being aware of the concept of being aware of the notion of human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
That a kid in the Ande who would grow up by creating that the mountain is an Apspilying the mountain is an Apologize that it will be a very different relationship with the mountain or that place , or the mountain that place of a Montana who has grown to create that a mountain is a masse of rocks is a rocks of rocks to be a rocks of rocks to be a lot of rocks in the mountain is a masse of footprprints .
which is the dimmora is irrelevant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that define the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia Britannica believing that forests would be cut .
And that has made me a different human being different from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that forests are the dimmora of Hukukukukukukukukukukukukukukude , who live in the Hamatsa .
If you start to look at that these cultures can actually create different reality , you can start to understand some of their sensations that we can start to understand some of them .
I took this picture to open in the nordocorle Amazon the nordest Amazon .
Maybe some of you &apos;ve heard about the ayahuasca , the most powerful psychophical substantial psychophical substantial .
What makes the fascinating ayahuasks is not the pharmacical potential of substance , but the processing elevation . It &apos;s two elements .
On one hand , this legny leaving a series of beta-coal series , harmoline and harmoline , harmoline , little skily hallucinogen , slightly hallucinogen ,
And by taking the only plant , you have a smoke that alter a little bit of the consciousness , but it &apos;s mixed with a caffected &apos;s family ards , and he said , &quot; Poptry is called Poptry and the viridis .
This plant contains powerful powerful , very similar to the seriotonin , dithylpmethyppptamine .
If you ever see the Yanomami throw me on the nose of the nose of the substance that make from a different species , it contains methydimethyyptamin .
You can have that dust on the nose is a little bit like being gone gone from a shoulder of paints and floating on a sea of electricity . We make it . We don &apos;t believe a distortion of reality .
I often have to my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who had been shown the psycheated , with her discovery of fungi in the &apos; 30s in Mexico .
In my thesis not going to class these tripamine as as hallucinogens because if you &apos;re made not telling anybody to be hallucinated . So , the tripamine tripamine can &apos;t be hasn &apos;t be abunt because they &apos;re in a enzyme that is of course in the intestine , called oxygen , called oxygen monoonalized .
It &apos;s possible to assumerely if you above with other chemicals that would dencaturate MAO .
Now it &apos;s the beautiful : the beta-fuel , the beta-fuel in-in-in-in-in-in-like , the same kind of need to be able to be the tripamine . The question is spontaneous . The question is spontaneous . In a fairds , like these people can find two defologically not similar , but that if you combine in this way , they &apos;re combined with with a chemical chemical version of the parts ?
We use the big Europeugly large formy , and the error , which can revealing to infruttifer .
But if we ask Indians , they &apos;ll tell us , we &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re asking . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Copan , has 17 variety of ayhuasca , who distinguishes in the forest , and that at our eyes would come back in the same species .
If we ask them how to stbipush their toxonomy will say , &quot; I thought , &quot; I thought , &quot; You don &apos;t know ? &quot; I &apos;ve said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : You take 17 varieties in a night of moon filling and each night with a different sets .
With this is not graduate at Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than stamp the stami .
Now , &#91; applausers &#93; the problem is that even those of us that have in the heart people who are painting but in some way , reduced to the margins in the history of respect our real world , and it &apos;s going to go beyond .
In fact , the 20th century , in 300 years , it &apos;s not going to remember his technological innovations , but rather like the one was where we stopped and we abbraced actively or passive , destruction of mass diversity and cultural diversity , cultural and cultural diversity of the planet . Now the problem is not change .
All of the cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibilities .
And the problem is not technology .
Indians Sioux have no smell to be Sioux when they put on their arco and frecovered as American and they have been on the horse and they put on the horse and hot .
It &apos;s not change or technology that threat the technology that threat the integrity of ethnosh . It &apos;s the power .
The hard to domination .
And if you look at the world , you &apos;ll discover that these are not destined to disappear .
They &apos;re living creatures and dynamics are wasting out of the existence from forces that go beyond their adaptation .
It &apos;s a disboscampaign in the Penan --
a people who lived in Sarawak , in the Southeast East , a people who lived in the forest to a generation , and now reduced to a generation ago , and now reduced to the servitery and the next titution of rights , where you can see the river river river river , the Borneo to the Merional Chinese , where nerional nurse , where the nabinkable can see the horizon ,
You get the wooden wooden with the wooden wooden .
Or the Yanomami -- are the diseases that have come with the discovery of the gold .
If we marry on the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the hard day-domination .
As you know the genocide , the extinction physics of a people , is convicted to universal level , but the destruction of the style , the destruction of the style of a people , not only is not a conducted , but even celebrated in certain cers , because it &apos;s part of the development strategy .
And you can &apos;t understand the Tibet until you go from the beginning .
I &apos;ve been pushed with the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in the West , coming in in Lhasa young connection , but only came to Lhasa young connection , but only came to Lhasa whose of talking about .
6,000 sacred reduced ties in dust and centered .
1.2 million people killed from the military in the Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy has been ascriteria to the Panchen Lama .
which means that it has been killed at the time of Chinese invasion .
His is fuel with Sue Santiity during the diaspora that led to Nepal .
His mother was imprisoned and her blame .
It was brought to hide in charge to the age of two hidden , in his wave because he couldn &apos;t have him .
The sister , who did the same , was a reeducation in reeducation .
One day , he reverted a remarkable fashioned a fashioning fashioned , was a sevenested to work for seven years .
The pain of Tibet can be insopportable , but the spirit of the people is from tener tener .
And then , it &apos;s all reduces to a choice .
We want to live in the world monocromatic or , or do we want to account the world policy ?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he said that his greatest fear was that , in our view of the world , we &apos;re going to see the whole gamory of the human imagination , we &apos;re going to see the whole gamort of thinking , but one day we &apos;re going to see a sleeping logging to the gamort to there were other possibilities .
And it &apos;s equally to remind that our species is existed for 600,000 years .
The Neolitica Revolution , who gave us agriculture , who gave us agriculture , which has done us to skim the poem of the skip , by the way , creating the gerarchy of specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has to be 300 years .
That shark story doesn &apos;t suggests me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we &apos;re going to face in millennia .
When to these miriades of the world is asked what to say to be human , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
And that &apos;s in these answers that we all return the chance to be what we are : a conscious species , which has to give all the people and the gardens can train . And there are big moments of optimism .
I took this picture on the north of the Baffin the Easter island , when I went to hung with the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olayas I went to the wonderful story of her grandfather .
The canads government has not always been gentile with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to stabilire our supremise , we have them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refused to go .
The family , theme for her life , he took him all the weapons , and all of his toward it .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t feel the cold , they exploit .
The pieces of the origin were made of fish fish flying in origin skin .
The grandfather of this man didn &apos;t reward the Arctic or the bylizer that suffering .
It &apos;s disgactified , it &apos;s hot the pair in the focus and defecated skin their hand . When I did it was frozen , and they worked with them by creating a skim .
He sprouting on the punch of this blined , and when solid sold , he was killed a dog .
He shake the dog and created a shoulder , with the toracy , has created a slope , he enliked another dog and he &apos;s disappeared on the banking , and it &apos;s disappeared on the banking , and it &apos;s disappeared to the dochhs .
We want to talk about the horrible with anything ? &#91; Risate &#93; And this , in different ways , &#91; Applusi &#93; is the symbol of the Inuit and of all the Indies in the world .
In the open-seven-seven-based reduced to the Inuit has total control area of a larger territory area of California and Texas together .
It &apos;s their new patha . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s an independent land . They all all minerary resources .
One beautiful example of the spleny of like a natione-state can reconcied with his people .
And , to finish , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious at least to who of us has been in these remote zes on the planet , I realized that they &apos;re not remote .
For somebody is home .
They represent sections of human imagination that are at the dawn of time . And for us all , the dreams of these kids , as the dreams of these kids , become part of the geography of hope .
And finally , we are National Geographic , we are convinced that politicians will never come to anything .
We believe that polemics --
&#91; Applaud &#93; are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the best to institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month , 35 million visits .
156 countries transmitted our television .
Our magazines are filled by millions of people .
Our work is traveling in the ethnososphere to bring our public to the public in places in places of cultural wondering from what they &apos;ve seen and , hopefully , embracts , and they &apos;re hoping , abbracing a life of anthropology : the world of exist in diversity , and we have to find a life of life in a pluralyan and multicultural world , muralistle and multiculticultural and melting our public and mess , mesthus
where all people can contribute to our collective wisdom .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope is called a other other other than you &apos;ve heard and I &apos;m going to try to show some links , in the case you don &apos;t notice .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the official dogma . &quot;
The dogma official what ?
The dogma official society of all the West industrial society . The dogma official dogma official well-being of our citizen . &quot; The way to do it is massized the well-being of our citizens .
The reason is , on one hand , in fact that freedom is in itself a value , is precious , useful , essential for human beings .
On the other hand , if we &apos;re free , each of us can act to do anything to do with the blast to do everything that massimize our well-being , no one of the deciding in our own .
The way to massized freedom is massized choice .
The more choices of people , the more they are libere , and the largest freedom , the largest one of them .
This , I think , it &apos;s so deeply roomed in society that nobody would have to be a doubt .
And it &apos;s also deeply roomed in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m going to permate a simple note about conditions to the injumped .
In my supermarket are 175 conditions , without contact 10 variety of oil , and the 10 variety of oil oil , and the 12 acities that you can buy to a huge number of conditions that you can buy to a number of conditions in the circumstance that none of the 175 .
And this is what the supermarket .
And then you go to the electronic store : cases , CD lettor CD leptor , radio , plasks , lifestyficator .
And in this single single electronic store , there &apos;s a big number of audio components .
We can make six and a half million different combinations using the components that there are in a only store .
You have to admit that there &apos;s lots of choice .
More fields : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all telephones that were willing to be , at the same time that they could get their mom Bell .
They noleggied the phone , they didn &apos;t buy it .
One of the result , between the other , was that the phone never break .
These times are gone .
Now we have a almost illimited , phones , especially among cell phones .
Here &apos;s the cell phones .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , cut the MP3 , cut her nose , and fornels for the snose , and fornels for the snose .
If you don &apos;t see it still saw in the back negotives , you &apos;re very much that will come .
And what happens is that people come in to the stores and they do this question . And what is the answer ? The answer is &quot; No . &quot;
You can &apos;t buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t make a cell phone that doesn &apos;t make too much .
So , in other ways of life that are much more important than the aquomines , it &apos;s the same explosion of choices .
Assistence : It doesn &apos;t happen to the United States that you &apos;re going to go from the doctor and the doctor you &apos;re going to do .
Instead , you &apos;re going to the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do A , or B , &quot; You could do A has these benefits and these risks &quot; B has these benefits and these risks . What do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Doctor , what would I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A has these benefits , and B has these benefits , and B has these benefits these benefits . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you &apos;re going to say , &quot; Doctor if you were , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; I &apos;m not her . &quot;
We call it &quot; &quot; autonomy of the malate , &quot; expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not that one move the weight and responsibility to make decisions from somebody who knows something , which is the doctor , to somebody else who knows anything -- and almost certainly is sick -- and it &apos;s certainly not a bad condition -- and so not in the ide-condition -- and so not in the ide-condition --
There &apos;s a huge marketing of products , directed to people like me and you , who , if you think about it doesn &apos;t make any sense , because we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why do they advertitire them ?
The answer is that they want to ask them to require them .
Something that &apos;s so important as it is our identity issue is a choice of choice , as you see in this vignity . We don &apos;t want to forced their kids . They &apos;re going to go up their sex at at the right moment , &quot; We have to invent it .
And we can reinventing how many times you get to get it .
which means that every morning , at the riskkin , you have to decide what kind of you want to be .
I &apos;m going to the family and the matririage , a long time the perspective , almost for anyone , it was that we married the most soon possible , and you start to get the most soon possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not when , and not what to do after .
So , it &apos;s really to play .
I teach students very smart students , and I do 20 percent in less of work than a time .
And not because they &apos;re not good because they &apos;re not because they &apos;re less diligent .
but why are they impending , you mean , should I marry me or not ? Should I marry it or not ? Would I get it right now ? &quot;
&quot; Should I get married later ? I think before the kids or the career ? &quot;
They &apos;re logorous interrogative .
And they &apos;re trying to answer these questions , even though this implical to not complete the tasks that I teach and not get a great voice to my exam .
And they have to really do that . They &apos;re important questions .
Now , the work : We &apos;re lucky , as Carl subyield , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from every day on the planet , except that from the Hotel Randolph .
And in the parentesesesthetic , and I &apos;m not going to say what the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t say that , because I want to use me .
What does this incredible freedom of choice that we have about the work ? It &apos;s that we have to continually decision , continually in every time , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing heat , with cell phone in a pocket , Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , typically , on the knees .
And even if they &apos;re all spending , every minute that we see our son rovating the game , we &apos;re also asking ourselves , we &apos;re asking , &quot; I &apos;ve got to answer this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? I &apos;ve got to email this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is no , all this makes the experience of your son very different son from your son &apos;s very different than the other conditions .
So , any of the look at , small things , big and large , things , life is a matter of choices .
Once the world was this : Which was there , there were some possibilities , but it wasn &apos;t all about choice .
The world today looks like this : The world is : The dilemma is , &quot; Is it a good thing , or negative ?
The answer is a lot of it .
The positive layers we know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative .
All this is this extra two negative two negative remarkable to people .
The first one , paradoxically , is that produced paralysis that that &apos;s paradoboy .
With many options between which choose , becomes very difficult to do it .
I give you a significant example : a study of voluntary pensive retipping .
A colleague had access to the Vanguard data , the gigantic society , with about a pension of pension , with about a million clients in 2,000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offering in the more , the percentage of adhespan down of two percent .
With 50 per offer , there &apos;s 10 percent less adhesive than advertising when they &apos;re available ?
Because with 50 funds where they choose , is hardly hard to decide , and choice is replaced to the indomans .
And tomorrow , and tomorrow , tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course tomorrow .
You know that it doesn &apos;t mean only these old workers who are going to keep food for the dog because they &apos;re not going to have enough money , they also want to say that the decision is so unpermaning the fund of the datories of the datasentary of work .
Not participating , they &apos;re losing to five dollars per year from the work dator , which would be well disposed to green .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think that makes the world .
&quot; And to end , for the ethernity : ketchup , or maionesescape ? &quot;
Would you like to make the right decision , if it &apos;s for ethernity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to pick the wrong bottom , and even the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can avoid the parallel and make choice , at the end , we &apos;re less satisfacts of how we would have been with less options .
And that &apos;s about a different reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions that choose , if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have done a different choice that would have been better . And what what &apos;s happening is that the alternative . It &apos;s the alternative to us to ramatically , it decreates reaved by the decision , and the reputing decreation on the decision , and the reavated demining ,
even when it was a very good decision .
The more choices there are , the easier displeased any details that &apos;s insatisfaction of the option choice .
And also , there is what economists call costo-opportunities .
Dan Gilbert : It clearly well , how we give things depends on things that we have to do depends on .
On the rest , when there are many options , it &apos;s easy to represent the actual characteristics of the option that you have to be a deeply unsatisfacts of the option that has choice .
So here &apos;s one example . I &apos;m sorry with all the people who are not New York .
But that &apos;s what you probably think .
There &apos;s this couple of Hamptons .
a place of luxury .
It &apos;s about beautiful , it &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not missing . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , right , right , it &apos;s August . &quot;
&quot; All my neighbors in Manhattan are away . &quot;
&quot; I could parking right in front of the home . &quot;
And it goes to two weeks on the idea that is losing -- every day -- every day -- the ability to parking parking where he wants .
costo-opportunities decrease soddisfation for what we have , even when choice was excellent .
And the more are the options that we have to look at , the more actual acities that are going to be refused against as costo-opportunities .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things that there is a lot of things .
We &apos;re talking about the time , and maybe to live slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you choose , you can &apos;t do the other .
The things that we don &apos;t pick up have a lot of activities that can make less attractive what we do .
Third thing : the increasing expectations .
I tried to my skin butterly a new jeans .
I &apos;m almost always almost always .
Once the jeans were just one , they bought and dressed them and dressed a bag , they were discomfortable , just after they took them a life and they were going to go well .
So , I went to bought a couple of time when the old old old ones were gone , and I said , &quot; I need to be a couple of jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
The committed me , &quot; You want to slim , relaxed fit , fit ? &quot;
He wants to do it with the cernified or with the buttons ? &quot; Stonewashed &quot; or &quot;
&quot; Would you like ? &quot;
&quot; You know , you want to ble ? &quot; Bla , &quot; Continupright , &quot; Continupright them .
I was unballoon , and after a while I got to say , &quot; I want the guy that was the only guy . &quot; He didn &apos;t have any idea what it was , so for a time , I tried all of the maleans , and then I came out of the jeans , and I skim , who had ever ever ever ever ever ever had .
It was the most of that . With all that choice had the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse about that was that with all that choice , my jeans had to be perfect .
At first I had a minimum expectations . I didn &apos;t expect anything that was just a kind of , but when I saw 100 different , which was at least a kind of had to be perfect .
What I did was good , but not perfect .
After I compared to the chose with what I was actually insatisfacted to the expectations .
The addition of options in life life life that people don &apos;t do that to increase the excellence of the options themselves .
And that will produce less subsatisfaction , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world &apos;s world &apos;s marketing if it &apos;s accounts .
Because if they knew , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more like this .
&quot; He was better when you were worse , &quot; The reason he was better when you were worse is that when you were worse was even even possible to meet the surprises .
So , in the world where we live in , in the world where we live in , industrialized citizen , with the expectancy -- the very very , very , very , very , the most of the expectations .
You never surprised to pleased because your expectations , my expectations , they got ingigantttle .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here is : &quot; Baxy wawaiting for for you . &quot;
I mean -- small autobiographic moment -- which are actually married and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn &apos;t do it , I didn &apos;t do it .
But you &apos;re not always a bad thing .
And then , one consequence of the buying a couple of jeans when there is just that you &apos;re not satives when you &apos;re not satisfacts , and you ask , why ?
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot; , the answer is clear .
The world is the responsible . What would I do ?
When you have hundreds of kinds of jeans , and you buy a insodisfacing , and you ask the who is the responsible , it &apos;s just so clear that the responsible you are .
You could have done better .
With hundreds of variety available , there are no excuse for insuccessful .
So when people do decisions , even if the result is valid , they feel insatisfy and they give the blame .
In the last years , depression is exploded in the last years .
I think a significant factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this honest depression is that people have experiences have deludent experiences because standard are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation they think the blame .
So the result is that we &apos;re better , actually better , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely fake .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little choice better than having any of it , but from this didn &apos;t go from this one , it didn &apos;t go to that much choice .
There &apos;s a magic value , magic value . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m quite sure we &apos;ve been enough we &apos;ve been on a piece of level where the choices are improved .
Now , from a political standpoint -- I almost finished -- from the political point of view , the peanch is the following .
What allows all this whole choice in the industrial society is wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know about that , where the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too too pack .
So the next thing that I &apos;m talking about is a malage of modern , rich society , which is Western society .
And what it makes and depressing and angry is : Steve Levitt told you yesterday how much those expensive and comfortable seats are useless . It &apos;s a money lurder .
I mean that these choices , complicated and depending , it &apos;s not that they &apos;re just useful .
I &apos;m even deleterie .
They &apos;re doing it worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows choosed to the people have too too much possibly , it wouldn &apos;t be the life to improve but also our own life .
This is what economists call is a lot of improvement .
A redistribution of income re-income re-income re-income redistribution of this , so it &apos;s about it .
To conclude , you can get it all you want to --
You , people of culture , you &apos;re going to think , &quot; But what does that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t get anything in a window . &quot;
&quot; A rantrade imagination , a limited vision of the world --
and I &apos;m interpreted it so , at the beginning .
But then , I realized , I &apos;m realized that that that fish the long knows the long knows .
Because the reality is that if you &apos;re missing in frantumes , so that &quot; all you can &apos;t &apos;t get freedom . You can &apos;t get freedom . You get the parallel .
If you break the mocting the mill in a way that it &apos;s all possible to decrease satisfaction .
You &apos;re getting the paralisis , and you reduce the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too strange , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of a few sphere is a recipe for inhappiness and , I theme for the rainin .
Thank you very much .
