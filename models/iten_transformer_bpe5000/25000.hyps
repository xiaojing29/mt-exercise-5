Last year I showed these slide up to show that the glacial calculate , which for almost three million years had the size of the 48 United States continental dimensions , it &apos;s restrip 40 percent .
However this underlying gravity of the problem because it &apos;s not extending of the ice of the ice of the ice .
The glacial calm is , in a certain sense , the heart of the glacial climate system .
It expands on the winter and you &apos;re going to be retreated .
The next slide is going to be a quick quick sat the last 25 years .
The glaces are reported in red .
As you see , they &apos;re going to go up to the blue scene .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter , which is going to be retreated .
You can see that the constitute constitute , five years or more , is like a blood blood , which here was fighting from the body .
In 25 years , since that , in 25 years , so .
This is a problem because the interests of the interests that , the glaciated land around the ocean where there are huge amounts of fuzzy that , skip , are transformed into meters .
I &apos;m going to the total-warming de-warming , that global warming , that amount could doubling , super-scale amount of not return .
In some of the fairly deep in Alaska metan is already resulting from the water .
The professorse Katey Walter of the University of Alaska has taken team prices to a team on a low-like lago .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You &apos;re good . The question is if we &apos;re going to be .
One reason is that this thermal exchange the Groenland from northermal .
This is a river at regime .
The ported never reached the layers like .
This is the Kanglussuaimal River .
If you want to know how the sea level of sea , it &apos;s shoulets on the land , here is where the sea is where it reaches the sea .
These currents are rapidly increasing .
On the other side of the planet : Antarctica , the greatest block of the ice of the planet .
Last month , the scientists have said that the balance of ice is in negative , and the West Antarccccccccccccccccccccccles , is particularly quick in the skiing .
It &apos;s six feet of the water , like in the Groenland .
Sulle Himalayas , the third greatest block of ice , you see new lagues , that a few years ago were glacied .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population revended half of the water from the potential .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of water .
The ported is increased .
But when it decrease , the same falls in the potential water .
In California , snow on the Sierra Nevada is decrecrease 40 percent .
The hyroline are in crisis .
The predictions , as you &apos;ve read , they &apos;re grats .
The growing safe in the world leads to a remarkable increasing incendi .
The disaster environmental disaster is increasing out of the normal and unprecedented .
Four times more than four than the last 30 years I was going to be 75 .
This is a wunsustainable and unsustainable .
If you look in the historical context , if they can see the outcome .
We &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the world of the East Pacific , from the Americans , to the west , and on both of the Indian continent , where there &apos;s a radical royal impoverslow in the ocean .
The greatest cause of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossil fuels .
The oil is a problem , and the coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two of the world with most emissions , together to China .
And it was proponated of a lot of other central centering .
But we &apos;re seeing a change of direction .
These are the annullated projects in the last years and some of the versus .
At any way , there &apos;s a policy in our country .
The industrial and the coal and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote coal coal , which is a symbol .
That image would remember me something --
Verice , in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a loss of 3.8 billion gallons of coal four-billion liers of coal .
You may have seen it on the news .
This is the second largest flury of the flow of the major flow of America .
It &apos;s happened around the Natal .
The coal advertising of one of the coal industrial advertising .
Video : See the carbon is a kind of allegro and it &apos;s a happy kind of allegry .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it &apos;s growing our economy .
Frosing the carbon is and more and more pulit .
It &apos;s good price , and adorable and the worthwhile we &apos;re going to be fashion .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the coal West Virginia .
The greatest minerary society is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I &apos;m going to be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosy , Harry Really -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Protection of the Clima has launched two campaign .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : At the same same thing . In the same , as a threat to our business .
For this priorities is invest a huge amount of money in a public effort to make public and confused the truth on .
In fact , coal is not sports .
We think it &apos;s pulit -- it &apos;s also a good profumo .
So you don &apos;t preupatory of climate change .
Let me do .
Video : Carbone puildlife -- you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
So let &apos;s do a turn around in a structure at the avanid structure for how it &apos;s coal .
Stricarm ! The machines are a little noisy , but that &apos;s the sound of the puzzle technology .
The fuel consumption is between the major causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology of puildness that you see change everything .
You look at a look . This is the technology of puzzle .
Al Gore : The end , the alternative positive is connected to economic issue and the national security .
Video : America is in crisis , the economy , national security , climate crisis .
The filter that connections all : our dependence from fuel fuel , like coal and the oil oil .
Now , though , there &apos;s a new , auduty solution for circles .
Repower : 100 percent cleaning energy , in 10 years .
A plan to reach America to work , make us more safe , and help stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that drink to solve our problems .
Repower America . You &apos;re more .
Al Gore : That &apos;s the last .
Video : It &apos;s about re-energy .
One of the fastest ways of getting getting to the dependence from the fuel that killing our planet .
Comparsa : The future is here . Vent , the future is here .
However 2 : Novi investimate for jobs .
Compling : Repower . It &apos;s time of being realisten .
Al Gore : A old African guy says , &quot; If you want to go speed , go from the speed .
If you want to go away , go together . &quot;
We have to go far far , fast .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED I did a introduction on the LHC .
And I promise to return to you on how the car works .
So I &apos;m here . And for those that the other time there were , the LHC is the greatest scientific experiment ever attempt -- 27 kilometers of circles .
His task is to rear the conditions that were at less than a billiondespite of a second from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
This is just ambitious .
This is the machine under Ginevra .
We &apos;re going to go through these mini-Big Bang in the relevant .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- is a large 44 meters and has a 22-meters .
This is an amazing picture of ATLATLAS in building so you can see the proportions .
The 10 September of the last year we &apos;ve got the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLATLAS .
It was because of immense flew in the control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first of particles of particles that had done all the around of the LHC , and it &apos;s going into the collision , and spread particles in the releving .
In other words , when we see that 10 September , we realized that the car worked , which was a big vinity .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to make us exulating more or that , when somebody went on on Google and saw that the page was this .
That means we &apos;ve had a cultural impact beyond that scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the car , had to the cover here -- these wildored .
These films caring out 13,000 ampampes when the car works at the most .
Now , the technical between of you will look at the films and they will say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . They &apos;re too good . &quot;
And instead of it can do it because when they &apos;re very cold , they &apos;re going to be the deaths of the sketch .
So , at less 271 degrees , at a lower temperature at the space between stars , these films can bring that current .
In one of the giuntures between the most of the magnetic in the LHC , there was a defect of factory .
So the files are going to be slightly , and the 13,000 amparded up that they had an electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magnees are about 20 tons , and that they moved about 30 centimetmeters .
They &apos;re damaged about 50 magnetic magnees .
We had to take them , what we did .
We reprined them and wanders .
They &apos;re now going back to all their underground .
At the end of the LHC , will be again integrated .
We &apos;re going to accain , and we expect to get data or July , and continue so our adventure to find out what the universe is the brains that constitute the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents reach the debate about the value of science and the engineering of frontier and the engineering of frontier . It &apos;s easy to contain .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s so hard , I think that &apos;s the value of things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of an Inglese scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , I suppose , in defense experiments of his puppllo was Miy Faday , he said , &quot; Nothing is so dangerous for the progress of human mind as the mind as the human mind as the ideas of science as the mind as well as the definitely , not there are the natural , that we have no mysti in nature , and that &apos;s not uncaught in . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start asking for rethink about when you , you play with kids , you play with the brick .
As you can get them and get them , and you learn them , and you learn them , and you learn to think and resolling relationships .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , from information that is inspired by useful by our interaction with physics , together to my collaborator , with my consult Pact , and at my collaborator Kalanithi , I started asking , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of having the only mouse as a digital , as a digital , which is going to be able to be able to affect physics ,
and fix it ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building Siftool .
In a few words , a Siftool is a big interactive computer like a biscanning .
In a few words , a Siftool is a big interactive computer like a biscanning .
You can move with your hand , they can see them , &quot; they can see &quot; their movement and have a wireless radio .
But overahead , are physicists , like the brick , you can just move down .
The Siftttext is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physical , aware of their movement , of the other , and as they become more physical , of the other , and as they become more physical , of the other movement , of how we can explore new and interaction , and we can explore new and interaction .
I &apos;m going to start with a simple example .
This Sifttool is configured to show video : if you cline it in a direction , the video will rotate so , if you cline from the other side back back .
These interactive portraits of the other .
If you release , you know , you &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re going around .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can see it and they can act a little bit .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can see it and they can act a little bit .
They also have their own and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the way to use community gexture on data , for example , &quot; a color like whether it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Sifmonks configured like the versus , and I can use them to use them to the color in that central , where they mix .
and I can use them to use it to use it to the color in that central , where they &apos;re going to blind .
We can put a little bit too , we can put a little bit of it .
There are also beautiful possibilities of learning , like languages , like the languages , the math and games of logic where people can try and see the outcomes .
Now I &apos;m --
This is a sequence of Fibonacks that I do with a equations program .
Here we have a game of words that &apos;s in the middle of Scarabeo and Boggle .
Basically , at every Turn one of the case on every Siftool , you get a letter of every Turn in a case of Siftool , and while you &apos;re trying to compose him , he &apos;s going to be a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds remained , and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the kids came up in the Media Lab , I did it in a way that I tried them and I &apos;ve been around a video .
They have very pleased .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
You just have to say , &quot; You know , &quot; You know , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s other people who try it .
This is our Tit tester tester , there on the right .
It just wanted to impllars .
They were just morning , for him .
Now , this is an applying of an interactive cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool for learning . He &apos;s Felix . He &apos;s Felix .
It can put new new characters in the scene , liftling the Sifmonks , they associated with .
It can put new new characters in the scene , liftling the Sifmonks , they associated with .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun out .
Video : The sun is surprising .
David Merrill : Now he led a treatment in the scene .
Video : The arange treatment .
Bel work ! You can do it .
So you shake the Sifttool and put it close them can make the characters --
Video : Bau !
by inventing their own story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a story with the open , and it can decide him how it does it make it decide .
DM : It &apos;s a story with the open , and it can decide him how it does it make it decide .
Video : Say , cat it .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , which I have time to show you is a tool , to sample music .
It &apos;s a tool , which is that it &apos;s a tool , to sample music .
The Siftesting here are sounds like basic , low-and the bacteria .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose what they use .
You can also put these sounds in a sequence from compose to your pleasure .
And it just by doing it by doing a sound and a sequence .
These are actually you can control from alive , like the reverse and the filter .
The acks to a particular sound and then cline to sounds .
And then there are general effects as time and volume , that are apply to the entire sequence .
Let &apos;s look like it works .
DM : We &apos;re going to put a base in two Siftness &quot; sequence , &quot; we put it in a series , we put it in a series , we add base .
Now , I &apos;m going to put a low line .
DM : Now I added of percussions --
DM : And now I &apos;m going to put the glass on the bacteria , so I can control the vial effect from alive .
DM : I can just get the entire sequence of the entire sequence , by one side or the other .
DM : And now I &apos;m going to add the bottom of the bottom to the bottom to give more expression .
DM : I can get the sequence of the flying sequence .
So I didn &apos;t have to plant it before , but I can suddenly make it a lot of a lot of time .
And now , finally , I can smoking the entire sequence of the entire sequence , by the Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new human interfaces and more and more like how they work our brain work .
And today , I &apos;ve got time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that &apos;s coming this new generation of the things that we &apos;re going to bring information in our world .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time of talking to all of you .
I &apos;m a writer .
I &apos;m going to be books , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the fascinating of my life .
And I don &apos;t look like it .
But , I said this , something that particular has happened in my life and in my career , which led me to recalibrate the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called &quot; Mangia , &quot; Prega , &quot; which , diversously , in my previous books , for some reason , in the world and become a big sensational , for some reason , interational bestseller .
And the result is that everywhere now , people treating me as if I was convicted .
I &apos;m going to be -- conducted .
They &apos;re all going to be worried and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t fear to do better than ?
You don &apos;t fear to go and write all of life without being able to create a book that can matter of someone ? &quot;
that can matter people importing someone ? &quot;
It &apos;s reassuring , you know .
But it could go worse , at the part of that I remember over 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was an adolescent -- I was a written .
I went to the same reaction with the fear .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you have succeeded ?
You don &apos;t fear that the humiliation of the refigures kills ?
You don &apos;t fear to do this for all of life without anything that it &apos;s ever out of a snaking of a cumb , with the sets of dinner wocking ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
I &apos;m afraid of all of those things .
I &apos;ve always got fear .
And I also fear of many other things that people would not have to be initiate .
How the algae and other things .
But , as I was thinking about write what I was thinking about and I ask me ultimally is why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s roughly logic that anyone who should expect to be slow-up with a work that you feel sent to do .
But what is that specifically in creative companies to make us nervous about the mental health as well as a way that other carefully they don &apos;t do it ?
As my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don &apos;t remember one once in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if it was fear to be engineer ?
There was never -- that block of the engineer John , how does it go ?
It wasn &apos;t working so , you understand ?
Onestly , chemicals like a group have not certainly , in the centuries , in the reputation of being alcccles .
We have enough to this reputation , and not just creative writers , but creative writers , but we have this reputation of the ununinstable .
And it &apos;s not going to be looking at the sad of the constraints of creative minds that , only in the 20th century , they die and often by hand .
And the ones that are not suicidated seem to be really disdisdisdisdissed by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , &quot; Every book has killed me a little bit more &quot; A remarkable to the work of their life .
But we don &apos;t throw it out when we feel saying why we &apos;ve heard these things so long that in some way we have completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and the suffering are in a few ways of the cumps are in a little bit of it and that art , at the end , and then , condurable to the angososcy .
And the question I want to ask you all here is : Wagree with this idea ?
It &apos;s good for you -- because it &apos;s also looking at it from a centimeter to me not good for this supposing .
I think it &apos;s hating .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous and I don &apos;t want to see it in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our big creative minds to live .
And certainly I know that , in my case -- in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start to the feeling of support of support , in the surrounded .
That &apos;s a pretty young , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;ve got about 40 years old .
I still have about four work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that everything I write about the right now is going to be right from the world as the work that came out after the very scary success of my last book .
I &apos;m going to be slavish , because we &apos;re all more or less friends here -- is likely that my greatest success is in my shoulder .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start bere in the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would keep doing this work that we work that we &apos;re doing this work that we are .
So , the question is going to be , how ?
And so it seems to me , after a lot of reflective , which the way to work to continue write is to create a psychological effective , right ?
I have to find a safety distance of safety , that I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxy about what I &apos;m going to do is get . And as I was looking for everything last year , looking for all the time , trying to find other societies , and I was looking for other societies , and I &apos;m trying to find more and more unlike human ideas and more unlike to see if they could have better ideas and more unlike to see if they could get some more and more unseen .
how to help people manage to deal with emotional risks of the emotional risks of creativity .
And that research led me to the ancient Great and ancient Rome .
Secting me because it comes in circle and then it back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity selling creativity from men , OK ?
They thought the creativity was this spirit looks at the divine and that came to men from a few distant and unknown , for distant and unknown , for distant and unknown .
The raised us these spirits of the demons of creativity &quot; demons . &quot;
Socrationally , believed that they had a demon that held wisdom from a long long long way .
The Romories were the same idea , but they called the the kind of spirit without a body .
The whose is great , because the Romans didn &apos;t think a really genius were somebody particularly intelligent .
They believe that a genius were this kind of divine that was believing was living in the walls of a little bit of the artist , a little bit like the electric parking , and that came out of the work of the artist and to model the artist of that work .
Here &apos;s eastern distance of which I talk about -- that &apos;s the distance of the purposes of your work .
And everybody knew it was so that it worked , right ?
So the antic artists were protected by certain things , like the too narcism , right ?
If your work was exceptional you couldn &apos;t take it all the deserves , all of the people who were helped by this genius .
If your falliva work , it was not your all your fail , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a hell .
And so people have han conceived creativity in the West for a long time .
Then the Rended and everything came up and changed , and it all this big idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe over and the mysties and without leaving space to the creatures of the detailed by divinity .
This was the principle of the rational principle and people started to think that creativity sell completely from the hydividist .
And for the first time in history , you start to reference this or that artist as a rather than person with the genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think it allows somebody , a simple person to believe that you can create a recient as a source , and the source of all the mysteries , and creative and unintense and creative and unflew and a lot of human adversus a ly-great responsibility for human fragile .
It &apos;s how to ask somebody of enjoy the sun .
And I deapse and completely distorce and create all of these kinds of ingestimates expectations on performance .
And I think it was that that &apos;s been destroyed in 500 years .
And , if that &apos;s true , and I think it &apos;s , the question is , and now ?
Can we do it it diversity ?
Maybe go back to a more ancient of human relationship between humans and mystery creative .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t sing 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And probably people in the audience who would be linked to the public suspects of scientific suspended on notion of , so you do , make people faiths , they follow their own projects .
I &apos;m probably not going to convince you all about this .
But the question I &apos;d like to ask ask is -- why not ?
Why don &apos;t you think about this way ?
Because it has more sense of everything that has ever heard to explain exasperating exasperating the imprevedibility of the creative process .
One process that , as anyone ever tried to do something -- so , basically , all here -- you don &apos;t know , rationally comports .
And , in fact , it can sometimes look completely paranormas well .
I did this meeting recently with the extraordinary poetse Ruth Stone , who was a little bit of life and said that during his life and said that during his childhood , and he felt it , in his childhood rural Virginia , working in the camps and he felt , in the camps , and he felt it , in the landscape .
He said he was like a train of air .
And it was roling to come up to the landscape .
He felt it , because he was going to do tremendous , because he was going to do tremendous .
He knew that you had one thing to do that , and it was , words , &quot; run like a match . &quot;
And so he was going to go home and was following this poem , and it wouldn &apos;t have to make another piece of paper and a match enough , as the trapart , and then he would collect it it up on page .
Sometimes I couldn &apos;t be enough , so correct and the correct and the correct without going to get in home and her poetry and kept her performed and she would continued to rolling through the landscape , and she would continued to rolling through the landscape , and she would continue through the landscape , and she would continued to rolling through the landscape , and she would continued to rolling through the landscape , and he keeping up , and she would continue to rotate through the next
Then there were those times -- this is not forcing the time -- there were moments when it was almost losing , right ?
So , he was running home and was trying to be looking for paper and the poetry and the poetry and sevened a match in the way , and he said , that it was like , if you put up with the other hand and the office .
And it was going to be poem from the code and reported it in his body and transmate it on the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page , but the contrary , from the last word to the first word to .
So when I feel it -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly the same as a creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conducucucucucture .
I &apos;m a mule , and my way of work is , and my way of work is , and to work and go up and go over the goodds .
But even , in my testy , I &apos;ve got striped against that thing , sometimes .
And I think that a lot of you have the han .
You know , even though the work and ideas came up to me from a certain source , I could not be honestly aware .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it in a way to not have to losing your head , but rather , that makes us healthy ?
As I &apos;m about , the best example of the contemporary example I have is the Tom Waits , which I interviewed several years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the major of life was the incarnation of the contemporary artist , trying to control , management , tomorrow by looking at , management , tomorrow species of creationally being completely interorized .
But then I was going to hit , he was driving on a highway in Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
He was going to be fast and everything about a sent of a little framment of melodia , coming in his head of how inspiration , elusively and the hecting , and the wants , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and it doesn &apos;t know how to get it .
It doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a recorder .
So , it starts to feel this kind of old anxiety in him , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to smooth of even emthids .
I &apos;m not enough , and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to the panic , he stopped .
He was going to put the whole mental process and made something completely new .
He just looked at the sky and said , &quot; Soll , don &apos;t you see what I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Was it seems that you can write a song now ?
If you really want to exist , you &apos;re going back to a little bit of it .
Altrains , you go to importunimportance somebody else today .
You can disturbing Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his work work was going on after that .
Not the work , the work was still dark as always as always .
But the process , and the fish that was repair that was released when the genius , the genius that was going out of him , the geniuses that was going back from where it was , and they went back from where , and he was going to be a thing interorized and mented .
But it &apos;s well-like , wonderful bizarre , wonderful bizarre , and this strange thing that strange and the outside that was not Tom .
So how I felt that story started to change a little bit of change a little bit of the way I work I was working and I &apos;d already saved once .
This idea , I was going to save me when I was writing , &quot; Mangia , &quot; and fell in one of those cave of the dispersation where we all have when we &apos;re all working on something and we &apos;re not going to start to think that it &apos;s going to be a disaster , which is the worst book .
Not just bad , just the worst book wrote .
And I started thinking about this project .
But I remember Tom that I was talking to the air and I tried .
So I got up my face on on the maneign and I was getting my comments to a vacuum angle of the room .
And I said , &quot; Her , what , both , we know , both of them know that if this book is not going to be a blame , right ?
Because I &apos;m seeing it , I &apos;m putting all of the things I have , I don &apos;t have that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to talk and do your part .
Okay . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know , I don &apos;t do anything .
I &apos;m going to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I would like to be recorded that I was today to do my part . &quot; Because the end is so , OK -- centuries does in the deserts of the North Africa people were rooms in the deserts of the lands of the lands of the lands , and and the music that would go on for hours and the dance .
And they were always magnifies because the dancy were professionals and were fantastic .
But every once , it was something happened , and one of these artists became really really transcendent .
And I know what I &apos;m going to talk about , because I know you &apos;ve all seen , at a certain point , a performance like that .
It was like the time , it was like , and the dancy walked through a kind of kind of , and it was not doing anything different from the usually , like 1,000 noticed , like 1,000 noticed , but it was all of them .
And suddenly , not just like a human .
But it came from from the divinity , and from below the fire .
And when this happened , the people knew what was , they called him him .
They were going to have their hands and started sing , &quot; Allah , Allah , God , God , God , God , God , God , God , God , God , God .
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curious notes -- when the Mori invaser the southern of the Spagna , preserve this habits , and the ready to change in the centuries from &quot; Allah , Allah , &quot; Ole , &quot; which you can still hear in the corride or in the flamenco .
In Spagna , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , &quot; Allaole , the box , &quot; Allaws , &quot; uncomcomprehensive , &quot; uncomprehensive , a welf of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes the day after , for the dancy itself , when you wake up and you see , the 11 of God &apos;s the morning , and the last of God is no longer .
It &apos;s just a lot of bad to the ginoctopus , and maybe it &apos;s not going to get to that altitude .
And maybe nobody is going to sing the name of God still as a gira , and what &apos;s going to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most painting re-porous reconciliations to do in a creative life .
But maybe it &apos;s not going to be so angosciating if you can not believe , advanced , which the most extraordinary aspects of your being from you .
But just believe that you &apos;re data in soon as you &apos;re underpath of a unimaginable source of this team of your life that you have to get somebody else when you finish it .
And , you know , if we think of it all changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s safe as I thought it for several months in the working of the book that I &apos;m going to soon , the dangerous , and attespush it , the dangerous , and attespped out of my great success .
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel electrized from this is , not going to have fear .
Don &apos;t go through you . It &apos;s just your job .
You have a present-arts for your way , whatever .
If your work is dance , you dance .
If the divine , absurd genius , I &apos;m going to give a little kind of wonderful , for a only time through your effort , then , &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Only , you do the same dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot; to you . &quot;
I think I think it &apos;s got to teach it .
&quot; Ole ! &quot; to you the same , even for having human love and testablishine tal cables to make you continuously talk .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As I &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects on human genome , what can mean and the discovery of new genes .
We &apos;re starting a new path : we started digitize biology and now we started digital code , we &apos;re going into a new phase of biology , designing and we &apos;re going into a new phase of biology , designing and synthesizing life .
We &apos;ve always tried to ask big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists think they attempted to understand various levels .
We have tried different approaches , reducing it to the minimi terms .
We &apos;re digitizing by almost 20 years ever .
When we sequenced the human genome treated by the analogical world of biology in the digital world .
Now we ask us : Can we regenerate life , or create new from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from smallest genome that can authoreplication in the lab .
And we tried to reduce that genome the genome to create a little smaller .
We can get a hundred genes of the genes of 500 that are here .
But when we look at the metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our .
Credeeply , that &apos;s simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can get out , one once , it &apos;s very unlikely that this can bring into a living cell cell .
So we decided that the only way to design is synthesizing this chromosome in a way that we could change the components to ask some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of the &quot; Can we synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Can we have the chemistry constant to produce these big molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create before ?
And , in case , we can make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemistry .
The speed with which we are able to digitize life is growing at exponential .
Our ability to write the gene code , instead , progress , which is a pretty slowly , but it &apos;s improving .
And our most recent results the leaders to a exponential curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process has request many passes , by starting with a bioethical review before the first experiments .
But we found out that we synthesize DNA is very hard .
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that produce small segment of DNA , the long length of 30 to 50 letters , and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the most mistakes there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these framments and correct the mistakes .
And that was our first attempty , starting by digital information from the genome of Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a small virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the framments , we &apos;ve got the framments , and we got a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material inheroes and we put it into the bacteria , they started reading this gene code and to produce viral particles .
The viral particles have been released by cells , they went back and they &apos;re destroyed .
I talked about recently with the members of the oil industry saying they have to understand this model .
They have reed more of you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build the same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in big .
We wanted to build the whole chromosome of the bacteria .
They &apos;re more than 580 thousand letter code .
So we thought we &apos;re going to build it in cassette cassette of the size of the virus , so that we can change the components of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard was of a mistake for every 10 midden .
We found it , resequence it , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence we never have been able to do it .
One part of the process is designing segments 50 letters that overwhelmers over-soveters with all the other segments of 50 letters to build smaller underneath small that work together .
We can try to unnights here .
You &apos;ve probably read you have read that we put the flourishing .
So think that &apos;s about it . We have a gene code on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters have about 20 amminoacids , and there &apos;s a specific order of letters , and there &apos;s a specific order to letter acid .
So we can use the gene code to write , frash , thoughts .
What we did at the beginning was self-reating it .
Some have been delused by the fact that it wasn &apos;t poem .
We designed these segments to be able to just join them with enzyme .
There are me , and they put them together .
And we started to assembling of the parts , starting with the sat five to seven mix , together so they can form segment of 24 mile , together so they can form it get to 72 .
At every step we &apos;ve produced these segments in abundance so that we can sequence them because we &apos;re trying to create a very good process -- like you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re looking for automatically .
So , this seems to be the table of a based player .
When we get these very long segments , more than 100 thousand basis , not going to grow more directly in Eccles .
You get the limit of the modern molecular biology .
So we &apos;ve considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called homological recent , which in biology is useful to repair DNA segment .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinoccurcurrency , can absorb three million radiation of radiation .
You can see in the upper riques like his chromosome is destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be completely dry .
They can live under vacuum .
They &apos;re absolutely sure life exist in space , and you have to find new environments of water .
Actually , NASA showed that this is going .
This is a molecule picture that we &apos;ve built using these processes , just by using the yeast with the appropriate design of the segments that we &apos;ve built .
The yeah hit it it .
This image was not taken with an electronic microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It &apos;s a molecule that we can see it with a little microscope .
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the published that we &apos;ve done a little time ago .
They &apos;re more than 580,000 letters of gene code .
It &apos;s the largest molecule structure ever created by man .
It has a half a molecular weight of 300 million .
If we pass it with a carat of 10 without spaces , we would like 142 page only to translate this gene code .
Now , how do we work ? How can we do it ?
Of course , you get a virus is a game game .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria .
It &apos;s easier to do when it is eucarial cells like our : you can just get the nuclear and put another , which is basically the process of cloning .
In the archaea , the chromosome is , instead of integrated inside the cell , but we recently demonstrated that we &apos;re able to do a complete trapial trapial trapial trapial of a cell to another and to actively .
We can clean a chromosome from a micbial species .
The two are different than men .
We &apos;ve added a few gene in a way that we decide that to choose for this chromosome .
And then it skip with the enzyme as to kill all the protein .
And when we put it in the cell was rappping -- and you open our so-like graph -- the new chromosome is gone inside the cell .
And we were thinking that we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to try and get us out there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found out that tantissim has added a second or a third chromosome from some part , adding in a second thousands of new traits to that species .
So who think about evolution as one gene as only one gene to change is not really understood much of biology .
There are enzyme of the restriction that they actually digit the DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell , you didn &apos;t have one .
The cell phone -- the chromosome that we put it in it .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other chromosome as a material , and we found it with only require , and we found it with only cell and the new chromosome .
It became blue because of the genes that we put .
And in a brief lassand of time , all the characteristics of a species , based on the new software that we put into a new species , based on the new software that we put in the cell .
All the protein has changed , memories , members have changed , and when we read the gene code is exactly what we &apos;ve moved to .
Now , this may seem like genetics , but by allowing the software can change things in a pretty substantial way .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that it &apos;s not about genesis -- but progress from three million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosize process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty obvious when we think about our necessity .
We &apos;re going to go from six and a half billion people at the next 40 years .
Right for example , I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one in 1946 ; 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re having problems now find food , fresh water and clean , medicine and wellin for six and a half billion people .
It &apos;s going to be even more to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion coal coal , more than 30 billion coal balls .
That means 100 million barrels a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replace them , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to keep the whole CO2 emission from these materials that end up in the atmosphere .
At the day , thank you very science discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the design of the future .
The electronic industry has only one dozen about components , and think about how many different things are come out .
Our limits here is data principle from reality and from our imagination .
Now we have some techniques , thank these methods of synthesization , able to create what we call a combinatory genomics .
We can build a big robot that can produce a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think of the 20-year-old genes or to try to optimize the processing to produce or drugs , new vaccines , we can change , we can change , because of a small team , and create more molecular biology than in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemical production or chemical or fuel , production , vaccines .
This is an instantaneea of some software programmed that we &apos;re working on to be able to seat and design species to computers .
Well , we don &apos;t necessarily know how they &apos;re going to be .
We know exactly how their gene code .
We &apos;re focusing on the quarter generation of quarter generation .
You also saw you who extract etanol from the grain was a finil experiment .
We have depending on and third generation that are going to use enough to be soon by the sugar to be more high-fuel butanle , like they &apos;re or different butanle .
But the only way biology can have a big impact without increasing the cost of food and limited the cost of the available and limestone of them , and we &apos;re going to have the first amount of energy , and we &apos;re working out of the fourth generation in about 18 months .
The solar light combined with CO2 is a metodo--- but in our discoveries around the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It &apos;s going to be in the deep ocean , about 2,500 feet of the webollition of water .
They create metane from CO2 using molecular hydrogen by using molecular hydrogen .
We &apos;re trying to understand whether we can incanaling CO2 , which can easily be transported by tubes , convert that CO2 in coal , to drive this process .
So we might be able to increase what the basic question of what life is what life is , &quot; is we have the real goal of life is , we have the modest goal to replace the entire chemistry industry .
Right . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can &apos;t do it for TED ?
It would be a major source of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working on the same metods to create instantanei .
You saw this year with flu , we &apos;re always forth of a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s about the flu vaccine .
I think that you can change by making combinable vaccines in anticip .
This is how the future might start to look change , now , the tree of evolution , accellyating the evolution with synthetic bacteria , arches , archatheists , and finally cells .
We &apos;re so so much from improving people .
Our purpose is to make it a long enough way to try to do it . Thank you very much .
So , first of all I &apos;m going to show you , the most fundamental work , the new technology that we brought to the Microsoft in the purcheck to a bug quantuas a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s a environment where you can interact is at the local level that remode with a huge amount of visual data .
So we &apos;re seeing a lot of digital photographs with a kind of digital photographs with a kind of a very quick , for a panoramic , we have the images like we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much much the amount of information that we see , how big these data are collected of data or images .
Most of them are common photographs , but this for example is a resion of the Library of Congress , and reentry in the gamma gaps of Congress , and it comes into the gamma gapixel .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that limits the prestations of a system like this is the number of pocket on any moment . It &apos;s also a very flessible architecture .
This is a whole thing , example of data doesn &apos;t have images .
This is the Dickens &apos;s desolate of Dickens . Every colonna represents a check .
To show you that it &apos;s just about text and not of pictures , we can do something like that , to actually see what it &apos;s a real representation of the text , not of a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a little electronic book .
I don &apos;t advice it .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s a number of The Guardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a section .
And really gives you the pleasure and the good experience of read the real version of a meadow or of a daily meant , which is for a multiple kind of a kind of a half .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of The Guardian .
We &apos;ve created a high-resolution advertising -- much higher than what you use in a normal publishing content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see you see here .
Or other models , or even the specific models .
And this really really shows some of these ideas to get out of the space on the screen .
And we hope that this means to put people at the people and to other similar , not to be necessary .
Of course , the maps is one of the poorest applications for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say that we have a contribute to give you in this field .
These are all the roads in the United States overhead of a geospatial image of NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually from the wellow , you can go and see it .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynthrow , which fighting two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research that was very interesting by Noah Snavely , a student of Washington , with the University of Washington , with the help of Steve Seadroughs Szelch . A great collaboration .
And it &apos;s from the living on the Web , managed by Seadragon .
You can see that when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from one image and have this kind of experience to multiple and so that kind of experience .
But the space of images here is actually a meaning .
The algorithms of the computer have recorded these pictures together , so that they corresponding to the real places where the imagining -- all the next to the laws of the Montagne Roccient channel -- they were taken .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot of space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data set of Noah-up data set from a previous prototynthrow that we &apos;ve done for the first time the summer -- to show you what I think is really the key behind this technology , Photosynth technology , Photosynth technology , Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily evidence as much as we look at the environments that we have in the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of Nothree Dame cattle of Nothree Dame images taken from Flickr . Bauct Nothree Din Flickr and you get images of types in shirt , and you get images of these arancient , which is a picture that &apos;s discovery appeared to this model .
So , they &apos;re all pictures taken from Flickr and they were all connected to the space level of this way .
And it &apos;s possible to igate this very simple way .
You know , I would never think of fining working for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifying to receive this kind of threshold here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different kinds of photocaming : from those cell cell phone , and a significant number , a significant number , a significant number , a significant number , put together in this environment .
And if I can try and try and those more strange .
Many of them are blocks by the faces , etc .
Somewhere you have a series of photographs -- there .
This is a poster of Nothing Dame is recorded correctly .
We can go from the poster physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is taking data from the entire collective memory of how the entire collective memory appearing of how the earth , from visual standards -- and connecting all that data together .
All of those pictures are connected together , the greater of the sum of the parts .
You have a model of the entire land that emerges .
Think about this as a prolungation of Stephen Lawler &apos;s work on virtual Earth .
It &apos;s something that is increasing in complexity as people are using it , and the advantages to increase with the use .
Their photos are march with metaphor by other people .
If you have a idea of contrast all of these wisers , and I can use it as a picture of Nobody of a sudden , and I can use it as a snarrical ingress of all that data , and I can use it as a way of ingress , and and I can use those pictures of you have a social experience of like cross-mooth and having a social experience of like , and having a social experience of like ,
Of course , a result of this is virtual virtual models of all the interesting virtual models of every interesting part of the earth , and collect satellite images and from satellite images and similar , but from the collective memory .
Mille .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What your software is going to be that at a certain point , in the next few years , all the photographs of all the world will be done by anyone in the entire world will be practically connected ?
BAA : Yeah . What it &apos;s doing is actually about to discover .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the content of the images .
The thing is very interesting if you think about the wealth of seant information that a lot of these pictures have .
As you do a research of images on the Web , you get a sentence and the text on the page of the web has a lot of information about pictures .
Now , what happens if that picture is connecting to all your picture ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of wealth that comes out of it is really huge . It &apos;s a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure of the raildness when you travel and one of the forgotten the antic traditions , between the versus the antic traditions , between the wings , the husband , the touch in the wind , it is driven in the rain , the leaving of plants .
Basti Jaguit &apos;s the Jaguit still is more of the Via Lattea , or that the old old Inuit &apos;s still collights , or that in Himalayas , the budget , and the budgets of the most of the Dharm , to remember the central centering , and the idea that the central anthropology , and the idea that the world in which we have not solved in a sense , but it &apos;s just a reality ,
the result of a particular set of adaptative set of choices that our stirpe has done , well or bad , generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential strips .
We all have . All of the procrease .
We are subjects .
We have to deal with death , so we don &apos;t surprisingly surprisingly if we &apos;re going to sing and we &apos;re looking at --
We all have an art .
What it hits is the particular rhythm of the song , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that are the Penan of the Borneo , or the following the Voodoo of Haiti , or the desert of the Kaithord in Kenya , Curander in Kenya , Curander , or a cammelt in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my journey of journey in the desert a month , or a yak hallelter in the Korkma values in the Mest &apos;s valuable .
All of these populations teach us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And , if you think of a minute , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
Insibles , the miriades of cultures in the world create a spiritual life and cultural that happens to the planet and it &apos;s important for the planet , and it &apos;s important for the planet , as a nououousehold of notable .
And you can think about this cultural spider as a a ethnosphere and you can define the total of all concepts , or the total , of inspirational , ideas , inspirations , inspirational , by the human imagination of consciousness .
The etnosphere is the great painting of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be as as as a kind of inquisitive species .
And because biosphere was very very very very quickly consumed as it has been on the etnosh , and it much faster .
No biologist , for example , would say that 50 percent of all species is or about the horrid is about the horrid of the extinction simply because it &apos;s fake , or -- in the highest field of biological diversity -- and not close to the most optimistic -- that of cultural diversity .
The language of this is , of course , the language loss .
When you &apos;re born 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not composed by just by a vocabolarian or a series of grammers .
One language is the spraking of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle of the soul of every culture comes in the material world .
Every language is a forest of your mind , a kiss , a thought , a spiritual of spiritual possibility .
And of the 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re sitting in Monterey , at least half not being subsurred in the ears of the children .
They &apos;re not teaching children , which means , unless camp , unless they &apos;re camps that are already death .
What is more sad than the wiser of being flvolume , of being the last last to talk a language , the way to talk a language , the unway to transmit the wisdom of children ?
This is a little bit of somebody in the world in some of the world every two weeks . every two weeks , every two elderly a language , and brings to her last silly language .
And I know somebody of you will say , &quot; Isn &apos;t that better ?
The world would not be a better place if we &apos;re going to be a better place if we &apos;re going to talk about yoruba .
We talk about kogi .
You &apos;re going to have a trails of what it means you can &apos;t talk to their language .
I &apos;d like to make you a journey through the etnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a bit of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I say &quot; different ways of exist . &quot; I mean , &quot; I mean , really different ways of existing .
Let &apos;s take for example , Barasan Spanzon , in the Amazon in the Amazon , who credes in the mist of the west , which creds in the west of the west of the west of the west of the snarrow snarrow .
It &apos;s a people who can &apos;t have the blue blue color from green because the time it is identified in the forest , where the celests of the forest , where the people are going to be identified in the forest , which depends on the people .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rule , called &quot; exogamia language , &quot; exogamia language , &quot; You have to marry a person talking about a different language .
All of that has roots in the mitological past , though the particularly , in these families where they talk about six or seven languages because of matriribbbbbble-up , and no language .
They &apos;re really going to listen and they start talking about .
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I &apos;ve lived , the Waorans of the Ecuador , a incredible popular people that had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionar-missionar-and-m-made contact .
They &apos;ve done by sandwindow that react them in a shoulder , forest that this people who were going to be seen anything that they had never seen anything that had ever seen anything about dimensional .
They collected the picture from the earth , they &apos;ve been around on the search of a form or , and not find out , they have the five missionar-missionaries , and they killed the five missionaries with the lance .
But the Waorani don &apos;t kill only the foreign &apos;t kills .
They killed between them .
54 percent of the death was caused by their own .
We &apos;ve been risalites about eight generations and we found two natural death , and when we &apos;ve insisted to know , they admit that one of them was invecked , and then they killed him him .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine from 40 steps and recognizes species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned a really interesting job when my Harvard professor , asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti in the basic secret of Duvalier and the Tonton Macoutlets , and the Tonton Macoutes , and the Tonton Macoutlosing , and I &apos;m going to be a very interesting job of the poison .
For a sense of the miraculous , I should have to understand Voodoo culture , and the Voodoo is not magic .
It &apos;s pretty a metaphor of metaphor .
Very interesting .
If I asked you to tell me about the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christianity , Islam , Buddhism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has not religious faith . And instead , and the Voodoo is not religious distilled .
What makes the interesting thing that it &apos;s interesting is the relationship between life and death .
So the vives are going to be the spirits .
The spirits can be invocated by the Great Actually , they say the race of the dance and replace temporary replace in a way that for a brief active active active active folds .
For this voodooists like , &quot; Who you say , &quot; You &apos;re white you go to talk about God .
We give God .
And from the moment that you &apos;re going to be , how can you do it ?
So you see these incredible events : following the voodoo in state of trance that touch is a pretty strong demonstration of the power of mind on the body when it &apos;s catalyzed in a state of extremely layer .
In all the people that I have been living with the most extraordinary is Kogi Santa Marta Sevada Marta City , in Colombia security .
They had to be in the tyranged that once were living on the caraiban of Colombia in waiting for the conquire , the people would have to the volcanic massy that you would have to be on the volcanic massy that you would have to be on the carbaiban .
In a macaries of blood , this people have been conquised by the spage-and-shelf of blood .
But today , they &apos;re governmental governmental , but their formation is so extraordinary .
The young people are taken from families to three to three or four , and they live secregated in a world of good and shading in a world of good frozen frozen frozen pay-up .
Two periods of nine years choices of the nine months of the windmill that they spend in the mother of the user , now are metaphor in the user of the Grande Mother .
For this time , they &apos;re acculturated at the values of their society , values that are predicting their prayers and just their prayers and they just keep the cosmic balance .
And so the term of this incredible initiation , suddenly brought out and for the first time in life , at the age of 18 , they see an alb . And in that moment of awareness , when the sun kets the sun &apos;s valuable to the beautiful valley , what they &apos;ve learned in theory is all all that they have learned in theory in his own splendor .
&quot; Gist ? Right , how I said you .
It &apos;s amazing . It &apos;s now to you protect it . &quot;
They call them larger brothers and say that we , are the hair of the destruction of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about indigenous populations and the environment is the old story of the selling selling history of selling selling , which is a razy concept of it , or maybe invod Thoreau and we say that these people are closer to the Earth .
The Indies are not nor feelings of nor indebate .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the malarial paluds , or in the vents of the Tibet , but because of the time and the rhythththththanks , they created a mystical of the Earth &apos;s not aware of close to , but on a very well as a good thing , the Earth can be just because it &apos;s infused by human knowledge .
What does that mean ?
That a kid of Ande that a kid of Ande who is a flying out of the mountain is a very different spirit of the Apu that will be a very different human being deeply different , and it &apos;s going to have a very different eye with the mountain or that place that you can create a mountain is a masse of rock is a masse of rockets , and that a masse of rockets are ready .
which is the dimora of one or a mineral caught is irrelevant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that define the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia , believe that forests that they were going to be cut .
And that has made me a human being different from my friends Kwakiutl that believe that the forests are the dimora of Hukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukuk-initiation .
If you start to think that these cultures can create reality , different reality , you can start to understand some of them sensensors .
I &apos;ve taken this picture to open in the nin-West .
Maybe some of you have heard about the ayahuasca , the most powerful psychoactive ,
What makes the wanting of the ayahuasca is not the potential of the drug of the substance , but his elaboration . It &apos;s a two elements .
On one side , this lian leaving buttery that contains a series of Tioline , little and hardden , slightly hallucinogene .
And by trying to the only plant is a smoke that alter a little smoke , but it &apos;s mixed with the leaving of a caffected Psysychoptry .
This plant contains potent potent , very similar to the seriotonin , dithylyptamine .
If you ever see the Yanomami pulling up for the birthday , the essence that make from a different kind of species , it contains methyltrypppylyptamine .
Tiring that dust on the nose is a little bit like being shoot of a painting of barely barely barely and landing on a sea sea of electricity .
I often have to my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has written the pychedelivered , with his discovery of fungi hs in Mexico .
Secondly , I &apos;m going to be able to classify these tripps as hallucinogens because if you did not tell anybody of being hallucinated .
It &apos;s possible to be absus just if abunte with other chemicals that are denied MAO .
Now it is the beautiful : the coal Tioline that are injors of MAO , the same kind of necessary to potentially have the threatened . The question is surprising is .
We use the great eufemism of the proof of and the mistake , which can be infruttifer .
But if we ask Indians , they &apos;ll tell us , &quot; The plants talk about it . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Copan , has 17 variety of ayahuasca , who have nectly in the forest , and that at our eyes would reentrepreneurs in the same species .
If we ask them how they stopped their toxes will say , &quot; I was thinking about the plants , of the rest of the rest of you don &apos;t know it ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : they take 17 variety in a night of moon , and each night , and each one is going to be able to a different tone .
With that you don &apos;t graduate Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than counting the stami .
Now , &#91; , &#93; the problem is that also the ones of us that have at heart of us who have at heart , and in some way , and in some way , and it &apos;s in some way to reduce margins in the real world , and it &apos;s going to move .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it &apos;s not going to remember his or his technology innovations , but rather like the age that we &apos;re stopped and we abbrace and activity abbrace of biological diversity and cultural diversity and cultural district and cultural diversity of diversity and cultural diversity of the planet . Now the problem is .
All culculculculculcultures have been involved in a dance for new possibilities .
And the problem is not technology .
Indians Sioux have no smell of being Sioux when they put out of arco and frecovered as American didn &apos;t stop being American when they put on the horse and calculus .
It &apos;s not the change or the technology that threatening integrity of ethnosphere . It &apos;s power .
The hard hard hard to domination .
And if you give a look at the world , I &apos;m going to find that these are not cultures destined to disappear .
They &apos;re living creatures and spinting dynamics out of the forces of the forces of their adaptation .
It &apos;s a disboscampaign in the Penan --
a pet of Sarawak , in the southwest , a people who have lived in the forest the forest of a generation , and now reduced to the generation , and now reduced to the riditus , where you can see the river river river &apos;s troughts , where you can see the river of the Netherthertherthertherlands up with the world .
It &apos;s ready to fill the wooden with the soth of the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that have come with the discovery of gold .
If we &apos;re going to move on the mountains of the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you see the hard hard hard hard to see the political domination .
As you know the genocide , the extinction of a people , is convicted at the universal level , but the et-notion , the destruction of the life of a people , not just is constuted , but even celebrated in certain certain ambers , because it &apos;s part of the development strategy .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of the Tibet until the beginning .
I &apos;ve payed 6,000 miles from Chengdu in the West , coming in the West , coming in Lhasa with a young connection , but just came to Lhasa with a young man , but just came in Lhasn statistics that we feel talking about .
6,000 sacridice reduced in dust and centered .
1.2 million people killed from the military in the Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical at Panchen Lama .
The Chinese means that it was killed at the time of Chinese invasion .
His uncle fit with Sua Saint in the diaspora that led the people in Nepal .
His mother was imprisoned and his cold was being rich .
It was brought up to hidden at the age of two birth birth , because he couldn &apos;t have a living without him .
The sister , who did the same , was put in reduced camp .
One day , he was socking a hot band a cooled fashion by a bunch of Mao and , for this transgression , was put in the forced for seven years .
The pain of the Tibet can be insopposable , but the spirit of the people is tener .
At the end , it &apos;s all reduces a choice .
We want to live in the world monocromatatic world or we want to account the policy world , or we want to get the policy ?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he died said that his greatest fear was that , in our way to this amorage of the world , not only we &apos;re going to see the whole gamma of human imagination , but one day we &apos;re going to see the whole gamma of human imagination , but one day we &apos;ll see it up a sleeping sleep to the forget that there were other possibilities .
And it &apos;s about a humiliating that our species is exist for 60,000 years .
The Revolution evolution evolution , and we &apos;re talking about the agriculture , that has been done to us with the seed , by by by replacing the poetry of the socking with the next of the clapping , by the next of the claiming of the specization , and we &apos;re talking about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has 300 years old .
That shark story not suggests me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to address in millenennia .
When the world is asked what to be human , they &apos;re asked what to say to be human , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all reflights the chance of being what we &apos;re : a kind of a unaware species , that must be able species , that must be able species . And there &apos;s great moments of optimism .
I &apos;ve taken this picture on the north of the Baffin the end of Baffin , when I went to cover the cockrobing with the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , and the Olaya , and the Olaya , and the Olayer , and this man , Olayer , and this man , Olayer , and this man , Olaya , Olayer , and this man , Olayers , and this man , Olayer , and this man , Olaya man , Ol
The canads government has not been gentile with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to stabilize our supremate , we have them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refuted to go .
The family , theme for his life , he took them all the weapons , and all of his tooles .
You know , you know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t have the cold , they do it .
The pieces of the origin were made of fish flying in origin skin in skin .
The grandfather of this man didn &apos;t have intimidnight or the byle of the day-out of the night or the byle .
It &apos;s ungaught away , he &apos;s hotted the pantyplayers in your own hand . When I did it frozen in your hand . When I did it frozen , and working a lama .
He &apos;s sprouseholds on the punch of this cacy of this cat and when it became solid , he killed a dog .
He &apos;s got a bunch , and created a bright with the kill , with the kill of the toacy , has imbrired another dog and is disappeared on the banking , and it &apos;s disappeared on the banking , and it &apos;s window .
We want to talk about horse with nothing ? &#91; Risate &#93; And that , in different ways , &#91; Applausers &#93; is the symbol of the resilience of the Inuit and of all the Indies of the world .
In the open open , 1999 , the Canadian government reduced to Inuit the total control of a larger area of California and Texas them together .
It &apos;s their new pathria . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s an independent land . They &apos;re all the mineral resources .
One of the splendid example of how a nation-state can reconcilied with his people .
And , as I think it &apos;s pretty obvious , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious to the people in these remote areas of the planet , to realize they &apos;re not remote .
For somebody is home .
They represent the sections of human imagination that are rising at the time . And for us all of these kids , as the dreams of these kids , are part of the geography of hope .
So we &apos;re going to end , we have National Geographic , we are convinced that politicians will never come to anything .
We believe that polemics --
&#91; Applausers &#93; are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month our website has 35 million visit .
156 countries transmit .
Our magazines are lected by millions of people .
Our work is traveling in the etnosphere to bring our public in places in the etnosphere for our public places that they &apos;re going to be abblblbled and hopefully for time , abbraccers of existing in the way , and we have to find a life of existence , and we have a life of life in a pluralist world , and we have a liquid life in a world and puralist world and we have a world of life in a pluralist and pockets , and we have a world , and we have to find a life in a life in a life of life in a
where the wisdom of all the people can contribute to our collective wisdom .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope to say , &quot; I &apos;m going to talk about it , in case you don &apos;t notice them .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the offical dogma . &quot;
The dogma official thing ?
The dogma official of all the West industrial society . The dogma offical dogma officer , &quot; If we want to male the well-being of our citizens &quot; &quot; The way to do it is massive of the individual freedom . &quot;
The reason is , on one side , in fact that freedom is in itself , in fact , useful , and useful , for human beings .
On the other one of us , which if we are free , each of us can act to do everything that we have our well-being , without nobody who deciding in our well-being , without any one that decide in our .
The way to massive freedom is massive .
The more choices have , the more of people are free , and the greater freedom , and the greater freedom , is their well-being .
This , I think , it &apos;s so deeply roomed in society that nobody would dream to be going to be a doubt .
And it &apos;s also deeply rown in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you a few examples of what progress made possible .
That &apos;s my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m going to allow me a simple note about conditions .
In my supermarket is 175 conditions , without contact the 10 varieties of olive olive and 12 acets that you can buy a huge number of conducting , which you can buy for a huge conditions in the circumstance that one of the 175 already already .
This is the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic store to buy one stereo : cast , CD letter , radio , plastra , amplificer .
And in this single single electronics , there &apos;s a big number of audio components .
We can make six million different combinations using the components that there are in a only store .
You have to put that there is a lot of choice .
Other camps : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a kid , they could get all the desire for the mama and bakers , at the mama Bell .
They were noleggied the phone , you didn &apos;t buy it .
One of that , in the other , was that the phone was not going to break .
These days are gone .
Now we have a variety of phones , especially between cell phone .
So here &apos;s your cell phone .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , cuts , MP3 , cutting the bird crone .
If you don &apos;t see it still , you saw in the store under your home , you &apos;re very well looking at the time .
And what happens is that people come in in the store and ask that question . And what is the answer ? The answer is &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that it doesn &apos;t do too much .
So , in other ways of life that are much more important than the acquished , it turns out the same explosion of choices .
Assistence : it doesn &apos;t happen in the United States that you &apos;re going to be from the doctor and the doctor you know what you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; Okay , we could do it or B , &quot; &quot; A has these benefits , and these risks , &quot; Be &quot; Be , &quot; Be , &quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Dr. , what should I do I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; Well , it &apos;s got these benefits , and B has these benefits , and the risks . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebat , &quot; Dr. if she was me , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result we call it &quot; autonomy of the malatory , &quot; expression that it looks like a good thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not that you can move the weight and responsibility of making decisions from somebody knows something , which is the doctor , to somebody else else knows -- and almost certainly is sick -- and it &apos;s not in the ideal condition of making it decisions that is that it &apos;s not in the ideal condition to decisions that that is the patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing of products of pharmaceutical products , direct to people like me and you , which if you think of it doesn &apos;t make it .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why do they advertising them ?
The answer is that they want to ask them to ask them to ask them to change the receiving .
Something about that , as it &apos;s our identity is a question of choice , as you see in this vignity . &quot; We don &apos;t want to forcing kids . It &apos;s not going to be a identity : we don &apos;t want to get it .
And we can reinvent us how many times we &apos;re going to be .
The one that means that every morning , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I &apos;m going to put to the family and at the matriage , a time time , the perspective for anyone , was that we married the most preserved possible , and they started to make the most soon possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not when , and not what to do .
So , it &apos;s really really going to play .
I teach a very smart students , and I &apos;m going to be a lot of work than a time .
And not because they &apos;re not because they &apos;re not because they &apos;re less diligent .
But why are they imbilities , you know , &quot; Should I marry it or not ? Should I marry do it now ? &quot;
&quot; Should I marry up ? I have to think before kids or the career ? &quot;
They &apos;re logoring .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this implement not complete the homework that I teach and not get a great voice to my exam .
And they really have to do it . They &apos;re important questions .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , like Carl underneath , because the technology allows us to work every day , from every day , from every day , from every angle of the planet , except from the Hotel Randolph .
And in the parentesthids , and I &apos;m not saying to nobody , where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t say that , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , the incredible freedom of choice we have about the work ? It &apos;s that we have to continuously decide , if we have to work or not .
We can go and see our son play , with your mobile phone in a pocket , the Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the woves .
And even though they &apos;re spending , every minute that we see our son will rovine , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; I need to answer this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? I have to email this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is &quot; no , &quot; no , &quot; that makes the experience of your son very different than than what would have been in other conditions .
So , from any of the look , small things and big , things , life is a question of choices .
And once the world was this : That &apos;s one , in fact , there were some possibilities , but it wasn &apos;t a question of choice .
The world of today is what it is , &quot; Is it a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is . It &apos;s a lot of it .
So the positive laypositions we know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative .
All of this is that that is two negative effects of people .
The first , paradoxally , is that produced paralysis that produced paradoxygen .
With a lot of options between which choices , becomes very hard to do it .
I give you a significance example : one study of the volunteer of the volunteer .
A connecting to 2,000 different data of the Vanguard data , the gigantic company funding , with about a million clients in 2,000 different companies .
What she found out of every 10 solutions that are offer , the percentage of adhesione goes down to two percent .
With 50 offer source , there &apos;s 10 percent in less than adhesions when they &apos;re only five . Why ?
Because with 50 sources of which choices , is sick hard deciding , and the choice is reduced to indomans .
And tomorrow , and tomorrow , tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course tomorrow .
You know , you know , it doesn &apos;t just mean that these old work will keep food because they &apos;re not going to have enough money , it also wants to say that the decision is so unlikely that the complex source of work .
They &apos;re not going to be losing , they &apos;re losing to five dollars per year from the work , which would be well be well-going .
So the paralysis a consequence of the troppe .
And I think that makes the world .
&quot; And to end , for the eternity : ketchup , maionese send ? &quot;
Would you like to make the right decision , if it &apos;s for the eternity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong condition , and yet the wrong condition .
So that &apos;s the first effect . The second is that even though we can avoid the parallel and make a choice , at the end , we &apos;re less satisssatisssatisfaction of how we would have been with less options between which which .
And that for a different reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions between which choices , if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would have been going to be better . And what happens is that the alternative imaginative imagined us to hammed with the choice , and the reflection decrease , decrease the satidfation of decrease , by the decision ,
even when it was a good decision .
The more choices there are , the easier of any detail that is unsatisfaction of the option .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has clearly very well as it is as we value as we &apos;re going to things that we compare to .
On the rest , when there are a lot of possible options , it &apos;s easy to represent the alternative , that is that it &apos;s choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m sorry with all of the ones that are not New York .
But that &apos;s what you probably think .
There &apos;s this couple of the Hamptons .
A place of lice .
It &apos;s all for them . Otma day . It &apos;s all for them .
It doesn &apos;t miss anything . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , the daust , it &apos;s Agust . &quot;
&quot; All my neighbors in Manhattan are away . &quot;
&quot; I could talk about front of the home . &quot;
And it goes to two weeks from the idea that it &apos;s losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The costo-opportunity decrecrease the sodness for what we have , even when the choice was excellent .
And the more are the options that we have to look at , the more attractive attrahead .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
It &apos;s about the moment , and maybe of the living slowly .
But the most important point is that whatever you choose , you can &apos;t do the other .
The things that we don &apos;t choose have a lot of attractive attractive what we do .
Third point : the growing spiral of expectations .
I tried it to my skin buy a new pair of jeans .
I &apos;m just just just jeans .
Once jeans were just like , buy them and drinking out of the bestivan , they were uncomfortable , just after they took them a lot of times , they started going to do well .
So , I went to buy a couple of old new when those old were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cutting . &quot;
The bet said me , &quot; You want to slim slim , easy fit ? &quot;
You want to do it with the clothing ? &quot; Stonewashed , &quot; or &quot; acidle &quot; or &quot; acidnicle &quot; ?
&quot; You want to do it ? &quot;
&quot; You know , you want to do it lars , &quot; Continupright , &quot; Continupright to elencare .
I was swealth , and then I was able to say , &quot; I want the kind of -- that was the only guy , &quot; he was the only guy , &quot; he didn &apos;t have any idea of them were , and then I came out of the jeans , and then out of the jeans that I had ever had .
It was the very very much . With all that I had the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse is that with all of that my choice was altissim , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was minimum of the very minimum . I was not expected when there was a kind of time , but when I saw 100 different steps , like , at least a kind of thing that was going to be perfect .
What I had been buying was good , but not perfect .
After I compared to that I was very unsatisssatisfaction .
The adding options in life of people don &apos;t do that increasing the expectations that these have respect to the excellence of the same options .
And that will produce less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing if it makes it account .
Because if they knew , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more about this .
&quot; It was better when it was worse , &quot; The reason it was better when it was worse was that when you was worse was still possible to meet pleasant surprises .
So , in the world where we live in -- opulent , industrialized citizens with the expectancy -- the most we can hope is that things are at the altitude of expectations .
You never surprised to be surprised because your expectations , my expectations , are ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Besespan &quot; Yes , you want . &quot;
I mean , small authographical moment -- that I really &apos;m married and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t have it .
But , it &apos;s not a good thing .
And finally , a result of the buying a couple of jeans is when there &apos;s just the kind of jeans is that when you &apos;re not sodness , and you ask you , &quot; Why ? &quot;
Who is responsible ? &quot; The answer is clearly .
The world is responsible . What would I do you do ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of jeans , and buy a ununsatisfaction , and you ask you who is responsible , it &apos;s just a clear clear clear clear that the responsible you &apos;re .
You could have done better .
With hundreds of varieties , there are no excuses .
So when people make decisions , even though the result is valid , they feel unsatisfaction and they give it the cold to their own .
In the last years , depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only , but important -- of this waving waving is just that people have deludent experiences because the standard are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think they think it &apos;s their .
So the end result is that we &apos;re better , we &apos;re better , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely fake .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than a lot of choice , but from that it doesn &apos;t have a lot of choice .
There &apos;s a critical value . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m pretty safe we &apos;ve overcome from a piece of level where the level of the level of the level that we have been overwhelming .
Now , from the political point of view -- I almost finished -- from the political point of view , the peanch is the following .
What allows all this choice in industrial society is the wealth .
There are lots of places in the world , and you know about it , where the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too bad .
So the faccenda I &apos;m talking about is a sick of modern , reaunting Western society .
And what it does depressing and angry is this : Steve Levitt talked about yesterday of how those expensive and uncomfortable seat at the time . It &apos;s a money push of money .
I mean , these choices , complicated and dispendiy , it &apos;s not that they &apos;re just useful .
I &apos;m really deleterie .
They &apos;re doing worse .
If a little bit of what we have in our society allows to be reversed in those where people have too too much chance , it &apos;s not just their life to improve but our .
That &apos;s what economists call a improvement of a relief .
A redistribution of income redistribution is good for everyone -- not just to the poor -- because of this choice in the case that it comes to us .
To conclude , &quot; You can get everything you want &quot; --
You , people of culture , you think , &quot; What does that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t do anything in a shocy of glass . &quot;
&quot; A covered imagination , a limited view of the world --
and I &apos;m going to interpret .
But then thinking about it , instead , I realized that that that fish the long knows the long knows .
Because the reality is that if you &apos;re missing in frantumes the bock , so that it &apos;s possible , &quot; You don &apos;t get freedom .
If you break the bock in a way that it &apos;s all possible to decrease soddisfation .
You get the paralysis , and you reduce the well-being .
They all need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too strange , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of some symbolic sphere is a recipe for inhappiness and , I &apos;m going to the rovine .
Thank you very much .
