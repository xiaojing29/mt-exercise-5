So last year I showed these two two two two two two million years of the U.S. , which is that for almost three million years of the United States , that &apos;s going to be the size of 48 , you &apos;ve got the size of the 48 percent .
But that &apos;s the very very far as the gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t exextra the ice .
The calculate glacial glacial , is in a sense , the heart of the global global system .
You &apos;ve got to inversus and you get to the summer .
The next slide is a remarkable reduced to be a reduced reduced by the last 25 years .
The glaciers are signed in the red .
And as you see , you go to the blue sweak .
That &apos;s the ice in inversus , which you get to the summer .
You can see that the constantly ice , five years or five years or more , is like the blood , that &apos;s like the blood , that &apos;s going to be exextra from the body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been from so ,
This is a problem because the warming rewarming the land of the raising land where there are huge amount of coal , where there are huge amount of coal , they &apos;re going to be transformed in meters .
I &apos;m going to be going to be rewarming from the global warming , that may be doubling , that that may be doubling , to this point of not around .
In some lagues in Alaska meter of the meters are already rebolling from water .
The professordered Katey Walter Walter , Alaska , and it &apos;s recated with a team ,
Video : Wow ! Gore : Lore is good . The question is if we &apos;re going to be that .
A reason that &apos;s that this scary scary , the Groroenland from the northerthereeeem .
This is a bull of the regime .
The took never reached the brains .
This is the Kangerluseful , in the southern of the Groenlandia of the Groenlandia .
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea for the sea line , you &apos;re here is where the sea sea sea .
These are increases increases .
On the other part of the planet : Antice , the greater than the ice of the planet .
And last month , the scientists have been diounded that the ice is in the negative ice is in negative , and the Anycle of the Western , which pogen on some izero-bank , it &apos;s particularly remarkable .
Equival six feet of the actual level of the actual , like in Groenlandia .
Sulla Himalaya , the third largest block of ice , you see new laghi , which few years ago , you see new laghi .
40 percent of the world has rereduced by the water .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the water .
The took it is increased .
But when it &apos;s when it &apos;s the same accounts to water .
In California , the neve the Sierra Nevada is remains of 40 percent .
The sticks are in the crisis .
The previsions , as you &apos;ve got a lot of them .
The growing growing in the world door to a remarkmarkable remarkable .
The disasers are increasing a ritual of the normal and not the real one of the normal and without the previous .
Four times more more than the last 30 years that I &apos;ve been going to 75 .
This is a and-and-and-and-and--and-up .
If you look at the the substitute , you can see the consequences .
We &apos;ve got 70 million tons of the last five tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the time , you look at the Pacific , from the Americans , from the subcontinent , and on both both both of the subcontinent , where there is a radical adical treme of oxygen in the ocean .
The greater because of global warming , together to deforestation , which is the 20 percent , is the use of combustible ,
The oil is a problem , and the coal is even worse .
The United States are one of the most emissions , together to China .
And it was proponed to build a lot of other central central .
But we &apos;re seeing a change of the direction .
These are the projects announced in the last years and some of alternative alternative .
And every way , there &apos;s a political political in our country .
The industrial and industrial is the oil and the industrial has speso 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the coal , which is a symsymptomorrow .
And that picture I remember that I would remember something --
I know , Natal in the Tennesis , where there &apos;s been a 3.8 billion liers of 3.8 billion liers of coal ,
Maybe you &apos;ve seen that on the news .
This is the second big fusually flow in America .
It &apos;s success around Natal .
The public advertising of the industrial industriand clearly .
Video : You &apos;re going to have a kind of alleo is a kind of alleo and happy .
It &apos;s ababundant here in America , and it &apos;s going to grow our economy .
It &apos;s a lot more connected .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and the work work work work .
Al Gore : The here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The largest society is Massey on the mountains is Massey . This is his own .
Video : Mr. Blankenship : I &apos;m going to be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelostiy -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for Prottion of Clim has launched two campage .
This is a part of them , a part .
Video : The ALergy : ALergy , we see the climate change change .
So , this is our priority is to invest a big amount of money in a forth to make advertical and confused the truth of the oil .
In fact , the coal is not to the sweak .
We think it &apos;s a good profumb -- it &apos;s also a good profumb .
So , you don &apos;t preprese of climate change .
Let me do it to us .
Video : The Attore : Carbone , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
So , let &apos;s go out in a structure in a structure in the same same as it is a foot .
Straordinarily ! Sweeply , but that &apos;s the sound of the technology of the technology of the fuels .
The consumption is between the main cause of the global warming , but the remarkable technology , but the remarkable technology of the coal remarkable technology , but the remarkable technology , but the remarkable technology , but the remarkable technology , but the remarkable technology , but the remarkable technology of the global warming , but the remarkable
You see a look at : this is the odiern technology of the coal .
Al Gore : Indeeply , the alternative of the economic expensive , and that of the economic security .
Video : The government is in the crime , the government , the nation-scale , the climate crisis .
The philililillion , our dependence from the combustible , as the coal repensive , and the oil importantly imported .
Now , there &apos;s a new audace solution to use for used to use .
Rey America : 100 percent of energy , in a 10 years .
A plan for the America , to make us more sure , and make more sure , and help stop the global warming .
And so , a solution that basts to solve our problems .
It &apos;s going to be more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Simimimimplant energy to America .
One of the most of the faster ways of the dependence from the combustible that kills our planet .
SSSee : The future is here . I feel , a new energy .
Commmmmims for places to work , for places to work ,
So , I mean , it &apos;s time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old old man says , &quot; If you want to go to the speed , you go to the speed .
If you want to go back , you go together . &quot;
We need to go back , quickly .
Thank you very much .
So , last year at TED I &apos;ve got a introduction on the LHC .
And promise to go back to the back to the back to the car on how it works .
So , I &apos;m going to be . And for the other time , there were no , the LHC is the greater experiment ever attacked -- 27 kilomers of circrisis .
his task is to rereach the conditions that were less than a billion times in the beginning of the universe , until we &apos;re going to 600 million times in the beginning of the universe -- until we &apos;re going to be at 600 million times in the second .
All that &apos;s just environmental .
This is the car under Ginevra .
So , I &apos;ve got these mini-Big Bang in the reducers .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- is a 44 feet and has a diameter of 22 feet .
This is a picture of ATLAS in AS in building so you can see the proportions .
The 10 section of the last year we &apos;ve got the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was because of immense of the control .
It &apos;s an image of the first fashion particles that had done all the around the LHC , and in the LHC , and deliberately , with a part of the HC , and spread particles in the website .
In other words , when we see that picture the 10 secember , what the car worked , the car worked , the which is a great vitty .
I don &apos;t know if this is to do that , and then somebody went to Google and see that when somebody went on Google and I saw that the page was this .
That means that we &apos;ve had a cultural impact on the scientific scientific .
It &apos;s a week after , it was a problem with the car , had to this machine , had to these films .
These films take 13,000 ampampampate when the car works works in the car works .
Now , the technical technical of you look at the philes and say , &quot; it &apos;s not true . &quot;
And instead can do that because when they &apos;re very cold to become the constantly the superconditions .
So , less 271 degree temperature in the temperature , in the stars , these films can bring that through the space between stars , these films can bring that the cross .
In one of the giunture between the most novememempt in the LHC , there was a difer of the willing .
So the films will survive a little bit of the foot , and 13,000 ampampamping .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think that these magnenearly 20 tons , and that they &apos;re moving about 30 centimeters , and that they &apos;re moving about 30 feet .
They &apos;re damage about 50 magnetworks .
We had to task them , what we did .
We &apos;ve got repristined and rerererereed .
Now they &apos;re going to go back to their place .
The end of the LHC will will be new integrity .
We &apos;re going to go , and we expect to juice or the loss , and continue so our own , and we &apos;ll continue so our extreme that they are the morning that they are the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents reducing the value of science and engineering and engineering and engineering matter . It &apos;s easy to consequences .
I think that the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s the value of the things like LHC .
I &apos;d like to conclude with the words of a scientist Inglese , Humphrey , which I think , in the difense of his own own own own own own , his himself , his puppppppage , his puppppppppping is dangerous for the human mind , which is not dangerous for the human human human mind .
Thank you .
I want to start asking the obvious of repressive when you go to the kids , you get to the morning .
While you can see them and make them , and it turns them , and you learn them , and you learn , and we can see them , and to make it and remarkable to be able to think and to make them to think and can be able to be able to think and to make them , and they &apos;re going to make them , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
The whole thing is , it &apos;s deeply connected to the way we understand the world around us .
So , by the inspired inspired by useful our interaction with objects , together , and I &apos;m in my Pts and my collaborator , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to ask , &quot; and if we use a computer , instead of the only one computer , you can have the computer to have the digital of the roller , and we can move the same same .
and it &apos;s going to do it ?
The question was so interesting that I decided to explore the answer , building the answer , building the Sifaily .
In a few words , a Sifairly computer interactive as a big computer interactive as a biscape .
In a few words , a Sifairly computer interactive as a big computer interactive as a biscape .
You can move with the hand , they can see , &quot; you see , &quot; in their own , you hear the right and they have a radio wireless .
But , the most of the physical objects , as the morning , you can move from the southern , you can move .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem for manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physicists , conconfigures , the other , the other , and the hand that they become more physicists , and they make more physical , the other of the other , of the other , as we can explore new and fun of interaction .
I &apos;m going to try to be a few example .
This Siftable is configurated to show the video : if you get it in a direction , the video roting that , if you get it , if you get it out of the other toral hetch back .
These remarkets are consequences of the other .
If they affiank , they &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re around .
If they &apos;re going to be reduced , you can act a little bit .
If they &apos;re going to be reduced , you can act a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
And then we realized that one of the interesting interesting implications of the interaction was that we can use the data , to example , &quot; a color as if it was a color as if it was a liququid .
In this case , we have three Sifrestaurate as a shirrrrich and I can use them to get it to the color in the central color , where they &apos;re going to be .
and I can use them to put them for the color in the central , where they &apos;re going to be .
If we &apos;re too , we can get a little bit of place .
I &apos;m also going to be a kind of apprecise , as the mathematand the mathematand games where people can try to try to try things , and see the same thing , and see the most immediately .
Now , I &apos;m --
This is a sequence of Fibonacks that I do with a program .
Here we have a game of words that is half between Scarabeabum and Boggle .
It &apos;s a rich one of the rich , you &apos;re going to be in every Siflow , Princically , to every single one of the rich case on the Siftable , and as as you &apos;re trying to do this on a dididitionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new set of the way , and you have a new new possibility to try and new possibility to try to be .
Thank you .
There &apos;s the children came in in the Media Lab , I did in a way that I &apos;ve got a video .
They were very much .
And one of the interesting things that is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instruments .
You just say , &quot; Compons of words , &quot; and they know what to do .
There &apos;s other people who try it .
This is our own own own own newearer , there &apos;s the right .
In fact , it was just implease .
They just just cles , for him .
Now , this is an actual acactual of a carrrupon .
We wanted to build a tool for the apepreneeived . He &apos;s Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , solving the Sifairly .
It can put new characters in the scene , solving the Sifairly .
Here &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : The sun sun .
David Merrill : Now he took a treat in the scene .
Video : The treatment .
Bel work ! You &apos;re !
So , you can see the Sifaily , and you can make the neighborhood .
Video : Bau !
-- when they &apos;re inventing their story .
Video : Have !
DM : It &apos;s a story with final final , and it can decide him as it goes to the him .
DM : It &apos;s a story with final final , and it can decide him as it goes to the him .
Video : Vice ice , gat .
DM : The last example that I &apos;ve got to show you a tool , make a tool , and I do to take music .
It &apos;s a tool , it &apos;s made of the recent and exact music .
The Siflow here here agreed by the bottom and the bacteria .
And you have one of these four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also put these sounds on a sequence of a sequence to your own pleasure .
And it just just doing it a &quot; sound and a sequence . &quot; And a &quot; and a sequence . &quot;
These are actually that you can control from the vivious and the phililillion .
The acks to a particular sound and then the incline for rereduced .
And then there are actually general as time and fly , and you want to the whole sequence .
Let &apos;s look like that .
Video : DM : We &apos;ll give a basic basic line in two Sifairly , &quot; we put it into a series , the way , we put it into a series , and we put another number .
Now , I &apos;m going to put a line .
Video : DM : Now , I &apos;m going to give the perception --
Video : DM : And now I &apos;ll put the phililildren , so I can control the effect from the vivist .
Video : DM : I can &apos;t do it the whole sequence of the whole sequence , and then from one side or the other .
Video : DM : And now I &apos;m going to add the bottom to the bottom for the top to give more expression .
Video : DM : I can rererich the sequence of the sequence . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to be planning , but I can sudden , make it more , and it &apos;s more ,
And now , I can actually smoking the whole sequence of the whole sequence in the left the Sifairly . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new interests that is a new interinterests .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the reduced that , and also some chance that we &apos;re going to bring out from the lab .
The concept I want to put you to get this new generation of objects that we &apos;re going to make the digital media , which will will be information in our world .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the now of all of you .
I &apos;m a scape .
I &apos;m going to talk about this , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the fashion of my life .
And I don &apos;t know what it can change .
But , he said , something that happened in my life and in my life and in my life , and I &apos;m going to reach the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I &apos;ve got this book , this book called &quot; Manate , Prua , Prua , Am , Am , Am , &quot; which , diversously , for some reason , and I &apos;m going to have a great sensational sensational , the interinterational , the interational interational .
And the result is that that you &apos;re going to be now , people me just like if I was being being being being being .
It &apos;s true -- he &apos;s been a little bit .
They &apos;re going to be worried and say , &quot; You don &apos;t have the fourth of them , and they &apos;re going to do better ?
You have no painting to write for all life without that we can &apos;t be able to create a book that can importantly to somebody ? &quot;
that can matter to somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s roughly , you know .
But it may go worse , I remember that I remember that I &apos;m going to say that I &apos;m going to say to people -- I was a rice -- I was a rrice -- I was a rrice .
I was going to put it on the same remarkable .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t that the people would you have success ?
You have no painting that the ugal refed you ?
You have no painting to do this to the whole life without nothing that happened to be nothing to get out and dead on a cumbumb , and to die on a cumbing the byze of the failure ? &quot;
You know .
The answer -- the answer -- the next answer to all these questions is : &quot; Yeah . &quot;
You know , I &apos;ve got this thing .
I &apos;ve always had the painting .
And I also have a lot of other things that people can &apos;t not be to be to to .
And as the allows and other things .
But , as I &apos;m going to write what I thought and ask me , and I ask ask that ?
Is it it ?
It &apos;s logic that everybody &apos;s going to be spacy from a work that you &apos;ve been born to do .
But what &apos;s that that &apos;s that particular in the immouth of the health mental health mental , as a way that other carvoses do it ?
And my father , for example , he was a chemical engineering and I don &apos;t remember one one time in its 40 years of activity that I asked if they were asked if they were asked if they were asked if they were to be engineering ?
It was never -- that that stuck of the engineer , how do you do ?
It &apos;s not working so , you know ?
Onestly , engineers like a group , as a group don &apos;t , in the sects , the instruments of being alcolized alcold ,
We have enough to be a lot of this reputation , and not just a creativity , but creativity of all , we have this reputation of being huge instant .
And it &apos;s not going to look at the tristes or of the dead of the magnifits that , only in the 21st century , they &apos;re going to be young and often often often often often often .
And the ones that they don &apos;t have to be really really disappeared by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before he &apos;s dead , in the last interview said , &quot; Every little little more , &quot; A little more , a little more more . &quot; A extraordinary amazing .
But we don &apos;t get the foot when we feel that because we &apos;ve heard these things , we &apos;ve been totally interized and accepted the noon that that creativity and accounts are in some way of the way , the art , the end , the end , the end , the end , the end , the end .
And the question I want to take all here here is : you do you do with this idea ?
You &apos;re good that -- because it &apos;s also looking at a centimeter of a centimeter of me , not good for nothing that .
I think it &apos;s a great .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous and I don &apos;t want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better encourage our great creative creative creative .
And I know that , in my case -- in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to that I &apos;m going to be very dangerous , especially you , the rololl the circumstumstances in my carer .
I &apos;m true -- you look at , I &apos;m pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I &apos;ve still about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that I &apos;m going to be judicted from the world as the work that he went after the world , as I &apos;ve got it after it &apos;s going to be right after I &apos;m going to do this last book .
I &apos;m going to be on , because we all more or less you -- it &apos;s likely that my greater success is to my spread .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thought that it &apos;s a person to start to get in the nine , and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would say , I would continue to do this work that we do this work .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so I &apos;m going to be , after many of a lot of work to work to go to write is what to create a psychological psychological psychological psychological , right ?
I had to some extend to be a distance of security between me , and I &apos;m writer , and my natural thing that I could get to get it , and I tried to all over the last year of how to do that I started to look at the time , trying to see if they could have the best ideas and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and the other other other things .
on how to help people people who are emotional to the emotional you to be creative .
And that research has been taken to the Great and the Rome .
I do do this because I go back and then back back .
Nelil ancient Great and Rome -- people don &apos;t seem to believe that creativity came out that creativity came out of men , OK ?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit , and they &apos;re going to be divine and that came out of a few and unknown , for reasons and unknown , for reasons and unknown .
The great-called these divins , you see the bees of creativity &quot;
Soccurred , he created a demon a deaded demic that ells a deeating rolder .
The Romans were the same idea , but they called that kind of spirit , but they were called that a genium .
The thing is , because the Romans didn &apos;t think that a genium was that a genize that a genize .
They believe that a genium was this kind of entity of a divin that literally literally in the murs of a little neighbors , a little bit like , a little bit like the willing , and that &apos;s going to be able to get the way to be able to the way to get the result of that work .
Here &apos;s the basic distance of the way that I think -- that &apos;s the psychological psychological that are psychological that are going to be able to your work .
And all they knew that was so that it worked , right ?
So , the artists were protected by certain things , like for example , like , as for example , not ?
If your work was excited to be able to get and all the merge , all they were helped by this genium , all they had to help .
If your work , it &apos;s not all your own work , it was not all your right ?
Everybody had knew that was your genium to be a incapace .
And so the people han concept of creativity in the West for a long time .
And then the Rinssand all all , and it &apos;s going to change the whole whole idea ; we put the human human universe in the universe , and the mysters and not left space to the crecreates that they were writing from the divinity .
This was the principle of humanity and people started thinking that creativity came to think that creativity came out of the creativity came out of the willing .
And for the first time in history , you know , you know , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m like a genium that is a very very much than a person with genium .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think that I &apos;m going to make somebody , a simple person to create like a recipient , the essentially , the essentially , the essentially , the essentially , creativity , unknown and unknown , unknown and etern , unknown and eterern to the fragile the human .
It &apos;s how to ask someone of instruments .
It &apos;s really , it &apos;s completely the ego and creates all these ingexexexist on the performance .
And I think it &apos;s been this pressure to destroyed the artists in the 500 years .
And if that &apos;s true , and I think it &apos;s , and I think it &apos;s the question , and now ?
Can we do it diversity ?
And I &apos;m going to go to a more antic understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can &apos;t use 500 years of thinking in a speaker .
And there &apos;s probably people between the public public that would be legittily , you do , you do , you do , you do , you do , you do , you do , you do that they &apos;re going to get the whole thing .
I &apos;m not going to tell you all about this thing .
But the question I want to take is -- why that &apos;s not ?
Why don &apos;t you think about this way ?
Because it has more sense of all of the other thing that has ever heard to explore the exact of the creative process .
A process that , as anyone who has ever tried to do something -- so , basically , it &apos;s not going to be , you don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t , you don &apos;t don &apos;t understand .
And , in fact , it can sometimes seem to be very bad .
I did this instrument with the extraordinary poetc Ruth Stone , which has 90 years , but that &apos;s been a few years , but that was a few years , and he said that during his infas in the surginia , working in the camps , and then in the way , in the way , and then then then in the front of the time .
He said that it was like a fragorous fragorous .
And that was going to take it to her shesesay .
I feel it &apos;s going to be , because it was very , because it was to the land under his feet .
He knew that I had to have a only thing to do that point and said , &quot; to the words , &quot; you get like a math . &quot;
And it &apos;s going to go to the house and it was just just just that little bit of this poetry , and it would not take a piece of paper and a piece of paper and a math , and it &apos;s going to get the page , and it &apos;s the page , and it &apos;s the page , and it would have to get the page .
Also three times , you couldn &apos;t be enough , so you can reduce , and the correct and the correcent and the poetry and the poetry and the poetry and the soud would continued to the roled through the landscape , trying to be a few few . &quot;
And then there were those times -- this piece of time , I &apos;m going to -- there were the moments that was almost lost , right ?
So , he was going to go home and the poetry and the poetry and the poetry and the poeer in the while that was going , and then he said , that he was like , and then he said , which was like , and then he was the office .
And it was the poetry from the cocoat and the body and the transcated the body and the transcated the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be on the perfect and the contrary , but at the last word to the last word .
So when I felt that -- it &apos;s just pathesk , it &apos;s exactly exactly the ugual process .
Not all my creative process -- they &apos;re not a conducucucucture .
I &apos;m a die , and my way of work is ; I &apos;m going to go to the same ororarily , and I &apos;ll give them up and go to work and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go down to the same .
But even I have , in my testestyaggine , I &apos;ve got to do it against that thing , sometimes .
And I think that &apos;s also a lot of you ,
You know , even though the work and the ideas came out of a certain source of them , I can &apos;t know that .
And what is that ?
And how can we relational to get the head , but , rather , but , rather , rather , that you &apos;re going to get the head ?
So , as I &apos;m going to be the best example that I have the musician that I &apos;ve been interviewed that I &apos;ve interviewed that I &apos;ve been working for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the most of life is the instruments of the neighborhood is reduced , trying to control , trying to control , to try to control , to the southern these species of observed , and you know , Tom , and you know , Tom , and you know , &quot; I &apos;m going to make you , and you know , Tom , and you know , we know , Tom , &quot;
But then I &apos;m going to do , and then I was going to go on a Los Angeles , and then he &apos;s going to change all for him .
He was going to be very quickly and all of a tract this little frame of melodia , which comes into his head , and it &apos;s going to be inspiration , and the wants , and the fold , and the wants , and the desiddly , but it &apos;s not like to get the .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , it &apos;s not a math , it &apos;s not a recorder .
So I started to hear this kind of old , you &apos;re going to be going to be in him , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to get to the wearing , and I &apos;m going to hear that .
I &apos;m not good enough , and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to go into the panic , they &apos;re going to stop .
He &apos;s going to put the whole whole process and made something completely new .
I just just just the sky and said , &quot; I &apos;m not going to see that I &apos;m going to drive ? &quot;
&quot; Ti seems to write a song now ?
If you really want to be a little more more more than one when I can get to care of you .
Altreme , you &apos;re going to importantly , you know ,
I &apos;m going to disturbing Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his process that &apos;s working after this .
Not the work , the work was still hoscope as always .
But the process , and the fish , and the fish , and the fish was that had been reduced when the genium , the genium that &apos;s going to be a little bit of the other that problems and they went back to the back to where they were going to be a thing that they were going to be a very interested in the thing that they were going to be a horized thing that they &apos;re going to be a little thing that &apos;s going to be the waving that that was that they &apos;re going to be rererere
but that &apos;s not Tom . This is amazing bizzzarre a conversation between Tom and that that &apos;s what the straightle that but it was not Tom .
So how the story that I felt that story to change a little bit , even the way I work and already &apos;ve already saved me a time .
This idea , I &apos;ve saved when I was writing , Prua , Prua , Prua , and I foot in a cave of the disperation of the disperation of the disperation of the disperation , the one that &apos;s going to think that &apos;s the workill .
Not just good , just the worst book .
And I started thinking about this project .
But then I remember I was Tom that I started to Tom that I &apos;m going to go .
So I &apos;ve got my face on the manoseeum and reremains my comments to a place of the room .
And I said to high , &quot; Sents , what , they know , what if this book is not going to be going to be not not interly .
Because I &apos;m going to see that I &apos;m not going to do that , I don &apos;t have this .
So if you want to be better , you have to have to be better , and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know , you know , I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m not .
I &apos;m going to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I want to please that it was that I &apos;ve been to do my part , &quot; because -- it &apos;s so , OK -- I &apos;m going to do my own own , OK -- I &apos;m going to do the willed to the dance of the North , and the laundance of a dance , and the launched to the lab and and the launched to the lab .
And they were always magnifflow , because the ballerers were professionists and they were fantastic .
But every time , a lot of something happened , and one of these artists was actually transcitional artists was actually transcitional .
And I know what you know , because I know , because I know that you &apos;ve all seen , a sense , a performance .
It was like the time , and the ballerin the way , and the ballerine , and it wasn &apos;t doing anything else from the usually , as 1,000 notice before , but all you &apos;ve been working on .
And the sudden that &apos;s not just as a human human .
But it &apos;s accounted from the willuminate in the fire of the divinity .
And when this happened , I was the time , people know what was , the people knew what was , they called his name with his name .
They said , &quot; Sygold , &quot; Allah , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , God , &quot; God , God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curious notice -- when the MMMMMMr. invaser , I was this above this , I was this above with their and the ready to change in the souseats from &quot; Allah , Allah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ole , &quot; I &apos;m , &quot;
In Sna , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , &quot; Allah , I &apos;m going to do , &quot; uncomcomfortable , &quot; &quot; unlikely , &quot; unless , I &apos;m going to be a foot of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need .
But the problem comes the day after , for the sallerin the same , when you see the 11 and find that are the 11 of Martedday , and I &apos;m going to go to God not there is no longer .
It &apos;s just a dead dead dead with ginockey to the ginockey , and maybe you can &apos;t be more to each other to that alteze .
And maybe nobody will be the name of God still , and what &apos;s going to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most payer to make in a creative life .
But maybe it &apos;s not to be so angosciant if you can &apos;t believe , the first expecting , which the most extraordinary expected to be from you .
But I just believe that you &apos;re data in presents that you &apos;re data in a remarkable initiable to your life that you have to get something else when you end up .
And , you know , if we think about this way .
And so I started think , and it &apos;s just as I thought , and it &apos;s just like I thought about about the public work that I &apos;m going to do , the dangerous dangous , the dangerous danger , and I &apos;m going to do this .
And what I have to go to tell me when I I feel that I feel that is , not having it .
Not the reach . It &apos;s just your work .
You &apos;re going to show you for your part , any can be .
If your work is balling , you go to the balling .
If the divine , you &apos;re genium to you get out of a wonderful time , to give you some wonderful of this wonderful , for a little time through the forces , then &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Altreme , you do the same .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot; &quot;
I think and I think it &apos;s going to teach it .
&quot; Ole ! &quot; I &apos;m going to give you the same for the human love and testygine ttals from you to reach .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
And as I &apos;ve already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what it can significant and discovery of new genome .
We &apos;re going to start a new perspective , we started to digital biology and now now now to digital code , we &apos;re going to get into a new phase of biology , designing and synthesize life .
We always tried to take big questions .
&quot; What is the life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that we think they have to try to understand the vararts .
We &apos;ve tried different different , reduced , and we &apos;ve got a minimi .
We &apos;re digalizing by almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was to the genome of the biology of biology in the digital world .
Now , let &apos;s ask , we can regenerate life , or to create a new life of this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycopycopy , which is the species from genome , which is the species from the little little little little bit of those that can be able to the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to reduce a genome to create a little little more .
We are able to eliminary a hundred genes of about 500 than the 500 than the 500 that are here .
But when we look at its map of the map metabolic map , it &apos;s very simple than our .
It credeeply , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can get to , one one one , it &apos;s very imlikely that that can bring a living cell cell cell .
So I decided that the only reduced to reduce this cromosome is to make this cromosome to change the components to change the components to get to the components to get some of these questions .
And so we started the romosome , &quot; can we synthesize a cromosome ? &quot;
Can you have the chemical chemical chemical chemical chemical that are never able to create before ?
And , in case , we can make a cromosome to work a cromosome ?
A cromosome is just a piece of chemical material .
The speed that we can be able to digitize life is growing to the reach of the exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , that &apos;s represent , but it &apos;s going to be able .
And our more recent reduced the rich rich rich .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process has required to a lot of required , and then then , the first experiments .
But we found that synthesize of DNA is very difficult .
There are dedeeps of the machines are , and they make small segment , the long bounding of 30 to 50 to 50 to the world , the most errors are .
So we &apos;ve got to develop a new way to assembling these framments and correct the mistake .
And that &apos;s our first attempt , to start with digital information of Phi 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills .
We designed the framments , effectively , the correction of the errors and get a molecule of DNA .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material , and we put it into the bacteria , the bacteria have started to read this genetic code and make the genetic particles .
The virals are virals , and they &apos;re going back and they &apos;re going back and they destroyed the Emals .
I &apos;ve talked about recent with members of the oil industry that they have to have this model .
They have removed more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where software can really build his same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the greatest things .
We wanted to build the whole cromosome .
They &apos;re more than 580 mila lls of code .
So we thought of building it in casses of the virus , so that we can change the clearly change the clearly to understand what the components of a living cell cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequence this genome for the first time in 1995 , the foot of the fillness of a mid-based .
We found , resequence , 30 errors . If we had been able to that original sequence that sequence we &apos;ve never been able to work .
A part of the process is designed to the long long as 50 pounds that you get to the other seged segers to make a little little little little bit of them to build a little little little more more than the work together .
We &apos;ve tried to the unclear here .
You &apos;ve got to read that that we put in the flights .
Think about that , we have a genetic code on four and T.
Those of those letter , they put up about 20 amminoacids , and there &apos;s a specific specific to each amminoid to the letter .
So we can use the genetic code for words , frases , of the brillights .
What we did in the beginning was authograin .
Some of them have been delivered by fact that it wasn &apos;t a poetry .
We designed these segments for poter-up segers just with it .
There &apos;s a lot of me that refed them and put them together .
And we started to assembling with the parts , we start with segers , and they &apos;re going to be able to make it seged , and they &apos;re using segers to 24 mix the fying to their time to get to 70,000 .
We &apos;ve got these segments in the abundance , so that we can try to make a process that we &apos;re trying to create a process that we &apos;re trying to create a whole extremely , as you see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems the tabellon a player of a basket .
When we go to these segments very long , more than 100 mid-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-foot .
You get to the limits of modern biology .
So we &apos;ve been been looking for some of the mechanisms .
We knew another mechanism called the romologist called the romologist , which is that in biology , and we knew the DNA in that we can use the DNA in the DNA .
Here &apos;s a example .
This organism , called Deinocate radiotrans , can be a round of radiation .
You can see in the requick , as a little bit of how his cromes came out .
In 12 , 24 hours is reassembled exactly how before .
There &apos;s thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be very much .
They can live in the way .
They &apos;re absolutely absolutely absolutely that life in space , and you can get to new environments .
And that &apos;s true , NASA showed that that this is .
This is a molecule picture of the molecule that we built using these process , just using the lievil with design appropriate .
The lights on the automatically .
This picture was not taken with a microscope with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a molecule that we can see the myroscope with a microscope .
These are the photos that coat a time of six seconds .
This is the published that we did a little time ago .
They &apos;re more than 580,000 lands of code .
It &apos;s the most big molecule of a defined structure of a defined structure of the man .
It &apos;s a molecular molecular ular weight .
If you &apos;re going to be a careful to a carcareful , you want to be 142 pages only to transcitizens to get this code .
Now , how do we work ? How can we do it ?
Of course , you take a virus is a virus is a game from kids .
It &apos;s a little more complicated when they use bacteria .
It &apos;s just simple when it &apos;s about cells , it &apos;s just , you can just get nuclear nuclear nuclear and put another , and then another , which is basically the process of clonally , that is basically the process of cloning .
In bacteria , in the bacteria the cromosome is instead of integrated in the cell , but we &apos;ve got to do a trapished that we can make a trapished a little bit of a cell cell cell to a cell cell cell that .
We &apos;ve got a cromosome cromosome from a species .
The two are different as men from mins .
We have a few gene in a little more , and we can decide that they get to this cromosome .
And then the mouth with the extra expensive .
And when we put in the cell cell , and appreciate our own graphics -- and you &apos;re appreciate our own own own own own own chchchchchchchchchchchchicken -- and then we &apos;ve got into the cell .
And we were thought that we didn &apos;t have to go beyond , but we tried to get more there .
This is one of the most of the world .
We found that tantisisisisisissounds a second or a third cromosome from a few of new trouble , and in a second thousands of extreme of the species .
So who think about evolution as a gene one of the time that it doesn &apos;t have a lot of biology .
They have been called the DNA of the extrition of reduction , which is that adopted the DNA .
The cromosome that was in the cell cell , it &apos;s not possible .
The phones that we put the romosome that we put it .
It &apos;s expressure , and he recognize the other cromosome like exextrist , and we &apos;ve got up with the only cell cell cell and the new cromes .
It &apos;s become blue because of the genes of genes that we put .
And in a short short , all the characteristic of a species are going to be lost , and it &apos;s transformed in a new species , based on a new species , based on new species , based on the new software that we put in the cell cell .
All the protected protected , the members are changing , and member is changing , and when we &apos;re going to do the genetic code .
Now , this may seem like alchemy , but it &apos;s going to change the software , but it &apos;s going to change things in a very very well .
Now , I &apos;ve already explosion that there &apos;s not about genesesesesesesesesesesesesesesesesesesium that we &apos;re going to create a new version of the explosion that we &apos;re going to create a new version of the digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s enough obvious when we think about our need to be .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion people to 9 billion in the next 40 years .
Right for an example : I &apos;ve been born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each other , in 1946 , 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re going to find food , water , and the food , and it &apos;s sounds and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion people .
It &apos;s going to be more dant to do that for nine billion .
We &apos;re going to use more than than than than 30 billion bars , more than 30 billion bars .
That means percent million bars in the day .
When we &apos;re trying to find biological processes , or any kind of process for repage them , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
We have to be able to the whole emission of CO2 from these materials that finished in the atmosphere .
And I &apos;m today , thank you very much of discoveries in all the world , we have a database with about 20 million gengenes , and I like to think that they are the components for the future .
The electronic industry has only a dozens of components , and you think about different things are coming out .
Our limits here is data , the principle from the biological reality and from our imagination .
We have the techniques , because of these metods remarkable to synthesize what we call genomic genomic combinatory .
We are able to build a big robot that can produce a million cromes in the day .
Think of the processing these 20 million genes or of different different different or to try to make the processes or or drugs , new vaccines , we can change , we can change , we can change , because we can change , we can change , we can change , because of the molecular biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a lot of the standard .
We can choose for survival , producproducproduction or chemical , producproduction , production of vaccines .
This is an antanea of some software programmed that we &apos;re working for being able to be able to be able to be able to the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how to be .
We know exactly the genetic code .
We &apos;re focusing on the fuel fuel of the fourth generation .
You &apos;ve also seen you that extrack of the grain was an experiment .
We have a lot of second and third generation that &apos;s going to be used to the cover the clock of the higher than the cutanle of the highest different kinds of butanle .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increase without increase the cost of food and limits to be to be able to turn the CO2 in matter , we &apos;re working for the matter , and we &apos;re working for designing cells that we &apos;re working for the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of of the food .
The solar solar combined with CO2 is a metodownnararies in all the world , we found different metods .
This is a organism that we &apos;ve got to the 1996 .
It &apos;s going to be a deep ocean , about 2500 feet of the water .
They create meters from using using using using using using using using using using the energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can indownal CO2 , which can easily be transported to the CO2 in coal , converting that CO2 in coal , to drive this process .
So , we think we can be able to be able to increase what the basic question of the &quot; which is , &quot; we have the real goal of the whole whole food , we have the modeserve to reach the whole oil industry .
ExExcept that . If you can &apos;t do that to TED , where you can &apos;t that ?
It would be a main source of energy .
We &apos;re working for the same metods to use the same as we &apos;re working for the ancient .
You &apos;ve seen this year with the flu , we always go back to a year and with a dollar , and in least when it &apos;s find the right vaccine .
I think what you can change to build vaccines in anticize .
So , what the future may start seem to change , now , the tree of evolution , and then then the evolution with bacteria , and then then they &apos;re inded , and they were cells , and they were , and they were cells .
We &apos;re so much from the way to improve people .
Our purpose is to do in a way of living enough enough to try to try to do it .
First of all I &apos;m going to see , the more quickly possible , a few few work , new technology that we took to the Microsoft in the following , as I &apos;m going to see , the whole thing .
It &apos;s a locks that you can interact is at the local level that remoon with a visual amount of data .
We &apos;re seeing a lot of gigabyte of digital photograph with a species of a kind of walls and continue , for a very quickly panoramic , we &apos;ve got to the images like .
And it &apos;s not the matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these are data or images .
Most of the photographs , but this for example is a scansion of the Congress of Congress , and reentrepreneur , and reentrepreneeur in the glass .
It &apos;s not a difference because the only thing that limits presents of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time . It &apos;s also a very flessible architecture . It &apos;s also a very flessible architecture .
This is a whole book , not about images .
This is Casa desolate of Dickens . Every column . Every colonna represents a caple .
So , to show you that it &apos;s just tough and not to images , we can do something like that , to see that it &apos;s a real representation of the task , not a picture .
It may be a little bit of artificial to read a electronic book .
I don &apos;t tell you .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s about a number of The Guardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a seon .
And it really gives you a little bit and the experience of read the real version of a little bit of a waily review or a waily , which is to nature of a half of a half of a half of a half of a half of a half of a half of a half of a half of a half of a half of a track of a half of a half of a half of a half of a half of a half of a half of a half of a half of a half of a half of a half of a half of a half .
We also made something with the angle of this number of the Guardian .
We created a public fashion on the high solute solid -- much more than that you use in a normal normal normal , and we put it in a normal normal normal .
If you want to see the characteristic characteristic , you can see here .
Or other models , even specific fic fic models .
And this really shows some of these ideas to get the limits of space in the screen .
We use that this means that that it &apos;s going to put up in the people and other pain like , not to be any of the most to be need to be .
Of course , the maps is a more obvious apply for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don &apos;t want to say that we have to say that we have to give you that it in this field .
These are all the world in the U.S. sovers in the U.S. sovers in the NASA .
So now , we &apos;re going to do something else .
This is actually from the web , I &apos;m going to see it .
It &apos;s a project called a Photosynth , which is that figured two different technologies .
One is Seadron and the other is a visual research to the Noah Savely Savely , one student of the University of Washington , with the help Steve Seitz of the US and Rick Selkft Rick Selkelkft Rick Seigch .
And it &apos;s from the Web , I &apos;m going to Seadrron .
You can see it when we do this as a screen , where we can go from a picture to another and have this kind of experience to solve it .
But the column images here has actually actually a meaning meaning .
The algoritarily visualization of the computer have been recorded these images together , in the way that I &apos;ve got to make the place that you imagine -- all the time you see -- all the time you see the fresulted . There are are spacted . There are the one of a remarkable to the one of a remarkable remarkable .
I don &apos;t know if I have to show you some other environment .
There &apos;s some more more actual .
I want to go directly to one of the original data of Noahahs -- and this is that we &apos;ve got to work for the first time , we &apos;ve done to work for the first time , the technology that we &apos;ve done to show you what I think is the key key key to show that technology is really the key to the first time , the technology is not necessarily much much of the same time . And it &apos;s not necessarily much . And it &apos;s not necessarily just just just just just just much much much much much much much much of the first time .
We had to prepreparks of the legal aspects and saying .
This is a reconstruction of the Nobody three Dame images from Flickr . Badigit . Badigit &apos;s going to be Nothing in Flickr and you get images in magine , other other camlip , other of the magazine of these conarts , and so on the whole thing that is that it &apos;s discovering to be able to keep this model .
So they &apos;re all images from Flickr and they &apos;re all connected to spread in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to be able to this simplant .
You know , I &apos;ve never thought of I &apos;m going to end with Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratification that &apos;s very gration-up .
I think that you see that it &apos;s a lot of different kinds of kinds of fotocaming , which is that that &apos;s a lot of different number of different kinds of , and a lot of significant , and you can see that there &apos;s a lot of different kinds of of fotococamong the environment .
And if I can try and do that , I try to try and those more strikes .
Many of you &apos;re block from the except , etc .
And somewhere here is a series of photographs -- and it &apos;s a series of photographs -- and it &apos;s a few of photographs -- and it &apos;s a number of photographs -- and it &apos;s a series of photographs -- and it &apos;s a series of photographs -- and it &apos;s a series of photographs -- and it &apos;s a few of photographs -- and it &apos;s a few of photographs -- and
This is a bter of Nothing .
We can go from the poster of this environment .
The point is that we can do things with the social environment . This is that &apos;s going to take data from the whole memory of the whole memory of how to do the land , from the visual view -- and the whole of visual view -- and connected to all those data together .
All of those pictures become connected together , more than the parts .
You have a model of the whole thing that emerging .
Think about this as a prolice of Stephen Lawler on the Earth .
It &apos;s something that you &apos;re growing in complex exity as the people use , and the whose for the useful and they &apos;re going to get the use of the use .
They &apos;re marced with metaphhhits by other people .
If you have a idea of contrast all these sessing sounds all these sounds , my picture of Nobody , my photos of Nothing , you &apos;ve got to be required to all those data , and I can use how to do it in that space , in that metaphor to the picture of the universe , and to have a kind of cross-fills of the crosses .
Of course , a consequence of all the whole whole thing is virtual exextremely , of the land , they can &apos;t only only only by you live in the past , and satellitary images and satellite images , but from the memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized that that your software is that your software to be able to do is that in the next few years , in the next few years , all the photographs , all the photographs , and all the photographs together ?
BAB : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is that it &apos;s actually doing it .
It &apos;s creating a rying rying the hyperlink , if you want , you want , in images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the basic images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the remarkable of information searching that many of these images .
And as when you do a research research on the web , you get a frase and the text of the Web has a lot about images .
Now , what happens if that picture is connected to all your picture ?
So the amount of interconnection , and the amount of remarkable to the amount of remarkable to be very huge . It &apos;s a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really amazing .
BABAS : You &apos;ll give you very much .
One of the main pleasant when you traveling and one of the delicians and the research is that we can live in the world between who not have to be deeply the antic of the world , who &apos;s going to be in the wind , the touch in the wind , the waste in the wind , the waste is that the world &apos;s the plants .
Basti thinking that the mells Jaguar , I go beyond the Via Lattea , or that the mites of the old Inuit &apos;s still cold , or that in Himalaya , which is still I &apos;m going to reach the importance of the Dharm , to remember the most of the idea of the most of the idea of the most of the idea , but the idea that we are not just a sense of the world , but we just just just a sense of the way , but we can &apos;t only model that we have a sense of the way ,
the consequence of a particular particular set of choices that our stirds that our stirds did , good or good , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the extended .
We all all of the whole thing .
We are southern to the beginning .
We need to do the inexist of death , so we don &apos;t care if we go and see --
We all have a art art .
What the cold is the particular particular one of the song , the ritual of the dance of every culture .
It &apos;s not the think of the Borneo , or the following Borneo , or the follow of Haiti , or the Haiti , or the westerday , the Curandandander in Kenya , the Curandander , the Curandander &apos;s the Mhara .
He was my company in desert , in the desert a month ago , or a evator of yak in the values in the values of Womolanger , the MMore , the More , the mother of the world .
All of these are teaching us that are other ways of there are other ways of think , other ways of thinking , other ways of being being in the world .
And if you reflecting a active active concept that it can give you a hope .
Insides , the miriades of the world creates a rich of the world , and cultural life that you want to get the planet and cultural is important for the world to be the world , and it &apos;s important for the world .
And you can think that &apos;s the cultural rounded as a quick , and you can defining the whole whole whole of all the concepts , and inspired , and inspired , inspired ideas , inspired , inspired , inspired ideas , inspired , inspired to be by the human imagination .
The etnosphere is the great cheap of humanity .
It &apos;s the symble of what we are and what we can be in how we can be in how species .
And as the biosphere was very quickly consumed by just as it &apos;s happened to the etnosphere and extremely quickly .
No biological , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all the species is about the orest the gestintion of the only one of the summer , or -- or in the potential , or -- and you don &apos;t have any more more than the biological diversity -- and not not to the most optively than the cultural diversity of the cultural diversity .
The one of all of that is , of course , the perspective .
When you were born 6,000 lingful on this planet .
A language is not composition by a bocolary or a series of rules .
A language is the soud of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle of which is that that animate in the world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a bunch of mind , a thought , a ecosystem of the own own own own own .
And those of those 6,000 linger , as we &apos;re sitting here in Monterey , at least half the time , at least half the children .
They don &apos;t teach children , the children , the means , less that you know , less than not the camps , which are already dead .
What is more tristes of the most tristes , of the last at the last to talk about a language , of the world , not having to transmit , of the way to transmit the promise to the promise the promise of the promise ?
This orrying is that I &apos;ve been a few of some of the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two old old old , and the door to their own own own own language .
And I know that somebody of you will say , &quot; Is it better that ?
The world would not a better place if we look at all the same language ? &quot;
Let &apos;s talk about the kogs .
You &apos;re going to be able to be able to say that it &apos;s not going to tell your language .
I &apos;d like to do you do a journey through the etnosphere --
a little journey in the nososphere to give you a place of what we &apos;re going to be lost .
Many of us dimentican inmenticed ways that when I say , &quot; I mean , &quot; I mean , really mean , it &apos;s very different ways of there .
Let &apos;s take for example this bimbo Barasana , in Amazony , the people who are required to the anaconda , which believe in the Amazon the front of the milk in the front of the milk in the front of the grass .
It &apos;s a people that that &apos;s not able to distinguished color from the blue blue , because the blue birth , because the time you know , which is identify in the time , which depends the people .
They have a language and a rule , and a rule , called &quot; exogogue , &quot; &quot; Resogogue &quot; : you have to get a different language .
All of that has been the mitological particularly , but the particularly the particularly , but the particularly that they &apos;re talking about six or seven , because of the causes of the math , no one language .
They &apos;re limited to listen and then they start to talk .
Let &apos;s take one of the most interesting tribes with the most interesting world that I lived , the Waorani of Ecuador , a unununununknown that had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionariarians have been a repair .
They &apos;ve done it down from the top photographs that required them in the top of the evolving , dementing that that this people have to the forest , and they have never seen nothing than than than than than the bi-dimensional .
They &apos;ve been collected the picture from the Earth , they &apos;ve been taken to the research of a shape , and they don &apos;t find nothing , they have to be treated that they were treated that was the diavoid that was the diavoid , and they killed five missionary miss with the lance .
But Waorani don &apos;t killed the strights .
They killed between them .
54 percent of mortality was caused by their own .
We &apos;re risallowed to eight generations and we found two of death and when we &apos;ve got a natural knowledge and when we &apos;ve got to know , they have a invecting that one of their invecting , and then they &apos;ve been killed the same .
The caughter were able to recognize the animal animal from 40 pass and recognize the species .
In the first years , I was an unlike a task , I really interesting when my professor , I asked to go to Haiti , if I wanted to go to Haiti in the basic secret to the basic secret the basic potential to do the basis of Duvaliver and Tonton Macon Macon Macon Macon Macon Macon Macon Macon Macon Macon Macon Macon Macon Macks .
So , to give a sense of the miracoly , I had to make the SVodoun and that Voodoo is not magnal .
It &apos;s pretty a complex view view of the world .
So , a lot of interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the great religion of the world , what would you do you ?
Cristian anthesh , Buddhism , Ebraism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that Africa &apos;s going to be sub-Sharharan Africa . And instead and the Voodoo , and the Voodoo is not the other that the geous religious ous ous ous .
What makes it interesting the voodoo is the intense of life and death .
So the you &apos;re going to be narrow .
The spiritual can be invocated by the Grands Actually , they say to the rich of the dance and they reminded up to the way that we can be the following following the follow .
So , that the voodookkkkkkill in &quot; &quot; Who you go into God .
We go into the temple and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment that you &apos;re sitting , is the spirit that you can do you get to you , how you can do you do it ?
So you see , and these amazing events : following the voodoo in the state of the trance that touch is that touch a very strong strong , rather than the body of the mind , as a very strong power of the mind , in a very excitation .
There &apos;s all the people with the most extraordinary that I &apos;ve lived the most extraordinary ordinary are the Kogi of Sierra Nevada , in Colombia , in Colombia .
I think of the ancient of the ancient civilization that once they live on the planure of the Colombia in the expensive , the people have been ring , the people have to the skills that you get the cheap of the skills .
In a continent of health , this people have never been conqued that has never been conquisted by the spread .
And today &apos;s a government government government has been been a click , but their formation is very extraordinary .
The young follow people are taken from families and three or four or four , and they live in a good world , and they live in a good world and omomoms in the basic world of the stones in the end of the fearth for 18 years .
Two years of nine years , they choices to reproduce the nine months of gestation that they translation in the mother , now are metaphor , now are metaphor in the Grands of Mother .
So , all of this time , they &apos;re acculturturning the values of their society , values , and only their pregnant , and only their pregnant , or to the equilibrium -- or to say the equilibrief .
And , of this amazing ununbelieved , they &apos;re sudden out and for the first time in life , they see a foot . And in that moment , they see a alba . And in that active , the whole blocks , when the sun the whole thing , all the whole thing that they &apos;re in the conference , all the whole thing that they &apos;re going to be been a place and then you see it &apos;s happening in his own .
&quot; Wison ? I said , &quot; I said ,
It &apos;s amazing . Now , it &apos;s now to you . &quot;
They call the most of the most and they say that we have , fraters , we are the colcold of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the indegene and the environment invoon Roussearching and the old story of the wisdom , which is a concept in its simplicity or maybe invoon the same way , and we say that these people are more neighbors , and say that these are more neighbors to the Earth .
The indees are not noses are not noses , you know , it &apos;s not nostaly .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the palude of Astore or in the sun , but because of Tibet , but because of the Tibet , but because I think , they created a mystic stic of the Earth is not on the concept of the most important thing : the concept that the concept that the Earth can only be so that the human human confifigured .
What does that mean ?
It &apos;s saying that a little girl who &apos;s going to be a little bit that the mountain is a spirit that you &apos;ll get the first mountain is that you &apos;ll get a human human being deeply , and it &apos;s going to be a deeply different with the mountain or that that &apos;s a lot of the mountain that &apos;s a lot of rocks that &apos;s a lot of rock .
What it &apos;s the dimer of one spirit , or a mineral is irrights .
What is interesting is the metaphor that defines the transport between the individual and the natural world .
I &apos;ve been on the Humbia Britannannica believe that the forests would be crisis .
And I &apos;ve got a different human friends from my friends Kwakiutl that they believe that the forests are the Hukukukukuk and the byle is the rich and the wissues that live in the world , the waste that we &apos;re going to get the world in the world , the spiritual ,
If you start to think that these cultures can create reality , you can start to start to understand some of them discoveries . We do this plant .
I &apos;ve been taken this picture to aprile in Amazony nururity .
Maybe some of you &apos;ve heard about the ayahuash , the more powerful psychology of the repertorum of the repertorum .
What makes it filling the ayahuash is not the potential drugs , but its elaboration . And it &apos;s the required . It &apos;s actually composition from two elements .
On one side , this liant liant is that contains a series of coal coal , harver and harver , read a lot of hallucinogene .
I &apos;m going to take the only planning on the island that allowed a little bit of the costs , but it &apos;s mistake with a little bit of a bunch of a caffecting , and they said ,
This plant contains , very similar to the seriotonin the seriotonin the dimethypping , methypamine , methypamine .
If you &apos;ve ever see the Yanoms on the nararguing that they make a different set of species , you &apos;ve got a different kind of species , you &apos;ve got a meypamine .
You can get that the pollls on the nose is a little bit like to be shoot from a fuels of dipinches of dipinsesearching on a sea sea . &#91; &#91; &#91; Ris&#93; &#93; not believe a distorsion of reality .
I often have a lot of my professor , Richard Evan Shultimes , the man who has got the mimum , with his discovery , with his discovery , with his discovery of the funny , with his discovery in Mexico .
I &apos;m going to be a classificate these tripppping , because if you &apos;re actually , because if you &apos;re actually , you can &apos;t tell any of being allucinated . &#91; Ris&#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; because they &apos;re not going to be a denly , because they &apos;re not going to be a lot of oxygen , demonstrike .
It &apos;s possible to be able to the orously , if you get to the other chemicals that denaturn the MAO .
Now , the beautiful : the none of the coal , which is instruments are instruments of MAO , the same kind of need to be able to be able to the tripamine . The question is the expensive . The question is a 80,000 species of plants , but if you combined in this way , but if you put a little bit of the size of the size of the size of the size of the country , but if they believe that &apos;s going to be a chemisphere of the whole thing that &apos;s going to be ?
We use the great eufemism of the evidence and the error , which can revevehimself .
But if you ask the Indians , you say , &quot; The plants us tell us . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuash , which they get nectly in the forest , and that we would have to our eyes , and that we would get in the same species .
If you ask how to do the tassonomy , you say , &quot; I thought I &apos;m going to say , &quot; I thought I &apos;m going to say , &quot; I &apos;ve got to say , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take 17 variety in a night of a loss and each one , and each one will be with a different way .
And that &apos;s not a graduuuurea Harvard , but it &apos;s very interesting that to the stood .
Now , &#91; &#91; applausers the problem is that also the problem is that also the heart of us that have no gengenes them , but in some way , they &apos;re going to be dousesearching in the real world , and they &apos;re going to get over the real world , and they &apos;re going to get over .
In fact , the 20th century , in 300 years , it &apos;s not going to remember , and it &apos;s not going to remember or its technology , but as as the technology , but as it was that we stop and have a lot of how the biological diversity and cultural extrtreme of biological diversity and cultural . Now the problem is not the change .
All the cultures are involved in a dance for the world of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indian Indian electric , they don &apos;t stop to be Sioux when they put it from the wears , and so they don &apos;t have to be American when they put from the horses , and they were hot when they put it from the horse and calculus .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that minds the integrity of the etnososphere . It &apos;s the power .
The wall of the domination of the domination .
And if you go to the world , I see that these are not destinate to the world .
They &apos;re living creatures and dynamic dynamic from the existence of the exist , and they &apos;re going to be the ability to adaptment .
And I &apos;m going to disbosygent in the summer --
a nomade of the nomade will be awak in the suest sousian instrument , a people who have lived on the forest to a generation ago , and now reduction to the next titution , and then the next titution , where you can see the fairs , where you can see the middle of the willing that it seems to be to the middle of the Morneo , where the window , where the southern , where the nometetetetetc .
You &apos;re ready to reempppair the path .
Or , in the case of the Yanomami , are the disease that are the diseases that are come with the discovery .
If we go on the mountains of the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research research , you see the whole whole thing .
And as you know , the genocide , the estinary physics of a populated level , but the ununless than a universal level , but the destrotroy of life , but it &apos;s not just been in , but it &apos;s not just been in the certain general of the environmental development .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of the Tibet until you &apos;re not part of the beginning .
I &apos;ve got the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in China , in the Western Europe , and go to Lhasa with a young young connected , but only came up to Lhasa , but only came back to Lhasa Lhasa Lhasa lot of time .
6,000 monuments redates in the polyesterday and the sweak .
1.2 million people killed if the military during the Rivolution in Cultural .
The father &apos;s father was ascritical in Panchen Lama .
The thing that means that that it &apos;s been killed to the Chinese time .
And it &apos;s refuel with Sua Santity during the Santity in the diaspora .
He was imprisoned and his cold , and his cold was to be rich .
It &apos;s been taken to a nararts to the age of two years , and they &apos;re going to be able because it couldn &apos;t live in the time , because it couldn &apos;t live .
The surprising , which has done the same , it was mitted in the field of reeducation .
A day has inversued a bultimate a fashion on Mao and , for this transgrsion , was med to this transgrsion , was mitted to seven years .
The pain of Tibet can be insopportrapppable , but it &apos;s the spirit .
And then , it &apos;s all reduce a choice .
We want to live in the world monotos of the monotony or or we want to take the world the policies ?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead , before we die , before he said that his greater filled that , in our back to this vision , not only we &apos;ll see the whole gma of the whole glass of the human imagination . And so we &apos;ll give us to the whole whole glass that we &apos;ll give us to the whole thing that they were going to be able to be able to be able to the other other than than the other other .
And it &apos;s a billion to remember that our species is there for 600,000 years .
The FFFFFrom , which has given us us us us us to the agriculture , which has done to be the poetry of the searching of the poetry of the filling with the next way , and we &apos;re talking about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world has been stent to be 300 years .
And that swide story , I don &apos;t suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we &apos;re going to do in millllls .
When these miric reahead of the world is asked what you want to say to be human , they say , you know ,
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all refliked the chance of being what we are : a kind of , that has to make it in a way that we all the people and all the gift . And there are great moments . And there are great moments .
I &apos;ve been taken this picture on the northern of the Baffin Baffin , when I went to the balary of the From , and this man , and this man , Olaya , and this man , I had told me the wonderful story of his grandmother .
The government is not always been gentile with the Inuit , and in the 191950s to be able to be our premate , we have to have them to get them in colonies .
The grandmother of this man , I got to go to .
The family , I &apos;m going to get the family , and I &apos;ll take all the back , and all his attract .
You know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t have the cold , the sweak , the sweak .
The pack of the slitks in origins were made of fish , they were made in the skin in there .
The grandmother of this man didn &apos;t have a bynal night , or from the night , or from the bynal that suffering .
It &apos;s sweden , it &apos;s calculated the pantystages in the pantalons of the pantalons and defecting in their hand . When they &apos;re going to do , the work work with a lama .
He &apos;s got a salive on the top of this cold of this cover and when it became solid , and he &apos;s killed a dog .
He &apos;s shopped up the cane and created a brighter , with the cables , and he created a slitta , has imbribrief another dog and it &apos;s sat , the bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbyed a slitch , and it &apos;s a brighter , and it &apos;s a brighter , and it &apos;s a brillighter ,
We want to talk about the horse with nothing ?
Napi -- the aprise government has reduced to Inuit , the total control of an area of the greater area of the greater largest area of California and Texas .
It &apos;s their new painting .
It &apos;s a third third ritory . We &apos;ve got all the minerary resources .
One splendive example of how a natione-been able to reach with its people .
And , I think it &apos;s rather obvious obvious to the ones of us has been in these willing , and they realize that they don &apos;t have the remote .
For somebody &apos;s home .
They have a searching of human imagination that they &apos;re going to the alba of the time . And for us all of these children , as the sets of these children , become part of the nutrtrtrtreme of the hope .
So , we have to have a few National Geographic we &apos;ve got to be that politicians will never be nothing .
We believe that the polemics --
&#91; &#91; Applauses are not persuasive , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and maybe we are the better institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month , we have 35 million visited .
156 countries will move our dog television .
Our reviews are laid from millions of people .
Our work is traveling in the nosynosphere to bring our public public in the wonderful and cultural that they will be absolving , and you hope , and you hope , you can hope , the way , we &apos;re going to get a lot of the world , and we have to find a style in the diversity of the world , and we need to find a life in a world , and we need to find a life in a world , and we we need to find a whole of the way of the way of the waving in in in in in in in the whole whole whole way , and and and we &apos;re working of the way of the
where the saggeon of all the people can contribute to our waste .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope to do that I hope you &apos;ve already heard and I &apos;m going to show you some of the connections , in case , not notice .
I &apos;d like to start what I call &quot; the &quot; dogs . &quot;
The dogram official official official ?
The dogram official official society . The Western official offal official offal , &quot; If we want to the whole westerday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The way to do it is the very massive of our own own . &quot;
The reason is , from a side side , in fact that the freedom is in the same value , is previous , useful , and of human beings .
And the other is in fact that if we are lights , each of us can act to do all that we have to do everything that that massive our well-being , without no one that decide in our own .
The way of the freedom is the freedom is massive .
More , more choices , and more is the most of them , and the freedom , and the freedom , it &apos;s their well-being .
This , I &apos;m going to say , it &apos;s so much , it &apos;s so much , it &apos;s a dredream of going to put it in the society .
And it &apos;s also deeply deeply deeply in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what the progress has to be possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not very big .
I &apos;m going to put a simple note on the ments for the instruments .
In my supermarket , there &apos;s 175 conditions , without context of the 10 various age of the oldest , and the 12 acets that you can buy for a friends that you can buy for a huge number of conditions that nobody of the 175 times is a number of the 175 times .
That &apos;s the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic store to buy one stereo : the clock , if you , CD , radio , mimtra , sounds , light light , and you can go to the mouse .
And in this single single store store , there &apos;s a big number of components .
We can do six million different combinations using the components that there are in a only store .
Bisogn to put that there is a very much choice .
Other camps : the world of communications .
And once , when I was a child , they could get all the phone services to the services that they were to melling , and they could be by mmouse .
You know , they &apos;re born the phone , they didn &apos;t buy it .
A consequence of that , in the other , the phone , it was that the phone never .
These times are gone .
We have a variety of the phone , especially between the phones , especially between phones .
Here &apos;s the phones of the future .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , MP3 , ccles of the naries of the narrow , and forth for the cross ,
If you don &apos;t have seen in the left left left , you &apos;re very much of the house , you &apos;re going to be going to be .
And what is that the end is that people go into the back and it does this question is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a phone that doesn &apos;t too too much .
So , in other other aspects of life that are much more important than the same explosion of choices .
Assistence : not going to be the most in the United States that you &apos;re going to be in the United States , and the doctor what you have to do .
Instead , you know , you know , and the doctor says , &quot; Well , we can do , and say , &quot; You can do , or B , &quot; &quot; A has these these benefits and these are these benefits and these are these benefits and these risks . What do you want to do ? &quot;
Tu Did , &quot; Dr. , &quot; What would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A has these benefits and these risks , and they &apos;re all these risks and these risks . &quot;
What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebits : &quot; Dr. if she was me , what would you do that ? &quot;
And the doctor : &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result of the result of the MMan , &quot; &quot; the expression that it seems to be a beautiful thing .
But it &apos;s not that one to move the fish and the responsibility of the decisions of the decisions from somebody who knows something , and the doctor , and that &apos;s the doctor , and it &apos;s not nothing -- and so much of course , it &apos;s not in the ideal condition to decisions the patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing products of products , directly to people like me and you , that if you think about it , you think that if you think you don &apos;t have any sense , because we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t you buy them , why they have they put them ?
The answer is that they want to ask the doctor to ask the doctor to ask the rich .
What &apos;s the fundamental thing as we have our identity is a question of choice , as you see in this vignant , &quot; we don &apos;t want to go to the children . They will go to the kids . &quot; Don &apos;t want to be an identity : &quot; Don &apos;t have the most identity : we have to invent .
And we can reinvented us us .
The thing that means that every morning , you have to decide that kind of person person want to be .
I &apos;m going to be a family and the matrimonium , a time the perspective , and I &apos;ve got to be able to anyone , and they were going to be able to be possible , and they started to make the most pression , and they started to make the more .
The only choice was with who , not when , and even what do after .
So , it &apos;s really really to play .
I &apos;m going to students very smart , and I &apos;m going to be able to work than a time .
And because they &apos;re not less brilliant because they &apos;re not not because they &apos;re less diligenes .
but why are they impressing , I mean , I mean , &quot; I would say , &quot; I do it ? &quot;
&quot; I would do you get back to the kids , I think before ? I was the children or to be the children ? &quot;
They &apos;re interrogative .
And they &apos;re trying to answer this questions , even if this implica not to get the commoon and you can &apos;t get a good voice to my own .
And they really need to do that .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , as Carl , as Carl , because it allows us to work every minute , every day , every day , every day , from every day , every day , from every day ,
I &apos;ve got to talk , there &apos;s a angoline , and I &apos;m not going to say that nobody , where the WiWiFi works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use it .
What means , this amazing freedom of choice that we have about the work ? It &apos;s that we have to work , and it &apos;s going to work or not .
We can go to see our son play on the hot , with the phone in a packberry , the Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the ginockey .
And if they &apos;re all all , every minute that we see our son roving , we &apos;re also asking this , &quot; I &apos;m going to ask this ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m going to answer this email ? I had to do this letter ? &quot;
And when the answer is &quot; no , &quot; all this makes the experience of your son &apos;s partnernership .
So , from any time , we look at things and great , things and the materials and the life is a question of choices .
And once the world was this : Of course , there were some possibility , but it wasn &apos;t a question of choice .
The world of today is what is : The dilemma is : &quot; Is it a positive positive positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Simimself .
The good good good for the negative of the negative of the negative .
All of this choice , two negative , two negative negative negative in people .
The first , paradopopopopy , it &apos;s that it &apos;s going to be freedom .
And so , you have to get very difficult to do it .
I &apos;m going to give you a significant example : one study of the push of pensive pensive .
A lot of my colleague has been taken to the data of the Vanderdered , the gantic giant society , with about a million clients , with a million clients .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are going to be offer , the percentage of the most of two percent .
With 50 offer , there &apos;s 10 percent in less than adopties when they &apos;re available to be available when they &apos;re not only five .
Because with 50 source of the source of which choices , is a hard hard decide , and choice is reminded to the intimate .
And I &apos;m still in the question , and I &apos;m still in the question , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , and I still have never .
You know that it doesn &apos;t only mean that these work from old old people , because it &apos;s not not enough money , you want to say that the decision is so so that the decision is so so that the decision is so so that the decision is so so , you know that the decision is so so that the decision is so , you can , you know , you know , you know that the deci
Not particularly to particularly , they &apos;re going to be able to five dollars from the work , which would be very displace to be able to be true to the way .
So , the paralive is a consequence of the way .
And I think that &apos;s that &apos;s going to be .
&quot; And I &apos;m going to end , for the eternity : ketchup , you know ? &quot;
Would you like to take the right decision , if it &apos;s for the right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong wrong , and nearly the condition .
So that &apos;s the first effect . The second thing is that if we can evid the parallows the parallows , we are less sweden , we are less sweden , we &apos;re less expensive to the way , we &apos;ve got less options to be able to the way ,
And that for different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of the people who choose , if you buy a and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could do a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the alternative imagination . And what &apos;s the alternative imagination is that the alternative to the choice , and the fairly , the very very much of the choice , and the ffresulated the sevents that you can imagine that you could have have a different choice .
even when it was a very good decision .
More there are , more easy to be displeased by any detail that is inssweden .
And there is what economists call is what economic call is that economic economic .
Dan Gilbert has been very good good , as the value that we get to the things that we &apos;re going to think about what we can do .
And the rest , when there are many options options , it &apos;s easy to represent the alternative of alternative alternative and being less less sounds of the option that you have to be able to the opposition of the opposition that you have to be able to be .
Here &apos;s a example . I &apos;m going to be working with all of the New York .
But that &apos;s what you probably think .
There &apos;s this couple of Hamptons .
A place of the lusually .
Spig , splendida . Ottttle . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not a . But that he &apos;s saying , &quot; Well , &quot; Well , it &apos;s Agust . &quot;
&quot; Everybody &apos;s my neighbors are on the Manhattan are . &quot;
&quot; I could parking the right right of front of the house . &quot;
And it &apos;s two weeks on the idea that &apos;s going to be lost -- every day -- the ability to be a way -- the ability to be .
The costs of an opportunity diminuum for that we have , even when the choice was , even when the choice was .
And the more options that we have to think , more the most of the most of the consequences ,
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
It &apos;s about the time , and maybe of the living time , and maybe of the living .
But the most important point is that you choose , you can tell the other .
The things that we don &apos;t choose that can make less attractive that can make less attractive active what we do .
Terch point : it &apos;s growing .
I tried on my skin in a new new new jeans .
I &apos;m almost always always jeans .
And the jeans were just like , they buy them and they buy them , they were soubliver , they were just just after they were , just just after they were , just after they were , just after they were going to go right right .
So , I went to buy a couple new new when the old old were went , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my own . &quot;
The committed me said , &quot; Li wants to do , it , you know , refit ? &quot;
Does the way with the cles ? &quot; Stonekkkkkkkkkkkko ? &quot;
&quot; Li wants the struggle ? &quot;
&quot; Seight wants to the cover ? BBla the bil -- &quot; Continule -- &quot; Continule .
I was sload , and after a little bit I &apos;ve got to say , &quot; I want the kind of &quot; Don &apos;t have the kind of &quot; didn &apos;t have the idea that was , so for a moment I tried to all the people , and then I went out from the giant , and then then I got the kind of .
It was the massive . With all that I had the best best .
But I &apos;m worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for the whole thing .
The reason I was worse that I was worse that I had been allowed to be perfect , the jeans had to be perfect .
I had waited about the minime . I didn &apos;t waited anything in the way , but when you &apos;ve got to be a kind of , but when I saw 100 different species , at least a kind of thing , at least a kind of thing .
What I had to buy was good , but not perfect .
And then , I &apos;ve got to do that I was inssweden in the disappear to wait in the waiting wait .
The one of options in life , the life of people don &apos;t get to the wait that these are that they can be able to express the expensive .
And that &apos;s going to make less sweeply , when the results are good .
No one in the world of marketing if you &apos;ve got .
Because if they knew it , you don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is that it &apos;s more to that .
&quot; You know , it was better when you were worse , &quot; The reason that was better when you was worse , I was worse that when you were worse , I was still possible to meet .
So , in the world that we live -- opultimtimate , industrialized adadult , the whole of the performing of the performal , the whole we can hope is that things are to the things are to the althetic of the waiting of the waiting of the waiting of the waiting of the waiting of the waiting of the expectations .
You &apos;ve never been surprising because your expectations because your wawaiting , my wawait , you &apos;re ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- it &apos;s : &quot; Bearlier wait . &quot;
I mean , little authographic authographic -- which are really really really sposed and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t have to be able to .
But it &apos;s not always a good thing .
And then , a consequence of the buy a couple of jeans , and you know , you know , you know , and you ask , and you ask , and you ask , and you ask , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot;
The world is the responsible . What I could do you do it ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a insoddisappearing , and you ask you who is the responsible , is the obviously , it &apos;s just as well as you &apos;re .
You could do better .
And with hundreds of various various various , there are not going to be the inincome .
So when people make decisions , even though the result is , if the result is , you feel inssweden , they &apos;re going to do it .
In the last years , the depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only , but important -- that &apos;s about this willing to depression is that the people have been too alty .
And when they have to explain that the situation they think that the cold is .
So the final result is that in general , but we &apos;re going to be worse .
Let me tell you that I remember .
This is the dogram official official , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely filled . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no one of them , you know , a little bit of choice is better than that it doesn &apos;t get that much more choice is better than a lot of choice is better than a little choice .
There &apos;s an critical value , magic value . I don &apos;t know what .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve got to have a piece of level in which choices to make our life .
Now , from the politician -- I &apos;ve got almost finished -- from the politics , the nocope is the follow .
What it allows all this choice in industrial society is the remains .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you &apos;re talking about , where the problem is not that they have no longer .
The problem is that they have too paid .
So , I &apos;m talking about is a bad bad malarartttle of modern modern , rerererequired .
And what it does , and you have to have this : Steve Levitt has to you know , you &apos;ve talked about how these expensive seats are initional . It &apos;s a spread . It &apos;s a spread . It &apos;s a spread of money .
I mean that these choices , and dispendious , it &apos;s not that they &apos;re just initional .
I &apos;m not saying that it &apos;s deleterie .
They make worse .
If a little bit of what in our society is allows choice , it &apos;s not just the their life to be too much to be able to be able to be able to make it but also our life to work , but also our life .
This is what economists called a imimpressive imimming .
A reduction of the income on -- not just to the poor -- not just to poverty -- because of this choice in the except that we &apos;ve got .
So , to conclude , &quot; First , you can become what you want to be , &quot;
You know , people of culture , you think , &quot; What do you think that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious obvious that you can &apos;t make anything in a shoot . &quot;
&quot; A very imagination , a limited limited view of the world -- &quot;
and I &apos;ve got the interpreted so , at the beginning .
But then , I think about , instead , I &apos;m going to tell that that fish knows that the long time .
Because the reality of fact , it &apos;s that if you &apos;re in frankle , in the way that &quot; you can &apos;t do the freedom . You don &apos;t good . You can &apos;t do the freedom .
If you take the bocking in the way that everything is that it &apos;s possible diving the sweweight .
You get the paralive , and you get the well-being .
All they need a sun .
This is almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost for the fish , maybe for the fish , and it &apos;s sure for us .
But the assume of some symbolic symbolic symbolic , and I think , for the rovine .
Thank you .
