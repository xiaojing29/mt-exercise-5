Last year I showed these slides to show that the arm calculus that the artica of artica , which for almost three million years had the size of 48 United States continents , it &apos;s recomfortable to 40 percent .
However this subject the gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice of ice .
The artica glacial calculate is , in a sense , the heart of the global global global system .
It expansion expansion .
The next slide is going to be a carrelated rying to the last 25 years .
The glacious layers are signed in red .
You know , you know , they &apos;re going to get to the blue box .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter , which is the summer ice .
You can see that the costs ice costs , five years or more , is how the blood , which here is how blood , that there was a blood , which here fiorious .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been from so .
This is a problem because the remarkable land , the length of the artic ocean where there are huge huge amount of fuel , where there are huge huge fuel that , melting , they turn into metan by the micbones .
And I &apos;m going to get the total of global warming , that amount of global warming , that can be doubling , super-standing , super-point point of not around .
In some fresh , Alaska metan , the metan is already rebuling from the water .
The professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska team , and a team on a team on prices last last inverse .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You &apos;re good . The question is if we &apos;re going to be it .
A reason is that this exchange exchange the Groenland from the northermal .
This is a river at the regimes .
The ported never reached the well-like .
This is the Kangerlussuahead , in the southern ovest of Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea to the sea level of the sea on the ground , here is where it &apos;s achieved .
These are getting quickly quickly at the time .
On the other side of the planet : Antarctttica of the planet .
The last month , the scientists have been born in negative , and the Western Antarcccccles , and the Western Antarcttttle , is particularly relief in the sun .
Equival at six feet of the actual , like Groenland .
Sulle Himalaya , the third largest blocks of ice , you see new lagues , which a few years ago , they were glasses .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population replaced half of water .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the water source of this city .
The ported is increased .
But when he demining , the same happens to the water .
In California , the snow on the Sierra Nevada is 40 percent .
The hyriririries are in cribes .
The predictions , like you read , are grasses .
The growing sure in the world brings to a remarkable remarkable .
The environmental disaster are increasing a round out of the normal and without previous .
Four times more of the last 30 years I was going to previous .
This is a remarkable .
If you look at the historian context , if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we add 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day .
Look at the time , the area of the Pacific , the west , and on both both the parts of the subcontinent , where there &apos;s a radical radical impoverment of oxygen in the ocean .
The greatest cause of global warming , together at deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossils .
The oil is a problem , and the coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with more emissions , together to China .
And he was going to build a lot of other central central centers .
But we &apos;re seeing a change of the direction .
These are the annullayers in the last years and some of the alternative .
So , anyway , there &apos;s a political lengaged in our country .
The industrial coal and oil have speses 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the fuel , which is a unless osymymous .
That image would remember me something --
Veras Natal , in Tennessee , where I saw , there was a 3.8 billion liers of the coal fourth of coal four-fuel .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen it on the news .
This is the second largest flusband in America .
It &apos;s success around Natal .
The advertising of the coal industrial .
Video : See , the carbon carbon is a kind of a very happy and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it makes our economy .
Frostle the carbon is always more clean .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and the workers are the faspendion .
Al Gore : From the west of the West Virginia .
The most great societies on the mountains is Massey Coal . This is its administrator .
Video : I &apos;m going to be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosy , Harry Reid -- don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima Prottion of Clima has been launched two campaign .
This is a one of them , a part .
Video : Attore : The ALergy : The ALergy we see the climate change as a serious threat at our business .
For this our priority is to invest a huge amount of money in a confused to make public public and confused the truth on the coal .
In fact , coal is not spork .
We think it &apos;s clean -- it &apos;s also a good profumo .
So , you don &apos;t predict about climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Attore : The Caahead -- you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
So we &apos;re going to do a turn around a structure at the avanid structure for the pulit .
Stuordinarily ! The cars are a little rumorous , but this is the sound of the fuel technology of the fuel technology .
The coal consumption is between the major global warming , but the remarkable technology , but the remarkable technology that you see changes everything .
You have a look at this : this is the odiern technology .
Al Gore : The end , the positive alternative , you know , the positive alternative , and at the national security .
Video : The America is in cribes ; the national security , the national security , the climate crime .
The filo that the connection that the bags of the fossils , how the coal fuel and the oil oil imported .
But , but , there &apos;s a new , audences for the circustomize .
Real America : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to report America to work , to make us more safe , and help us stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that basts to solve our problems .
Repower America . Scoprite more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Comment : It &apos;s about rerererereement energy to America .
One of the faster ways of bringing the dependence of the combustible that killing our planet .
Comparsa : The future is here . Vent , a new energy network .
Comparsa 2 : Nggs investing for jobs .
Comment : Really , America . It &apos;s time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old proverbial African said , &quot; If you want to go fast , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , &quot; If you want to go fast ,
If you want to go back , you go together . &quot;
We need to go back , fast .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I did a introduction on the LHC .
And promises to return to the back to the way to you how the machine works .
So I said , there . And for the other time , the LHC is the most great scientific experiment ever attempt -- 27 kilomers of circles .
His task is to reach the conditions that were at less than a billionone-billion-billion-million times at the second .
All that is just environmental .
This is the Ginevra machine .
So , we have to photographs these mini-Big Bang in the rilevers .
This is what I work . This is a 44 feet and it has a diameter diameter diameter diameter diameter .
This is a picture of ATLATLATLAS in construction , so you can see the proportions .
The 10 in the last year we got the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLATLATLATLAS .
It was because of immense fespit in the control of the control .
It &apos;s an image of the first fascination that had been around the LHC , entring in collision , deliberately , with a part of the HC , and spread particles inside the rilever .
In other words , when we saw that picture the 10 industry , we know that the machine worked , which is a great vitty .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to make us more optired or this , when somebody went on Google and saw that the beginning was this .
That means we &apos;ve had a cultural impact on the scientific impact on the scientific .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had just to these films here -- these films stops .
These files are 13,000 ampampes when the machine works at the very very powerful power .
Now , the technical between you will look at the files and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . They &apos;re willing to be too good . &quot;
And instead of doing that because they are very cold to get the constuck the superconducucuction .
So , at less 271 degrees , at the lower temperature in the stars , these files can bring that current the stars , these files can bring that current .
In one of the giunture between the most novemila in the LHC , there was a defect of factory .
So the films are going to be slightly , and the 13,000 bulbs suddenly met a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think these magnees more than 20 tons , and that they moved about 30 centimeters , and that we moved about 30 feet .
They have been damaged about 50 magnees .
We had to take them , what we did .
We have repristine and travel .
They &apos;re going back back to the ground .
The end of the LHC is going to be new integrated .
We &apos;re going to go , and we expect to get data or the lue or dragging , and we &apos;re going to get out what the universe is going to be in the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these crashes reach the dibat the value of science and engineering engineering of frontier . It &apos;s easy to confuture .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact of going to get the limited , I think it &apos;s the value of things like the LHC .
I want to end with the words of a scientist Inglese , Humphrey Davy , which , I suppose , in defense of his clean , his clean , his clean , his clean , the face of the human mind , which is not so dangerous for the progress of the human mind , which is not so dangerous for the progress of the human mind is defines that we have no mystery in nature , which we have a sense of the monomomics of the monize of the . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start asking for rethink about when you , you play with kids , play with the morning .
While you know how to get them and get them , and you know , and to learn them , and to be able to think and solve problems by by actual actual relations .
The spacacacactual reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , from the useful inspired by useful comfortable objects , together at my consultant objects , together to my consultant , and the collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to ask me , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of the mouse as a pass of mouse as a a rolic roll as as a a rololl . We can move from both the hands , with both hands , with both hands , with both hands ,
and we put it to our pleasure ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a computer interactive as a biscope .
In a few words , a Siftable is a computer interactive as a biscope .
You can move with the hand , they can see , &quot; they can see &quot; between them , &quot; feel the right and they have a screen and a radio wireless radio .
But especially , they are physicists , like the morning , like the morning , you can just move them out .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate digital information .
And as they get more physicists , conscious of the movement , the other , and as they get more physicists , conscious of the movement , of the movement , of the movement , of the other , of how we can we see , we can explore new and interaction of interaction .
I &apos;m going to try with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show video : if you cline it in a direction , the video will rophs so , if you &apos;re going to get out of the other hand back .
These reach interactive .
If I affianco , they are interested in what they &apos;re going around .
If they are circles , they can act a little bit .
If they are circles , they can act a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the way we could use common gesture on data , to say , &quot; a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configuring out of the green , and I can use them to use them to use them to use the color in the central , where they &apos;re missing .
And I can use them to use them to use them to the color in the central , where they &apos;re missing .
And if we &apos;re too , we can put a little bit of it .
And I also also think you &apos;re a good chance of learning , like the languages , the mathematics and logic games where people can try things fast , and see the results .
Now , I &apos;m now --
This is a Fibonacks that I do with a equations of equations .
So here we have a game of words that is at half in Scarabeo and Boggle .
Basically , to every turn one letter -- -- in every Siftable , , at every turnail , and as you &apos;re trying to have a letter in case . And as you &apos;re trying to compose him , and as you &apos;re trying to do it ,
Then , after about 30 seconds , you know , and you have a new set of letter and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the kids came in the Media Lab , I &apos;ve done it in a way that I tried to try and turned a video .
They liked up very .
And one of the interesting things of this applied is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
You just say , &quot; You know , &quot; You know , &quot; You know what to do .
Here &apos;s more people that try it .
This is our Tibeta tester , there on the right .
It was actually wanted to be empilars .
They were only morning , they were just morning , for him .
Now , this is an applied of a interactive cartoon .
We wanted to build a device for learning a device for the Pingos is Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , by the Sifaily associated with .
It can put new characters in the scene , by the Sifaily associated with .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : The sun is surround .
David Merrill : Now he took a treatment in the scene .
Video : The arancium treatment .
Book work ! You know , you know , right ?
So , you shake the Siftable and putting them together can be interact the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing their story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide him as it slight .
DM : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide him as it slight .
Video : Vola , gat .
DM : The last example that I have time to show is a tool , which is the recent of recent , to sample and execting music .
It &apos;s a device , which is a tool , to sample and follow music .
The Siftable here is sounds like the bases , and the battery .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can pick out what we use .
You can also put these sounds on a sequence of your pleasure .
And it just by doing touch a sound and a sequence . &quot;
These are actually you can control from the vivious , like the rivers and the filter .
The acks to a particular sound and then cline to get it .
And then there are general effects as time and volume , which are applied to the whole sequence .
We look like this .
Video : DM : We &apos;re going to try to put a very large in two Siftable , &quot; we put it in a series , we &apos;re going to add to a series , we add other basic basic .
Now , I &apos;m going to put a line .
Video : DM : Now I &apos;m going to use --
Video : DM : And I &apos;m going to put the battery to the battery , so I can control the effect from the vivious .
Video : DM : I can reach the whole sequence of the whole sequence of time or the other side .
Video : DM : And now I &apos;m going to add the straight to the bottom of the bottom to give more expression .
Video : DM : I can remate the sequence . &quot;
So I didn &apos;t have to plan , but I can suddenly , and I can improvise it , and it &apos;s more corporate .
And now , finally , I can smoking the whole sequence of the left the Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new interface of the machine , and more as they work as our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some possibility that we try to bring out from the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that coming this new generation of objects to interact with digital media , that will be information in our world .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the now of talking to all of you .
I &apos;m a writer .
And I &apos;m books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the beat of my life .
And I don &apos;t think that it can change .
But , he said this , something particular happened in my life and my career , and in my career , which has brought me to report the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I &apos;ve recently wrote this book , this book called &quot; Mangia , Prega , Am , &quot; the which , diversously , I was a few reason to come out of the world and I got a great sensational , and I got a great sensational , bestyle .
And the result is that everywhere , people treat me like I was going to be adly .
It &apos;s really -- conducted , conducted !
They &apos;re going to be now , and they said , &quot; You don &apos;t have a fearth more to do better than than to do ?
You don &apos;t have afraid to be able to write for all life without the more to be able to create a book that can importance to create a book that can importance to create a book that can importance to create a book that can importance to create a book that can be able to create a book that can importance to create a book that can importance to create a book that can importance to create a book that can be able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can
that can be a ? &quot;
It &apos;s ruring , you know .
But it could go worse , at the part of the time , I remember 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a writer .
I &apos;d come up to the same reaction of the same reaction .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you have succeed ?
You don &apos;t have afraid that the ulililights ?
You don &apos;t have afraid to do this for all of life without anything that &apos;s ever coming out and to die on a cumb cumb cumes of wholdest with the bocking of the failure of the wildness ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
Yeah , I &apos;m afraid of all those things .
I &apos;ve always got afraid .
And I also have afraid of a lot of other things that people might not inform .
And as the alge and other things .
But , as I think about write what I thought and ask me , and I asked me why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logic that everybody &apos;s supposed to be spitted by a work that you were born to do .
But what is there is so particular in the creative entry , and what &apos;s the mental health health health as as a way that other carefully they don &apos;t do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemist engineer and I don &apos;t remember one one once in its 40 years of activity in which he was asked if he was asked to be engineered ?
It was never -- that blocks of the engineer , how does it go ?
It doesn &apos;t work that , you know ?
Every , the engineers , chemical engineers like a group , they don &apos;t have , in the centuries , gotten reputation of depressive maniacated depressive .
We have enough to this reputation , and not only not only the writers , but we have this reputation of all kinds of the kinds of unununforged .
And it &apos;s not going to look at the tristes of the creative magnifies that , only in the 20th century , people are young and often to hand .
And even those who don &apos;t look at the siciddons are actually disappears to be really disappears to be disappears .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , &quot; Every book has killed me a little more , &quot; A very fashion on on the work of their life .
But we don &apos;t give him when we feel that because we heard these things so long that we &apos;ve heard these things so much about it , we &apos;re completely interiorized and accepted the noon that creativity and the art , the end will always be at the angosce , and that art , the end will always the angosce .
And the question I want to ask you to get all here today is : you agree with this idea ?
It &apos;s good for you this -- because it also looked at the time , because it &apos;s not good for that , it &apos;s not good for that we have no good for that .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous and I don &apos;t want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our great creative creative minds .
And I know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start to fire to fire that I felt that I was in my career .
That &apos;s true -- you look , I &apos;m pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I &apos;ve got about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything I &apos;ll write from now to the world as the work that came out after the world as the work that came out after I was going to success about my last book .
I &apos;m going to be skill , because we &apos;re all more or less friends here -- is likely that my most success is to my split .
Oh , Gesus , that thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that brings a person to start dying in the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would continue to do this work that we work .
So , the question is , how ?
And so it seems to me , after a lot of reflective , which the way to work to continue to write is to create a psychological construct , right ?
I have to find a distance of security between me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural natural analysy about what I think it could get to go through the time , trying to look through the time , trying to find more societies to see if they could have more better than the best ideas and more human human ideas and more human ideas and more human human ideas and more seemed .
how to help people creative people manage to manage the risks of the risks of creativity .
And that research has taken me to the ancient Great and ancient Rome .
You know , I &apos;m going to go back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity selling creativity selection from men , OK ?
They thought the creativity was the creativity was the spirit of the divine and that came from some surprising different different and unknown , for distant reasons and unknown .
The greatest call us the devices of the demands of creativity . &quot;
Socrationally , he believed to have a demon that elargive .
Romani were the same idea , but they called that species spirit without a genius .
The Romani is , because the Romani didn &apos;t think a genius was a very smart ,
They think a genius was that a genius of divine that he believed in the walls of a neighborhood , a little bit like the elsewhere is a very , as the elsewhere it &apos;s got to be able to the work of the artist and to model the outcome of the work of that work .
Here , exectional -- here , that &apos;s the distance of which is the distance of the results of your work .
And everybody knew that was so that it worked , right ?
So , the antic artists were protected by certain things , like the too narcism , not ?
If your work work was excited to get it all of the time , everybody knew that you had been helped by this genius .
If your work failed , it wasn &apos;t all your work , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a incapable .
And so people han concept of the westerday .
And then the Raissance came and all of this great idea ; we put the human at the center of the universe on the universe on the center of the universe on the center of the universe on the creatures and let &apos;s have more to be in the detached .
This was the principle of the rational principle and people began to think that creativity came from the idivide .
And for the first time in history , you know , you know , you know , how to a rather than a genius as a rather than a genius than a person with genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big error .
I think that I hope to have somebody , a simple person to believe as a recipe as a source , and the surprising of all the mysters , and the surprising of all the mysters , and eternation and ethical responsibility and ethical to give a phagile , you know , the bluride of human human .
It &apos;s how to ask someone of ingoing the sun .
It deapse and details all of these ingestible ingestible expectations on the performance .
And I think it was this pressure to have destroyed artists in the passed 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think that &apos;s the question , and now ?
We can do that diversously ?
Magarguing a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can &apos;t take 500 years of rational thinking in a speaker .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience that would be legitimate , scientific replaced on the notion of , initious , you do , you make people fought on their own projects .
You can &apos;t really convince you all about this .
But the question I want to ask is -- why ?
Why don &apos;t you think about this way ?
Because it has more sense of anything else that I &apos;ve ever heard about to explain the explanting of the creative process .
One process that , as anyone who ever tried to do something -- so , basically , all here , you don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t understand rationally .
And , in fact , it can look completely paranorous .
I &apos;ve done this recent against recent with extraordinary poetly Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but it was a poeer for all life and said that during his childhood in the Virginia , worked in the fields , and he felt it , in the fields , and he felt it , in the fields , and he felt it in the landscape .
He said he was like a frageous fragework .
And that came up to her from the landscape .
And it was going to be , because he was tremendous the land under its feet .
He knew what he was to do at that point and he was , he said , &quot; &quot; See , &quot; as a match . &quot;
And he was going to be going to come home and he came from this poetry , and it would not have to make another piece of paper and a math , and it &apos;s going to collect it and mistake it on the page .
And again , I couldn &apos;t get fast enough , so correcent and correcent and correcent without to get to the house and the poetry and the poetry and he lost it and she would continued to roled through the landscape , looking for , as he said , &quot; one said , &quot; Am , &quot; another few few times you &apos;d continued to roled through the landscape , and she would continued to roled to the back and she would continue to be able .
And then there were those times -- this piece I will never forget -- there was moments where the was almost lost , right ?
So , he was going to be running and the poetry and the poetry and the poetry and he said , he was like the housing , and then he said , he was like , if you were going to be halled with the other hand and the office .
And he was the poetry from the code and the shoulder in his body and the transction on the page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be presented on the perfect page and intact , but at the contrary , from the last word at the first word .
So when I felt it -- it &apos;s pathesk , is exactly the ugual to my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- not a conducucucucucucucture .
I &apos;m a mulo , and my way to work is ; I wake up at the same orary every day and to go on the goals and to go on the goals .
But even I , in my testyard , I &apos;ve got against that thing , sometimes .
And I think even a lot of you the han done .
You know , even if the work and ideas came to me from a certain source of them , I couldn &apos;t really end .
And what is this ?
And how can we relate to it in the way to not to allow the head , but , rather , that we can stay up ?
So , as I think about the best example of the same time that I have the Tom Waits , which I interviewed that I &apos;ve interviewed several years ago for a journal .
We were talking about this , and you know , you know , for the majority of life was the incarnation of the art art art art , trying to try to manage , asked these species of impulsed creative interiorized .
But then invecked , he was going to get up , and a day he was driving on a highway in Los Angeles , changed all for him .
He was going to be fast and all of a sat this little little bit of melodia , who comes in his head as a inspiration , and you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the desiddle , and the desiddle , but it doesn &apos;t know how to take it .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a bunch .
So I started to feel this kind of , as a kind of , is to be growing in him , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to have been going to be able to be enabled by this song even even ements .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to go to the panic , he stopped .
He was going to put the whole mental process and made something completely new .
He just looked at the sky and he said , &quot; I &apos;m not going to see that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Ti seems to write a song now ?
If you really want to exist , you know , I &apos;m going to take a little bit of you .
Altrain , you know , I &apos;m going to importantly something else today .
You know , I &apos;m going to disturbing Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his work process of working process .
Not the work , the work was still dark , as always .
But the process , and the fish of the anxial actor that was reduced when the genius , the genius that came out of him . And I went to go back to the back where they came back to the back , and I went back to where they came from , and the gentleman .
But it &apos;s the well-peculiar , collaboration between Tom and this strange and this strange thing that straight and the outside that it was not Tom .
So what I felt that story about change a little bit of the way I worked and already saved me once .
This idea , I &apos;ll save me when I was writing , &quot; Mangia , Am , &quot; and fall in a of those cave of the disperation where we &apos;re working on something and we can &apos;t get to think that &apos;s going to be a disaster , which is going to be a disaster , which is going to be the worst book .
Not just good , right the worst book written .
And I started thinking about gecting this project .
But then I remember Tom that I talked to the air .
So I got my face on the manoscritical and deployed my comments to a vacuum of the room .
And I said to high voices , &quot; Somebody , what we know , if this book is not going to be very cold , not that ?
Because I &apos;m seeing that I &apos;m going to do that , I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want you to have to show you and do your part .
Okay . But if you don &apos;t know what , I don &apos;t do it .
I &apos;ll try to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I want to be recorded that I &apos;ve been presented to do my part , &quot; because , at the end is so , OK -- centuries ago in the deserts of the North of Africa &apos;s the dances of the North of the dances of the North of the North of the lune and the wave and the alba .
And they were always magnifleap , because the professional walls were fantastic and they were fantastic .
But every one , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became actually transcendent .
And I know what I &apos;m talking about what I know you &apos;ve all seen , at a point , a performance .
It was like the time , it was like the time , and the ballerin a kind of portal and not was doing anything else else from the usually , like 1,000 notes before , but it all the way it was going to be in .
And suddenly , it doesn &apos;t look like a human .
But he accounts from the digging in the fire of divinity .
And when this happened , people know what was , people know what was , they called him by his name .
And they were the hands and started to bay , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , God , God , &quot; God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curious note -- when the More invasing the south of Spagna , I was this abstract with them and the ready to be in the centuries . &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , &quot; Ole , &quot; , &quot; I &apos;m the hole , &quot; which you can still hear in the corrids or flamench .
In Spagna , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , I am , Alah , magnifiction , &quot; uncomfortable , &quot; uncomfortable , and then , and he &apos;s got a fallen of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need .
But , the problem comes the day after , for the ballerin the same , when you wake up and find that are 11 in the morning of Martedday and the fourth of God is there .
It &apos;s just a dead with a lot of bad ginoccurred , and maybe it will never be able to each one to that althetic althes .
And maybe nobody will dogs the name of God still while , and what &apos;s going to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most porose to do in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so much if you can &apos;t believe , advancy , which the most amazing aspects of your being being being from the same .
But it just credest you &apos;re data in the present of a source of this team of a source of the life that team you have to go to somebody else when you &apos;ve got it .
And , you know , if we think about this way .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s certainly like , as I thought about the work of the book that I think I &apos;m going to work , the dangerous , spaving , dangerous , speshierous , and we follow it was following on my great success .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel electrized by this is , not having afraid .
Not at the arts . It &apos;s just your work .
Continua present-presented for your side , any one can be .
If your work is balling , you know , if your work is balling ,
If the divine , they &apos;re going to get some kind of reach , you decided to leave some kind of wonderful , for a only moment through your foragement , then , &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Altrain , you do the same dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot;
I think it &apos;s about it . I think it &apos;s going to teach it .
&quot; Ole ! &quot; to you the same , even for having human love and testles to make you continuously .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
You know , you know , I &apos;ve talked about some of these human projects on what it can mean and on the new genes of genes .
We &apos;re starting a new path : we started digalize biology and now start by that digital code , we &apos;re going to get into a new fase of biology , design and synthesizing life .
We always tried to take great questions .
&quot; What &apos;s life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists I think they have been trying to figure out of the willing .
We tried different approaches , reducing the minimes .
We &apos;re looking at almost 20 years old .
When we sequenced the human genome treat the analogical world of biology in the digital world .
Now , we ask : we can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome that can authoreplicate in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit more smaller .
We can eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 that are here .
But when we look at its map map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our own metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our .
Credei , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one one of the time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this can bring a living cell cell cell .
So we decided that the only one on design to be synthesizing this chromosome , so we could change the components to get some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of &quot; Can we synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Can I have the chemistry of production these great molecules that we never had to create before ?
And , in case , we can make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemical material .
The speed that we are able to digitize life is growing at the exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , design , but it &apos;s getting better .
And our most recent results the results of a curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process has required a lot of passes , starting with a bioethical review before .
But we discovered that synthesize of DNA is very difficult .
There are thousands of cars in the world that make little little segment of DNA , the long DNA , of the long , and it &apos;s a degenerative process : more segment .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these framments and correct the errors .
And this was our first attempt , to start with digital information about Phi 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that killes bacteria .
We designed framments , we designed the correction of the mistakes and get a DNA molecule of about about 5,000 letter .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material , and we put it in bacteria , and we put it in bacteria , and produce the viral particles , and produce the viral particles .
The viral particles then you &apos;ve been reduced by cells , they &apos;re back and they destroyed .
I &apos;ve talked about recent with the members of the oil industry industry that they are certainly compost this model .
They have more of you .
We believe that this is a situation where software can actually build its same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things larger .
We wanted to build the whole chromosome .
They are more than 580 mile letter code .
So we thought we &apos;ve been building it in cassette of the viruses , so that we can change the cassette of understanding what they are the components of a living cell .
The design design is critical , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard of the standard was a mixed mixes .
We discovered , resequenced it , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence we had never been able to do that .
One part of the process is designed to design segments that you &apos;re willing with all the other segment of 50 letter to build more segment at the bottom of 50 letter to build more small subject .
We try to do unic elements here .
You &apos;ve probably read that we &apos;ve got to put the flyle .
Think of it , we have a genetic code , A , C , Gs and T.
Three of those letter to mate together code about 20 amminoacids , and there &apos;s a specific specific order to letter for every ammindddness .
So we can use the genetic code to write , frasy , thoughts .
What we did at the beginning was authogical to do it .
Some of them have been delused by the fact that it wasn &apos;t .
We designed these segments to do that with the power to just employees with it .
There are me that they reject them and put them together .
And we started to assembling parts , starting with the parts of five to seven mile to seven thousand letter , to be able to make seglobe to make the segment of 24 mile to 72 .
So , we &apos;ve produced these segments in abundance , so we could have given them to create a very much rooms .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems the tabellon a game game game .
When we get these segments that much much long , more than 100 , 100 , they will not be directly directly in the Ecles .
You get to the limit of the modern biology .
So we &apos;ve got more mechanisms .
We know about another mechanism called the reomologist reaching the biology is to repect the DNA to repect the DNA to units its segment .
Here &apos;s a example .
This organism , called Deinoccurred three million rad rad of radioils .
You can see in the top of the top of the destruction of his destruction is destruction .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s reassembled exactly how before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be dying .
They can live under the vacuum .
They are absolutely sure that life exist in space , and you feel new required to find new required of water .
In fact , NASA showed that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built using these processes , just using the lieventually design appropriate with the appropriate design appropriate .
The check it up .
This image didn &apos;t have been taken with a microscope microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a molecule that we can see the microscope that we can see the microscope .
These are photos that coprone of about six seconds .
This is the publipublization that we did a little bit of time ago .
They are more than 580,000 letter code .
It &apos;s the biggest molecule , the largest molecule .
It has a weird molecular weight at 300 million .
If we &apos;re going to be a 10 without spaces , we would like 142 pages only to transmate this genetic code .
Now , how do we do that ? how can we think about it ?
Of course , you take a virus is a game .
It &apos;s a little more complicated when they use bacteria .
It &apos;s more simple as well as it is eucarious cells as our : you can just extract nuclear and put another , which is basically the clonation of clonation .
In the archaea , the chromosome is , instead of integrated in the cell , but we recently demonstrate that we are able to do a complete chromosome from a cell to another and to the second .
We can clean a chromosome from a little bit of a micbial species .
The two are different than the men from mice .
We add some gene in a way to decide what to have to decide what to take for this chromosome .
And then he sat with the extra flew out of all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell is studied -- and open our graph -- and open our graph -- the new chromosome is go inside the cell .
And we thought we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to try to get more in there .
This is one of the majority of evolution .
We found that tantissim species have added a second or a third chromosome from some part , add in a second thousands of new traits to that species .
So who thinks about evolution as a gene , as a gene , it doesn &apos;t understand much part of biology .
There &apos;s a filled called &quot; remarkable to return out of remarkable to make DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell , it doesn &apos;t have one .
The phones of the chromosome that we have put it in the --
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other cromosome as a material , the masticated , and we found with only only the cell cell and the new chromosome .
It became blue because of the genes that we put .
And in a short short of time , all the characteristics of a species are gone , and it turned into the new software that we &apos;ve got perse in the cell .
All the protection is change , members are changed , and when we read the genetic code .
Now , this might seem to look like , genetics , but it &apos;s going to change things in a very very very very substantial .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that here is not about genesis -- but progress from three million years and a half million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion Cambrian , where they will be new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty obvious when we think about our needs .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion and a half billion in the next 40 years .
Right ? I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one in 1946 ; in 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find food , water , fresh and the clean , medicine and wellin for six billion and a half billion people .
It &apos;s going to be more to be able to nine billion .
We use more than five billion fuel bars , more than 30 billion barrels .
That means percent millions of barrels a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or whatever , you know , it &apos;s a huge challenge .
We need to get all of CO2 emission from these materials that end up in the atmosphere .
So , by the time , thank you scientific discoveries around the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the design components for the future .
The electronic industry has only a dozen about components , and you think about how many things are coming out .
Our limits here is data from the biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have technical , because of these synthesization methods , able to create what we call genomics combinatory .
We can build a big robot that can produce a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think about processing these 20 million different genes or trying to optimistic the processes to produce opping opping or drugs , new vaccines , we can change , because of a little team , and create more biology molecular biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a selection selection .
We can choose for survival , chemical production or fuel production , or of vaccines .
This is an instantany of some software programmed that we &apos;re working to sex us to design species at the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t necessarily know how to be .
We know exactly what they know is their genetic code .
We &apos;re focusing on the fourth generation coal .
You also saw that extract you extract it from the grain was a hurt .
We have depending on the third generation and third generation that will use enough to be on the sugar , as they get a higher value of the higher value as they they put or different kinds of butanner .
But the only way biology can have a great impact without increase the price of food and limited the food and limited the food and limited the CO2 in matter , so we &apos;re working to design cells that can achieve this , and we think we can achieve this first coal , and we think that we can achieve the first coal .
The combined solar light with CO2 is a metodo--- but in our discoveries in the world , we found different metods .
This is a organism that we described in 1996 .
It &apos;s going to be the deep , at the deep ocean , at the ocean temperature of the water .
It makes metan by using CO2 using hydrogen molecular as energy source source .
We &apos;re trying to figure out if we can ing CO2 , which can easily be transported by the cubbbbbbbbbbes , to drive this process .
So we think we might be able to increase what the basic question of &quot; which is what life is life is what life is life is , &quot; We have the fashion industry .
So , what is that . If you can &apos;t do this for TED , where you can &apos;t do this for TED , where you can &apos;t do this for TED , where you can &apos;t do this for TED , where you can &apos;t this TED , where you can &apos;t do this for TED , where you can &apos;t do this for TED , where you can &apos;t do this for TED , where you can &apos;t this for TED , where you can &apos;t it ?
It would be a major source of energy .
And we &apos;re working on to use the same metods to create instantaneous vaccines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with flu , we &apos;re always back to a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s about to find the vaccine .
I think what you can change building combinable vaccines in anticipe .
Here , how the future might start seeming , right now , the tree of evolution , accellyating evolution with synthesic bacteria , and finally , cells , and finally , eucarious cells .
We are so so on to improve people .
Our purpose is to make a way to live enough to try to make birth . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the faster possible , some fundamental work , the new technology that we took the Microsoft in following a year ago . This is Seadragging .
It &apos;s a environment where you can interact is local level that remode is local level that remoon on the local level .
So we &apos;re seeing a lot of digital photos with a kind of a kind of a constant , and continuous , for a fast panoramic , we want to do .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big is the amount of information that we see , how big these data are these kinds of data or the images .
Most of the digital photographs , but this for example is a provenient scanning from the Biary of Congress , and get in in the gamma 300 megapixel .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that limited the prestations of a system like this is the number of plan as a system is the number of the screen in any moment . It &apos;s also a very flessible architecture .
This is a book of the book of data doesn &apos;t have images .
This is the Casa desolate of Dickens . Every represents a checter .
So , to be to show you that it &apos;s just about the images , we can do something like that , to try to see that it &apos;s a real representation of the tissue , not a photos .
It could be a little artificial way to read a electronic book .
I don &apos;t recommend it .
This is a more realistic example . This is a number of The Guardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you pleasure and the good experience of read the real carracy or a daily , which is to nature multiple kind of a kind of a lot of a lot of a half .
We also did something about the corner of this particular number of Guardian .
We created a public advertising advertising -- much more than what it uses in a normal publish publish -- and we put you put it in a very high content .
If you want to see the characteristic of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even specific patternical specific .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that this means that it means to put people , and to other brings like that , I didn &apos;t have to be need to be necessary .
Of course , the maps is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say we have to give you in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States , the Sovrapposes on a geospace .
So now we go to something else else .
This now is actually from the web; you can go to the web ; you can go to see it .
This is a project called Photosynth , which is fight-different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research at the very interesting computer by Noah Seadround , a student of the University of Washington , with the help of Steve Szeliski Microsoft Research Szeliski Microsoft Research .
And it &apos;s from the website , management from Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from an image to the other and have this kind of experience of resolution .
But the spacectal collocation here has actually a meaning .
The goritems of the computer , they recorded these images together , so that correspond to the remarkable places where they have the reviewed -- all the close to the launch of the Montagne Rocciose canadesies -- are now . So here you see the elements of a de-stable . So here you can see the elements of a fashion .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more spacal .
I want to go directly to one of the original data that we &apos;ve been doing this from a previous prototype of Photosynth that we &apos;ve done to work for the first time the summer time the summer of this technology , the next thing that we really think about this technology , the Photosynth of the technology , the Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily evident to the website .
We had to worry about the legal aspects and said .
This is a reconstruction of Nobody Cedral Nobody images from Flickr . Badigitititate Nobody .
So I &apos;m all images from Flickr and they were all spacaasial level in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this very simple .
You know , I &apos;d never think of the work for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifically to get this kind of accounts here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s about a lot of different kinds of phones of phones that at those phones who are at the professional .
And if I can , I try to try to try and the more strip .
Many of them are blocked by faces , etc .
So , you know , you find a series of photographs -- eccole .
This is a Nobody poster .
We can go from the poster physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is taking data from the whole memory of the whole memory of collective memory as a visual memory -- and connections all those data together .
All those photos become connected together , more than the parts .
You have a model of the earth .
Think about this as the prolungment of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It &apos;s something that grow in complexity as people use it , and the whose advantage for who are getting the use .
Their photos are marked with metads by other people .
If you are the idea of contrast , all these sounds saying , my name , my photos of the cattattedge of Nobody three Dame suddenly refence of all those data , and I can use the way to immerse in that space , in that metaphor , using the photos of the space , using the photos of the exhiero-mode and have an experience of the cross-moon .
Of course , a consequence of all of that are very extremely elaborate , of all interesting , collected by satellite images and satellite images from satellite images and similar satellite images and similar satellite .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I &apos;ve got this ? What your software is going to be to do is that at a point , in the next years , all the photographs with anyone in the entire world will be very connected ?
BAA : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is basically about it .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , you want , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the searching of information seant that many of these images possible .
As you do a research of images on the Web , you have a frase and the headline on the web has a lot of information about images .
Now , what happens if that picture is connecting all of your photos ?
So the amount of interconnected and the amount of remarkable to reach is very huge . It &apos;s a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the pleasure of the walls , and one of the ethnogical research is the way to live between who who didn &apos;t forget the antic of the people who have the past in the wind , the wave , the past in the wind , the website , the wild in the wind , the wingful in the website , the faiths of plants .
Basts to think that the sciamani Jaguar , and the idea that the Lattea , or the mites of the Inuit &apos;s still colful of the Dharma , or Himalaya , the distinctive budget the breath of Dharma , and that the world &apos;s resh , but the idea that the world we live in a sense , but it &apos;s just a sense of the world we live in a sense , but it &apos;s only a model of reality , but it &apos;s just a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stirpe has done , good or bad , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share exextra extra .
We all all of the . We all all all of the .
We are subjects to the initiation .
We need to deal with the death inesorability , so we don &apos;t surprisingly surprisingly surprisingly , we &apos;re not going to blow .
We all have an art .
What he hits is the particular roll of song , the rituals of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that are the Penan of the Borneo , or the following of the Voodoo , or the desert warriers of the Kaisnal , or the desert CCurandero , or a cammellier in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my company company , he was my journey in the desert a month ago , or a website of Qomolangma in the values of the world .
All these populations are teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And , if you reflect a moment , it &apos;s a concept that it can give you hope .
Insides , the miriades of cultures the world are a spiritual roll and cultural life that flight the planet and is important for the wealth of the planet as the biological race .
And you can think about this cultural race as a ethnosphere and you can call the ethnosphere and you can call the ethical sphere , all , with ideas , , inspired , , intuitions , inspired by the human imagination from the human imagination from the human imagination from the weline of the consciousness .
The ethnosphere is the great patriage of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be as as a kind of inquisitive .
And because the biosphere was very , very , as a success of the ethnosphere and a lot more quickly .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species has been on the orest of the summer summer , because it &apos;s flied , or -- in the most apocalittical diversity . And you don &apos;t even get a little bit of biological diversity .
The one of all of that is , of course , the loss of language .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not just compost by a vocabolarian or from a series of grammatical rules .
One language is the springing of human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle of every culture comes in the world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a stick , a thought , a thought , a spiritual possibility .
And of the 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re sitting in Monterey , at least half not the subsurrated in the ears of the kids .
They don &apos;t get more teacher to kids , which means , less you know , not , to less than the camps that they &apos;ve been dead .
What is more tristes of being wiser , of being the last talking about a language , of the last talking a language , of the case of the kids or to get the wisdom or to anticipate the promises of the kids ?
This is a few weeks of the world &apos;s been a few weeks of the world every two weeks , every two weeks , a old language and door with the housing with the last last few weeks .
And I know somebody who &apos;s going to say , &quot; Is it better ?
The world would not be a better place if we &apos;re going to go to the same language ? &quot; Benize , then we &apos;re all yoruba .
So , I talk about kogs .
You &apos;re going to get a tract thing that means you can &apos;t talk about their language .
I &apos;d like to do a journey through the etnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a round of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , &quot; different ways of exist . &quot; I mean , very different ways of exist .
We take for example of this bimbo Barasana , in Amazon Caoms , the people who create at the midance , which crees to try from the river of the latte panish pants .
It &apos;s a people that &apos;s not able to distinguish the color from the green because the blue blue as the birth of the time , which is identified in the time , which depends on the time , which depends on the forest , which is not able to distinguish the color of the green , because the celium is identified in the forest , and it &apos;s identified in the time , and it &apos;s identified in the time ,
They have a language and a matriage rule , and a matriage , called &quot; exogy language , &quot; You have to stop a person who talks about a different language .
And it has radical past , but it &apos;s the particularly , but the particularly the particularly extended in these families , extinct , which is that in these six or seven languages because of the matriries .
They limited listen and then they start talking about .
We take one of the most interesting tribe with which I lived , the Waorani of Ecuador Ecuador , an incredible populations that had the first contact of the first contact in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionary missing a very mistake .
They &apos;ve done by the top photographs that retraits in the front of the lasts , and forest that this people who was going to have ever seen nothing of the pluvial forest .
They collected the photos from the earth , they &apos;ve been taken to the research of a shape or a figure and not find out of the diavoid , and they killed five missionary missing the lance .
But the Waorani doesn &apos;t kill the foreign .
They kill them up with them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by their same .
We &apos;re saved at eight generations and we found two natural cases and we &apos;ve got two natural cases . And when we &apos;ve got a invecting one of them was invecting , and then they killed it . And then they killed it the same .
The catters were able to recognize the animal urine from 40 pass and recognize the species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned a very interesting job when my professor , he asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti , he asked me if I wanted to Haiti in the basic , the basic power of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes , and the Tonton Macahead , and the Tonton Middle .
For a sense of the miraculous , I &apos;d have to understand the Vodoun culture , and the Voodoo is not magic .
It &apos;s quite a complex view of the world .
Many interesting interesting .
If I asked you to tell me about the world &apos;s great religions , what would you say ?
Cristian , Islam , Good , Ebraism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Sharian Africa has no faith . And instead and the Voodoo is not more than the distilled by these religious religious religious .
What makes interesting the voodoo is the intense to the report between life and death .
So , the vights are going to hide the spirites .
The spirits can be invocated by the Grands Actually , they respond to the ritory of the dance and replacement temporary to the soul of the way that for a short second second , we can get the check .
For this , the woodoooists say , &quot; You &apos;re going to go to church to talk about God .
We say , we &apos;re in the temple and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment that you &apos;re going to be the spirit that you , how can can do you make it ?
So you see these incredible events : following voodoo in the state of trance that touch employed , very strong infuel , very strong demonstration of the body &apos;s mind , very strong extremely excited about the body when it &apos;s catalized in a very exciting excited .
In all the people who have been living in the most extraordinary people who have been living in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta , in Colombia sectors .
And I think of the ancient civilization that once lived on the aid career planes of the Colombia in the comfortable , the people have been able to the containment that you get on the volcanic masses that you take on the volcanic cartoic plant .
In a continent that button , this people who never have been conquitted by the spagnles .
And so , in fact , they &apos;ve been government by a click , but they &apos;re very extraordinary .
The young young folks on the families , and they live secrets to three or four years , and they live secret in a buian world , and they hit for 18 years .
Two years of nine years , they choose about to reproduce the nine months of gestation that translation of the mother , now are metaphor in the Grande Maather .
For all of this time , they &apos;re accultured to the values of their society , values that are going to prere the equilibrium , and only their prayers are going to be constantly , or to say the equilibrium .
And the term of this incredible start , they &apos;re suddenly brought out and for the first time in life , at the age of 18 , they see an alba . And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve learned about the first bright , when the sun kill the flel of the beautiful landscape , all of the time , all of the time , all that they &apos;ve learned about about this . And he said , &quot; You know , it &apos;s going to say , &quot; I &apos;m going to go back and say ,
&quot; Visice ? Proprio as I said .
It &apos;s amazing . Now it &apos;s now to you protect it . &quot;
They call the most people call the most people and say that we , brothers , are the colpful colpful colpping of the world .
This is extremely important .
When we think about the Indigene and the environment we invoon the environment , and the old history of the noble selection , which is a ropping concept , or maybe invode Thoreau and we say that these people are more neighborhood at the Earth of us .
The Indies are not nine sensitive , nine is nurture by the nostaly .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the Asmat the Asmat the Asmat the Tibet , but thank you very much of the time and rituals , they created a mystic of the Earth , not about the concept of the execectly much , but on a very much more subsisively subject .
What does that mean ?
It means that a little girl who are going to grow up with the mountain is a spirit of the mountain is a spirit of the Apu that will be a depor that will be deeply different and it will be a very different , and it will be a very different , and you will be a mountain of the mountain or that a mountain of rock .
which is the dimmnow of a spirit or a mineral , is irrilevant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that define the relationship between the individuals and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia Britannics , which the forests they were going to be cut .
And that has been different from my friends Kwakiutl that people are the forests are the dimora of Hukukukukukukukukukukukle and the downnnbal cannibal , which we live in the world , the world , the beginning of the world , the spirits that we &apos;re going to the world &apos;s going to be different from the world , the world &apos;s historic .
If you start to think that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to start to understand some of the discoveries .
I &apos;ve taken this picture to open the Amazon the Amazon the Western Amazon .
Maybe some of you &apos;ve heard about the ayahead , the most powerful substance of the repertorium .
What makes it fascinating the ayahead is not the potential pharmacical potential , but its elaborate . It &apos;s what makes .
On one side , this liana legning a series of Tioline , hardly and hardly hardness , hardly housing .
And by trying to the only plant , it has a smoke that allows a little bit of consciousness , but it &apos;s mixed with the family of a caffection , and he said Psychoption .
This plant is trouble powerful powerful , very similar to the seriotonin , dimethylyptamine , dimethyptamine .
If you ever see the Yanomami pull up for the birth , the essentially that they make from a different set of species , anchy is a different kind of a different set of species , it &apos;s a different set of species , you know , if you will see Yanoms .
Tiring that dust for the birth is a little bit like to be shown from a little bit of the bull of the wild and land on a sea sea of electricity . &#91; &#91; Ris&#93; &#91; &#91; Ris&#93; &#91; &#91; &#91; Ris&#93; Not a detailing of reality .
I often got to do with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has been scatched the filled the &apos; fliquid , with his discovery of the gentlemen Mexico .
And I &apos;m my tamine , you can &apos;t classification these triptamine as alucinogens because if you &apos;re done , you can &apos;t tell anybody to be hallucined .
It &apos;s possible to be absorb the right right if they &apos;re in other chemicals that denian MAO .
Now , it &apos;s the nice : the Tialine that are in this liana are ininjitors of MAO , the same kind of need to be able to be able to be able to express the trippping tripping . The sister spontaneous species of plants , like these people are two morfological people who are going to find two morfological chemical . But if you combined this , you have a version of the parts of the parts of the other ?
We use the great eufemale and the error of the error , which can reveal infrued by the way ,
But if we ask Indians , we ask the Indians , &quot; The plants are talking about . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribes , Cofan , has 17 variety variety of ayahead , which can tell you , and our eyes would come into the forest , and our eyes would come to the same species .
If we ask them how they think about their tasses will say , &quot; I thought , &quot; I thought I understand it was a plants , of the rest of the people who don &apos;t know everything ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take 17 variety in a night of the lun and each night in a dinner .
So , you don &apos;t have laurea at Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than to count the stami .
Now , , , like , &quot; the problem is that also the ones of us that have to the indees are pushing them , but somehow reduced to our margines , and it &apos;s going to be beyond our real world , and passage .
In fact , the 20th century , in 300 years , it &apos;s not going to remember the same as we are in the technological innovations , but rather like the one was where we stop and abbracked and we abbracked the biological mass and cultural .
All the cultures are involved in a dance for new possibility of life .
And the problem is not technology .
Indian Indian Sioux , they don &apos;t stop being Sioux when they put from the arco and frecent as Americans have no stop being American when they put from the horse and hot .
It &apos;s not change or technology that mindset of ethnosphere . It &apos;s the power .
The hard hard hard to domination .
And if you give a look at the world , I find that these are not destined to disappear .
They &apos;re living creatures and the spines out of the existence from the forces that go beyond their adaptment .
My devices that you disbosyssamp in the Penan --
a nomads of Sarawak , in the southern , a people who have lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to a generation ago , and now reduced to the next titution , where you can see the river , where you can see the river river , where you can see the river of the willuminate , where the napapes are born with the horizon , where the wave of the horizon the horizon ,
It &apos;s ready to fill the fashion .
Or , in the case of the Yanomami , are the diseases that came with the discovery of the gold .
If we put on the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of researchers , you &apos;ll see the hard hard hard hard to see the political domination .
As you know the genocide , the extinction of a people , is convicted in universal level , but the ethnic destruction , but the etnocide , not only is to be announced , but it &apos;s celebrated in certain environments , because it &apos;s part of the development of the development of the development of the development of the development of the development of the development of the development of the style .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of Tibet until the beginning .
I &apos;ve lost 6,000 miles from Chengdu in China in Western Tibet , coming to Lhaaan , came to Lhasa with a young connection , but only came to Lhasa with a young young connection , but only came to Lhasa with a young statistics we feel talking about .
6,000 monuments sacred reduces in the dust and centers .
1.2 million people killed the military in the Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical at Panchen Lama .
The Chinese means that it was killed to the time of the Chinese invasion .
Suo guy &apos;s fed with Sua Santity in the diaspora that has brought the people in Nepal .
Sua mother was imprisoned and his cold was remote .
It was brought to birth to the age of two years , he hidden in his gonna because it couldn &apos;t live without him .
The sister , which has done the same , has been mitted in education .
A day he had injected a bulked by a chase of Mao and , for this transgrsion , was mitted to seven years .
The Tibet of Tibet can be insopportrait , but the spirit the instrument is from tener .
In the end , it all reduces a choice .
We want to live in the world monocromatic world or we want to get the policy of diversity ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before we die said that its most great landscape was that , in our view of the world , we can &apos;t just see the whole gamorful of human imagination . But one day we &apos;re going to see the whole gamorful . But a day day we &apos;re going to see it from a sleeping .
And it &apos;s about 600,000 years .
The Revolution revolution in the Revolution of the Colture , which has made us overed us to the crash of the seed , by by by the next poetry of the melt with the proscline of the art , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The industrialized world has to be 300 years .
And that &apos;s what it doesn &apos;t suggests me that we have the answers to all the challenges we &apos;re going to deal in millennia .
When to these myriades of cultures the world is asked what they want to say to be human , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all all reflid the possibility of being what we are : a kind of conscious , that it has to make all the people and the garden can fix . And there are great moments of the things .
I &apos;ve taken this picture on the end of the Sorn island of Baffin , when I went to cover with Inuit , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olayer story of his grandfather .
The Chanchnology is not always gentile with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to stare our supremate , we &apos;ve got them to hit .
The grandfather of this man refuse to go .
The family , I think for his life , he took them all the weapons , and all its attract .
You know , you know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t have the cold , they do it .
The skin the origins were made of fish in the origins of caribore in the caribore there .
The grandfather &apos;s grandfather didn &apos;t have intimistic or from the artica or the bull that suffering .
It &apos;s slow , you &apos;ve been standing in , you &apos;ve been calculated the package of focused and defected in your hand . When I did , they have been conrozen , the working with a lama .
It has sprayed salive on the side of this clock , and when I became solido , and when I became solido , he killed a dog .
It has a brighter and created a brighter , with the kick ktoracic , has embranch another dog and it &apos;s been disappeared on the banking , and it &apos;s been disappeared on the banking , and it &apos;s been disappeared .
We want to talk about horse with nothing ? &#91; &#91; Risate &#93; And this , in different ways , &#91; Applausi &#93; is symptomle of the people &apos;s resilience of the people &apos;s resilience of the world .
In the aprile 1999 , the government has reduced to Inuit , the total control of a larger territory area of California and Texas mall of the Texas mall together .
It &apos;s their new . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a independent territory .
One of the spleny of how a natione-state can reduce with his people .
And , to end , I think it &apos;s quite obvious to the ones of us was in these remote areas of the planet , make not remote .
For someone &apos;s home .
They open the boundary of human imagination that they &apos;re going to the alba . And for us all of these kids , as the dreams of our kids , become part of the geography of the hope .
So we have , we of National Geographic , we think of the politicians will never be .
We believe that polemics --
&#91; Applausers &#93; not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best institution to tell the world stories of the world . Every month our website has got 35 million visits .
156 countries are transmitted our television canal .
Our magazines are lette from millions of people .
Our work is traveling in the ethnosphere to bring our public places in the cultural places that they &apos;re going to go on and , hopefully , abbracing , abbracing for the central anthropology : the world &apos;s the world of the exist of the diversity of the world &apos;s life . And we need to find a a life of life in a world , and we need to find a life of life in a world , and we need to find a life of a world ,
where we have the wisdom of all the people can contributing our wising .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I hope to say , &quot; I hope to call it some of the things that you &apos;ve heard and try to look at some connections , in case you don &apos;t notice them .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the official dogma .
The official dogram of what ?
The official official society of all the Western industrial society . The recognition is , &quot; If we want to massive the well-being of our citizens . &quot; The way to do is massive the individual freedom . &quot;
The reason is , from a side , in fact that the freedom is in itself a value , is , pretious , essential for human beings .
And the other is in fact that if we are free , each one of us can act to do all of what massive massive massive is , no one that decide that we have no one name .
The way to massive the freedom is massive .
And more choices the people have , more libing , and more is their freedom , and more is their well-being .
This is , I think , is so deeply radicated in society that nobody would dream to put it in the doubt .
And it &apos;s also deeply radical in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly great .
I hope to get a simple note about the conditions for injump .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without contact the 10 variety of oliium extravert , 12 acets whales you can buy a number number of people who you can buy for a number of the world &apos;s world &apos;s going to be a number of the world .
Here &apos;s what the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic store : the electronic store : the CD , radio , the CD , radio , radio , plastra , amplificer .
And in this single electronic store , there &apos;s a great audio number of audio .
We can make six and a half million different combinations using components that there are in a only store .
You have to put that there &apos;s tantially much choice .
Other fields : the world of communications .
And once , when I was a child , they could get all the phone services , at the floor that they provides from mamma Bell .
They had noleged the phone , you didn &apos;t buy it .
One consequence of that , one one of the phone never .
These times I went .
We now have a variety of phone , especially between phones , especially between cell phone .
Here &apos;s the phones of the future .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , cut cut , cut the birds , and forth to the kick chcheck , and forth to the kill crk .
If you haven &apos;t seen the store in the store , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , if you didn &apos;t have the case .
And what &apos;s the end is that people get in the negotives and it makes this question , what &apos;s the answer ? The answer is &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a phone that doesn &apos;t too too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the acquiring bull the same explosion of choices .
Assistence : It doesn &apos;t happen in the United States that you &apos;re going to go from the doctor and the doctor you know what you have to do .
Instead , you &apos;re from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; Okay , we could do A , or B , &quot; A has these benefits and these risks &quot; B has these benefits and these risks . And these benefits these benefits and these risks . And what do ? &quot;
Tu Dr. said , &quot; Dr. , what would I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A has these benefits and these risks , and B has these benefits and these benefits . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebits , &quot; Dr. if she was me , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result we call it &quot; authonomy of the malmalate , &quot; expression that it does it look like a nice thing .
But it &apos;s not that a shift and the responsibility of the weight and the responsibility of making decisions from someone knows something , and it &apos;s the doctor , and almost sick , and it &apos;s not a good thing -- and so it doesn &apos;t know , and it &apos;s not the patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing of products , the direct of the drugs , as you , if you think you think it &apos;s not no sense , because we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why they advert them ?
The answer is that they want to ask the doctor to ask them the round to ask them .
Something about this as the thing is our orthan our orthan is a question of choice , as you see in this vignant , &quot; We don &apos;t want to forget the kids . They &apos;re going to be a very right now . &quot; We don &apos;t have to invent .
And we can reinventing how many times we &apos;re going to reinventing us .
The one that means that every morning , you have to decide that kind of person to be .
I &apos;m going to get the family and the matriage , a long time , the perspective , almost for anyone , was that you had the most presents as possible , and you start to make the most presents .
The only true choice was with who , not when and even what to do after .
So , it &apos;s really to play .
I teach students very smart students , and I &apos;m going to 20 percent in a time .
And not because they &apos;re less brilliant , not because they are less diligenes .
But why are I &apos;m imbilities , I mean , I should be asking or not ? I should be doing it ? &quot;
&quot; I should be going to get later ? I got to think before the kids or the career ? &quot;
They are logical interrogative .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this implic uncomplete the companies that assemble and not get a nice voice to my exam .
And they have to do that . They &apos;re important questions .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , as Carl underlying , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from every day , except from the Hotel Randolph .
And I &apos;m going to tell anybody , there &apos;s a coroline , and I won &apos;t tell anybody what the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t tell you , why I want to use it .
What does this incredible freedom of choice that we have about this work ? It &apos;s that we have to continuously decide , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son play with the phone , with the phone in a pocket , the Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the notion .
And even if they &apos;re all spending , every minute we see our son , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; I &apos;m also asking , &quot; I need to answer this ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? I have to email this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is &quot; no , &quot; all of this makes the experience of your son very different son from what it would be in other conditions .
So , anywhere we look at , little things and big , things and things , life is a question of choices .
And once the world was this : That , there were some possibility , but it wasn &apos;t a question of choice .
The world today today is what &apos;s the world today : The dilemma is , &quot; What &apos;s a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Solden .
So the positive layers know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative .
All this is about two negative effects of the people .
The first , paradoxically , it &apos;s products paralysis that it .
So , you know , it becomes very difficult to do that .
You give you a significance example : a study of the flight of flying flying .
A connected to the data at the data of Vanguard , the giant society of the funds , with about a million clients .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offering in more , the percentage of adesion two percent .
With 50 office , there &apos;s 10 percent of less than adesions when they &apos;re available to when they &apos;re available only five . Why ?
Because with 50 sources of which choose , is sick to decide , and choice is going to decide , and choice is reduced to the intomorrow .
And in tomorrow , and I still ask tomorrow , and of course tomorrow .
You know that doesn &apos;t only mean that these old working on the old who are food for the cans because they &apos;re not enough money , it &apos;s so much money , it &apos;s so so dator that they lose the complementary of work .
Not participating , they &apos;re lying to five to five dollars for a year from the dator of work , which would be very dispost to versars them .
So the paralysis a consequence of have too choose .
And I think that &apos;s the world .
&quot; And to end , for the ethernity : ketchup , or maionese ? &quot;
You would want to take the right decision , if it &apos;s for the ethernity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to pick the wrong wrong , and yet the condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that if we can avoooid the paralysis and to be a choice , at the end we &apos;re less options that we were with less options between which choose .
And this for a different reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions of which you choose , and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have been better . And what &apos;s going on is that the alternative . And what &apos;s happening is that the alternative to be better . And what &apos;s happening is that the alternative to be satisssssatisfaction the sfacing the satisfaction , and the repage of the decision , and the reflation of the decision ,
even when it was a very good decision .
The more choices are , more easy to display any detailed that is insfacing than than option .
And of course , there is what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has been very well stamine as the value that we are the value that we are the things that we compare .
So , when there are a lot of options , it &apos;s easy to represent the alternative of alternative shot and be less sation-constitude and to be less sation-constantly option that you have choice .
Here &apos;s a example . I took all of the ones that are not New York .
But that &apos;s what you probably think you &apos;re going to think .
There &apos;s this copy to Hamptons .
A place of lusse .
Spire splendida . Ottma . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not going to be . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , it &apos;s Agust . &quot;
&quot; Everybody my neighborhood at Manhattan are on . &quot;
&quot; I could talk about the home . &quot;
And it &apos;s going to be two weeks from the idea that &apos;s losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The costo-opportunity to demining the sationsfacation for what we have , even when choice was excellent .
And more are the options that we have to think , more the actual characteristic .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is living us , it says a lot of things .
There &apos;s about living the moment , and maybe of living on the time .
But the most important point is that anything you choose , you choose to not do the other .
The things that we don &apos;t pick out of the attractive that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : the growing of the expectations .
I &apos;ve tried to my skin bought a new couple of jeans .
I &apos;m almost always jeans .
And you know , jeans were just a bestone , they bought them and bought them up , they were scomodisdisappears , just after they took them a life life and they were a lot of times , they start to go right .
So , I went to bought a couple of new when those old who went , and I said , &quot; I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
The committed me , &quot; Li wants to do , &quot; You know , you know , fit ? &quot;
You want to do it , or with the button ? &quot; Stonewashed , &quot; or &quot; aciddle &quot; or &quot; aciddle ? &quot;
&quot; Li : &quot; Will you ? &quot;
&quot; You know , I want to do it wire or stretch ? Bla &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was sent , and after a little bit I was able to say , &quot; I want the kind of , &quot; I want the only guy , &quot; it was so for a time I was going to have all the maledetached jeans , and then I came out of the gycle , and then I got out of the gycle , and I was the best couple of jeans that I &apos;ve ever had .
It was the very very . With all that choice .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse that I was worse that my choice , my expectations were altissue , jeans had to be perfect .
And I had expected to be minimum . I didn &apos;t expect anything about this exist when you saw 100 different , but when you live in 100 different , stead , at least a kind of a perfect .
What I had bought was good , but not perfect .
After I started to have the chose with what I was trying to do insationed to the expectations .
The add of options in life of people don &apos;t do that increase the expectations that these are the excellence of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the people don &apos;t do that to increase the excellence of the options of the options of the people don &apos;t do that
And this will be less sation-sation-bulull .
No one in the world of marketing if it &apos;s made .
Because if they knew it , you would not know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth of the most of the truth .
&quot; You know , he was better when you were worst , &quot; The reason he was better when you was worst when you were worst when you could meet the surround of the pleasure .
So , in the world where we live -- opulent , industrialized citizens with the expectancy of perfetion -- the very we can hope is that things are at the althetic .
You never surprised pleases because your expectations , because your expectations , you &apos;re ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Baswaiting . &quot;
I mean , little authobiographic moment -- that I &apos;m really sposted and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t have to do better , I didn &apos;t have to do better , I wasn &apos;t .
But it doesn &apos;t always be a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of the bought a couple of jeans , when there &apos;s only that kind of jeans is that when you &apos;re not sation-made , and you ask you , why ? &quot;
&quot; Who &apos;s responsible ? &quot;
The world is the responsible . What could I do ?
When you have hundreds of jeans , and you buy a insssationist , and you ask you who is the responsible , is the clear that responsible , is the true true , you know , the responsible you &apos;re .
You could have done better .
With hundreds of variety variety , we don &apos;t know ,
So when people make decisions , even if the result is valido , you feel inssatisfaction and damage the same .
In the last years , depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a factor factor -- not the only , but important -- of this wave of depression is that people have delusional experiences because they are too alts .
And when they have to explain this this is their own .
So the end is that in the final result is that in the general , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely flied . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no duby that a little bit of choice is better than I didn &apos;t have any of it , but from this doesn &apos;t have a lot better choice than a little bit better .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic value . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we have supersince a piece of the level where they choices are to improve our life .
Now , from politician -- I &apos;ve got almost finished -- from political view , the nocy is the following .
What it allows all this in industrial society is the require .
There are many places in the world , and you know about you know , where the problem is not that they have too choice .
The problem is that they have too paired .
So the factory I &apos;m talking about is a malent to be exclusive than modern society , recipe that society .
And what it makes depressing and array is this : Steve Levitt told you yesterday about how those expensive expensive seats are inutives . It &apos;s a spread of money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and dispendious , it &apos;s not that they are just inutilize them .
I &apos;m deleterie .
They do worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows allows , you to have a lot of choice , not only be their life to improve , but our our .
This is what economists call a improvement of the improve of this .
It &apos;s a replacement revention of income , not just to the poor -- because of this choice in excess that we &apos;ve got to go .
So to end , &quot; Fille , you can get all what you want &quot; --
You know , people of culture , you think , &quot; But what &apos;s a fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t make anything in a glass of the glass . &quot;
&quot; A unclearly imagination , a limited view of the world --
and I &apos;m going to be interpretated so , at the beginning .
But then , thinking , instead , I realized that that the fish knows the long time .
Because the reality is that if you &apos;re managed in frankon , so that it &apos;s possible , &quot; You don &apos;t get freedom . You don &apos;t get freedom . You can &apos;t get freedom .
If you break the bocking of the way that all of the dimines that we can diminds the satisfacation .
You want to get the paralysis , and you reducing the well-being .
They all need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too strange , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the asymous of the sphere is a recipe for injobs and , I &apos;m , tempting , for rovine .
Thank you very much of the heart .
