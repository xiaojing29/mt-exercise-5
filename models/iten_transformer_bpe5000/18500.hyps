Last year I showed these slides to demonstrate that the glacial calculate , which is about three million years had the size of 48 , the U.S. U.S. U.S. continents , the size of 48 .
But it &apos;s going to put this underlying the gravity of the problem because it &apos;s not exhip of ice .
The glacial calving is , in a sense , the heart of climate system .
It &apos;s been expanded and retreat .
The next few slides will be a remarkable revenue to the last 25 years .
The glaciers have been signed in red .
You know , you see , they go to the blue dark .
That &apos;s the winter ice , which is a halling ice .
You can see that the cost-ice constitute , five years or more , is like , that there was a blood , which is a blood , which is that there was a fighting here .
In 25 years , it was so that .
This is a problem because the interests of the rap land around the arttic ocean where there are huge amount of coal , where there are huge amount of fuel that , skiing , they &apos;re transform into metane .
I &apos;m going to the total of the atmosphere of global warming , that amount of global warming , that amount of the way , that &apos;s going to be doubling .
In some lagues in Alaska little profound in Alaska a little bit of the water .
The professored Katey Walter of University of Alaska was a team print that was a team print that last winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You &apos;re good . The question is if we &apos;re going to be .
And that &apos;s why this termal exchange the Groenland from the north .
This is a river in regimes .
And he had never reached that that has never achieved that .
This is the Kangerlussuap , in the southern ovest of the Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea level to the skiest on land , here is where the sea is where it &apos;s reaching .
These currents are increasing rapidly .
On the other part of the planet : Antarctica , the largest block of the planet .
The last month scientists have detailed that the balance of ice is in negative , and the Western Antarctttica , which is particularly in the sun , is particularly quick in the sun .
It &apos;s about six feet feet of the foot , like Groenland .
Sull Himalaya , the third largest block of ice , you see new lakes , which a few years ago were glacies .
The 40 percent of the world &apos;s population was going to get half of the water from that slum .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the water of this city .
The ported is increased .
But when it demines , the same is happening to the water .
In California , the snow on Sierra Nevada is demining of 40 percent .
The hyririries are in crisis .
The previous predictions , as you read , they &apos;re grave .
The growing safe in the world leads to a remarkable remarkable .
The environmental disaster are increasing to a rhythm outside of normal and unprecedents .
Four times more than many many people in the last 30 years I was going to be in the last 30 years .
This is a lot of insustainable .
If you look in the historical context , you can see the consequences .
So , the last five years , we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the place of the Pacific East , the Americans , from the Americans , to the United States of the subcontinent , where there &apos;s a rooth impoverment of the oxygen in the ocean .
The greater cause of global warming , with deforestation , which is the use of fossil fuels .
The oil is a problem , and coal is even worst .
The United States is one of the two countries with more emissions , and China .
And he proponed to build a lot of other central central .
But we &apos;re seeing a change change of the direction .
These are the annullated projects in the last years and some alternative proposes .
So anyway , there &apos;s a struggle in our country .
The industrial and oil industrial , they spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote cocoal , which is a hosymymphones .
That picture me reminds me something --
Verse Natale , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion litri wasters .
You may have seen it on the news .
This is the second largest flow in America .
It was all around Natale .
I &apos;m going to advertising one of the coal industrial was this .
I &apos;m going to go to the carbon â™« Frosl carbon is a very nice , and I &apos;m happy .
It &apos;s above here in America , and it grow our economy .
Frosl carbon is always more clean .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and the workplace .
Al Gore : From here is most of the coal West Virginia .
The largest minerary society on Massey Coal . This is its administrator . This is its administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I &apos;ll be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosy , Harry Reid -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore . So the Alleance for the Protection of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Attore : At the next ALergy we see climate change as a weird threat to our business .
So for our priorities is to invest a big amount of money in a publicitary to make public and confused the truth on the coal .
In fact , coal is not spork .
We think it &apos;s pulit -- it also has a good profumo .
So you don &apos;t prevent climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Attore : Carbon , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
So , let &apos;s do a turn around a structure to avanguard for how you can can get a four-up structure .
Straordinary ! Straordinary ! Sorose is a little rumorous technology , but that &apos;s the sound of the fuel technology .
The coal consumption is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology that you see change everything .
You have a look at this : this is the hate technology of pulit .
Al Gore : The end , the positive alternative is connects to economic and the national security .
Video : Complan : America is in crisis ; the national security , climate crisis .
The filter that connects all : our dependence from fossil fuels , like the spork and oil oil .
Now , there &apos;s a new , audacy solution to use it .
Real America : 100 percent clean energy in 10 years .
A plan to reach America to work , make us more safe , and help us stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that bought to solve our problems .
Real America . Scoprite more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Complan : It &apos;s about reducing energy to America .
One of the faster ways of getting the dependence of the fuel of the fuel that killing our planet .
Comparsa : The future is here . I &apos;m going to be here .
Compan : Number two : New York investiments for jobs .
Complplan : Real . It &apos;s time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old lunch African says , &quot; If you want to go fast , go from alone .
If you want to go away , go together . &quot;
We have to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I was a introduction on the LHC .
And promises to come back to the way to reach you to how the machine works .
So , I &apos;m here . And for those other time , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever attempt -- 27 kilometers of circumconference .
Her task is is to rear the conditions that were less than a billiondest from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
That &apos;s just environmental .
This is the machine under Ginevra .
So , we go through these mini-Big Bang inside the relevers .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- is large-foot diameter diameter diameter &apos;s 22 meters .
This is a picture of ATLAS in building that you can see the proportions .
The 10 secret of the last year we have pushed the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by AS .
It was because of immense festhes in control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first fashion of particles that had done all the LHC , entring in collision , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles inside the LHC , and spread in the relever .
In other words , when we saw that the 10 secrets , we realized that the machine worked , which was a great vittory .
I don &apos;t know if it was going to be able to do it , when somebody went on on Google and saw that the front page was this .
That means we &apos;ve had a cultural impact beyond the scientific .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , we had to do this , just these films here -- these dored films .
These filters bring 13,000 ampampwhen the machine works at the very much of the power .
Now , technical , between you will look at the films and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . They &apos;re films too much . &quot;
And instead of them can do it because when they &apos;re very cold , they &apos;re very colorn superbits .
So , at least 271 degrees , to a temperature temperature in the space between stars , these films can bring that current .
In one of the giunture between the most novels of the magnees in the LHC , there was a defect of factory .
So the films reheated up , and the 13,000 ampampete suddenly met a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , that &apos;s more impressive if you think that these magnees over 20 tons , and that they have been moved about 30 centimeters .
They &apos;re damaged about 50 magnees .
We had to take them , what we did .
We repristinted and wouts .
They &apos;re now coming back to their underground .
I end up the march of the LHC will be again ,
We &apos;re going to go , and we expect to the data or the lue , and we keep our adventure to find out what the universe is .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these crosses reach the dibatch on the value of science and engineering . It &apos;s easy to constitute . It &apos;s easy to contain .
I think that &apos;s so difficult , the fact that &apos;s done , I think that &apos;s the value of things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of a English scientist Inglese , Humphrey Davy , which is , I guess , in the defense of his own clean , his clean was Michael Faraday , he said , &quot; Nient is so dangerous for human mind as the progress of human mind as the science as the human thinking about science as it is definitely , there are no mysters in nature , and that we don &apos;t complete exts are new , and that we don &apos;t exact . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start asking for rethink about when you , you know , you play with kids ,
As you could get to how to reach them and get them , and you learn them , and you learn them , and you know , actually , and by the space space .
The space is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , by the useful information of our interaction with physical objects , with physical objects , with my consulent , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to ask , &quot; And if , when we use a computer , instead of having the only cursor of the mouse as a a digital poltract as a digital poltract as a digital poltrel , we could have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to sevent with both ,
and I pleased it to our pleasure ?
The question was so interesting that I decided to explore the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a computer interactive computer as a biscan .
In a few words , a Siftable is a computer interactive computer as a biscan .
You can move with them , you can see them , they can see them , &quot; they can see their movement and they have a screen and a radio wireless radio .
But I &apos;m whose morning , they &apos;re physicists , like the morning , you can just move it out .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physicists , conscious of the other movement , and as they become more physicists , and as they become more physicists , conscious of the motion , other , how we can can explore new and fun styles .
I &apos;m going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show video : if you start to the video : if you start , the video is going to rotate that , if you get on the other hand back .
These interactive remarkable is aware of the other people .
If I &apos;m interested in , they &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re going around .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can see it and they can be agitating a little bit .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can see it and they can be agitating a little bit .
They also also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting interesting implications of the interaction was that we could use common gestures on data , to example , &quot; a color like if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configured like a bunch of shelf and I can use them to the central color in that central , where they &apos;re missing .
And I can use them to the central color in that central , where they &apos;re missing .
So , you can get too , we can put a little bit of place .
I &apos;m also beautiful possibilities of learning , like the languages , like the languages , the mathematics and logical games where people can try things fast , and see the results .
Now , I &apos;m --
This is a Fibonacts of Fibonacts that I do with a program .
So here we have a words that is half between Scarabeo and Boggle .
And that is basically , at every turnone of the Siftears , it &apos;s basically , in every Siftool on Siftable , and while you &apos;re trying to understand him on a Siftable , and while you &apos;re trying to do it .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you get a new set of letters and new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
So here &apos;s the children came in in the Media Lab , I did so that I went and turned them a video .
They were very liked .
And one of the interesting things that kind of apply is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
You just have to say , &quot; You know , &quot; You know , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
So here &apos;s other people coming .
This is our beta tester tester , there on the right .
It actually wanted to be impllary .
They were only morning , for him .
Now , that &apos;s a applied of a interactive cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool for learning . He &apos;s called Felix . He &apos;s Felix .
It can actually put new characters in the scene , soleving the Siftake-up .
It can actually put new characters in the scene , soleving the Siftake-up .
So , he &apos;s getting the sun .
Video : The sun is surviving .
David Merrill : Now he took a treatment in the scene .
Video : The arancium treor .
Bobs !
So , by the Siftttool and put close them up , can be interacting the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing their own story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a final story with open , and it can decide him as it is smooth .
DM : It &apos;s a final story with open , and it can decide him as it is smooth .
Video : Vola , gat .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , made , I made , to sample and to do music .
It &apos;s a tool , which is a recent , to sample and perform music .
The Siftable here are ags , as the low , and the battery .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can pick it out of them .
You can also also also put these sounds in a sequence to comcompose on your pleasure .
And it just just touch a sound and a sound and a sequence . &quot;
So , these are actually that you can control from the vivious , like the reverse and the filter .
It &apos;s acks to a particular particular sound and then incline for wider .
And then there are general effects as long and volume , that &apos;s apply .
Let &apos;s look at how it works .
DM : DM : We &apos;re going to start putting a base in two Siftool , &quot; We put them into a series , we add into a series , we add . Let &apos;s go , add it .
Now , I put a line line .
DM : DM : Now I &apos;m going to add on percussions --
Video : DM : And now I &apos;ll put the filter to the battery , so I can control the vivive effect from the vive .
DM : DM : I can reach the whole sequence of inclining the whole time from one side or the other .
Video : DM : And now I &apos;ll go the bottom to the bottom to give more expression .
DM : DM : I can get to the sequence of the flight .
So I didn &apos;t have to plan to plan it , but I can suddenly make it more straight .
And now , finally , I can smoke the whole sequence of inclining the Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new human interfaces , more more more more more like how we work to work our brain and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that we &apos;re coming this new generation of things that we &apos;re going to bring on digital media , which will lead information in our world .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the hour of talking to all of you .
I &apos;m a writer .
I &apos;m going to be a profession , but it &apos;s more of this , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the love of my life .
And I don &apos;t look like it can change .
But , I said , something particular happened in my life , and my career , which led me to report the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called &quot; Manegy , Prega , &quot; which , in my previous books , for some reason came out of my earlier books , for some reason , and bestseller .
And the result is that everywhere now , people are now , people treat me as if I was convicted .
I &apos;m going to be a bunch , conducted .
They &apos;re going to be now all worried and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t have a little bit more to do ?
You don &apos;t fear to keep write all the life without able to create a book that can importantly create a book that can importance to somebody ? &quot;
what can you care about somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s resurrassuring , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember that I remember that over 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a scritual -- I was a written .
I would go to the same reaction of the fear reaction .
And people say , &quot; Don &apos;t you temple to have succeed ?
You don &apos;t have fear that the ulililiant &apos;s killed ?
You don &apos;t have fear to do this to be all of the life without anything that &apos;s ever out and to die on a cumb clock with the mouth of wild cums ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
Yeah , I &apos;m afraid of all of those things .
I always had a little bit of the time .
And I also fear of many other things that people don &apos;t have to be initiate .
As the algae and other things slowly .
But as I &apos;m about writing what I thought and I would ask me , and I would ask me , why ?
Is it rational rational ?
It &apos;s logical that anybody should be waiting for being frightened by a work that sent slow to do .
But what &apos;s so particular in the creative entry is so particularly about the mental health health as as as a more carefully , they don &apos;t they ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemistry engineering and I don &apos;t remember one once in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if she was a afraid to be engineer ?
There was never -- that blockage of the engineering John , how does it go ?
It didn &apos;t work that , you know ?
Onestly , the engineers as a group don &apos;t have certainly , in centuries , gain , gain , reputation of being alcolized .
We writers , we have enough this reputation , and not only only writers , but creativity , we have this reputation of being enormous unbelievable .
And it doesn &apos;t have another to look at the tristes of creative magnifies that only in the 21st century , just died young and often by their own .
And the ones that don &apos;t have suicidated seem to be really disappeared by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , &quot; Each book has been killed to me a little more &quot; A little more , a great deal about their life .
But I don &apos;t bunch when we feel like to say because we &apos;ve heard these things so long that somehow we &apos;ve completely interized and accepted the notion that creativity and the suffering is in some way , and the suffering are in some ways of the angoses , to always end , and the end ,
And the question I want to ask all over here today is : Would you agree with this idea ?
And it goes to that -- because it &apos;s also looking for a centimeter to me not that well for nothing to me .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous and I don &apos;t want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better encourage our big creative creative minds to live .
And certainly I know that , in my case -- in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to that I felt dark for the dark of support of the support of the workplace in which I &apos;m in my career .
That is -- you know , I &apos;m quite young , I &apos;m quite young , I &apos;m quite a 40 years .
I still have about four work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that everything is writing now in the world , and then it &apos;s going to be right from the world as the work that was in my last book .
I &apos;ll be slaved , because we &apos;re all more or less friends here -- is likely that my greatest success is to my bedroom .
Oh , Gesus , who thought .
You know that &apos;s the kind of thinking that &apos;s a person to start double with the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would refer to do this work that we love .
So , the question is , how do it , how ?
And so it seems after a lot of reflective , that the way to work to keep write is what to create a real psychological construct , right ?
I have to find a safety distance of me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural advanced that it can written out of what I wrote to it , and I was trying to look for other societies , to find other societies to see if they could have better ideas and more and more sane safety to see if they could have better ideas and more and more sane safety . And as I was trying to find more more ,
how to help people people to manage the emotions of the risk of creativity .
And that research led me to the ancient Great and ancient Rome .
Slow me because I &apos;m going to go back and then torn back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
And it was thinking that creativity was this spirit looks like this and that came to a few men from a few distant , and unknown .
The great-called these spirits divini guards of creativity . &quot;
Soccurred , wonderful , he believed to have a demon that elargive saggeises from far .
The Romans were the same idea , but they call that kind of a spirit .
The Romans didn &apos;t think that a really really , because the Romans didn &apos;t think that a kind of a particularly intelligent .
They believed that a genius was this kind of divine that was believed in the lawalls of a neighbor , a little bit like the elf , and it sell the walls , and that sell out to be the work of hidden the work of the artist .
So , here &apos;s a big deal , that is the distance of which I &apos;m talking about -- that &apos;s the psychological construction that you have been in your work .
And everybody knew that was so that it worked , right ?
So , antiists were protected by certain things , like , for example , the way , for example , the way , not ?
If your work was exceptional , you couldn &apos;t get it all the meritch , everybody knew that she was helped by this genius .
If your work failed , it wasn &apos;t all your own , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a binable .
And so people have han conceived creativity in the Western for a long time .
Then the Renaissance came and everything , and it changed this big idea ; we put the human being in the center of the universe over all of the universe over all of the universe over the minds and no longer to leave space to the mess .
This was the principle of the rational principle and people started thinking that creativity came out of their own idividust .
And for the first time in history , you start to get this or that artist , is how to a kind of a rather than a person with the genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think it &apos;s allowed somebody , a simple person to believe that they &apos;re like a recient , like the source , and the surrounts of all the mysters , creative , unknown and unknown and etheless and etheless , and unknown and ethernicous , and unknown to the fragile pon the pieces of human .
It &apos;s how to ask somebody to enjoy the sun .
It &apos;s details completely completely unexpected on the performance .
And I think it was this pressure to destroy the artists in the passed 500 years .
And if that &apos;s true , and I think that is , and I think that is , and now ?
We can do it diversity ?
Maybe go go to a more ancient understanding of human relationship and mystery .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can &apos;t get 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And they probably have people in the audience who would be reading scientific suspects on the notion of the notion , they do that they follow people are going to be willing or fit on their projects .
I &apos;m probably not really really really really really convey to you all about this .
But the question I would like to ask is , why not ?
Why don &apos;t you think about this way ?
Because it has more sense of everything that I &apos;ve ever heard to explain the explanning the imprevedibility of the creative process .
And a process that , as anyone who has been attempt to do something -- so , basically , all here -- you don &apos;t really understand rationally .
And in fact , it can sometimes look completely paranorly .
I did this reverse with the extraordinary poetest Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but it was a poem for all life and said that during the Virginia , working out in the rural Virginia , working out in the fields , and it felt , inside if a poem came from the landscape .
He said , &quot; I was like a frageous train .
And he came up to her from the landscape .
It was a little bit of the land under his feet under its feet .
He knew that I had one thing to do to do at that point and was , he said , &quot; run like a match . &quot;
And so it was going to house and it was chicken by this poem , and it wouldn &apos;t have to be able to get a piece of paper and a matched enough , as the trapp , and it turns out to be it , and it turns out to the page .
And sometimes I couldn &apos;t be fast enough , so correcal , so correct and correct without getting to get into home and her poem , and she would continued to roll through and she would continue to roll through the landscape , trying to be , as she said , &quot; another poet . &quot;
Then there were those times -- this piece never forget -- there were moments where it was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was trying to be trying to paper and poem the poem , and he said , &quot; that she was going , and then he said , &quot; that was like , if you were going to be allowed with the other hand and the carrit .
It was going to be poem from and he repair it in his body and transform it on the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page , but the contrary , from the last word to the first word to the first word .
So when I was thinking -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly the same same as a big as it as a big as it as I was as a big as it as I was in my creative process .
Not all of my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conducucucucture .
I &apos;m a mula , and my way to work is is ; I wake up the same orar every day and sweet and work and passing up and work and passing up .
But even I &apos;m even in my clothes , I &apos;ve got strike against that thing , sometimes .
And I guess that I also think many of you the han did .
You know , even if the work and ideas came from me from a certain source of them , I wouldn &apos;t be honestly know .
And what is this is this ?
And how can we relate to it to it , so that we don &apos;t have to lose the head , but rather , what does it remains ?
As I &apos;m about , the best example of the contemporary example I have is the Tom Waits , which I interviewed different years ago for a journal .
We &apos;re talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of the life was been the incarnation of the same artist , trying to control , to be able to control , to be able to be able to be able to control , and we &apos;re totally interorized .
But then I invecked , he hot , and he was driving on a self-building in Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
He was going fast and all of a very quickly , this little framework of melodia , which comes in in his head as a inspiration , and the training , and the desidera , and the desidera , but it doesn &apos;t know how to take it .
It doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a mature .
So he starts to hear this kind of old anxiety , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose it , and I &apos;ll be able to lose ,
I &apos;m not enough , I can &apos;t do enough , I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to go into the panic , they stopped .
I &apos;ll have to do the whole whole whole whole whole new process .
He just looked at the sky and said , &quot; I &apos;m not driving that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Do you look like , &quot; Do you know , you know , right now ?
If you really want to be there , I &apos;m going to get care of you .
Althertherwise , you go to importantly someone else today .
I go to disturbing Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his work process changed after that .
Not the work , the work was still dark as always always as .
But the process , and the anxiety of the anxiety , and the genius that was going out of him , the genius that was going to be a none of the problems and freezing it back to where it was , to be a interhorized thing that it was interhorized , and the gotten .
but it &apos;s so good , it &apos;s wonderful , wonderful , a conversation between Tom and this straight , and that it was not Tom .
So how the story I was going to change a little bit of the way I was working and already saved me a time .
This idea , I &apos;ll save me when I was writing , &quot; Mangia , Prega , &quot; and fall in a cave of the disperation where we &apos;re all working on something and we &apos;re all working on something and we don &apos;t have and start thinking that &apos;s going to be a disaster , which is the worst book .
Not just bad , just the worst book written .
And I started thinking about gacing this project .
But I remind of Tom , who was talking to the air and I tried .
So I got my face on on the manoscritical and I removed my to a place of the room .
And I said , high voices , &quot; Sents , what both of them know , if this book will not be brilliant , it &apos;s not going to be a good cold , right ?
Because I &apos;m going to see on what I &apos;m putting on all I have , I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to present you and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what I don &apos;t do it .
I &apos;ll start to write the same because it &apos;s because it &apos;s my work .
And I would like to be recorded that I was a today today to do my part . &quot; Because the end is so , OK -- centuries does in the deserts of the North Africa of people were dances , dances and music that went on to the middle of the lands , dances and the household .
And they were always magnifies because the ballerers were great professionals and they were fantastic .
But every time , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became actually transcendent reality .
And I know what I &apos;m talking about what I know , because I know that you &apos;ve all seen , at a certain point , a performance .
It was like the time stopped , and the ballerin walking through a kind of portal , and it was not doing anything else else , but it was going to be done .
And suddenly , not just like a human .
But he accurts from the divinity , and on the fire fire .
And when this happened , people knew what was , people knew what was , they call it .
They were , they were to blow , &quot; Allah , &quot; Allah , Allah , God , God , &quot; God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
I &apos;m noticed historical -- when the Moretry of Spn , I preserve this abitude with them and the ready and the ready to change in the centuries , Allah , Allah , Allah , &quot; Ole , &quot; the ones , &quot; which you can still hear in the corrids or flamenco .
In Spagna , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , and I &apos;m like , Allah , I &apos;m like , &quot; unbelievable , &quot; unclearly , &quot; unbelievable , &quot; Human understanding of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need .
But the problem comes after , for the ballerin the same , when you wake up and find that are 11 in the morning of Martedday and the God &apos;s one more .
It &apos;s just a dead with a lot of bad to the ginoccurred , and maybe it &apos;s not going to get more to that altitude .
And maybe nobody will dg the name of God &apos;s God as a gira , and what &apos;s going to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most porose to do in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so angoscivote , if you can &apos;t believe , advanced the most extraordinary aspects of your being being from yourself .
But it just makes you present data in a remarkable source of this team from a unimaginable source of this team of your life that you have to take somebody else when you ended .
And , you know , if we think about this way it changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s safe as I thought about it for several months in the working of the book that I &apos;ll present , the dangerous , saving , the dangerous , and it &apos;s been doing it .
And what I have to keep to tell me when I feel electrized from this is , I don &apos;t have afraid .
Don &apos;t fill you . It just just your work .
It &apos;s going to talk to you to your part , whatever it can be .
If your work is dance , you have balling ,
If the divine , absurd genius to give you a decide of a few wonderful wonderful wonderful , for a only time through your effort , then &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Otherwise , you do the same dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot; to you know the same .
I think , and I think it &apos;s weak taught .
&quot; Ole ! &quot; to you know the same , even for having a human and testestables to be able to represent you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what it can mean and the discovery of new genes .
We &apos;re starting a new perspective : we started to digital the biology and now start by that digital code , we &apos;re going into a new phase of biology , designing and synthesizing life .
We always tried to ask big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists , I think they were trying to find out out of various levels .
We &apos;ve tried different approaches , reducing it to the minimi terms .
We &apos;re digitizing about 20 years of a hour ever .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the analogical world of the digital world .
Now , we ask : can we regenerate life , or create new life , or create a new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome that can authoreplicate in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a more small .
We can get a hundred genes of the about 500 of the genes that are here .
But when we look at his map metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our .
I think , that &apos;s simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can get out , one at the time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this can bring to a living cell cell .
So we decided that the only way to designers to be synthesize this chromosome to be able to change the components to ask some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of &quot; Can we synthesize a cromosome ? &quot;
Can we have a chemistry to produce these big molecules that we never had to create before ?
And in case , we can do a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemistry material .
The speed that we &apos;re able to digitize life is growing up to the exponential .
Our ability to write the gene code , instead , instead , designers , but it &apos;s better .
And our most recent results the results of a curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process required a lot of passes , starting with a bioethics review before .
But we found that synthesize of DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that produce small segments , the long DNA , the long length of 30 to 50 letters , and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the most mistakes are .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these fragments and correct them .
And that was our first attempt , to start with digital information about the digital genome of Phi 174 .
It &apos;s a small virus that killes bacteria .
We designed the fragments , actually , in the correction of the mistakes and got a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letter .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemistry material , and we put it into the bacteria , the bacteria , they started reading this genetic code and produce the viral particles .
The viral particles were then left from cells , they &apos;re back and they &apos;re going back and they &apos;re going back and destroyed .
I talked about recent with members of the oil industry to say that they have certainly understood this model .
They have more of you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build its hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things larger .
We wanted to build the entire chromosome .
They &apos;re more than 580 mila letter code .
So we thought we &apos;ve thought to build it into casses of the viruses , so that we can change cassette to understand what the components of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , they have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard was of a mistake for every 10 midst .
We found out , resequenced it , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence would never be able to do it work .
One part of the process is designing lung 50 letters , which is to be overwhelming with all the other segments of 50 letter to build more small underounces that work together .
Let &apos;s give a very element here .
You &apos;ve probably read that we &apos;ve got to put the fighting .
Think it so : we have a gene code on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters together caught about 20 amminds , and there &apos;s a specific order , and there &apos;s a specific order to letter for every amamminds .
So we can use the gene code to write , frass , lay .
What we did at the beginning was authogical .
Some of them have been dolphuses that it wasn &apos;t poem .
We designed these segments to be able with enzymes .
There are some of them repair and put them together .
And we started assemble parts of the parts , starting with five to seven mix , and we &apos;re going to get them to a cheap segments to be forming segments to them to get to 72 .
So , we &apos;ve made these segments in abundance so we can sequencing it because we &apos;re trying to create a very good processing processes -- like you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatically automatically to be trying to automatically .
So , that seems the tabellon a basket player .
When we get these very long segments , more than 100 , more than 100 basis , it doesn &apos;t grow more directly ,
You get to the limits of the molecular biology .
So we &apos;ve considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called the homologist called the homologist that in biology is useful to repair the DNA to be able to unting the DNA segments .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinoccurcurred , can be absorb three million rad of radiation .
You can see in the upper rip of the upper rip of the destroome is destroyed .
In 12 , hours it &apos;s reassembled exactly as it was before .
There &apos;s thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely completely completely .
They can live under empty live in the vacuum .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life exist in space , and you get to find new environments of water .
In fact , NASA showed that this is happening .
This is a molecule picture of the molecule that we built , just using the lieventually with the design appropriate design .
The lieviiished them automatically .
This picture was not taken with a microscope , but with a very regular microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It &apos;s a very big molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the publishing that we did a little time ago .
They &apos;re more than 580,000 letters .
It &apos;s the largest molecule of a structure that has ever created by the man .
It has a high molecular weight to 300 million .
If you &apos;re going to be a 10 without spaces , you &apos;d like 142 pages only to transform this gene code .
Now , how do we work ? How can we get it ?
Of course , you know , you know , a game is a game .
It &apos;s a little more complicated when they &apos;re using bacteria .
It &apos;s more simple when it &apos;s eucarious cells as our : you can just get the nuclear , and put another , which is basically the cloning process .
In the archaea of the chromosome is instead of integrated inside the cell , but we &apos;ve been demonstrate that we &apos;re able to do a complete trapion a complete from a cell to another and vacuum .
We clean a chromosome , from a microbial species .
The two are different than the men from mice .
We &apos;ve put some gene in a more way to decide what to do for this chromosome .
And then skip with the enzymes so that it &apos;s going to be killing all the protein .
And when we put it in the cell was studied -- and you open our graphic graphic graphic graphic graphic graphic graphic is gone inside the cell .
And we were thinking that we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we &apos;ve tried it anymore , but we &apos;ve tried it anymore there .
This is one of the major mechanisms .
We found that tantissized species have added a second or a third chromosome from some part , add in a second thousands of new traits to that species .
So , who think about evolution as a gene once , and the time you change didn &apos;t understand much of the biology .
There &apos;s enzymes called the frestrial of restrial that I actually make digital DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell , you didn &apos;t have one .
The phone -- the chromosome that we have put it up up .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other cromosome as a material extraneum , and we found with only the cell and the new chromosome .
It became blue because of the genes that we put .
And in a short short lash of time , all the characteristics of a kind of time , based on the new software that we put in the new software that we put in the new software that we put in the cell .
All the protein has changed , member change , members are changed , and when we read the gene code is exactly what we &apos;ve moved to do .
Now , that it may look like genetics , but alchemy , but by the software we can change things in a very subway .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that I &apos;m not talking about genesis -- but progress from three million years and a half million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of Cambrian explosian explosian explosian explosian explosian to be where we &apos;re going to create new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s quite obvious when we think about our needs .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion and a half billion in the next 40 years .
Right to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for every one in 1946 ; in 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medicine , wellin six billion and a half billion people .
It &apos;s going to be more daily to nine billion .
We use more than five billion fuel fuel , more than 30 billion coal balls .
That means 100 million barrel a day .
When I call to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replace them , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
We have to keep all of CO2 from these materials that ended in the atmosphere .
So , by the day , because of the scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that they &apos;re the components of the future .
The electronics industry has only a dozen about components , and you think about how many different things came out .
Our limits here are data here is principle from the biological reality and from our imagination .
Now , we have techniques , because of these synthesization , able to create what we call genomics , and we call genomics combinatory .
We can build a big robot that can produce a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think of processing these 20 million genes or trying to optimize the processes to produce optimize them , new vaccines , we can change , because of a small team , and create more molecular biology that in the last 20 years .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection selection .
We can choose for survival , chemistry or fuel production , or fuel production , etc .
This is a few software of some software programmed that we &apos;re working on to be able to seat and design species .
Well , we don &apos;t know how they &apos;re going to be .
We know exactly what they &apos;re like their gene code .
We &apos;re focusing on the fourth generation coal .
You also saw that you can extract ethanol from the grain was a bad end .
We have coal-second and third generation , that will use enough enough to be able to be able to get more high-coal as the ophs or different butanx .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increasing the cost of food and limarne the energy in the cost of food and just transform CO2 in matter before , so we &apos;re working to design cells that could achieve this purpose , and we think we can have the first coal coal of fourth fourth generation in about 18 months .
The solar light combined with CO2 is a metodo--- but in our discoveries around the world , we find different metods .
This is a organism that we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
It &apos;s going to the deep ocean , about 2,500 feet deep deep at the temperature of the water .
It creates metane by using hydrogen by using molecular hydrogen as source .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can incanaling CO2 , which can easily be brought through your bones , convert that CO2 in coal , to drive this process .
So , short , we might be able to increase what the question of the &quot; which is what life is &quot; We , versus &quot; which is &quot; We , versus the whole oil industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can ?
It would be a main main source source of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working on the same metods to create instantaneous vaccines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with influence , we &apos;re always forth of a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s about find the vaccine .
I think what you can change is building combinable vaccines in anticize .
That &apos;s how the future might start looking at , now , the tree of evolution , accellerating evolution with synthetic bacteria , arches , arches , and inquitous cells .
We &apos;re so so much to improve people .
Our purpose is to do enough to be a long enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
So , first of all I &apos;m going to show you , the most quickly possible , some fundamental work , the new technology that we took to the Microsoft in the following a almost a year ago exactly . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s a place where you can interact is to be a local level that remode with a huge amount of visual data .
So here we &apos;re seeing a lot of digital photos with a kind of digital zoom , and I continue , for a fast panoramic , despite images like .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much the information that we see , how big is these data is , how big they &apos;re seeing is , as the images .
Most of them are common photographs , but this for example is a provenient from the Biary of the Congress , and reentry in the gamma gamma .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that &apos;s limits its presents of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time . It &apos;s also a very flessible architecture .
This is a whole book , not the images of data .
This is the Casa desolate of Dickens . Each represents a chapter .
To demonstrate that is just about heads and not the images , we can do something like that , to see really that it &apos;s a real representation of the text , not a photos .
It could be a little artificial way to read a little artificial book .
I don &apos;t give him .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s a number of The Guardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a section .
And really gives you very pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading the real version of a magazine or a everyday , which is for nature a multiple kind of a half of a half .
We also did something with the angle of this particular number of the Guardian .
We created a high-resolution advertising advertising -- much more high-resolder than what you use in a normal content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
I hope that it means to put people on the people and to get these people , and I &apos;m going to get to the people , not have to be necessary .
Of course , the maps is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say that we have a lot of contributions to this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. sovraped an image of NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually from the web of the web ; you can go to the web .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynthes , which is a project called Photosynthrows , which is a project called Photosynthes , which is a project called Photosynthes , which is a project called Photosynth .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research at the very interesting computer that we &apos;ve been by Noah Seadly , a University of Washington , with Steve Seitz Seadround Seadly , the Microsoft Rick . A great collaboration .
And it &apos;s from the website , I &apos;m going to be a website .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from a picture to the other and have this kind of experience to be resolution .
But the space of the images here actually have a meaning .
The algoritms of computer computer , have been recorded these images together , so that you corresponds to the real places that they can imagine -- all sorts of the Sunage-Rocciose singing -- they &apos;ve got been taken .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more space .
I want to go directly to one of the Noah-up set of Noah-up . And this comes from a very previous prototynthrooms that we &apos;ve done work for the first time the summer summer -- to show you what I think is really the behind behind this technology , Photosynththrows . And it &apos;s not necessarily evidence by by looking at the environments that we &apos;ve put in the website .
We had to worry about the legal aspects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of Nobody cattedral of Nothree Dame images from Flickr . Bae NoDame in Flickr and you get images of these kinds of wild and they &apos;re going to be a picture that &apos;s been found out of this , represented a picture that was discovered that .
So , they &apos;re all images from Flickr and they were all spacal level in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to be able to be in this very simple way .
You know , I &apos;d never thought to end to work for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifically to get this kind of accounts here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of photocamers : from those cell phone to those professional , SLR , a significant number , they had to do in this environment .
And if I can do , I try to try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and do it ,
Many blocks , etc .
Somewhere you find a series of photographs -- and you find out there .
This is a Nobody poster of Nobody Dame recorded .
We can go from the poster of the physical view of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is taking data from the whole collective memory . This is now taking data from the visual point of view -- and connecting all of those data together .
All those photos become connected together , more of the parts .
You have a model of the earth .
Think about this as a prolungent of Stephen Lawler on Earth virtual Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complex complex as as people use it , and the people use it , and the whose advantage to get up with use .
Their photos are marked with metadmit by other people .
If you get somebody &apos;s the idea of contrast , you know , my name , my photic cattedge of NoDame suddenly ended up with all of the NoDame suddenly ended up with all of those data , and I can use it as a check for me in that metaphor , using the photos of the other , and having a social experience of the cross-mobili-cross-used .
Of course , a consequence of all that are very very much processed by every interesting interesting interesting land of the earth , not only by planes and satellite images and satellite images and satellite images and similar , but from the collective .
Thank you very much .
CA : I understood ? What your software is going to be able to do is that at a certain point , in the next few years , all the photographs , all the photographs that &apos;s all the world will be practices .
BAA : Yeah . What is doing is doing is actually find .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , in the images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the images .
And what becomes very interesting is , if you think about reach of the seant information that many of these images have been .
As you do a research research on the web , you have a phase and the heads on the web has a lot of information about the pictures .
Now , what happens if that picture is connecting to all your photos ?
So the amount of seedness of the interconnection and the amount of remarkable to get is really enormous . It &apos;s a classic network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible .
BAA : thank you very much .
One of the main pleases when you travel and one of the ethnogical research is the living in the wild , you have forgotten the ancient traditions , between the hoods the past in the wind , the hits the wild , the guilty is , the guguilty in the wind , the guesses .
And the thinking that samoring Jaguar travel again , and the idea of the Lattea , or the Inuit &apos;s still cold of significant , or in Himalaya , the distinct budes , the distinct budes , and the distinct the central of the Dharm , and the idea that the world that we live in a sense , but it &apos;s just a reality of reality , but it &apos;s just a reality of reality , but it &apos;s a reality , it &apos;s just a reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stirpful stirpful , or bad , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential traits .
We all come . All right . We all projecting .
We &apos;re disappeared to rituals .
We have to deal with the death of , so we don &apos;t surprising us and although --
We all have an art .
What &apos;s the one of the song , the rhythm of the song , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t care that they think the Borneo &apos;s Borneo , or the following the Voodoo of Haiti , or the desert Kaithuriers in Kenya , the Curandery of Ande , or a a camp in of the Sahara .
He was my company in desert a month ago , or a month ago , or a month ago , or a a hallever of the Qomolangma on Mest , Mest , Mest , Mom of the world .
All of these populations are teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of moving around the world .
And if you reflect a minute , it &apos;s a concept that it can give you hope .
Insively , the miriades of cultures , they create a spiritual life and cultural life that happens the planet and cultural , and it &apos;s important for the planet , and it &apos;s important for the planet as biososphere .
And you can think about this cultural race as a a ethnosh , and you can defining the etnosh of all the concepts , dreams , mites , dreams , with ideas , inspiration , and inspiration , from the human imagination .
The ethnosphere is the great parimonium of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we &apos;re and and what we can be as inquisitive species .
And because biosphere was gravitely consumed by the etheless , and it was a lot more quickly .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all the species was or is on the horric , just because it &apos;s filled , or -- in the most apocalyptic diversity -- and not get it to even even more optic -- that &apos;s the most optimistic -- that of cultural diversity .
The whole thing is , of course , the language loss .
When you &apos;re born 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not composed only from a vocabulary or a series of rules ,
One language is the spraking of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle of the way that the soul of every culture comes in the material .
Every language is a forest of mind , a gaps , a thought , a thought ecosystem .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re sitting in Monterey , at least half not the subsurrounding in the ears of children .
They don &apos;t get more teacher , the children that means , less I &apos;m supposed to be a lot of a lot of them , which is already dead .
What is more trister than the silence , of being the last one to talk about a language , not to be the last talking a language , not to transmit the wisdom of the kids ?
This is a filled with somebody in some of the world every two weeks : every two weeks , a few weeks , a old language and door to him with the toms of a ancient language .
And I know somebody who will say , &quot; Is it better ?
The world would not be a better place if we were talking about the same language ? &quot; Benisately , then we talk about yoruba .
Let &apos;s talk about kogs .
You &apos;ll find a sudden what it means you can &apos;t speak to your language .
I &apos;d like to do a journey through the etnosh --
a little journey in the etnosh to give you a little bit of what we &apos;re lost .
Many of us forget that when I say , &quot; different ways of existing , &quot; I mean , really different ways of existing .
Let &apos;s take for example , Barasana , in Amazon Stheron , the people of anaconda , which crees to the mix of the milest in the snap of the milest in the sserpounds .
It &apos;s a people who don &apos;t have to be able to distinguish the green color from the green because the time you can depend out in the forest , where it depends the people .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rule , demonstrip , &quot; exogue &quot; : You have to be a different language .
It &apos;s all that has roots in the mitological past , but the particularly the particularly about these families in the summarian of seven languages because of matters no one language .
They &apos;re very limited to listen and then start talking to .
Let &apos;s take one of the most interesting tribe that I lived , the Waorani of Ecuador Ecuador , a incredible populations that had the first contact in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionarts have been trying to make a similar mistake .
They &apos;ve been slow down on the top photographs that they were retrial to the people who were reaching that this people in the pluvial forest .
They &apos;ve been collected the photos , they have been a research , or a figure , and not find nothing , they have been concluse that was the diavian , and they killed the five missionary with the lance .
But the Waorani didn &apos;t have only killed the foreign .
They killed between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by their own .
We were saving eight generations and we found two natural death , and we found two natural death , and when we &apos;ve been in the course of them was invecting , and then they killed him . And then they killed him .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine 40 pass and recognize the species .
In the early 80s , I was assigned a really interesting task when my Harvard professor , I asked if I wanted to go to Haiti in Haiti , I was going to Haiti in the basic power of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes , and the Tonton Macoutes .
To give a sense of miraculous , I would have to understand Vododoo culture and the Voodoo is not magic .
It &apos;s kind of a complex metaphor of the world .
Many interesting interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianity , Islam , Buddhism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no faith . And they won &apos;t faith . And they &apos;re not the other than the distilled to be a lot of nates in the tragic concepts of nates in the tragic .
What &apos;s interesting is that voodoo is the intense relationship between life and death .
So , the vivives are becoming up .
The spirits can be invocated by the Great Act , they respond to the ritm of the dance of the dance of the vious way that for a short active active active , the folds the end becomes the goodness becomes the god .
So , for this voodooists like to say , &quot; You know , you know , you know , God .
We dancing in the temple and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re posing , is the spirit that you have , as you can do it ?
So you see these incredible events : followed the voododoo in the state of trance that touches shes hurt , infuted a very strong demonstration of the body , when it &apos;s catalyzed in a state of extremely excitement .
I &apos;m all the people with which I have lived the most extraordinary is Kogi Santa Marta Santa Marta City , in Colombia secsectors .
They have to be on the ancient civilizes that once lived on the cardboard , the people in the charge of the conquician , the people who were retreat on the volcanic masses , the people would be on the volcanic ,
In a macartment of blood , this people have never been conquised by the spagagees .
I &apos;m not a today today , they &apos;re government by a clero , but their formation is so extraordinary .
The young people are following by their families to three or four years , and they live secret in a good world , and they live in a good world of stone of the stone of the glacier for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years , they choose to reproduce the nine months of gestation that they spend in the mother of the mother , now are metaphor in the user of the Grande Maather .
So for all of this time , they &apos;re acculturing to the values of their society , values that prefer and only their prayers , they keep the cosmic balance .
And the term of this incredible initiation , they &apos;re suddenly brought out and for the first time in their life , at the age of 18 years , see an alba . And in that activities of the first bleap , when the sun kelf the beautiful valuable , all of the things that have learned in theory is all its slow slow . The pret does a step , and says : : &quot; I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; Pendor a step back and says :
&quot; Gisto me ? Proprive as I said .
It &apos;s amazing . Now it &apos;s now to give you it . &quot;
They &apos;re called a major brothers and say that we , brothers , are the colpair , we &apos;re the colpping of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the Indigene and the environment , we call Rousseau and the old history of the selvessing , which is a concept of the noble , which is a concept of the hurt , or maybe invoose Those , and we say that these people are closer to the Earth .
The Indies are not nor sentimental sentimal , they &apos;re not safety from nostaly .
There is no space for these things in the Asmat Asmat or in the Asmat , or in the Tibet , but because of the time , they created a mystical mystical of the Earth is not about consciously , but on a very much much of the Earth , but on a very much more subtition , but it &apos;s a very much more subtext .
What does that mean ?
It means that a kid of Ands the Ande who &apos;s grows up by creating the mountain is a spirit that will be a deeper of the Apu will be a deeper , and it &apos;s going to have a very different race with the mountain or that place a lot of rocks is a mountains of a rock of rocks are ready to be scaving .
That &apos;s the dimatory of a mineral or a mineral cutting is irrilever .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that define the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia Britannics , creating the forests .
And that has been a different human being from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the dimonds of Hukukukukukukukuk and the bstored damage of the world , spirits that live in the Hamsa &apos;s initiation .
If you start to think that these cultures can create reality , you can start to understand some of them feeling , you can start to understand some sensational discoveries .
I took this picture to open the picture to open the Amazon the Western Amazon the Western Amazon the Western Amazon the Western Amazon the Western Amazon the nurturnorder .
Maybe some of you &apos;ve heard about the ayahuased , the most powerful substance psychoactive repertory .
What makes the check of the substance of the substance is not the potential of the substance , but it &apos;s composed by two elements .
On one hand , this lian lighting of a bunch of Tial-up , hardly , hardmoline , lighting , lighting hallucinogene .
And by taking the only plant plant smoke that allowed a little bit of consciousness , but it &apos;s mixed with the leaves of a caffecting family of a coffer &apos;s family caffecting .
This plant contains powerful powerful , very similar to the seriotonin , dithyptamine , dithyptamine .
If you ever see the Yanomami pulling up for the birthday , the substance that they do from a different kind of species , anchy is methyptamine .
Take that dust on the nose is a little bit of a little bit of a pinch of paints and land on a sea of the wild . &#91; Ris&#93; &#91; Ris&#93; Not a distortion of reality ; it &apos;s actually a distortion of reality .
I &apos;m going to use with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has written the psichedelichedelic , with his fineggs discovery of the hallucinogens in Mexico .
And I &apos;m going to be a bunch of these triptamine as alucinogens because if you &apos;re done not to tell anybody to be hallucined . &#91; Ris&#93; tripamine trips , but they can &apos;t be abunte to be abunte , because they dened by a enzyme that &apos;s obviously about a dasn , demonoamine .
It &apos;s possible to be absence if you abunt with other chemicals that denian MAO .
Now , it &apos;s the beautiful : the Tibeta-coal that are ininbors of MAO , the same kind of the same kind of need to be able to be able to be triptamine . The question is spontaneous species of plants , like these people are doing these people to find two deflit , not similar , but that if you combined in this way , it &apos;s a chemistry version that is that upper sum m m in the sum ?
We use the great eufemale of the evidence of the mistake , which can reveal infruted .
But if we ask the Indians , they &apos;ll tell us , we &apos;ll tell us . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuasks , who distinguished in the forest , and that we would come into the same species .
If you ask them , how they &apos;re going to be able to say , &quot; I thought , &quot; I think , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take 17 variety in a night of a lamp , and everybody will damn with a different tone .
So , you don &apos;t have a Harvard to Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting that you can count stami .
Now , &#91; applausers , the problem is that even the ones of us have to heart people who have pitted their people find pittoresks , but in some way to margins of history than our real world , and it &apos;s going to the songongs of history than our real world , and it &apos;s going to go beyond .
In fact , the 21st century , in 300 years , it &apos;s not going to be reminded for his technology , but rather like the was where we stopped and enabled to the vacuate and we used to have a very active accepted , or cultural and cultural planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All cultures across the centuries are involved in a dance for new possibility .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux didn &apos;t stop being Sioux when they put from the arco and freceived as Americans don &apos;t stop being Americans when they put away from the horse and calcies .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that threatened the integrity of etnosh . It &apos;s the power .
The dough of the domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you find that these are not destined to disappear .
They &apos;re living creatures and dynamics , willing out of the identifabetics that go beyond their adaptment .
It &apos;s about the package of the Penan of the Penan --
a nomasian people in Sarawak , in the Asian , a people who have lived in the forest to a generation , and now reduced to a generation , and now reducing on the rights of the fiumes , where you can see the river river , where you can see the river flew from the wearing of the wearing of the horizon , where the wave ,
You &apos;re ready to fill the wooden with the south .
Or the Yanomami , are the disease that have come with the discovery of the gold .
If we married on the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the volume of the political domination .
As you know the genocide , the extinction of a people , it &apos;s convicted to the universal level , but the etnocid of the style of a people , not only is convicties , not only is convicties , but I also addictar to strategy , because it &apos;s part of the development strategy .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of Tibet until you go from the beginning .
I &apos;ve path the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in China , the Western China through Tibet through Lhaw with a young connecting , but only came to Lhasa with a young connecting , but only came to Lhasa with a young connection , but only came out of the statistics we were talking about .
6,000 monuments sacred reduces in dust and centers .
1.2 million people killed from the military in the Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascriteria in Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed to the time of Chinese invasion .
Her uncle was founded with South Sainity during the diaspora that led the people in Nepal .
Her mother was imprisoned and his hilty was reahead .
It was brought to be hidden in a carefully of two years , he was born under his gonna because it wouldn &apos;t have to live without him .
The sister , who did the same , was mitted in the reeducational field .
And one day he had a hot hot button , and it was a race of Mao and , for this transgression , was mitted to seven years .
The Tibet can be insopposable , but the spirit of the people is from tener tener .
And finally , all it &apos;s reduces to a choice .
We want to live in the world of monocromatic world or we want to get the world policy of diversity ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he died he died that his largest fear was that , we go to this amory love of the world , not only see the whole gamma of human imagination , but a very limited modality of thinking , but a day we &apos;ll see a day from a sleep to a probe of thinking , but a day we &apos;ll see it from a sleeping to the perspective of the way there there were other possibilities .
And it &apos;s humiliant to remind that our species is there for 600,000 years .
The Neolithic revolution , which gave us agriculture , which has given us us us us to socawars of the seipoem of the skim of the skim , with the next of the clero , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has been a 300 years .
That shared story doesn &apos;t suggests me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to deal with the millennia to come .
When to these miriades of the world is asked what it means to be human , they respond to 10,000 different different voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all refer the possibility of being what we &apos;re : a kind of a conscious species , that has to be able to be a lot of good .
I took this picture on the north of Baffin , when I went to cover with the Inuit , when I went to cat the Inuit , and the Olaya , and the Olaya , and I &apos;ve got to be a great story of his grandfather .
The Chanadodian government has not always been gentile with the Inuit and the &apos; 50s to be able to be our spremate , we have refined them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refused to go .
The family , I theme for his life , he took him away all of the weapons .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t have the cold , they &apos;re laying .
The pieces of the slites in origin were made of fish fish in the wild .
The grandfather didn &apos;t have intimidnight , or the blefing of the bylizard , and the bylizard that was suffering .
It &apos;s been sweet , it &apos;s hot the pantalons in the skin of their own . When I did it fected , they work with them . When I did they were frozen , and they work with a lamamamamambobobobodies into a samp .
It &apos;s sprued salive on the punccccclock and when I became solido , he killed a dog .
He shake the dog and created a bright , and he created a bright , and it has a samp , has been stunning another dog and is disappear to the bang , and it &apos;s gone on on .
Let &apos;s go to talk about horrise with nothing ?
In the bet of the Chanadly government reduced to the total of a larger territory area of California and Texas mapes and Texas mapes together .
It &apos;s their new paintintent . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a independent land . They &apos;re all minerary resources .
One marvelize example of how a natione-state can re-re-concied to his people .
And finally , to end , I think it &apos;s quite obvious to least at least at least to the people in these remote areas of the planet , they realize that they &apos;re not remote .
It &apos;s for somebody &apos;s home .
They represent search sections of human imagination that they represent at the time . And for us all of these kids , as dreams , they become part of our kids , become part of the geography of hope .
We &apos;re going to end , we have a beliefs that politicians will never come to nothing .
We believe that polemics --
&#91; Applausers are not lost lost , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month our website has 35 million visits .
156 countries transmit &apos;s put our television .
Our magazines are licenses from millions .
Our work is travel to the etnososphere to bring our public in the etnoses of cultural reveals from which they &apos;re going to be abbracing , and it &apos;s hopefully for the central reveal of the exist , and we have to find a lifestyle in a pluralist world , and we have to find a lifestyle and multicultural a style and multicultural a world of life in a pluralist and multural world in a gyle and melle our our own in a world in a life in
where the wisdom of all the people can contribute to our collective well-being .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope you &apos;ve heard and put some links , and I &apos;ll find some links , in case you don &apos;t note .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the official dogma . &quot;
The dogma official ?
The dogma official of all the Western industrial society . The dogma official official . &quot; If we want to masssies the well-being of our citizens . &quot;
The reason is , from one side , in fact that the freedom is itself a value , is useful , it &apos;s useful , for human beings .
On the other hand , is that if we are free , each of us can do that for all of us to do everything that massizes our well-being , no one that decide in our well-being , no one that decide in our own .
The way to masses freedom is massize the choice .
More choices , more of people have , more libere , and the more is their freedom , is their well-being .
This is so deeply roomicated in the society that nobody would dream of nervous to put it in doubt .
And it &apos;s also deeply roomed in our lives .
I &apos;ll show you some examples of what progress I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress do is you can .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m going to allow me a simple note about the conditions for injump .
In my supermarket there are 175 conditions , without contact the 10 variety of olium , and the 12 acets of the extrade of oil , and the 12 acets you can buy a huge number of conditions in the circumstances that nobody of 175 .
That &apos;s what the supermarket is .
Then you go to the electronics to buy a stereo : cow , however , the CD , radio , plastra , light , light , light , bull .
And in this single store store , there &apos;s a big audiences .
We can make six and a half million different combinations using the components that there are in a only store .
You have to admit that there &apos;s tearing .
Other fields : the world of communications .
And once , when I was a child , they could get all the phone services , at all the phone services that they were supposed to be Bell .
He was noleged the phone , didn &apos;t bought it .
One consequence of that , between the other , was that the phone never break .
These days , they went .
Now we have a almost illimited variety of phone , especially between cell phone .
So here &apos;s cell phone .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , cutting up the birds of the birds , and the forcing for the bruleline .
If you don &apos;t have a still seen in the store under the house store , you &apos;re very much for it &apos;s going to be .
And what the end is that people come into the negotives and he &apos;s got this question . And what is the answer ? The answer is &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a phone that doesn &apos;t make much much much much of things .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important to the acquows of the same explosion the same blockets .
And there &apos;s health care : not happens to the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor , and the doctor you know what you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do a A or B , &quot; A has these benefits , and these risks , &quot; B has these benefits and these risks . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Dr. , what I would have to do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A has these benefits , and B has these benefits , and B has these benefits of them . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebat , &quot; Dr. if she was me , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result we call it &quot; autonomy of the malatory , &quot; expression that it looks like a beautiful thing .
But it &apos;s not that it &apos;s not that you can move the weight and responsibility to make decisions that someone knows something , which is the doctor , to someone else else else else -- and almost certainly it &apos;s sick -- and so it doesn &apos;t know , in the ideal condition to make decisions that it is the patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing of pharmaceutical products , direct people like me and you , if you think it doesn &apos;t have any sense , given that we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we don &apos;t buy them , why do they advertising them ?
The answer is that they want to ask them to ask them to ask them to ask them to be .
Something about that , as a fundamental identity is our ort is a choice of choice , as you see in this vignet . &quot; We don &apos;t want to forze children . They &apos;re going to be a lot of identity . We have to invent it .
And we can reinventing how many times we &apos;re going to get up .
That means that every morning , at the risis , you have to decide that kind of person wants to be .
I &apos;m going to the family and the matrimonium , a long time time , it almost sites for anyone , was that was that skip the most presents , and it started to be the most preserved possible , and it started to be the most preserved possible .
The only real choice was to people who , not when , and not when , and not even what to do after .
So , it &apos;s really really to play .
I teach students very smart students , and I &apos;m going to be 20 percent in less of work on a time .
And not because they &apos;re less brilliant , not because they &apos;re less diligent .
But why are I &apos;m imtremes , I mean to ask , &quot; I should be sposing or not ? &quot;
&quot; I should be going to get away ? I have to think before kids or the career ? &quot;
They &apos;re interrogative interrogative .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this implica not complete the companies that assume , and not get a beautiful voice to my exam .
And they have to really do that . They &apos;re important questions .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , as Carl , as Carl , because technology allows us to work every day , from all day , from all the time , except from Hotel Randolph .
And in the parenth , there &apos;s a cord , and I won &apos;t say to anybody where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use it .
What does that mean , this incredible freedom of choice that we have about the work ? Is it all the time , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing hot , with the phone in a pocket , the Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the blocks .
And even if they &apos;re all spending , every minute that we see our child reoving , we &apos;re asking us , &quot; Do you answer this ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? I have to email this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is &quot; no , &quot; No , &quot; all this makes the experience of your son very different than what it would be in other conditions .
So , anywhere we look at , small things and big , things and the materials and lifestyle , life is a question of choices .
And once the world was this : that that &apos;s true , there were some possibilities , but it wasn &apos;t all of a choice .
The world of today is looking like this : The dilemma is , &quot; Is it a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Simple .
We sites them all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative .
All of this choice is two negative effects of people .
The first , paradoxygen , is that it makes a paralysis that it &apos;s going .
So , with a lot of options that you choose , becomes very difficult to do it .
I give you a significant example : a significant study of the voluntary pensive .
A connecting to has been access to the Vanguard data , the gigantic company , the gigantic society , with about a million customers in 2,000 different companies .
What she found out of every 10 solutions that are offering in more , the percentage of adhesian scenes of two percent .
With 50 offerts , there &apos;s 10 percent in less than adhesions when they &apos;re available only five .
Because with 50 sources of which you choose , is sick to decide , and the choice is reduced to the indomans .
And tomorrow , and tomorrow tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course , tomorrow never come .
You know that it doesn &apos;t only mean that these old work as they &apos;re going to be able to do enough money , because they &apos;re not going to say that the decision is so hosttic that lose the complex dator &apos;s the damn dator &apos;s the damn of work .
Not participating , they &apos;re losing to five thousand dollars for a year from the work , that would be well disposed to be there .
So the paralysis a consequence of having tropes .
And I think it &apos;s like that .
&quot; And to end , for eternity : ketchup , or maionese ? &quot;
Would you like to make the right decision , if it &apos;s for the ethernity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to pick the wrong , and yet the wrong condition .
So that &apos;s the first effect . The second is that even if we can avoid the paralysis and to the end , we &apos;re less satissssed by by the result of how we would be with less options .
And that for different reasons .
One of them is that with many conditions of which you choose , and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could do a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us to maricate the choice , and the remarkable to the demining the demining , and the repair dement , the decrew by the decision ,
even when it was a very good decision .
More choices , there &apos;s more easy to be displeased by any detail that is insoddisappearing of the option .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunities .
Dan Gilbert has been clearly good stamp , like the value that we &apos;re depending on things depends on .
So , the rest of the other way , there &apos;s a lot of possible options , it &apos;s easy to represent the alternative to be less sation-facts , the option that you have choice .
So here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m sorry with all of them that are not New York .
But that &apos;s what you &apos;re probably going to think .
There is this copy to Hamptons .
It &apos;s a slow place .
Spiach splendida . Otttle journal . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not miss nothing . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , maltext is Agust . &quot;
&quot; All my neighbors to Manhattan is . &quot;
&quot; I could paregate right in front of the house . &quot;
And it goes to two weeks assilte on the idea that is losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The costo-opportunity to demining the soddisfation for what we have , even when the choice was excellent .
And more are the options that we have to consider , the most actual traits is going to be going to be constitute against how costo-opportunities .
So here &apos;s another example .
This is a living is told us a lot of things .
It &apos;s about living the moment , and maybe of living slowly .
But the most important point is that whatever you choose to not do the other .
The things that we don &apos;t pick a lot of attractive that they can make less attractive what we do .
Three point : : I &apos;m going to be a growing expectations .
I tried to my skin bought a new pair of jeans .
I &apos;m almost always always jeans .
And the jeans were just like a only guy , bought and vast them , they were skip , they were skied , just after they brought them a whole life and work , they started to go to well .
So , I went to buy a couple of the old days when the old were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cutting . &quot;
The committed me , &quot; You know , you know , you know , you know , relaxed , fit ? &quot;
I want to do with cernic or with the button ? &quot; Stonewashed , &quot; or &quot;
&quot; Wi wants to be straight ? &quot;
&quot; See , eight wants to be a bull , &quot; Continua -- &quot; Continuum ,
I was salord , and after a little bit , I could say , &quot; I want the only guy , &quot; that was the only guy , &quot; he didn &apos;t have any idea what it was , so for a hour of jeans , and then I came out of the wearing , and I went out the best couple of jeans I had ever had .
It was the very very much . With the whole choice I had the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worst is that with all that choice , my jeans were altissime , jeans were perfected .
I had been expected to be minimes . I didn &apos;t expect anything exceptional when there was a hundred , but when it was a different kind of them , like , at least a kind of perfect .
What I had been bought was good , but not perfect .
After I was talking about that I was going to do with what I was insodly ,
The adds of options in the life of people don &apos;t do that to increase the ecast of the options of the same .
And that &apos;s going to produce less satisfation , even when the results are good .
No one in the world of marketing has been on .
Because if they knew it , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more to that .
&quot; It was better when she was worse , &quot; The reason why he was better when it was worse was worst when you was worse was still able to meet pleasant .
So , in the world that we live -- opulents , industrialized citizens with the expectancy of perfection -- the most we can hope is that things are at the altitude of the expectations .
You &apos;ve never surprised it pleasant because your waiting for your expectations , they &apos;re ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Besears &quot; Yeah , &quot; Yeah , you want it . &quot;
I mean , small authographical moment -- that I &apos;m really sposted and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t have to do better , I &apos;m not going to be done better ,
But it &apos;s not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of a couple of jeans , when there &apos;s only that kind of jeans is that when you &apos;re not satisfacts , and you wonder , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot; The answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What would I do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a insodisfacing , and you wonder , you wonder , is just as well as much as it is as clear that the responsible you &apos;re .
You could have better .
With hundreds of variety available , there are no excuse for the insuccess .
So when people make decisions , even if the result is valid , they &apos;re so insatisfy and they give the cold .
In the last years , depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only , but important -- of this wave of depression is just that people have deludent experience because they &apos;re too much .
And when they have to explain this is they think that the cold is their own .
So the final result is that we &apos;re better better , but we feel worst .
Let me reminds you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely filled . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than it was not having any any of it , but it doesn &apos;t have a lot better choice .
There &apos;s a critical value , magical . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure that we &apos;ve been overed by a piece of the level where the choices are going to be able to be .
Now , from the political point of view -- I &apos;ve almost finished from the political point , the nocy is the following .
What it allows all this to the industrial society is remarkable .
There are many places in the world , and you know about that , where the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too pahead .
So the faccenters that I &apos;m talking about is a bad bad bad of modern , re-cutting , re-like society .
And what it does depressed and angry is this : Steve Levitt talked about yesterday of how the expensive and seat for bimes are ineless . It &apos;s a money .
I mean , these choices , complicated and dispendiose , it &apos;s not that they &apos;re just useful .
I &apos;m even deleteries .
They &apos;re worst worst .
If a little bit of what in our society allows a lot of choice was reversed in those where people have too much much chance , it wouldn &apos;t only be their life to improve but also .
This is what economists call a better better better paretetary .
It &apos;s a redistribution of income reduction is good for all of this choice in excess , because of this choice in excess .
So to end , you can get all that you want to be , &quot;
You know , people of culture , you think , &quot; But what does that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t do anything in a glass of glass . &quot;
&quot; A covered imagination , a limited view of the world --
and I &apos;m going to interpret .
But then , thinking about them , instead , I realized that that that fish knows the long knows that that the fish knows .
Because the fact of the fact is that if you manage in frankly , so that you can &apos;t get freedom . You don &apos;t get freedom . You can &apos;t get freedom .
If you break the boccia in the way that all divents can decrew the soddisfation .
You &apos;re going to get the paralysis , and you reduce the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too strip , maybe even for us .
But the absence of some symbolic sphere is a recipe for the inhappiness and , I &apos;m going to the rovine .
Thank you very heart .
