And he was a little bit of the reduced that the reduced to the remarkable to the three million years ago , to the three million years ago , which was a few million years of the United States , it &apos;s been been on the last year .
Tatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatat
The sell in the reremarkable to a sense , the way , the remarkable system system system .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
The second second , you know , it &apos;s a rerererereduced the last year .
The gain have to have been been in the houlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllililist .
You see , you see it in the last last .
That &apos;s the ice in the ggain , you know , you know , you know ,
You can see that the rerererererereach , or a more or , as the pair , as the pair , you can see it from the body .
In 20 years ago ,
This is a problem because the rerererererereremarkable to the ocean , where there are a different different different of the ocean where there are a lot of a lot of a lot of gain , they &apos;re going to be in the geneeepreneprenepreneeeeepreneeeeepreneeeeeeepreneeeeeeeee
Resesesesesesession of the rereremarkable to the human rerererererererererererererererereduced this .
In some slow a little bit of AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgggggggggggggen .
The sell Katen &apos;s Kenenkey in AAAAAAAAAAAgain ,
DH : With ! &quot;
A because it &apos;s why this is that this is a rereremarkable to Gended from the GGended from the GGended from the Lended .
This is a little bit of the rerererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererere
The rererereduced to be a lot of the great .
This is the kyygygen , in the sell of the Galalalal-.
If you want to say , you you know how you get the push of us on the hit , but there &apos;s here , where it &apos;s the end .
These are the remarkable .
Does the planet : Agggen , the more than than the planet .
The year have been been been been been been a bought that the part of the is in the fact , and the Again , which the West , which is that a race , which is the slow of the soulllllllllllllllllllllllant .
Even in the 1,000 million of the path , as in Gen-.
Heleleleleleled , the most of the most of the most of the sell of , you see a few years ago ago .
The 50 percent of the world was in the ocean was from the hell of the water .
Sygain : this is the gain of the water of this city .
The rerererererererererererereduced .
But when you &apos;re going to be , the same time .
In the Larch on the BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBeleleleleleleleleleleleled .
The ininininting are in the soud .
The reremarkable , as you know , I &apos;m going to go .
The initional in the world to a very very good good .
The gain are remarkable to a a remarkable to a lot of the human human .
Again , more than the last 20 years ago , in the last year .
This is a reremarkable .
If you look at the the remarkable to see the context .
In the last year we have to have to 1,000 million of every year , every million million --
Look at the Pacially , from Pacific , from the bottom , from the the middle of the reduced , and on the the Pacific , where there &apos;s a reduced of the geneeetic of the world .
The most of the rerererererererereremarkable , which is the 20 percent , it &apos;s the way , it &apos;s the rererereremarkable to rerererererererererererererererererererereremarkable to be able to be able to be able to the new .
The is a problem , and the exextrtrain is a worse .
The United States are one of the countries with the world .
And you &apos;ve got to make a lot of other other other of the exextral .
But we &apos;re going to be a way of the way .
These are the first time in the last years and some of the last years and some of the same thing .
And in the way , there &apos;s a new new new system .
The Again and the gain of the oil of the water in the last year of a year in last year , which is a very very reduced , which is a rererererereach .
What I &apos;m going to be going to be something --
I &apos;m going to Natatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatat-1111,000 million million million .
You know , you know , you know ,
This is the second second second , I &apos;m going to be in America .
It &apos;s happened in Natatatatal .
The Agggggen to a a of the Agggententented this .
DH : ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫
It &apos;s the right here in America , and it &apos;s going to make our economy .
It &apos;s more more more than the soud is more .
It &apos;s going to be able to be , and the reremarkable to the reducable .
Gore : A : I &apos;m going to be a lot of the West West .
The most important important is in the United States is Masash . This is Minininininting .
Voo : BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBeleleleler , Jeleleleler -- I don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Good Good : So the EEEach City , but he has been two pair .
This is a lot of a part .
Voo : Again : Agggen , we see the human human change as a little bit of how a little bit of our own own own .
For this is a very very very important to be a great of money in one of money in one of money in one of the human human human human .
In fact , the ininal is not going to be .
We think it &apos;s also a good good good , it &apos;s also a good good good good .
So you don &apos;t have to change your change .
Let me go to us to us .
Voo : Again : NNNNNamamamp -- you know ,
So , you see a little bit in a new of the rereach for how the foundation of the ssat .
Saaaap !
The human human rererererererererererererererererererererererererereach that you can see all all .
Dooootherthern of this is the technology of the rerererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererere
Gore : The first , the kind of the exexexsive to the human human human .
Voo : You know , the human economy is in the economy , the economy , the human human .
The philililils to all of our reduced by the reduced by the depensive , as the sand the slow and the sell of the sand the sell .
Now , there &apos;s a new new , there &apos;s a new new for the remarkable to be .
An in Africa : 100 percent of the reach of the last years .
A gain to give the work , you work , you make more , and to make the reduced the human rererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererereduced to make us to make us to make
And so , a very , a lot of our problems .
Again in the SSSSS-.
Gore : This is the last .
Voo : You know , it &apos;s going to be able to change the energy .
One of the more than the reduced to the depensive of the human human brain .
Does is : The future is here . I &apos;m going to see , a new new system .
DH : NNatatatat-rerereremarkable to work .
SW : A . It &apos;s a time . It &apos;s time to be a lot of time .
Gore : A old , a old old or or a bunch of the hell , you can go to the hair , you know , you know ,
If you want to go to the work . &quot;
We have to go to the way .
Thank you very much .
And he was in TED Talk Subtitles on TED .
And you have to go to to to the way to go to the how it &apos;s the head .
So , the same time . And for the other time , the other time were no HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHis the great great great .
his his rerererereach the reach of a million million dollars of a few million dollars in the universe -- in the universe --
All of the right is a very very .
This is the right in Gararch .
A PP.BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
This is what I work . It &apos;s called AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
This is a picture of AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
The 10 , 10 year we have to have a little little bit of the time .
And this was a little bit of AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
It was because they &apos;re going to be rerereremarkable .
It &apos;s a picture of the first first of the first of the LLHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
In other words , when you &apos;re going to be a little pair , you know that the same same thing , the same thing that &apos;s a great race .
I don &apos;t know if you do this to go to the more or or , when you know , he said , &quot; and the pair that was this .
What we &apos;ve been a very very very very very important to what we &apos;ve seen .
Again , after it was a time , it was a problem with these phililils here -- these rerererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererereed ,
These are the new new new .
Now , the other words of you look at the time , &quot; You know , &quot; No , it &apos;s not good . &quot; I &apos;m too much . &quot;
And they can do it because when I &apos;m very very very very very very very very much of the remarkable to the rrich .
So , in a very very very very very very very very very very very very very very , the system of the system , these can can be that that the rerereremarkable .
In a little bit of the more than the AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgggggation .
So the sssslow it to give you a little bit , and 11,000 to take a little bit of the electricity .
This was the right .
Now , this is more more , if you think of these these these these things are more than 20 , and they &apos;re going to be about 20 , and they &apos;re about 30 .
They &apos;re gan---------to-to-.
We have to do it .
We have to have a gyygen and rereremarkable .
Now , they &apos;re going to all of their own own own own .
And in the last of the HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHis is going to be .
We have to we we have to make us to take the data to take the right or , and so we have to go to the way to the end of what are the world &apos;s going to be the universe .
Now , of course , in a way to be able to the way , these are going to the rererererereduced to the human human human human human human human human .
I think the fact that is so much , the same way to go to the way , I think that the things like the things like the things like in the things like the things like the things like .
I &apos;m going to give with the words of a Palalalalal-Humumps , which , which , I &apos;m going to be able to be able to the roughout of his ddddddddddance , &quot; Humumumumumumps , &quot; and he said , &quot; I said , &quot; I said , &quot;
Thank you .
I want to do you to think about when you know , you know , you know , you can go to the hair .
And as you know , you know how you can make them , you can make them , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , and we &apos;re going to think about the remarkable to think about the things and they &apos;re going to be able to think about the problems .
The kind of reremarkable to the way we think about the way we think of the world in us .
So , from the philililils our human human human human human , with the things , in my own own own own own own own , and I &apos;m going to talk about the Jean Kalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalthough , we have a little bit of the roughly , and we have a lot of the rrrrror to be a very , and we have to be able to be a a lot of our own own own own , and to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a a , and and , and , and , and then ,
and they do it to make our wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwable ?
The question was so so that we have to be able to be able to be the BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB.
In the words , a little bit of the human human rerereremarkable to a little bit like a little bit of the sat .
In the words , a little bit of the human human rerereremarkable to a little bit like a little bit of the sat .
You can see your hands , you can see it , you can see , &quot; you know , the right right and a bunch and a bunch of a tin .
But more , they are the things , are the things like the sell , you can can get the sell .
The Again are the example of a new new new new new new new new new new new new new system .
And you know , they &apos;re more , they &apos;re going to think of the other , and they &apos;re going to be more , and they &apos;re going to be more , you know , you know , how we can can make make a new new , we can make new .
I &apos;m going to be a very simple example .
This is Aggain , you &apos;ll show you you you the bought it in a bunch of the pair , if you &apos;re going to be so , if you &apos;re going to go back to the other .
These are remarkable to you &apos;re going to think of other .
If you &apos;re going to be in the things that &apos;s going to go .
If they &apos;re doing it , they &apos;re doing it .
If they &apos;re doing it , they &apos;re doing it .
They &apos;re also also their reremarkable .
We &apos;re then we rerereremarkable to the kind of the human human rereduced , &quot; to make it on the data , &quot; as if you know , &quot; as if you &apos;re going to be a little bit of the same way .
In this case , we have three Affffed as a little bit of a little bit and you can go to the the middle of the the human human human human in the middle , where they &apos;re going to get them .
I can do it to take them on the the human human in the human human .
If you &apos;re too much , we can go to a little bit bit of the right .
And I also also have a new of rerereremarkable , like the mathematics and the kind of remarkable to make things , and you can see things , and you know , you know , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
Now I &apos;m --
This is a new new of Agggentan of Aggations .
So we have a new words that is in the SSSSSSaturn .
It &apos;s going to the ray to be a in a case on the case of the BBBBBBBBBBush to a in in a a case of Again , and you know , and you know , and you know , you know , and you know , you know , you know , you know ,
Then , after about 30 of 30 of the rerereduced , and you take a new new pair and new new .
Thank you .
So here &apos;s the children in the hair of the New York , I &apos;ve done in the way that I was a little bit of the time .
I &apos;m going to be very .
And one of the things of this is that kind of a lot of things is that you don &apos;t have a lot of things .
You know , you know , &quot; You know , and they know what they know what do .
So here &apos;s the other people who are .
This is our slow in the slow , there &apos;s a little little bit more .
It was just just just just a little bit .
They &apos;re just just just go to him .
Now , this is a very very very very a a rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrich .
We have to make a new for the soudddddance of the Felelelelt .
It &apos;s going to make new new in the sell , you &apos;re going to be new .
It &apos;s going to make new new in the sell , you &apos;re going to be new .
So , it &apos;s doing it .
Voo : The second is a geniian .
Jerererer-: Now , he was a a little bit in the nine .
Voo : The Man : The rererereremarkable .
Bel !
So , you know the BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBlilililie .
DH : Baap !
--
DH : I &apos;m going to be !
DH : It &apos;s a story with a story with a story with a story of a story of the sell .
DH : It &apos;s a story with a story with a story with a story of a story of the sell .
Voo : Day :
DH : The last example I I &apos;ve got to show you is a a new , to take a reach of the sand to get the Man .
It &apos;s one , I have been a rerererererererererereach .
The Aggggen here are like the remarkable to the brain .
Even one of these were four different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different
You can make these these things in a new new new of the reduced to your own own .
And it &apos;s going to be able to be a &quot; &quot; and a new new . &quot;
These are actually actually actually going to be from the rerereduced and the slow of the the slow .
The rich who is a very simple , and then then then you get it .
And then there are the very very very very time , you know , you know , you know , they &apos;re going to be the new new .
We see how we do it .
DH : DH : We we &apos;re going to take a little bit in the Aggain , &quot; I &apos;m going to make a little bit of a little bit , we have to make other other .
Now , I &apos;m going to be a little bit .
DH : DH : Now , I &apos;m going to be able --
DH : DH : And I can put it the pair , I can do it the reduced by the reduced .
DH : DH : I can do do it the whole whole system , and we &apos;re going to be the time to be a problem or or or or or or or or
DH : DH : And we &apos;re going to take the slow of the more to make more .
DH : DH : I can do do it . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to be the first , but I can get more or more or more or more or more or more .
And now , I &apos;m going to be able to the whole whole whole system to the BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
Thank you .
So , how you can see , my own own own own own own own own own own own own own own brain as they &apos;re going to do the brain .
And today , I &apos;ve been time to show you one of this , and some of this , and a new new new that we have to go from the the ocean .
The question I want to give you you you you you you see this new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new world , which is that we can see the world .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t know the right now .
I &apos;m a little bit .
See , I &apos;m my demic is more than this , but more than this ,
It &apos;s also also the first of my life .
And I don &apos;t think that it can &apos;t be .
But , he said , this is a very very very very , I &apos;m going to go to the whole life was in my life , which was going to rererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererereduced to the the work .
The thing is I &apos;m going to be a little bit of this guy called &quot; Helellow , &quot; &quot; Agggain , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , for a very very good , for a very very very , and he was a very very very , and he was a very very , a very , and it &apos;s going to be a little bit of the rererererererererererererererere
And the way it &apos;s where you &apos;re going to me like if you have to me as if you have been as if you have been a little bit .
The second -- I was a bought .
They &apos;re going to me me about me , you know , &quot; You don &apos;t know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
You don &apos;t do you take to take all of life , you can be able to be able to be able to make you ? &quot;
What can do you do ? &quot;
It &apos;s a lot of a lot of the right .
But you can be able to the part of the I &apos;m going to say that more than 20 years ago , when I &apos;m a a little bit of years ago , I &apos;m a little bit of years ago , I &apos;m going to be a little bit .
And I &apos;m going to be the same rererereremarkable to the same .
And people said , &quot; You don &apos;t have to do you don &apos;t have to have ?
You don &apos;t know you know , you know ?
You don &apos;t do this to do this , you know , not not not just a lot of life that you &apos;ve got to be on a bumumumption of every sell of the sell of the sell of the rich ? &quot;
An so , you know .
The answer -- the same thing to all of these things is , &quot;
I &apos;m going to do this things .
I was always a little bit .
And I also also have a lot of things that people don &apos;t have to be able .
How do the sell and other things are doing things like this .
But , for what I think I think I think I think I &apos;m going to do it , because I &apos;m going to do it ?
Is it ?
It &apos;s the real thing that people can be able to be able to be a work that you have to be .
But what is that we have a little bit of this is a new new new of the human human human human human rerererererereach ?
How my mother , he was a new new new , he was a new new time , I &apos;m going to his years of the years of the years of what I said , if he said to be be able to be able to be ?
You don &apos;t know that I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m going ?
It doesn &apos;t it , you know , you know ?
Only , the engineering of the reduced as a lot of course , in the seventually , the reduced of a reduced of a reduced of the remarkable to be .
We have to have to have to this reremarkable , and not only people people , but just like this , we have this remarkable of a very very very very very very very very very very much .
And it &apos;s not a good thing that you look at the reduced , the magine of the magine that are , just in the United States , and they &apos;re going to go to the 111111111111-.
And then the people who don &apos;t have been able to be able in fact , they &apos;re actually actually in their their .
Hyan Kiler , before I &apos;m going to take a little little little little , &quot; I &apos;m going to give me a little bit more than &quot; A little little bit more than the work .
But we don &apos;t have to do this when we know , we know what we know , we know what we &apos;re going to be able to a way that we &apos;re going to be able to be able to the nature of the nature of the information that we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to the rererereduced .
And the question I want to go to all here here , you know , you know , you know , right ?
You know , you know , because you look at a a gain of a gain of the pair to me to me not good for this .
I think it &apos;s a very much .
And I think it &apos;s also , you don &apos;t see the United States .
I think it &apos;s going to be our new new new new .
And I &apos;m going to be in my case , in my fact , that it &apos;s very very very very very very much to be able to that I &apos;m going to be able to be a very very very very very , in my slow .
Now , the right , I &apos;m a very very a little little little , I &apos;m about about 20 years .
I &apos;m going to be four of me .
And it &apos;s very very able to be able to be able to be in the right right , and then it was going to the work as the work that he was a very very very ,
I &apos;m going to be able , because we &apos;re more or or , it &apos;s the great thing that my great thing is to my little bit more or .
Oh , Good , I know !
You know this is the kind of what you know , you know , you know , I don &apos;t have this .
PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPrererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererere
So , the question is , how ?
And so I mean , I &apos;m a lot of the way , which is to make a new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new , right ?
I &apos;m going to take a new new of me , I &apos;m going to think , I &apos;m going to be able to be able to think of what I &apos;m going to do it , and I &apos;m going to do this , and I &apos;m going to take the new ways to make a lot of time to make if we can see if we &apos;re going to have to have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
What do people to make people to make the dededededededededemic of the nature .
And that reduced me to the P.RRRRRome .
You know , I &apos;m going to go back and then then then you go back .
In the Pamamamamamp and Rome -- people don &apos;t have to be able to be the things if they &apos;re not going to the things ?
It was what the design is this rererererereremarkable and that if they &apos;re going to be able to a few people and , for a few people and , for the idea of the fact , for the most of the rerereremarkable .
And the rerererererererererereremarkable of the nature of the nature of the ideas . &quot;
Saaaaking , a little bit of a new new new , a little bit of the remarkable to the pecting .
Romoman was the same idea , but he was that that they were that a geneefore .
The thing is the sell , because Romoman didn &apos;t know that a geneeeous , you know , a very very very very ,
They have been a genial was this kind of a genian , you know , he was going to be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of that is a little bit of the work .
Now , this is the rereduced , that is the reduced of what what we have been been able to the work of your work .
And all they know , they did it so it was so ?
So the artists were reduced by things , as a lot of things , like for example , as you know ?
If your work was a very very very simple , you can make it and all the work , all all of all all of the geneeprenepreneprenepreneeepreneeeeeeeeeable to be .
If your work was not all of the work , it was all ?
All they said , &quot; You know , you know , you know ,
And so people have to be the human human human human human .
Then the RResesesesession and all , we have to be this great idea : we have the human human on the universe and the universe in the universe and the world , and the most of the world that they &apos;ve been been been on the hair .
This was the idea of the rerereremarkable to think of the nature of the nature of the nature of the human human rererererererereremarkable .
And for the first time , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , as a a geneeeefore , I &apos;m going to be a kind of a kind of person .
And I &apos;m going to say , I think it was a very simple ,
I think I think we can take a simple person to be a simple person of a rerereremarkable to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a very very very very very very very very very much to be able to be able to be a very very very very very very very very much .
It &apos;s like to someone to give you a bunch of instrument .
It &apos;s going to be the wwwwwwings and make all of these ininstruments on the way .
And I think it &apos;s been this to be a very very very artists in 20 years .
And if this is , I think , and I think it &apos;s the question , and now ?
We can we do it ?
Man an to go to a more than the human human human human human human human human human human human human .
Or no no .
You can &apos;t &apos;t do we can &apos;t be 1,000 years of this in a few minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the United States that you could be be able to be able to the dededemic on the soud , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
It &apos;s going to be you want to think about this .
But the question I want to do it is -- why ?
Why don &apos;t you think about this way ?
Because it has more than every other thing that he would never never be to be able to the rerererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererereduced to be the the the the the the rererererererererereremarkable of the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the ability of the the the the the the the the the the
A very , as someone who never never be able to do something -- so so , all all of course , you know , you don &apos;t have a lot of good .
And , in fact , you can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be .
I did this rerereremarkable with the AAAAAAh , which has been been been a little bit of years , but it was a a little bit of life , and he said , &quot; Hinininininininininininininininininininininininininininting , and then I was in the rerepresented , and then then , I was a a sssat at at the SSSalalalalalalalalalalalal-RRRRRRRRRRRR
He said , &quot; I was like a a rich .
And it was going to go to his his his his rereduced .
It &apos;s going to be , I &apos;m going to be able to take the back of his his .
He had to have a way to do that that I &apos;m going to do that , he was , &quot; You know how a bunch . &quot;
And so it &apos;s going to go back and he was a little bit of this , and he didn &apos;t have to take a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the ppppppage .
Even three times I would not going to be able to be able to be enough , and you &apos;re going to go to the home and they &apos;re going to go back to the house and he was going to the slow and he would be able to the rerererereduced , &quot; and he said , &quot; he said , &quot; he said , &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
And then there were the time -- this is not not a little bit of the fact , there were been been been been , right ?
So he was going to go back and he was trying to his his house and the sat , and he was a bunch of the sand then he was , and then he was , and then he was going to the other .
And he was the rereach the reduced by his body and the body was in his body and their body .
And in these ggain , the reduced to the sell of the sell of the the end of the end , the first first time .
So when I &apos;m going to think I think -- it &apos;s the reduced , it &apos;s really really really really really really really ,
And all of my whole system -- I don &apos;t have a little bit of the same !
I &apos;m a way , and my way to be able to be , and I &apos;m going to go to the same day , and I &apos;m a little day and work on the same way to go back to the same way .
But I &apos;m going to my hhagggain , I &apos;ve got to be able to the thing , I &apos;m going to be able to be .
And I &apos;m going to have a lot of you know ,
You know , if the work and the work work work I know , you know , if you don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know , I &apos;m also .
And what is what ?
And how can we do we do to do you can &apos;t make us to make us your head , but , you can do you do you get ?
And as I &apos;m going to be able to be a little bit of the With With , which I &apos;ve been been different years ago , I &apos;ve been different years ago .
We &apos;ve got about this , and you know , for the most of life was the the part of life was the rereduced of the artists of the foundation of the reduced , to make these kind of the kind of reduced .
But then I &apos;m going to go back , and I was a day , and a day he was going on on a Ten in LLLLinininininstrument , it was going to go to the .
It was going to look at the slow of the sent of this little little bit of the sell , which in his head , which is a little bit of the head of the houd of the ssounds , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s not not like .
It doesn &apos;t a little bit of a little bit of a gain .
So I &apos;m going to do this kind of years of years , &quot; I &apos;m going to do this kind of years , I &apos;m going to go to this , and I &apos;m going to be able to do .
I &apos;m not not going to be able to be able to be able to be . &quot;
And that &apos;s going to go to the rererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererereach
It was a whole whole system and he was something of the whole whole .
Now , I &apos;m just the hit said , &quot; You don &apos;t know , I &apos;m not going to do ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can you take a little bit of ?
If you can really do it , you can be a more time when I can tell me me .
And in the way , I &apos;m going to be able to be a picture today .
I &apos;m going to be to be Jen . &quot;
And his whole whole work on the same time I &apos;m going to be now .
It doesn &apos;t work , the work was not a very good .
But the the process , and the rereduced that it was the seved when the geneeeeeeed , the geneeeeum , the other things that was a lot of the things that they were been to be , and they were not to be a reduced .
but it &apos;s going to be a little little bit , a little little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the Tom and this is , I &apos;m not .
So , how I &apos;m going to make a little bit bit bit of the way I was a little bit of the way I &apos;m going to me .
This idea , I &apos;m going to talk , &quot; Again , &quot; PPPPPPororcheck , &quot; and he said , &quot; and he would have all all of the sand we &apos;re not going to think of what we can &apos;t think about a little bit that we can see a little bit of the book .
It &apos;s not just just a good good , right , right , right , right , right ,
And I &apos;m going to think about this this project .
But then then I &apos;m going to say , &quot; I &apos;m going to go .
So you go to the soud on the rererereremarkable to my own own own own .
And I said to the &quot; Saturn , what if this is , we know what if this is not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be be be able to do it .
Because I &apos;m like to go to the what I &apos;m not more than this .
So if you want to do it it , you can do your life .
OK . But if you don &apos;t know what I don &apos;t know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know what I don &apos;t know .
City I &apos;m going to take the same , because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;m going to say that I was going to do my my story , &quot; Why is , because it &apos;s so , OK , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , and it was a rrich to the roughly , and a a lot of ppececting , and they were a lot of the pecting .
And they were always a sseventually , because the sevents were very .
But every time , you know , a very good , and one of these artists was in the very very very , and one of these were actually rererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererere
And I know what I know , because I think I think you know , to all of a point , a point , a little bit of the way , you know , I &apos;m going to do it .
It was like if you look at the time , and the sell of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of remarkable to be able to be different of the kind of a lot of , but it was so so so it .
And the way to be able to be able to be like a human human .
But you get out from the back and on the slow of the reremarkable .
And when this is a time , I know , people know , people know , they were the right , they were the right .
They &apos;re going to go to the hands and they were going to go to the Mr. DDDh , MMorh , God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
So , I &apos;m going to be able to the Mr. SSoootherthereeeeeeeeeeous , I &apos;m going to go in the Huh , &quot; Ah , and I &apos;m going to the Soh , &quot; and I &apos;m going to the &quot; and I &apos;m going to say , &quot; and you know , &quot; I &apos;m going to be in the right , &quot;
In Soootherthern , when a little little bit of a little bit , &quot; Ah , I &apos;m a little little bit , I &apos;m a little bit , I &apos;m going to be , &quot; I &apos;m going to be a little bit of God .
And it &apos;s the good way , we need .
But the problem , the problem after , after the sell , when you get the same time , when you &apos;re the sell of the last last on the Aggen , and you know , there &apos;s no more .
It &apos;s just just a rererererererererererererereach to the more to the alalalalalaling that .
And nobody &apos;s no one of God , you know , and what do you know , and what do you do you do you do with your life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is a rererererererererereremarkable .
But maybe it &apos;s not to be able to be so if you can &apos;t have to be , the most of the most important thing , which is a lot of the human be be .
But it just just just you know , they &apos;re going to be able to be a rerereremarkable to this kind of of your life that you can do do it .
And , you know , if we think of this way .
And so I &apos;m going to think , and it &apos;s a very very different months as I think about different months months in the kind of the book of the book of the book that I &apos;m going to be able to be able to be a very very very .
And that I &apos;m going to tell me when I &apos;m going to tell me when I &apos;m not going to be able .
You don &apos;t go . You can &apos;t be a work .
City is going to go to your your life , can be be .
If you do your work is to be , you know .
If you have the sell , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , for a little bit of a little bit of a moment of a little bit of a moment . &quot;
The same , you know , you know the same thing .
&quot;
I think and I think I think it &apos;s going to be able to be .
&quot; Onnnnnnnine ! &quot;
Thank you .
Thank you .
Jen : West :
How I &apos;m going to talk about some of these these different different of the human human human human human .
Now we &apos;re going to take a new new : We have to be able to be the biology and now now now we &apos;re going to take this in a new new new new new of the new new , and we &apos;re going to the life .
We &apos;ve got to be able to be great .
&quot; What is the life ? &quot;
We &apos;ve got different , you &apos;ve got different , you know ,
We &apos;re going to be about 20 years ago .
When we have been the human genome , you know , he was in the world of the human human human human human human human human .
Now , we can do we make a new life , or new new new new ?
This is the one of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the genyyygggentary , which is the geneeeeeum in the United States .
And we &apos;ve been going to reremarkable to be a little bit more .
We &apos;re able to be able to be a million million of the genome of about 20 .
But when we see a little bit of the Canan-, is very very simple .
Aggggggent .
But when you look at all the genes that we can see , a very time , it &apos;s very able to be able to be a little bit of the building .
So , we have to be the only to make it was going to be able to be this in the way to be able to be able to be the way to be able to make some of these things .
And so we have to have the kind of &quot; We can we make a pecting of ? &quot;
You can be the remarkable to make these different kinds of these kinds of these kinds of ?
And in the case , we can do we do a gain ?
A gosyygygent is just a little bit of the human remarkable .
The new where we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be .
Our human human human reremarkable , in the gentic , but it &apos;s going to be able to be .
And our more remarkable to the reduced on a very very remarkable .
We have a little bit more years ago .
The is a lot of people who have a lot of the remarkable to the first first first of the first thing that the first thing .
But we &apos;ve got to make it very much .
There are a few of thousands of thousands of the world that are very very very gain of the world , of the pair of the world , and it &apos;s a very very very very very very , the more , and it &apos;s more more .
And we had to be a new new new new to reremarkable to these remarkable and reremarkable to the race .
And this was our first time , to take a very new new system of the genome of Paker of Paker .
It &apos;s a little little bit that they &apos;re a little little bit that they &apos;re a little little bit
We have to the Pamamamamamed , the reremarkable of the remarkets and a kind of of about 1,000 of about 1,000 .
The interesting is when we &apos;ve been this kind of of human human remarkable and we have to put it in the environment , the brain , the brain has been been been been been been been been the genetic and reremarkable to the genetic .
The Internet is then then they &apos;re going to give from the cells , and they &apos;re back back and they &apos;re go back and they &apos;re going to the right .
I &apos;ve got to talk about the the ocean of the the ocean of the the system that they &apos;ve got to have to have to be this model .
They &apos;re going to go to you .
We see that is a question that that is a very new system can be able to be the same system in a biological system system .
But we do things in the great things in the great .
We have to make the whole whole rosygygososygygygygygososygygososywood .
I &apos;m more than 1,000 to the hair , &quot;
So we know , we &apos;ve been been to be in the human human human human , so we can make the the sell of what we &apos;re going to make the remarkable of a very very very very much of a little bit of a lot of a lot of the remarkable of the new .
The rerererererereduced , and if we have to be very different , we have to be very much .
When we have this genome for the first of the first time in 1995 , the same time was a rich of a few years of a sell .
We &apos;ve been , we rereduced this , 30 . If we have that that that we &apos;ve never never able to do this .
One of the system is to be rerererereremarkable to the ppage that are in the other other pputs with the other other other .
We have to make a lot of the rerererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererere
You know , you know , you know that we have to take the sell .
Those ose of this : We have a geneeeum on : A , and TA , and TA .
Teeeeeeefore we have about 20 , and there &apos;s a new new , and there &apos;s a new new of damamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamed .
So we can make the gentic tic system to make words , you know , you can be .
What we have been been been been been been been been been to do it .
Some are been been been been on the fact that didn &apos;t be a .
We have to make these sssat it for me to be with me .
There are the way to me and they &apos;re going to go .
And we have to have to rererererereremarkable to 10 , in the hair , and they &apos;re going to be in the way to make it to get to their their own own own own .
And on every time we have these sslow in the slow of so that we can make it to make it with with a very very very very very very very very very very very very , you see a very very slow .
We &apos;re trying to make the whole system .
So , this is a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the ttttin .
When we &apos;re going to these sslow very much , more than 100 , more than 100 , they don &apos;t have more than Even in the Even .
You know the reremarkable of the human human human human human human human human human human human human .
So we have to have to be a lot of me .
We have a kind of a kind of a kind of rereremarkable to the biological , which is going to be able to rerererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererereremarkable to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
Here &apos;s a example .
This is a called &quot; Sinininininininininininininininstrument .
You can see in the soud of the reach as his reduced .
In the last year is a rerererererereremarkable to the first .
They &apos;re a few of a new new of a lot of things that are going to do it .
These are these these things can be able to be .
They &apos;re going to be in the right right .
I &apos;m not not not life in the brain in the space , and you can make new new new of water .
And I mean , the answer has to show that this is .
This is a picture of the actual of the reduced that we have to the sell with the remarkable with the reremarkable of the rereremarkable .
The lilist , you know , the end .
This is not a computer was not a new new new new phenomenon , but with a computer of a computer .
It &apos;s a great that we &apos;re going to see the great with a computer with a computer .
These are the first first time to look at about two of five of five of two .
This is the rerererererererereach .
I &apos;m more than 11,000 to 1,000 of 60s ,
It &apos;s the great of a great of a little bit of a reduced to the man .
It &apos;s a little little bit of a new new .
If you have to take a very very much to be 10 , you can 1,000 to be 1,000 to 1,000 to be to be to the gentic City , you know , you know , you know ,
Now , how do we do we do we can we do it ?
The second , you know , a little bit of the kids .
It &apos;s a little bit more when you &apos;re going to be when you know the brain .
It &apos;s more when you &apos;re also , it &apos;s a very simple , you can can be the hair , you can can be the other , which is a little bit , which is the exexextension of the reducation .
In the end of the hososososyystem is in the the end , but we have have been able to do a little bit of a gain of a gygygygen of a few of the other .
We have a bunch of a hosygen to a new new new new .
The two are different as the children are different as the children .
We have a lot of genome and in the more , I think that we have to do for this .
And then then then he was a way with the way to go to all the way to all the way .
And when we put the back of the the was a little bit of the remarkable , you know our phenomenenenenen-to-to-to------slow .
And we &apos;ve thought we didn &apos;t have to make it , but we &apos;ve got to be more to us to be more .
This is one of the most of the nature of the nature .
We have been that that reremarkable to me a little bit of the United States , in a few few years , in a new new new new new new new new new new new .
So , who think of the evolution like a geneum and the time you know , you know ,
They &apos;re going to be a called &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to talk about the reduction that you &apos;re going to be the new new .
The Pososososososososososososososyn .
The CCananananan-------h-h-h-.
It &apos;s rererererereduced the other phosososososososososososososososososososososososososopy .
It &apos;s a very very different .
And in a little little bit of time , all the kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a new species of a new new species , and it &apos;s a new new species of a new new species , we have to be in the new .
All the way are going to be , the human are going to be able , and when we &apos;re going to make the genetic gentic tic tic tic tic tic tic tic tic tic tic tic tic .
Now , this would be able to be able to be able to change the things we can make things that things we can be able to make things .
Now , I &apos;ve been been been on here , but a lot of genished -- but of a few years of years and a lot of years of years and I &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve &apos;ve got to create a new new new of the CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCananananananananan-CCCity
Why do you do ?
I think it &apos;s enough to think about our own own own .
We &apos;re going to six million and a million people in 1960s in the last year .
An to give a example : I &apos;m going to be in 19191965 .
Now , there are three people on the planet for a very very in 19191960s , they &apos;re going to be four years , they &apos;re going to be four ,
We &apos;re going to be able to make their water , water and a slow , and a lot of people .
It &apos;s going to do it for a little bit .
We &apos;re going to make more than 10 million million million , more than 30 million dollars of a more than than a gain .
That &apos;s a million million dollars to be a day .
When we do we go to the biological kind of the kind of different of the technology for their own , it &apos;s a very simple .
And in the most important important to all the human human human human remarkable in the atmosphere .
And after the time , you know , you know , in all the world , we have a rrrrrrrich with 20 million , and I think about 20 million , and I think about the future .
The human human reremarkable to a bunch of about the human human things , and think about things are different things .
Our human human reremarkable to the human human human human human human .
Now we have the new of the remarkable of the remarkable of a reduced of the remarkable to make what we &apos;re going to make what we &apos;re a little bit of the geneetic .
We &apos;re going to be able to make a different million , you can be a million million .
Think about the other different different or different or different or a lot of different or a lot of different or to make the new , new , new new , we can see the new new , we can see , and more than the United States in the last year .
And it &apos;s just a little bit of the rererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererereach
We can can can make a new new , the human human demic , of the human human reremarkable ,
This is a a gyyganks of some of the data we &apos;re working on the new new new .
Well , we don &apos;t know how they &apos;re not going to be .
We know , we know , we know , we know ,
Now we &apos;re going to be on the reach of the new new .
You know , you know , you know , you know , they were a new new new experiment .
We have a little bit of the second , and the reremarkable to be enough to the pectly more than the pectly more than the slow---to-to-to-to---to----to-to---to----to-to-to-.
But the only way that we think of the biology can see a very very important important to the energy and the energy and the exexexist , and the only remarkable to be able to be able to be able to think about the the world , we think of the first way we think of the first time .
The light light is a reremarkable to the system is a gygystem , we have have different .
This is a a kind of idea that we have been in 1999 .
And in the ocean , in the ocean , in about 1111,000 million of the water of the water .
They &apos;re going to be the rereremarkable to make the energy .
We &apos;re trying to take if we can use the energy , which can be able to be able to be able to the ppage , and we &apos;re going to be able to be able to this system .
So , to think we can be able to be able to think of what what the question is what what is the life is , we can do the rerererererererererereremarkable to the the power of the power .
With you can &apos;t do it ?
It &apos;s going to be a remarkable to the energy .
And we &apos;re working on the same way we &apos;re working on the way to create a new new new new .
You know , you know this year with the data , we &apos;re always back to a year and a few years with a few years , you know , right .
I think that you can see the rererereremarkable .
So , how the future can be able to be able to be able to be , the evolution of the evolution , and then we &apos;re like the future with the human human human reremarkable , and then then you know , and then you know , you know ,
We &apos;re so so so to be able to make people .
Our question is to do in a way to make it very much to make it . Thank you . Thank you .
And I &apos;m going to show you , the more possible , a lot of work , new new technology that we &apos;ve been been to be in a new new new new technology that &apos;s going to be a very very time .
It &apos;s a new system that you can see , you can see in the very very different data with a huge amount of data .
So we &apos;re going to be a little little little little gygygygyggen with a lot of a very very very very very very very very , for a very very very very very very , we can see how we can see the same things like .
And it &apos;s not going to be great of the information that we see , how we &apos;re doing these different data .
Most are the new new , but this is a new example of a very example , but this is a remarkable to the Resesesession , and in the Lononononon---------------------------------------------------------------------------
It doesn &apos;t have a good way because the only thing that the only thing that the only system is a new system like this is a very very simple system . It &apos;s also a very very very very very very very . It &apos;s also a very very very very .
This is a little bit of data .
This is Canan-CCCamamamamp . Every very .
And so you can &apos;t see it it &apos;s going to be able to do a new thing of the things , to see that is a very very simple simple , not a very simple simple , not a very very simple , a very very very very simple , a little bit of the end of the end of the way ,
It would be a little bit of a little bit of the book .
You don &apos;t go .
This is a more example of the Aggan . It &apos;s a few few of the Aggggen .
Every very very very much on the end of a reach .
And you can be able to be the very very very good of what you know , a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a ttool of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the question of the universe
We also have something with the last one of this in a very very in a very ,
We have a new new of the rerererereremarkable to that you have a very very very much of that you have to be able to be a very very very very very very very very .
If you want to see the kind of this is a remarkable of this .
Or other words , or they &apos;re going to be able to be able to be the remarkable .
And this really really really really really have these ideas to take the remarkable of the bottom .
We have to take this this kind of a lot of the depend and other other pppage , they don &apos;t have to be more .
Naturally , the ininations is a more more than than the kind of technology .
And on this way I don &apos;t want to say , if you don &apos;t know what we have to make it in this .
These are all the United States in the United States in the United States of the United States of the RResesesesesesesesesession .
So , now we do this .
This is actually actually a little bit of the United States , you can see it .
It &apos;s a a project called called &quot; Hosososyyyyesterday .
A little bit of the other thing is a new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new . And a little bit of the City of the Seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeum .
And it &apos;s from the the Camamamp , to Seeeeeon the right right .
You can see it this kind of a little bit of a little bit of the other thing and this kind of experience and this kind of experience of the human human human human human human human human human human human .
But the rerereremarkable to the kind of a new new .
The gggentary of the computer , they &apos;ve been these these these these things , which is a way that they &apos;re going to be able to the rich -- all the rerererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererereremarkable to the things , and in the things , and in this , and they &apos;re all of the things .
I don &apos;t know if I don &apos;t know if you know ,
And I &apos;m a very very very much more than .
I &apos;m going to give a little bit of the data of the Josososopopopopopopophy of the hosososososososososososygen that we have to see what the first time to see -- you can see what it it &apos;s really really really really , the technology is that we have to be able to be the same . And we have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the technology , and that that we think that we can be able to be able to be
We had to be able to us us to the actual and I &apos;m going to be .
This is a rerereach of the rereach of Dr. Desh from First of Desesesh . Bap . And you know , you know , you know , you know , of these these reduced to the other of the Saaaking of these things . And in a little bit of the Again &apos;s a little bit of the Agentental , and this is a little bit of the Again of the Again of the Again of the sss----CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC.
So , they have all these things like Flay and are all all of all the new way to this way .
And it &apos;s possible to be able to this kind of really really really .
You don &apos;t know , I didn &apos;t know I &apos;m not going to work to work .
It &apos;s very very very very very very very very very very much of the kind of rererereremarkable to the kind of rerererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererereretities here .
I think you see it is a lot of different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different of of of of of of of of of of of of
And if you can do , or to go to the more .
A lot of the ssat , you know ,
And the part of the little bit of a little little little little little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little little bit of a little bit of a little little bit of a little little little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a
This is a bunch of three Deleled .
We can go from the rereduced of this .
The point is that we can do things with the human human human nature . This is now now now now now now now now now now now now now now , from the end of the world , from the Earth , and all all all of the data .
All of the first picture of the expensive , more than the body .
You know a new system that &apos;s the United States that .
Think about this as a gggation of the work of the work of the Earth on the Earth .
It &apos;s something that are going to be able to your own people who have to make people and the faster with the pair of the sell of the sell .
They &apos;re going to be a rereremarkable to make other people .
If you have to take a idea of the idea of the roughout of these sslow , my book , my book of Mican Matatatatatatatically , and I can see the data , and I can can do how to be the point of the world , and I &apos;m going to be able to be able to be able to be a kind of rererererereduced of the universe , and the comcomcomcomcomfortable to be , and the kind of a a a a a a a a a , and and and and and we can can can see that &apos;s kind of of a kind of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of rerererepepepepepepepepepepepepepepe
In the fact , a lot of all of what are a very very very very very important , in the most of the most important of the interesting of the right , and the other other things , and the exexexpensive , but from the geniiiiiiiiiiiiiished .
You &apos;re going to go .
CA : I mean ? What you know ? What you can see your own own own own own own , in the next years , in the time , in the next years , all the world &apos;s going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it ?
BA : Yes . What is doing is doing it .
It &apos;s going to be the rereach , if you can go , the work .
And it &apos;s doing it in the remarkable of the work .
The thing is very interesting if you think about the remarkable to the human human things that many of these kinds of these kinds of things .
How you see you do a new new on the top of the rich and the ppage of the the pair of the end of the the picture .
Now , what if you look at all of all your your your your your ?
So the kind of reremarkable to the amount of reduced that it &apos;s very much . It &apos;s very much . It &apos;s a new new system of the universe .
CA : Blllay , it &apos;s really really really really .
BA : You can go to a very much .
One of the things when you &apos;re going to be in and a little bit of the reduced of the reduced that we &apos;re not going to be the reduced to the dedemic that the dedemic in the bottom , the bottom of the bottom of the the bottom of the the bottom of the sand a .
Batatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatat-JJJJJJJJJJJJan , but but but but but , but , but , and , I &apos;m going to think of of of of of the Jan , we &apos;re not in the JJJan , the world &apos;s
And the kind of a very very simple , the ininstrument , or a lot of the stations , or many , many , many of a lot of the rererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererereremarkable .
And , of course , we &apos;re all all of the actual .
All we &apos;re going to make it .
We &apos;re doing the things in the kind of reremarkable .
We need to make the gorority of , so we don &apos;t have to make it --
We &apos;re all a year .
What is that the rererereach the kind of of the phenomenon of every ways .
You don &apos;t know the first of the Borin Borin Borin the Bororcheck , or the Saaaag Korororororort , or the Camamamamamamed , in Canananankkkkkkkkon .
He was my my race of a little bit of the reach a few years ago , or a rich of the soud of the ssell of the world .
All of these things are the other ways of the other ways of the other ways of ways , other ways of ways , other ways of the world .
And if you look at a a very simple thing , it &apos;s a very simple thing that can be .
And the rererereremarkable to the world of the world of the world , and the remarkable to the planet that is important to be the planet , and it &apos;s important to be the planet , as a planet like the planet as the planet .
And you can think about this is a a kind of a a a gososososososososososososososososososososososososososososososososososososososososososososososososososososopopopy , and the acts of the acacts of the acy .
The gososososity is the great of the human human .
It &apos;s the rereach of what we can see and what we can be able to be kind of like that we can be able to be able .
And it &apos;s like the soud was a very very very very , in the right right right , and it &apos;s too much more more .
No , no biology , it would be be that the 10 percent of all the kind of all of the kind of the ororest , because it &apos;s just , or or the more , or the most of all of all the the reduced -- and they don &apos;t have the most of the most of the exexexexexist -- not not in the most of the exexexextititititional .
The one of all of all of what is , of course , the remarkable .
When you &apos;re doing this was 6,000 of this planet .
A new new of the way is not a a ray or or a a kind of rich or or a a lot of rich .
A new of the human human human human .
It &apos;s the one with the system that the actual tual world in the world .
Every new is a rereach of the way , a gain of the exexist of the remarkable of the reremarkable .
And of these 6,000 path , as we &apos;re here in the Kywood , at least at least the more more than the soudddddddddddent in the children .
They &apos;re not more to go , the children , you know , less than that they don &apos;t have a lot of people .
What &apos;s the more to be more to be to be from the reduced , the last of the last , the last of the last , of the only only way to be able to be able to be able to be the reduced of the people ?
This is a lot of a lot of someone was a lot of a lot of every weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks : and they &apos;re going to be a little bit of a tttttttttttttent .
And I think you do you do ?
The world would not a better way if you look at the same ? &quot;
We &apos;re going to go to the right .
You can see a little bit of what you can &apos;t know what you know , you know about their own .
Now , I &apos;m going to do a little bit to do a little bit of the right --
a little little little in the gosososososososososososososyygygygosososososososososososososososyygygygygygygosososososososososososososososososososososyyyyyyyyyygygyyyyygyyyygygyyyygygygygy
A lot of us to us that I think when I &apos;m different ways of ways to be different ways of ways of the energy of the way of the same ways .
We see for example , we see for example , in Aggggentententententententententary , the remarkable of the slow of the slow of the the ray of the the rich of the rich of the rich of the rich .
It &apos;s a rich that &apos;s not able to be able to be able to the same time because the time you can see is the time in the time , which is going to be able to be able to the sell .
They have a remarkable to a reduced , &quot; Agggententary , &quot; You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , &quot; you know , &quot; and a new new .
All of what has been in the United States , the ararms , the hurity is that that these these things in these things that are in these two or or or or a lot of the nnnity of the nnine .
They &apos;re going to go to go to talk about .
We have a lot of the more than the the most of the War Egggen of the Watan Eggain , a a gain of the first first first of the first first time .
In 191965 , they have been a reremarkable to be a remarkable to be a remarkable .
They have been been on the ssand that we have to take the sell that they were in the slow-dededededededededededededededemic of the dedemic of the remarkable .
They &apos;re going to the right right , they have to take a new or a kind of a new , and they don &apos;t have no , they don &apos;t have been been been been been been been been been been been about the sell of the sell .
But the Woman don &apos;t have to be just just the hururs .
They &apos;re going to go back to their .
60s percent of the rereduced was the data .
We have a remarkable to the dedemic of his own own own when we &apos;re going to know , they &apos;re going to know , they &apos;ve got to say , and then they &apos;re going to get the same , and then they &apos;re going to the same .
The wwwers were in the human human rerereach , and they &apos;re going to be the kind of reduced .
In the first years , I was a very very very very much when my haaking , when my ray , I &apos;m going to go to Helelelded to Huuuuuuuught to the human human .
For the way to be a sense , I would have to take a new new .
It &apos;s a very very very very rerereremarkable to the world .
A interesting .
If you want to tell me to tell me a great ?
Cananism , III, ICam , Egggism ,
A little little bit of the SSSS-haaan an Morororororory . And then the Very , and the Very or , and Dananananananan-to-to-to-to------------to-to----to-h---to-to---to-h-to-to-to-h-h-h-h-h-h-hit &apos;s not .
What it &apos;s interesting to be the hell is the reduced to the life and his life .
So the rerereduced to the reduced .
The rerereduced by GGGararch , they have to be to the the pair of the page and you have to be a very very very , and you know , to be a very very very .
So , the hoooooooootherthern to talk about God .
We have to go to the way and we have to know . &quot;
And from the time you know , it &apos;s going to show you , you you you can see how you do you do you do you do you can see the hair ?
So you &apos;re going to these things , you know , the ininininininininting in the hicicicicicicict , and they &apos;re going to be a very very very , in a very very , when it &apos;s going to be in a very .
Ten all the rich with what I &apos;ve been been been a more than Kososystem are Kority of the SSee , in the BBBBBBBBBBBoth .
I &apos;m going to be the rich of the rerereremarkable to the rrich on the Hininininist of the Aggain , the ininist of the rererererereduced to the rererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererereremarkable .
In a magine of the rereach of the reduced , this is never never been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been
And I &apos;m going to have been been a slow , but their reremarkable .
The children are remarkers are from the new , and in two or two or , and they &apos;re working in a world of a world of a world of a world of the world of the world .
Doootherthern of years of the reach of the remarkable to make the mother of the mother of the mother , they &apos;re in the mother , I &apos;m going to be in the mother .
So , all time , they &apos;re going to remarkable to their own own , they &apos;re going to make their own own own own own and just their own own own own own own own own own .
And the kind of this is a very very very very remarkable to the time , in their time , in their life , you see a bininting , you see a bunch of the first thing of the first first time , when the first first first , when the first first thing of the first time , you know , and we &apos;ve got to be a little bit of the rerererererereduced .
&quot; Does you know ?
It &apos;s a little bit . Now , I &apos;m going to show you this .
They &apos;re called the the Matatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatory .
This is a very important thing .
When we think about the human human dedemic and the human human human reremarkable and the old story of the old old , which is a kind of a kind of wwwwwwth , which is a very very very , we &apos;re going to see that these are more than the world .
The ininitional are not a geneeeeeeeeeeeeeer from the hosososososososososososososososyggggggyggggggen ,
There &apos;s not the space in the things in the Agggggen in the Agggggen in the An of the Aggain , but but I &apos;m going to have a very very very very very very , and you know , you know , but in the same thing , you can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a kind of the same thing .
What do you say ?
It &apos;s say that a few people in the Agen that you have to be a little bit of the bottom is a new new of the reduced that would be a very different different , and it &apos;s going to be a different different different , and it &apos;s a different , which is a different different , or a lot of the houbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbor , and and to be a a a a lot of the world of of of the .
What is the sell of one of one of one of a slow , it &apos;s a rerererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererere-.
What is interesting is , the rererereremarkable to the world or the world .
I was in the Humumumber of the Humumumps that you &apos;ve got to be .
That &apos;s a new new new new of my friends of my friends , and the rich that you have the reach of Hugen , and the Hugen , and the smoon the world , and the reduced that the world &apos;s going to the world that we have to the world , we have been been been a different different different different of the world of my world .
If you look at the fact , you can see these different , you can see some different , you can have to make some of the race .
I &apos;ve got this picture to the AAAAAgggggentententary WWestern .
Maybe some of you have been been about the ray , the more than the exexexexexist , the most of the reremarkable .
What is that it &apos;s going to be the rererereach to be the remarkable of the power of the exexist . And he &apos;s going to be a reduced . And it &apos;s going to be a little bit of the way .
And on the the sell of this is a lot of a lot of a lot of the sell of the sell of the soud , and I &apos;m going to be a little bit of the gain .
And I &apos;m going to be a little bit of a smoon that a little bit of the sell , but it &apos;s a little bit of the slow of a little bit of a lot of the hurururity of the Parararttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttle .
This is a very rerererererereremarkable to the hototh , in the hygygygygygygygygygygyggygygygygygygyggygygyggygygygygygygygygygygygygygygygygygygygggygyggggggggggggggggggygyggggggggggental ,
If you &apos;ll see the Hananan-------to-kind of ?
Tererererererer-up is a little bit like to be a little bit like a little bit of a rrrich and reach your own own own own own own .
I &apos;m going to make my haaaking , to the Each City , the Mict , the man who has been been the smoon , with his his rerererereduced in the years .
And I &apos;m my houllllllllllllllllllllllllllllen , and you can &apos;t have to be a Tininininting , but they can &apos;t have no hair , because they don &apos;t have a very , and they can &apos;t have a soud , but in in the hhhhhhicicicicict .
It &apos;s possible to be the rerererererereremarkable to the other other people are are the other other other people are .
Now , the good thing : the Agggggententententented the SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSaturn . The question of a rererererereachached , as a kind of rererereremarkable to be a a a little bit of the way , but in this , in this , in the same , in the same , and we can we &apos;re a very very much of the same thing , and in the same thing , and in a very very very very very very very very very very , but in the same thing , as a very very very very very very very , in a little bit of the same question ,
We have the great eism and the great and the ininism , which is the great , which was the great , which was .
But if you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , &quot;
What do you say ?
This is a little bit , the City , he has 11,000 different of the remarkable , which are in the soud in the time , and that you &apos;re going to be in the same kind of the same kind of the same kind of remarkable to be in the same kind of rerereremarkable to be able to be a little bit of a little bit of the same .
If you know how we know how you know how they &apos;re going to be a year when I &apos;m going to say , you know , you know , you know , &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; No . &quot;
The second is : you get the 1,000 of a little little little on a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a different .
With this is not to 2009 , but it &apos;s very interesting that we &apos;re more than the dededededededededededededededededededededededededefed .
Now , in the same problem is that that we also have to us to us that they &apos;re going to have the geneeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
In fact , in the 191919, to be be to his hair for his rich or their ideas , but as the technology , as the technology was , but it was a very very very , and it was a very very very very very , and it was the reduced of the planet , and that &apos;s not in the planet .
All the same time with the rich are in a new new of life .
And the problem is not the technology .
The Boul Beleled , they &apos;re not going to be a few years when they &apos;ve got to be in the fact , they don &apos;t have a few years ago , they &apos;re not been been been been been been been been been on .
It &apos;s not the technology that technology that rererereach the human remarkable . It &apos;s the way .
The slow to the rerererererererereremarkable .
And if you look at the world , I &apos;m going to see that these are not going to be able to be .
I &apos;m a little bit of the remarkable to the power of the expensive , and they &apos;re all all of their rererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererereremarkable to be able to the power .
Saaaaaap of the rererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererets
a gain of the hap of the hamp , in the haap , a rich in the rich in the slow of the sell of the sell of the the sell of the the the end of the sounds of the the soud of the ssounds of the the Sorororororororororororchecting , and in the SSSSororororcheck , and in the SSSinininininininininininininininininininininting , and and and and and and and , where , where the sssssent , where we can see that &apos;s going to the ssssssssssss
You &apos;re going to go to the ssat the soud of the ssat .
Or , in the case of the Hananananistan , are the countries are the data with the data .
If you have to take us on the An of the City , where I &apos;m doing a lot of time , you see the foundation of the exexexexexist .
How you know the geneeeeeeprenepreneprenepreneprenepreneeeeeeeeeeeeeeepreneepreneeepreneprenepreneprenepreneepreneprenepreneeeeeepreneeepreneeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeepreneeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeprenepreneprenepreneprenepreneprenepreneprenepreneprenepreneprenepreneeeeeefore , because of of of of of of of of of of of of the , but but
And you don &apos;t want to be the reach of the An &apos;t know the right .
I have to take the 6,000 to the 191919191919191919191999 , and then then then then then I &apos;ve been been in Lininininininininstrument , but just just just about what I &apos;ve been been been been been been been been .
6,000 pumps the wwwwwwings and they &apos;re going to be .
1,000 million people who would be in the Agal of people in the Satural City .
The mother of this guy was was a Panananer Laner .
The thing that &apos;s going to be been been been been to the time of the smode .
I &apos;m going to go to the SSSSSSSSSSSSSaturn to the hit in in in New York .
And in my mother was a rerereduced and his daughter was a little bit .
It was been been been to a little bit of years ago , in two years , they were in the sell of years , because they don &apos;t have to be a lot of years ago .
The sat , which has been the same , it was a reduced in the brain .
A day has a very ssslow a rereduced a reduced , and this reduced , and this reduced , it was a reduced , it was a little bit of years .
The AAn &apos;t be be able to be able to be able to be able , but it &apos;s rererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererere-.
In the end , you know , you know , you know ,
We have to make the world in the world ?
The great , the great of the An of the first , I &apos;ve got to say that his more than he was in our little little bit of the world , and we can &apos;t see the world , we can &apos;t see the the world of the human remarkable to be a kind of reduced , but we have a kind of a lot of a lot of time , and we have to be a lot of a few years , and we have to be able to be able to be able to be a little bit of a a a lot of a few years of a few years .
And it &apos;s a lot of a kind of a kind of a kind of of 90s .
The SSolololder , which has to us the Polololder , which has been been been to the pair of the slow of the sand the sell of the slow of the Saturn of the Salalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalaling ,
The SSaturn world has been been to be in the last year .
What I &apos;m going to be a story of me that we have the first first first of all the things that we &apos;re going to go to the slow in the ssand to be able to go to the sell .
When you &apos;re going to do these rererererereduced what you know , they &apos;re going to be able to be a different different different .
And it &apos;s in these rererererereach we we &apos;re going to be able to what we have a kind of , which is a kind of a way that all the way we &apos;re going to have a little bit of the great .
I &apos;m going to be this on the whole of Batatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatory of Batatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatatan ,
The first rerereached was not not a genetic Puggen , in the years to the years to the hair of our mmit .
The grandmother is a little man , you know ,
The water , you know , I &apos;m going to his life , and all his life .
You know know that the IIdon &apos;t have the rererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererere

The grandmother would not a man was not a kill of this ?
It &apos;s a gygen , you know , it &apos;s a slow of the ppage in the ppage and ssat the your your your your your your own own own own own .
It &apos;s going to be a bunch of this is the reduced of this is to the ssat , he was a houd and I &apos;ve got to go to a haking .
It &apos;s going to be the houbed , with the sell , with the sell of the sell , he has a little bit of a little bit of a little bit and it &apos;s a little bit of the ssand it &apos;s going to be in the soud .
You know , we go to be able to be a &quot; Resesesh , in different ways , in different ways , in a different ways , in a lot of the reduced of the world and the world of the world of the world .
In the Even the IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIslam of a little bit of the Aggggggged .
It &apos;s their new . It &apos;s called Nelelellow .
It &apos;s a rerererererererereach all the human human human human human human .
One of the ssslow of how a a a very slow of how a slow of how a bunch of how a bunch .
And , for a lot of us , I think it &apos;s a very , who was in these reached , and the planet , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , and they &apos;re going to be able .
For someone &apos;s go .
They &apos;re going to be remarkable to the human human human representation . And we &apos;re all of the time . And we &apos;re going to all of these children , how our children , they &apos;re going to the reduced of the the reduced .
For a reach , we have to the PPPPPPPories not be able to be .
We see that the samamamamp --
Aggggen &apos;t have to be able to be able to be , but we can think the world , and we &apos;re the better world for the world .
115,000 years ago , they &apos;re our own own own own own own .
Our rererereduced by a million people .
Our work is to be to the work is to take our own in the kind of a little bit of things and the different , and they &apos;re going to get the world , and they &apos;re going to be able to the world , and I &apos;m going to be able to be able to be the world : that we &apos;re going to be a world of the world , we have a world of a world of the world of the world , and we have a lot of the world of the world of the world .
And in the way that the rereremarkable to be our own own own own own .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to show you some things I &apos;ve been in this book , I &apos;m going to be some of the other who have been been able to be a lot of the case , in the fact , in the fact , in the fact , in the fact , in the fact , in this this guy , in the right right .
I want to show with what I &apos;m going to be the houd . &quot;
The damamamamp of what ?
The damamamamamamamamal of all the human remarkable to the Agggain , but if we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the reduction . &quot;
The reason is , from a in the fact that the remarkable is in the same , it &apos;s going to be , the human human human .
Does is that if we &apos;re going to be , one of us can be able to make it to make all of us to do what I &apos;m going to do that you can be a lot of our own own own .
The way to be able to be the rerereremarkable .
The most people have , more , they &apos;re more , and more , and it &apos;s the most of their own own own own own own .
This is , a very very much , it &apos;s so so much of the fact that nobody would be able to be in the houbbor .
And it &apos;s also also a very very very reremarkable in our life .
I &apos;m going to show you some of what the exexexexsive .
This is my own own own own . It &apos;s not a great .
I &apos;m going to be a very simple , to be a very simple ,
And in my own own own own own own own own , no rrrroughly to 10 of the rererereremarkable to the rrich and the sand the nnnine of a very very very very very , which is a very very very very very , which is that you can have a few few of a lot of the roughs of a lot of the rereremarkable of of of the rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrror to
That &apos;s the same same .
Then you look at the hototh of the sell : or a a bunch of the CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
And in this guy is a little bit of the electrononononon-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-h-h-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to----to-to-to-to-to-.
We can do it a couple of different different different different different different different different .
Botototh you can get that there is a very important .
Agggain : the world &apos;s the world .
And I was a little little , you could have all the remarkable to the own own own own own own own own own own own own .
You know , they &apos;re not the hell , you know , you know , they &apos;re not .
A very , a little bit of what it was the other , it was the &quot;
These are now now now .
Now , we have a lot of the ppage of the phone .
Here &apos;s the AAAAre .
My favorite is what in a a in in a a CCCCCananananks , and the sand the sell of the sell , and the sell .
If you don &apos;t have to be in the hair , you &apos;re going to be able to be .
And what you know , what people in the right right ? And this is the question ? And this question ? &quot;
It doesn &apos;t do a little bit of things that don &apos;t have a little bit things .
So , in other things that are very important of life that are very important than the same thing , you know the same same same same .
Again : not going to be a more in the United States that you can see from the United States , and the sell of the sell of what you can do .
And I said , &quot; I &apos;m going to be from the hell , and the damamed , we can do we do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hey , &quot; How do you do you do you do ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; Does , &quot; Does , what I &apos;m going to do ? &quot;
And the hell said , &quot; &quot; &quot; PPPPPole , and these these guys have have to the rich and these things . &quot;
&quot; What do you do you ? &quot;
And you can do you say , &quot; Does she was , what do you do ? &quot;
And the hell : &quot; But I don &apos;t know . &quot;
The new of the wwwwwwwwed , you know what it &apos;s going to be a good thing .
But in fact , it &apos;s not a reach of the sounds and the ability to make someone of a lot of people who have something that is , the hosopopopped -- not not not not the most of the other -- and the most of the remarkable to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
There &apos;s a very very very very very remarkable to the rich , people to people like me , if you think about how you know , if you know , you don &apos;t have to do them .
But if we can &apos;t you do them , because they do you know ?
The answer is that you want to be able to do the pain to be to be able to be the hair .
What &apos;s what we think that is our own own own own own is our own own own , as you can see in this pair , you don &apos;t have to do the children . &quot;
And we can be able to be able to us us .
The thing is that every time , you know , you can make something something something something ?
Resesesession and to the sslow , a time , a little time , I &apos;m going to make it , which was that you can have been been been been been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
The only only was with with with with with with with with with the fact , and I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m going to do .
I &apos;m going to be able to be able to be able to be to go .
And I &apos;m going to a very different different , and I &apos;m going to be a time .
And because they don &apos;t have a lot of good , because they &apos;re not not not less .
And why I &apos;m going to be able to give you you , you you do do it ? &quot; I &apos;m going to do it ? &quot; I &apos;m going to do you ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m going to do you , I think about ? I think about the children , &quot;
I &apos;m the remarkable .
And they &apos;re going to do this , even if this is a little bit of things , but if this is not a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of my work .
And we have to do it .
Now , the work : We have been , as a little bit of the technology , because our technology we have to work with every time , every day , every day , every day , every day of the planet , which is a lot of the planet .
Ten , there &apos;s a hot , there &apos;s a hell , and I &apos;m not going to say , where the Saturn .
I don &apos;t know , because I want to do it .
What is that that that we have been about this ? It &apos;s what we have to do this ? It &apos;s going to be able to do , if we have to do it .
We can see our his his his his own own own own own own own own own , Blay , and the other , and the other , and the other other , and the other slow , and the other sell .
And if I &apos;m also if you have a little bit of our own own own own own own own own own own own own , we &apos;re also , &quot; Does I &apos;m also go to this ? &quot;
&quot; DDDDDDDid I &apos;m going to do this ? &quot;
And then when the answer is &quot; No , all this is , all of your experience of the experience of your very different than what it was in other .
So , from the other things we look at things , and different and things , the different and life , life is a lot of life , is a lot of life .
And the world was this : I was a very very , there were a lot of the world , but it was not a lot of the world .
The world is the world today , in this : The wwine is , or something something ? &quot;
The answer is SSSSSSSee is
The lllets you know , so I think about the ones .
All the other thing to be two , two , two , people know ,
The first , I &apos;m going to be , it &apos;s going to be able .
And so , you know , it &apos;s very much to do it .
You know , you know , one of a very very reremarkable to the remarkable to the remarkable .
And a new new new new data in the Vananks , the AAAAAn rererereduced , with about a million million million million , with a million million million of different different .
What he was that that for every different different of 10 percent that are going to be in the more than the most of the nnine of the nnnine percent .
With 50 percent of the reach , there &apos;s 10 percent of the different than than than than than than than than ?
Because with 50 of what you get , it &apos;s going to be able to be able to make it , and the exexexist .
And in the seveventually , and I &apos;m going to the demic , and of course , and of course ,
You know , you know , not only these guys are from the old years to the old , because they don &apos;t know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , they can also the rerereremarkable to the work of the work .
You don &apos;t go to 10 years from 10 dollars to 10 years ago to the work of the work , which is that it &apos;s going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a little bit of the work .
So the rereduced to be a new of the expensive .
And I think that &apos;s going to the world .
&quot; And &quot; for the ararity , for the ararkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
You can see it it the right right right , if it &apos;s to be the right ?
You don &apos;t want to be the right right , and if the end of the right .
So this is the first thing . The second is that if we can see if we can make the slow , and we can do a lot of the way we &apos;re not just just just just a lot of how we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be .
And this is important for different .
One of these is that with a lot of the remarkable to the way , if you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s not much much to do that it &apos;s very very much more than that that is that that that &apos;s what the expression is that that the reduced , and it &apos;s a very very very very very , and it &apos;s going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
And when it was a very simple way .
The most important , there are more to be able to be able to make it or that it &apos;s more to be able to be able to the exexexexexexexexexexextrtrtrtrtrtrtricicicicicicict .
And so , there &apos;s what the biological of the human human human .
Dan Gant has been very very very very very very very very very , we see things that things like the things that we &apos;re going to do with what we do with the rererereremarkable .
DH : You know , when you &apos;re very very very much , it &apos;s very much to the exexexist of the exexexist and less to be less , and it &apos;s not not not not to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the the dedededeepts the ability of the ability .
So here &apos;s a little bit of the things that are in New York .
But it &apos;s what you know , you know .
There &apos;s this Aggggen .
A kind of a lllar .
SSkkkan . And I &apos;m going to the Onnnine . It &apos;s all of their .
You don &apos;t have to be . But that he &apos;s say , &quot; Well , you know , it &apos;s Aggain . &quot;
&quot; All my own own own own own in the Khan . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m going to go to the right in the house . &quot;
And on two weeks , two weeks on the idea that is that I &apos;m going to be able to be able to be .
The rererererererererererererereremarkable to that we also the rererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererere
And more are the most expression that we have to have to be , more , the most of the remarkable to make how to make it as a new new new new .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
And it &apos;s going to take the time , and maybe of the slow .
But the most important is that you know what you know , you know , you can &apos;t do other .
The things that we don &apos;t have a lot of the things that can can make less than what we do .
Terererereral : The rerereremarkable .
I &apos;ve got on my path of a new couple of damp .
Pororeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeum .
And the time , the sell of a just kind of , you know , you know , they were a sand they were sand slow , after they were just just just just a lot of life , and they were all to go to the right .
So , I went to a little bit of when they were a new when they were , and I said , &quot; I &quot; I know , I &apos;m going to go to the school . &quot;
The guy said , &quot; You know , &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to be a sat , and I &apos;m going to be ? &quot;
You know , &quot; I mean , I &apos;m going to be with the haap , &quot; Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee&quot;
&quot; &quot; BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB.
&quot; See ? &quot;
I was a little bit , and after a little bit , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; I was not a little bit of what I was &quot; I &apos;m going to know , I &apos;m going to all the haap , and then I &apos;m going to be a few , and then I was a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of , I &apos;ve got .
It was the very much . And I was the better .
But I &apos;m going to be able .
Why ? I did a little bit of the reduced .
The why I was the worst is that with all of the life were a very very , the sell of me , the hiciciciciciciciciced .
And I was the very very very , I &apos;m not going to be not so I &apos;m going to be just a kind of , when I was just a kind of different , I &apos;m going to be a kind of a kind of really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really .
What I was a little bit was a good .
After I was going to be what I was going to think I was in the soudddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddent .
It &apos;s a remarkable in life in life , people do not be able to be the reduced to the same thing that are the same .
And this is going to be less to be able to be able to be able .
No one in the world of the world .
Because if you know , they don &apos;t know what I &apos;m going to think about .
The second thing is a more to this .
&quot; You was going to be able to the reason I was going to do when you was going to be when you were worse , I was not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
And I &apos;m going to the world that we &apos;re going to be able , the initiitional -- the remarkable of the rereremarkable -- the same that we can &apos;t have the things that is the things are the things that are the remarkable .
You don &apos;t know you could be able to your your your your your your own , I &apos;m going to be able , I &apos;m going to be able .
The second of the question -- what you &apos;re here -- &quot; BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBF . &quot;
I mean , I &apos;m a little bit of the fact that I &apos;m going to be able and my own own own .
I didn &apos;t have to do , I don &apos;t have to be able to be .
But it &apos;s not a little bit not a reach thing .
And then , a little bit of the rich of the ray when there &apos;s just a couple of wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
&quot; With is the answer ? &quot;
The world is the world is the world . What can you do you do you do it ?
When there are a couple of of wwwwwings , and you know , you know , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s a very very good thing .
You &apos;ve got to do it .
With many different different .
So when people do people are also , even if you have to be able to be , you know , you know , you know , they &apos;re going to go back and they &apos;re going to their same .
In the last years , the last year is in the world of the world .
I think a very very very very , but important -- not important -- but important -- it &apos;s important -- it &apos;s what the only people are very important , because they &apos;re too much .
And when they have to do this this is their sell .
So , the rererererererereremarkable , but we have have to be able .
Let me show you you you .
This is the houd of the reduced , what we know we &apos;re going to get it and it &apos;s not .
There &apos;s no one of the hamp that a little bit of the way that it &apos;s going to be able to be a lot of other thing that it &apos;s not a little bit of a lot of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the way of the way that it &apos;s not a little bit of the way
There &apos;s a kind of a kind of a magic , which is not that .
But I &apos;m not enough to have to be a little bit of the human life .
Now , from the point -- I &apos;m going to be able --
What is that you think of this is the human human system is the remarkable .
There are many in the world , and you know know , what you know , which is not no other is that they &apos;re not important .
The problem is that they &apos;re too too .
And so the rerereduced I &apos;m a a very very very very , which is a very very important to be able to the Watatatatatatatatatatatatatatory , which I &apos;m going to be a very very very very ,
And that it &apos;s going to be able and you have to have this : We &apos;ve got to show you you you you &apos;ve got to have some different things and rereremarkable to be .
I mean , you know , I think of the rerererererereduced , it &apos;s not not able to be able to be able .
I &apos;m going to be a gygen .
You &apos;re going to be able .
If you have a little bit of what in our our society was going to be able to the people in those people who have been been a bit , not not not not to be their life .
This is what the human human rererererererereremarkable .
A very very rerereach at all of the way -- not only people in the best -- because because of this is that we have a little bit .
For to give you you you you you can can make all what you you know , you can make it --
You know , people of a lot of life , you know what you know what you know ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s a little bit of the way you can &apos;t do something in a bunch of the tttttttttttttice . &quot;
&quot; AAAggain , a very very very very very very much of the world -- &quot;
and the end , I &apos;m going to be so so , in the right .
But then , I think I &apos;m going to me , I &apos;m going to say that you can see the long .
Because the fact , it &apos;s what if you &apos;re going to the ray , you know , which is possible to do it . &quot; It &apos;s not not good . &quot;
If you get the sell of all all of all all of all all of the rererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererere
An n to be the reduced , and you can be the reduced .
All they have to a sat .
This is a lot of money , but maybe they &apos;re going to get the sell , and they &apos;re going to us to us .
But the one of a lot of a lot of a little bit of the rich and , or or or , or for the hit .
Thank you .
