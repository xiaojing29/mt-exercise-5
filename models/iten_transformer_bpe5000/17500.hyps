Last year I showed these slides to show that the artica of the artica , which is almost three million years had the size of the 48 continental , the size of the United States continental , it &apos;s restrip of 40 percent .
However this underlying gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice of the ice of the ice .
The artica calght glacial calm is , in a way , the clean of global system .
You expanded up of inverse and reverse of summer .
The next slide is going to be a remarkable carrying on the last 25 years .
The glaces have been signed in red .
As you see , you get up to the blue dark dark .
That &apos;s the ice in the inverse ice , which is ritier of summer .
You can see that the cosmic ice cosmic ice , five years or more , is like the blood , which is like the blood , which is that there was a body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been like this .
This is a problem because the rewarming of the interests , the terrain , where there are enormous amount of coal coal , which , skip , come up with the microbes .
I &apos;m going to the total of the atmospheric ination of global warming , that amount could be doubling , the amount of not around .
In some of the four-profound lags in Alaska metan is already rebuling from water .
The professorly Katey Walter of University of Alaska team , and a team print that last invern .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You &apos;re good . The question is if we &apos;re going to be it .
And this is that this exchange termal scambiator from the Groenland from north .
This is a river at the rusty .
And the portation had never achieved levels like it .
This is the Kangerlushihihihihibition , in the southwest of Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea level of the sample on the ground of the sea .
These currents are rapidly increasingly .
On the other side of the planet : Antarctica , the greatest block of ice on the planet .
Last month of the scientists have depted that the ice of the ice is in negative , and the Western artide , which pogy on some islands of the submarine , is particularly related in the sun .
It &apos;s about six feet of the foot of the foot , like Groenland .
Sull Himalaya , the third bigger block of ice , you see new lakes , which a few years ago were glacious .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population recycled half of water .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of water of this city .
The ported is increased .
But when he deminds , the same happens to the water .
In California , the snow on Sierra Nevada is deminuity of 40 percent .
The hyririries are in crisis .
The predictions , as you have bed , are grounds .
The growing because of the size of a remarkable amount of inceness .
The environmental disaster is increasing to a race out of the normal and unprecedented .
Four times more of the last 30 years I was going to be the last 30 years I was going to be .
This is a kind of unsustainable andering .
If you look at it in the storyteller can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we add 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the point of the area of Pacific , the Americans , to the Americans , to the west parts of Indian continent , where there is a radical root of the oxygen in the ocean .
The greatest cause of global warming , together to deforestation , which is the use of fossil fuels , which is the use of fossil fuels .
The oil is a problem , and the coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with more emissions , together to China .
And it was to build a lot of other central central central .
But we &apos;re seeing a change of direction .
These are the annullated projects in the last years and some alternative proposes of the versus .
And in the way , there &apos;s a struggle in our country .
The industrial coal and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the fuel , which is a symptoms .
That image would remember me me --
Verway Natale , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion litri of coal fouron loss of coal four-pink loss .
Maybe you have seen it on news .
This is the second largest flow of the flow of America .
It &apos;s happened around Natal .
And the advertising of a coal industrial and the coal of the industrial industrial .
Video : Stum carbon is a kind of hot , is a kind of hallegry and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it &apos;s growing our economy .
Frosop carbon is more clean .
It &apos;s good price , and the workable and the workers keep it .
Al Gore : From here is a big part of the West Virginia .
The greatest minerair , the largest threat is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I &apos;ll be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosy , Harry Reid -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Allem for the Clima Protection of Clima &apos;s Ten Protection .
This is one of them , a part .
Video : Attore : At the TALergy , we see the climate change as a threat at at our business .
For this , our priority is to invest a lot of money in a public effort to make public and confused the truth on the coal .
In fact , the cocoal is not spork .
We think it &apos;s clean -- it &apos;s also a good profumo .
So you don &apos;t preocuption of climate change .
Let &apos;s give us to us .
Video : Attore : Carbone clean -- you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
So we &apos;re going to do a turn around a structure at the avanguard for how to pulit fuel .
Straordinarily ! The machines are a little noise , but this is the sound of the technology of pulit .
The coal consumption is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology , and the remarkable technology that you see changes everything .
You look at a look : this is the hdiern technology of pulit .
Al Gore : The end , the positive alternative is connected to the economic question .
Video : America is in the crisis ; the economy , national security , the crisis .
The filter connected all : our dependence from fossil fuels , like the fuel fuel , as the fuel coal and oil .
Now , there &apos;s a new , audace solution for circuit .
Really , 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to remate America , to make us more safe , and help stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that basts to solve our problems .
Really . You get more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It &apos;s about re-energy .
One of the fastest ways of getting to the dependence from the fuel fuels of fuel that killing our planet .
Comparsa : The future is here . I feel , sun , a new energy network .
Comparsa : Notegan investiment for jobs of very well well well , retributed .
Complplant : Really . It &apos;s time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old African proud says , &quot; If you want to go speed , you go to the speed , you go from .
If you want to go away , you go together . &quot;
We have to go far , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I was a introduction on the LHC .
And promising to return to the way to go back to how the car works .
So here I started here . And for those that the other time was not , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever attempted -- 27 kilometers of circles .
His task is to rear the conditions that were less than a billion ardespite of a second from the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
All that is just ambitious .
This is the car under Ginevra .
We Photographing these mini-Big Bang inside the remarkable .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLAS -- is
This is a show of ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLAS in construction .
The 10 September of last year we have pped the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLAS .
It was because of immense festhetic attitude in control .
It &apos;s a image of the first fascination of particles that had done all the whole of the LHC , deliberately , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles inside the remarkable .
In other words , when we saw that the 10 September , we realized that the car worked , which was a great vitty .
I don &apos;t know if it was going to be more or this , and I saw that the first time , I saw that the beginning was this .
That means we &apos;ve had a cultural impact beyond the scientific .
About a week later , there was a problem with the car , just to these filters here -- these files .
These files bring 13,000 bulbs when the car works at the very very very much of the power .
Now , the technicians between you will look at the files and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . I &apos;m very good . &quot;
And instead can do that because they &apos;re very cold becoming the superbition .
So , at least 271 degrees , at a lower temperature at the space of the space between stars , these files can bring that current .
In one of the giunture between the most novelseamers in the LHC , there was a defect of facbringing .
So the files surround , and the 13,000 bulbs bulch , and the 13,000 bulbs bull .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think of these magnees of the magnees of 20 tons , and that have been moved about 30 centimeters .
They &apos;re actually damaged about 50 magnetic magnetic .
We had to take them , what we had been done .
We have reinated them and woulls .
Now , they &apos;re going back to the underground .
I &apos;m going to be a new integrous .
We will accuse it , and we expect to get data or the right , and we &apos;re going to try to find out what are the morning is the morning that we &apos;re in the morning .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these crash crashing the value of science and engineering of frontier . It &apos;s easy to confuture .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact of getting beyond the limits , I think is the value of things like LHC .
I want to conclude with the words of a scientist Inglese , Humphrey Davy , the defense of inutilighting , his empty was Michael Faray , his clean , his clean was Michael Faray , and said , &quot; No , Nient is so dangerous for the human mind as the ideas of the mind of the ideas of the human mind is defines , that there are no mysters in , and that the complete is a new monial . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start asking for rethink of when you , you play with children , you play with the morning .
And as you get them and say , and you can get them and move them , and you learn them and move them , and you know problems and solving spacecting and manipulating space .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , by the usual kind of the usual interaction with physical objects , together to my consultation , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalithi , I started asking me , and I started asking me , &quot; And if , when we use a computer , instead of having the only treor the mouse as a little digital , we could be able to be able to put it , and so much information with the same same same , with both hands , my hands ,
and put it on our pleasure ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the Siftiftable .
In a few words , a Siftill is a computer interactive as a biscan .
In a few words , a Siftill is a computer interactive as a biscan .
You can move with your hand , you can see , &quot; you can see , &quot; they &apos;re in their own , and they have a screen and radio wireless .
But overeign , they &apos;re physical objects , like the morning , you can move them to relate them .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physicists , awful of the movement , of the other , and as they become more physicists , and as they become more physicists , and other , as we can explore new and fun of interaction .
I &apos;m trying to try with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show video : if you cline it in a direction , the video will rotate as a way , if you cline from the other back back .
These interactive remarkable is aware of the other .
If I &apos;m interested in , you &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re around .
If they come circumst-, they can see it , and they can act a little bit .
If they come circumst-, they can see it , and they can act a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was that we can use common gestures , for example , &quot; a color as if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftired as a bunch of shelks and I can use it to use it for the color in the central , where they put it .
and I can use it to be the color in the central , where you get it .
We can get too , we can get too , we can put it a little bit .
And you also have beautiful possibly learning , like the languages , like the languages , the mathematics and games of logic where people can try things can try and see the results immediately .
Now , I &apos;m --
This is a sequence of Fibonacks us to do with a program of equations .
Here we have a words of words that is in the middle of Scarabeabeum and Boggle .
Be , at every turnake in every Turn one of the Siftough , at every Turn , you &apos;re going to be a letter to case on every Siftill , and you &apos;re trying to understand him on a dictionary .
And then , after about 30 seconds , you get , and you have a new set of letter and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the kids came in in gitable to the Media Lab , I made it and I turned them a video .
They were very much .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of kind of kind of apply to people .
You just say , &quot; You know , &quot; You know , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s other people who try it .
This is our beta tester , there on the right .
It was actually wanted to be impllary .
They were only morning , they were just morning , for him .
Now , this is a kind of a interactive cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool for learning . He &apos;s Felix . He &apos;s Felix .
It can be able to put new characters in the scene , and by relief the Siftired .
It can be able to put new characters in the scene , and by relief the Siftired .
Here &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : The sun is surprising .
David Merrill : Now he took a treatment in the scene .
Video : The arange treor .
Bel work !
So , you shake the Siftiptip and you can get them to interact the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by inventing their story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a very final story , and it can decide him as you go .
DM : It &apos;s a very final story , and it can decide him as you go .
Very : Vola , gat .
DM : The last example I have the time to show you is a tool , to try and take a recent tool , to try and execting music .
It &apos;s a tool , and I was recent to sample and performing music .
The Siftable here is agging from sounds , like the bottom and the bacteria .
And you can take one of these have four different variations , and you can choose to use .
You can also put these sounds on a sequence of your pleasure .
And it just changes it by touch a sound and a sequence . &quot;
These are actually you can control from the vive , as the rivers and the filter .
The acks of a particular , and then cline for a particular , and then cline for the time .
And then there are general effects as long and volume , that you &apos;re apply to the entire sequence .
Let &apos;s look like it works .
Video : We will try a very , we &apos;ll try a very , and we &apos;re sequence , we put it in a series , we add to a series , we add .
I &apos;m going to put a line of low .
Video : I &apos;m going to add percussions --
Video : And now I &apos;ll put the philt to the battery , so I can control the effect from the vial effect .
Video : I can revelocize the entire sequence of the entire sequence of the time from one side or another .
Video : And now I &apos;m going to add the bottom to the bottom to the bottom to give more expression .
Video : I can remate the sequence of the sequence .
So I don &apos;t have to plan it before , but I can suddenly make it a long time or more corta .
And now , I can be smoking the entire sequence of the entire sequence of the left the Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new interfaces , more more and more resemble as a function of our body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the results of this path , and some possibilities that we try to get out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that &apos;s coming this new generation of objects for interact with digital media , which will bring information into our world .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the now of you all .
I &apos;m a writer .
I &apos;m writing books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that .
It &apos;s also love and the fashion of my life .
And I don &apos;t look like it can change .
But , this is something particular recently happened in my life and my life , and in my career , and I got me to report with this work .
The particular thing is I recently written this book , this biography called Mangia , Prega , Am , but , &quot; the which , diversously , for some reason came out in the world and became a great sensational , and bestseller , interational bestseller .
And the result is that everywhere you go now , people treatment as if I was convicted .
It &apos;s true -- conducted , conducted !
They were all me worried and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t have a little bit more to do than you do better ?
You don &apos;t fear to be able to write for all life without being able to create a book that can importantly create a book that can importance to somebody ? &quot;
that can importantly anything ? &quot;
It &apos;s resurant , you know .
But it could go , I remember that I remember that I remember that I &apos;m more than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a written adolescent .
I would go to the same reaction of the same reaction .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you throw it ?
You don &apos;t fear that the ulilighting you killed ?
You don &apos;t fear to do this to be a whole of life without anything that &apos;s ever coming out and to die on a cumb of dreams with the mouth of failure ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is , &quot; Yes .
I &apos;m afraid of all the things .
I always had fear .
And I also fear of many other things that people could not ininitiate .
And as the alge and other things .
But , as I write about it what I thought and ask me , and I ask me , is why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logic that anyone who have to expect to be frightened by a job that you &apos;ve been born for doing .
But what is that there is so particular , in the creative entrepreneurnervous for the mental health health as a way that other career do they don &apos;t do it ?
As my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don &apos;t remember one time in his 40 years of activity in which was asked if it was fear to be engineer ?
There was never -- that stick of the engineer , as John , as it goes ?
It wasn &apos;t working like that , you know ?
Onestly , chemicals like group don &apos;t have certainly , in centuries , in centuries , the reputation of depressed maniacated .
We have a writer , we have enough to this reputation , and not just a writer , but creatives of all of these , we have this reputation of being enormous instable .
And it &apos;s another one that look at the trads of the magnificent of creative minds that , only in the 20th century , and they were young and often to their hand .
And the ones that don &apos;t have suicidated seemed to be really dised by their dones .
Norman Mailer , before to die , in the last interview said , &quot; Every book said , &quot; Every little book has killed me a little bit more .
But we don &apos;t throw up when we feel it to say because we &apos;ve heard these things so much , we &apos;ve been all all of interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and the struggle , and the striking , and the art , at the end , and the angososcy , and then at the angososcy , and the end .
And the question I want to ask to everybody here today is : you agree with this idea ?
It &apos;s OK , because it &apos;s also looking at it as a little bit of a distance to me .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous and I don &apos;t want to see the perpepepeated in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our big creative minds to live .
And I know that , in my case -- in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start to the point to the supposing of supposing , overeign the circumstances in my career .
That &apos;s true -- look , I &apos;m quite young , I &apos;m quite young , I have about 40 years .
I still have about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything that &apos;s writing in now is going to be right from the world as the work that was after the very , the first book of my book .
I &apos;ll be slavor , because we &apos;re all more or less friends here -- is likely I have my biggest success is to my own own .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads to a person to start dking in the hammes and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would keep going to continue to do this work that we love .
So , the question is , how do it ?
And so it seems to me , after many reflections , which the way to work to go to write is that to create a protective protective protective , right ?
I have to find a bit of safety , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxiety of what I &apos;m writing that will be . And as I was trying to get to look through time , trying to find other societies to see if they could have better better and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and look for the best ideas and more and more and look for the best ideas and more and more and I was trying to find a lot of societies of the way of that I &apos;m
about how to help people to run the unerent risks of the emotions of creativity .
And that research took me to the ancient Great and ancient Rome .
I &apos;m going to give me why I come and then go back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity sely creativity sely .
And it was thinking about creativity was this spirit looks like , and that it was a few of people who came from some surprising and unknown , for distant reasons .
The Greeks were called these spirits divine and the deployed of creativity .
Socrate , wonderful , he believed to have a demon that elargive wisdom from far .
Romani were the same idea , but they called the kind of the kind of spirit without body .
And that &apos;s great , because the Romani didn &apos;t really think a genius was a particularly intelligent .
They thought , a genius was this kind of divine that was living in the wild of a living in the walls of a neighbor , a little bit like elsewhere elling is a lot of the work of the artist , and modeling the outcome of the artist and modeling the outcome of that work .
Here &apos;s etional -- here , that &apos;s the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological construct that protected you from your work .
And everybody knew that was so that it worked , right ?
So , antic artists were protected by certain things , as the way , as the too narcism , right ?
If your job was , you could not take the whole job , you all the deserve , everybody knew that were helped by this genius .
If your fake work , it wasn &apos;t all your own , it was not your hit , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a hahead .
And so people have to concept the han concept for a long time .
And then the Rince came and everything , and it changes , and it &apos;s great idea ; we put the human being in the center of the universe on the top of the universe on the mitchen and without left to leave space to the mitchate creatures that desk detached detached from divinity .
This was the principle of humanity and people started thinking about the creativity was completely by idivided .
And for the first time in history , you started to referred this to the story , and that artist as a rather than a person with the genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big error .
I think I think I allow someone , a simple person to believe of being as a recient as a source , and the source of the mysters , and the source of all the mysters , unknown and ethernical and a philillion , and unknown and ethernical and a very big thing to give to the fragile pties of human .
It &apos;s like to ask somebody of ingooding the sun .
And it &apos;s completely distores and it &apos;s completely expectations about performance .
And I think it was this pressure to be destroying artists in passed 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think that is , and I think it &apos;s , and now ?
Can we do it diversously ?
And to be more ancient understanding of human relationship and mystery .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can &apos;t excellent 500 years of rational thinking in a speaker at a speaker .
And probably people in the audience who would be related to the scientific notion of the notion of the notion of , initially , you do , they follow people , and they &apos;re doing , they &apos;re doing ,
And I &apos;m probably not going to convince you all about this thing .
But the question I want to ask is -- why not ?
Why don &apos;t you think about this way ?
Because it has more sense of anything that ever heard to explain the explanning of the imprevedibility of the process .
A process that , as anyone who ever attempted to do something -- so , basically , you don &apos;t understand , you don &apos;t understand .
And , in fact , it can sometimes seem completely paranorly .
I &apos;ve done this recently , I was recently with the wonderful poetry .
She said he was like a frageous train .
And that was going to rotate to her from the landscape .
It was going to be , because he was tremendous to be the land under his feet .
He knew that I had one thing to do to do at that point and was , his words , &quot; running like a match . &quot;
And then , then it was going to be followed by this poem , and it would not have to be able to get a piece of paper and a math , and it was going to be , and then then then the page , and then then it down and errying it on the page .
And sometimes I couldn &apos;t be fast , so correcal and correcal and correcal and correcal , and the poetry and poetry and get the hot , and she would continued to rotate through the landscape , and she was going to rotate through the landscape , and she said , &quot; another poem . &quot;
And then there were those times -- this piece I won &apos;t forget -- there were moments where the was almost losing , right ?
So , he was running home and was trying to paper and the poetry and paper , and he was going to be in the while he was going , and then he said , that was like , if you were halled with the other hand and the office .
And it was poem from the coda and he was going to be in his body and transmitted on the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page and the top of the last word to the first word .
So when I felt -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly the same as a real process .
Not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conducucucucucture .
I &apos;m a mulo , and my way of work is ; I wake up to the same orary every day and go and go up and go up and go up on the households .
But even I was in my clothes , I striped against that thing , sometimes .
And I guess that many of you have the han done .
You know , even if the work and ideas were to me to give me a certain source of you , I could not be excited .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it in a way to do not losing your head , but rather , what does it remains ?
As I think about , the best example I have is the Tom Waits , I have the Tom Waits , I interviewed years ago for a journal .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the major of life was the incarnation of the artist of the artist , and to control , to try to control , to be able to deal with these species of impulse creatives .
But then invecked , he was hot , and a day , and a day , and he was driving on a highway in Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
And it was going to be fast and all of a seat , and it was a little framing of melodia , who comes in his head as inspiration , and the hot , and the desive , and the desive , but it doesn &apos;t know how to take it .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a mature , it doesn &apos;t have a recorder .
So he starts to feel this kind of old anxiety of him , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to be able to be on this song even even .
I &apos;m not enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to be in the panic , and I &apos;ll stop .
And he put the whole thing , and he did something completely new .
He just looked at the sky and said , &quot; Same , don &apos;t see that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Would it be writing a song now ?
If you really want to be , you get , I get care of you .
Altherwise , you &apos;re getting to importantly something else today .
You can disturbing Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And the process of the working process of going to change after that .
Not the job , the work was still dark as well as a time .
But the process , and the fish of anxious , that was the genius that was reeased when the genius , the genius who was used to be , and freezing it back to where it was , and it was doing it , and it was made it , and it was done that it wasn &apos;t interized and toration .
But yes this peculiar , wonderful bizarre , wonderful bizarre , and this strange thing , and this strange thing that was not Tom .
So , how the story I was going to change a little bit of the way I worked , and I was saved me once .
This idea , I would save me when I write , &quot; Mangia , Prega , &quot; and fall in a one of those cave of the cave of disperation where we &apos;re all working on something and we don &apos;t have and you can start thinking that &apos;s going to be a disaster , which is going to be a disaster book .
Not just good , the worst book wrote .
And I started thinking about gecting this project .
But then I remember Tom I was talking to the air and I tried to us .
So I got my face on on the manoscritical and I was in a vacuum of the room .
And I said to high voices , &quot; Sath , what we know if this book is not going to be very brilliant , it &apos;s not going to be a hot , right ?
Because I &apos;m looking at all I &apos;m putting all I have , I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want to be better , you have to be able to show you and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , I don &apos;t do it .
I &apos;ll just try to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I would like to be recorded that I was today to do my part . &quot; Because the end is so , OK -- centuries in the deserts of the North people had been stuned for the dances of the clear dances of the dances of the clear dances of lands , dances and the households and until the alba .
And they were always magnifigured , because the ballerini were professionals and were fantastic .
But every one of these , something happened , and one of these artists became actually transcendent .
And I know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know you &apos;ve all seen , at a point , a certain point , a performance .
It was like the time , you stopped , and the ballerin walked through a kind of portal and was not doing anything different from the usually , like 1,000 notes before , but all of it was going to be .
And suddenly , you don &apos;t just look like a human .
But it &apos;s accested from the divinity of the divinity .
And when this happened , the time , the people knew what was , they called him him .
They were , they were , and they started to sing , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , God , God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
I &apos;m a historical note -- when the More invaser the south of Spn , I was this habits with them and the ready to change in centuries . &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , &quot; Ole , &quot; and you can still feel in the corride or flamenco .
In Spagna , when a artist did something impossible and , &quot; Allah , I hole , &quot; Allah , I &apos;m , magnificent , brace , &quot; uncomable , and here &apos;s a scum of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes day after , for the ballerin the same , when you wake up and you see that are 11 in the morning of Martedday and the last one of God is no longer .
It &apos;s just a lot of bad to the ginocneneat , and maybe it &apos;s never going to each other to that .
And maybe nobody will will be the name of God as a gira , and what has to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most sweaper to do in a creative life .
But maybe it &apos;s not to be so angosciant if you don &apos;t believe , you can &apos;t believe , the most amazing aspects of your being being .
But just believes you &apos;re data in the present data from a unimaginable source of this team of your life that you have to go to something else you have to go to something else when you ended up .
And , you know , if we think of this way is change .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s certainly like I thought for a different months in the working of the book that I &apos;ll show , the dangerous , and I &apos;m going to be , and I &apos;m going to be very successful .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel electrized from this is , I &apos;m not afraid .
Not at the end . It &apos;s just your job .
Continua present-you for your hand , whatever it can be .
If your job is balling , you can get a balling .
If the divine , you endo a little bit of you decide to leave some of wonderful , for a moment through your effort , you know , you know , &quot; Ole ! &quot;
You can do it the same dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot; You can do it .
I think it &apos;s weak to teach it .
&quot; Ole ! &quot; You know the same , even for having human love and testables testing , you &apos;re going to show you continuously .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As I &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects on the human genome , about what can mean and the new set of genes .
We &apos;re starting a new path : we started digitize biology and now now starting from that digital code in a new phase of biology , and designing and synthesizing life .
We &apos;ve always tried to ask big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists , I think they tried to be a lot of biologists , I think they tried to be a lot of biologists .
We tried different approaches , and we &apos;ve been trying to minimum .
We &apos;re digitized by almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome treated from the analogical world of biology in the digital world .
We ask : can we regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smaller genome that can authoreplication in the lab .
And we tried to reduce that the genome to create a little bit more small .
We can be able to eliminate a hundred genes of genes that are here .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our own .
Credemic , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it &apos;s very improbable that this can bring to a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to design was synthesize this chchromosome in a way of able to change the components to ask some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of &quot; Can we synthesize a chchchchchromosome ?
Can the chemistry consensus these big molecules that we never have been able to create before ?
And , in case , we can do a cromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemical material .
The speed with that we are able to digitize life is growing at exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , and it &apos;s very slowly , but it &apos;s better .
And our most recent results the results bring on a curve .
We &apos;ve been working more than 15 years ago .
The process has request many passages , starting with a bioethical review before we start the first experiments .
But we found out that we synthesize of DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that produce small segments , of DNA , the long of 30 to 50 letters and it &apos;s a degenerative process : more the segment is , more errors .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments and correct the errors .
And this was our first attempt , to start by digital information of the genome of Phi 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the frammments , actually , actively the correction of errors and getting a molecule of DNA molecule .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material , and we put it into bacteria , bacteria , bacteria have started reading this genetic code and produce .
The virals then were reported by cells , they come back and they were reated .
I talked about recent with the oil industry saying that they have certainly account , and they certainly started this model .
They have more of you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build the same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the bigger things .
We wanted to build the entire chchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchromosome .
I &apos;m more than 580 mile letters .
So we thought of construct in cassette of the size of the virus , so that we can change the cassette of what are the components of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard of the first time in 1995 , the basis .
We found , resequence it , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence would not be able to do it work .
And one part of the process is to design segments that you get overtig-up with all the other segments of 50 letter to build smaller substity to build smaller , and they &apos;re working together .
We try and unlike this .
You probably have read that we &apos;ve probably read that we put the flyllands .
Think about it , we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , Gs and T.
Three of those letters together codificate about 20 amminoacids , and there &apos;s a specific order of them for every amminoacids .
So we can use the genetic code for words , frash , thoughts .
What we &apos;ve done was self-recipe .
Some of them have been deluser from the fact that it wasn &apos;t poem .
We designed these segments to be able to do it with enzyme .
There are some of them repair and put them together .
And we started assembling parts , starting with the parts of five to seven to seven to mit , to seven to mit , and just just make them to form of 24 mile , and they get them to 72 to the letters .
And we &apos;ve made these segments in abundance , so that we can sequence them that we &apos;re trying to create a very extreme process , very robust -- as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems like the tellon a baskabs .
When we get these segments that are much longer , more than 100 , the basis , it won &apos;t grow more directly in Every .
You get to the limit of the modern biology tools .
So we &apos;ve been considered other mechanisms .
We knew another mechanism called the reaching homological repair , which is useful to repair the DNA to be able to unquitous seatments .
Here &apos;s a example .
This organism , called Deinoccurred , can be a three-million rad of radiation .
You can see in the top of the way of his chchchchchchromosome was destroome .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s just as the same as it was before .
There &apos;s thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely completely .
They can live under empty .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life existence in space , and you get to the new environments of water .
In fact , NASA showed that this is .
This is a molecule image that we &apos;ve built using these processes , just using the lievished with the design appropriate segments to be able to put .
The heveliiiished it .
This image was not taken with a myroscope , but with a very regular microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It &apos;s a very big molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the publization that we &apos;ve done a little time ago .
I &apos;m more than 580,000 letters .
It &apos;s the largest molecule of a structure ever created by man .
It &apos;s a very high molecular weight .
If we &apos;re pass it with a 10 without spaces , you would take a 142 pages only to transmate this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ? How can we do it ?
Of course , you take a virus is a game .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s easier to be as eucarious cells like our : you can just get the nuclear or and put another , which is basically the process of clonation .
In the archaea , the chchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchromosome from one cell to another and active .
We clean a chchchromosome from a microbial species .
The two are different as men from tops .
We add some gene in a way that we have added some gene for this chromosome .
And then , the skiolt with the enzyme so that it &apos;s killing all the protein .
And when we put it in the cell was studipendo--- and you &apos;ll open our graphics , you &apos;ll open the new chromosome is .
And we were starting to be , but we tried to go beyond , but we tried to be more in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that tantissir have been added a second or a third chromosome from some part , I add to a second thousands of strikes to that species .
So , those thinks about evolution as a single gene at the time , it &apos;s changed a lot of the biology .
There &apos;s a enzyme of the restrial of restrition that I can tell DNA the DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell , it was not one .
The phone phone -- the chchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchromosome we have it .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other chchchchchromosome material , and we were found with only the cell and the new chromosome .
It &apos;s become blue because of the genes we have a little bit of genes that we have .
And in a short short of time , all the characteristics of a species , and it transformed of the whole new new species , based on the new software that we have a new species , based on the new software that we have in the cell .
All protein are changed , memory are changed , and memane are change , and when we read the genetic code exactly what we &apos;ve spent .
Now , this could seem like genetics , but by by the software we can change things in a pretty substantial way .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that there is no genesis -- but progress from three million years of evolution and a half of evolution , and a half of evolution , and a half of Cambrian explosion Cambrian explosion Cambrian process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s quite obvious when we think about our needs .
We &apos;re going to spend six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right for an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for every one existence in 1946 .
We &apos;re having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medicine and wealthy for six billion and a half billion people .
It &apos;s going to be more to be for nine billion .
We use more than five billion fuel bars , more than 30 billion barrels , more than 30 billion barrels .
That means 100 million barrels a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replace them , it &apos;s a huge challenge .
We need to account of all CO2 from these materials that finds in the atmosphere .
And by the day , thank you to the scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the components for the future .
The electronic industry , you only have a dozen , and you think about how many different things came out .
Our limits here is , principle , and the data of our own imagination .
We now have techniques , thank you to these metods of these methods , able to create what we call a combinatory genomics .
We can build a big robot that can produce a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think of processing these 20 million genes of genes or to try to optimize the processes , new vaccines , we can change , and to be more biology , we can change , and create more biology than over the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemical production or fuel , production of ethc vaccines .
This is a few software istant that we &apos;re working for a few software programmed that we &apos;re able to seat us and design species at computers .
Well , we don &apos;t know how to be .
We know exactly how their genetic code .
We &apos;re focusing on the fuel coal of fourth generation .
You also saw you who extract the hanter from the grain was a hurt experiment .
We have depenpending of second and therefore , that will be used enough to the sugar of higher value as a doctor or different butanle .
But the only way biology can have a big impact without increasingly the cost of food and limited the cost of food and limarne and limarne and the energy of the energy , and we &apos;re working for cells that can achieve this purpose , and we think we can achieve the first coal coal , and we think that we can achieve the first four-four-generation .
The combined sunlight with CO2 is a metododowntown , but in our discoveries in the world , we found different metods .
This is a organism that we described in 1996 .
It &apos;s been in the ocean , about 2,500 feet of deep to the temperature of the water .
It creates metc from CO2 using molecular hydrogen as a source of energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can ing CO2 , which can easily be transported by tubbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
So we think that we might be able to increase what the question of the basic question of what life is . We can , versus the whole life . We have the fashion goal to report the entire oil industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can ?
It would be a major source of energy .
And we &apos;re working on the same metods to create instantaneous vaccines .
You saw this year with flu , we &apos;re always forth of a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s about the vaccine .
I think that you can change by building combinable vaccine in anticipe .
Here &apos;s how the future might start to look , now , the tree of evolution , accellating the evolution with synthetical bacteria , arches , and finally cells cells .
We &apos;re so much like that we can get people .
Our purpose is to do in a way of trying to be able to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the fest possible , some fundamental job , the new technology that we took the Microsoft in the following to a year ago . This is Seadron . This is Seadadron .
This is a environment where you can interact is local level that you can interact is that you can interact with a huge amount of visual data .
We &apos;re seeing a lot of digital gabyte of digital photos with a kind of wealth and continuous , for a fast panoramic , and I have images like to do .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much the amount of information that we see , how big these are collection of data or images .
Most of these are common photographs , but this for example is a scanning scanning scanning from the Library of Congress , and reentra half half half a gapiel .
It &apos;s no difference because the only thing that limits the one thing that &apos;s limits the number of pixel on your screen in any time . It &apos;s also a very flexel architecture .
This is a whole book , for example of data .
This is the Casa desolate of Dickens . Every colonna represents a chapter .
To show you that is just about the text and not images , we can do something like that , to be able to see that it &apos;s a real representation of the tissue , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a little electronic book .
I don &apos;t give you it .
This is a more realistic example . This is a number of The Guardian .
Every image is the beginning of a section .
And you really the pleasure and the good experience of reading the real version of a real version of a day , which is a multiple , which is for a multiple kind of a half .
We also have something with the corner of this number in particular number of The Guardian .
We created a very high resolution -- much higher than that you use in a normal advertising -- and you have a very higher content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even specifically techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that this means to put people in the people , and I think about the people , and I &apos;m supposed to be necessary .
Of course , maps is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not to lose time , if I don &apos;t mean that we have a contribute you to give you in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. sovrappy image of NASA .
So we go to something else .
This is actually from the web , you can go to the web ; you can go and see it .
This is a project called Photosynth , which fighting two different technologies .
One is Seadron and the other is a visual research at the very interesting computer made by Noah Snavely , a student of Washington , with the help of Steve Seadround of Microsoft Research .
And it &apos;s from the websan , manage from Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can spend from one image to another and have this kind of experience of multipacking experience .
But the space of the pattern here has actually a meaning .
The algorithms of visualization , they &apos;ve been taken these images together , so that I correspond to the real places that you imagine -- all the next to the lake Grasis on the Montagne Roccious . So you see the element of the elements of a slides of a slides of a slightly show .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data set of Noah-hosynth of the first summer prototynth , that we &apos;ve done work for the first time the summer -- to show you what I think is really the key to show behind this technology , Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily evidence that we have been looking at the environments that we have been doing in the web .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so forth .
This is a reconstruction of the Cedral of Nobody Dame images made by Flickr . Bast NoDame Dame in Flickr and you get images of kinds of kinds of campus and and so on . So , one of these campus and so on .
So , they &apos;re all images from Flickr and they were all linked to the space level in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to be able to be a very simple way .
You know , I would never be thought of the end to work for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratificent to get this kind of access .
I think you can see that it &apos;s about a lot of different kinds of photoooaming : from those phones of the professionals .
And if I can , I try and try and look more strange .
Many of you are block by faces , etc .
And somewhere you have a series of photographs -- ecit &apos;s a number of photographs --
This is a poster of Nobody Dame recorded .
We can go from the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is taking data from the whole memory , from the entire memory of the collective memory of how the data looks , from visual point -- and connected all those data together .
All those pictures become connected together , greater than the sum of the parts .
You have a model of the entire of the entire that emerge .
Think about this as a prolungation of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as people are using it , and the advantages for those who are useful for the use .
Their photo is marched with metad-added meaded by other people .
If you have a idea of contrast all these sant songs , my photo of the Thanks of Nobody DDemail , you have a sudden constantly , and I can use it as a point of ingress , and I can use it as a picture of the data , and having a social experience of the other , and having a social experience of the kind of a chromoss-mode and cross-tox-cross-to-hot experience experience .
Of course , a consequence of all the kind of this is virtual models , and collective images , and collective images and satellite images and satellite images and satellite images and satellite images and similar satellite .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized that ? What your software is going to be doing is that at some point , in the next years , all of all the world will be practice , all of the world will be practically connected ?
BAA : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is actually discover .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , you want to , in images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the images .
And what &apos;s a very interesting thing if you think about the seantic information that many of these images can be .
As you do a research research on the web , you digit &apos;s a frase and the headline on the web has a lot of information about the images .
Now , what happens if that picture is connected to all your photo ?
So the amount of seant interconnection and the amount of wealth of the amount of remarkable to the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really amazing .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the main pleases when you travel and one of the dolphice of the ethnogical research is to live in who has no forgotten the ancient of the past in the wind , and the households , and you touch it in the wind , and you touch it in the households .
Basti thinking that the Jaguar travel Jaguar , and the mytha , or that the mythians of the Inuit &apos;s still cold of significed , or in Himalaya , the distinct of the Dharma , the distinct of the most of the world . And the idea that the world we live in which we live in a sense of reality , but it &apos;s just a reality of reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stirpe has done , well or , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share some essential strikes .
We all of the projech .
We are convicted with the report .
We have to be a death of , so we don &apos;t surprising if we &apos;re looking at the way .
We all have an art .
What it &apos;s the particular thing is the race of song , the race of the dance of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that the Penan of the Borneo , or the following of the Voodoo , or the Borneo of the desert Kaithizes , in Kenya , the Curander , or a cammelt in Kenya , or a cammelt in the heart of the Sahara .
And he was my journey , in the desert a month ago , or a yak of yak in Qomolangma , on Everest , the Mest , the Mest , the dea mother of the world .
All these populations are teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And if you reflect a minute , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
Insides , the miriahead of cultures make a spiritual life and cultural life that you want the planet and it &apos;s important for the planet , and it &apos;s important for the planet as a biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural race as a cultural race and you can call the etnosphere , the total sphere , all of the concepts , every , with ideas , inspired , the intuitions , inspired by the human imagination of the human consciousness .
The ethnosphere is the great parimonium of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be as as a kind of inquisitive species .
And because biosphere was very , as a very , as a very , as a lot of good as well as as quickly as well .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species is , or is about the cover of the summit , because it &apos;s phanananocaly -- in the most ophically , in the field of biological diversity -- and you don &apos;t even get a little mystical -- that of the cultural diversity .
The one of all of this is , obviously , the language loss .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not just composed by a vocabulary or a series of grammitty ,
One language is the spraking of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle of which is a soul of every culture is in the world .
Every language is a forest , a bunch of mind , a thought , a very photystem ,
And of those 6,000 languages , as we sit in Monterey , at least half is no longer suspect in the ears of the children .
They &apos;re not more teacher , the children that means , less I don &apos;t get to the camps , which is already death .
What is more tristic than you can be a silence , of the last to talk a language , of the last to talk a language , of the way of being to transmit , or to anticipate the promise of the children ?
This one of the candy was a few of the world of every two weeks .
And I know somebody who will say , &quot; Is it better like that ?
The world would it be a better place if we were all the same language ? &quot; Benize , then we talk about the yoruba .
We talk about kogs .
You &apos;ll just put a sense of what it means is not to talk about their language .
I would like to be a journey through the ethnosphere --
a little journey in the ethnosphere to give you a bit of what we &apos;re losing .
Most of us forget that when I say &quot; different ways of existing ways of existence .
Let &apos;s take for example , this bimbo Barasana , in Amazon Satch , the people of anaconda , who creates the myth of the west of the wild of the west of the wild .
This is a people who can &apos;t be able to distinguish the blue color from green because the time celests of the green because the time celests , and depends on the forest , and it depends on the people .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rule , called exogram language , &quot; exogy language , you have to be a different person who talks a different language .
All of this has roots in the past mythological , though the particularly , you know , in these households in which you &apos;re talking to six or seven ing-none language .
They &apos;re just listening and then start talking to and then talk .
We take one of the most interesting tribe with the most interesting tribe with , the Waorani of Ecuador , a popular popular that had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionary missioned a touch error .
They &apos;ve been taken out of the top of the photographs that they were adichevolve , and forest that this people in the forest of the forest forest .
They &apos;ve collected the photos , they turned the research of a form or a figure , and not by looking at nothing , they have been conclused to the hell , and they killed the five missionary with the lance .
But Waorani didn &apos;t have just killed the foreign .
They killed between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by their own .
We were eight of eight generations and we found two of natural death and when we &apos;ve been done for know , they admitted that one of them was invecting , and then they killed it .
The cattachers were able to recognize the animal from 40 pass and recognize the species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned a very interesting job when my professor was asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti in , I was going to Haiti in the basic of Duvalier and the Tonton Macoutes , and the Tonton Macoutes , and I was a very interesting job of the poison .
To give sense of a miracy , I should have understand Vodoun culture and that Vodoo is not magic .
It &apos;s quite a complex metaphorries of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to tell me about the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christianity , Islam , Buddhism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has no faith . And instead and the Voododoo is , and the Voododoo is not another one that the distilled of these religious concepts of slavor .
What &apos;s interesting is the voodoo is the intense relationship between life and death .
So , the beat are being being .
The spirits can be invocated by the Great Accord , they respond to the dance of the dance of the alive so that for a short active active active , it turns out that for a short short active active , the following becomes the god .
For this the voodooists love to say , &quot; You go to church to talk about God .
We dancing in the temple and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re post , is the spirit that you can do it ?
So you see these incredible events : following the voodoo in state of trance that touch impunizes infuels , which touches on the body when it &apos;s catalyzed in a state of extreme .
And in all the people that I lived the most extraordinary people who have been lived the Kogi Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta Colombia , in the Santa Marta Colombia .
I think of the ancient civilization , and they were living on the aid career plant of the plant Colombia in the catch of the conquitous , the people had to be on the volcanic masses , which is the plant plant , the career .
In a continent of blood , this people who had never been conquised by the spage-sheer continent .
But I &apos;m government government from a clero , but their formation formation is so extraordinary .
The young people come up with the householes at three or four years , and they live secregated in a world of good and shadow hone of stone of the stone of the glacier &apos;s paying for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years , I picked up to reproduce the nine months of gestation that translated into the user of mother , now are metaphor , in the user of the Grande Mother .
For all of this time , they &apos;re accultured to their society , values that are at the prehate prayers and only their prayers to keep the balance -- or to say the cosmic balance -- or to say the balance of ecological balance .
And by the term of this incredible initiation , suddenly , and for the first time in life , at the age of 18 , see an alba . And in that actual ademic of the first bull , when the sun kitchen , and it &apos;s all that they &apos;ve learned in the whole whole day day . And it &apos;s prevent , and says : &quot; I &apos;m going to be a step back and says :
&quot; Gist ? I said ,
It &apos;s amazing . Now it &apos;s now to protect it . &quot;
They call the major brothers and say that we , brothers , the hair , are the hits of the world &apos;s destruction .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think of the Indigene and the environment , we call Rousseau and the old story of the selvacuum , which is a concept in his simplicity , or maybe invode Thoreau and we say that these people are closer to Earth .
The Indies are not nor feelings are not seveline feels from nostaly .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the evil of the Asmat , or in the frozen vents of the bet , but thank you for the time and the rits , they &apos;ve created a mystical of the idea of the Earth &apos;s based on the concept of the Earth can be just because it &apos;s infused by confidence , but it &apos;s infused by consciousness .
What does that mean ?
That means that a little bit of Ande who is growing up creating the mountain is a spirit of the mountain is a very different human being being deeply different and it will be a very different , and it &apos;s going to have a different different thing with the mountain or that a little bit of the mountain , or that &apos;s that mountain is a rock of rock , and that &apos;s a massive rock of rock is a massive rock of rock of rock .
That &apos;s the dimmmone-and-, a little bit of a mineral , is irrilevant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individuals and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia , which was , the forests that the forests that they were used to be cut .
And that &apos;s a different human being different from my friends Kwakiutl that the forests are the dimmate of Hukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukuk-in the Hamatamsa .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create reality , you can start to understand some of their sensations . We take this plant .
I took this picture of aprile in the Amazon the Western Amazon .
Maybe some of you &apos;ve heard of the ayahuash , the most powerful substance psychoactive ,
What makes the fascinating of the ayahuash is not the drum of the substance , but his elaboration . It &apos;s been made .
On one side , this liana legning , which is a series of bet-coal , hardly and harmoline , little hallucinogene .
And by trying to take the only plant plant , and it &apos;s a smoke , and it &apos;s mix with the leaves of a caffic bull &apos;s family , Psychchchchosen and so I said , &quot; Psychchchchecertry and caffection .
This plant plant contains powerful , very similar to the seriotonin , dimethyptamine .
If you ever see the Yanomami pulling up for the hide , the substance that make a different set of species , it &apos;s a methyptamine .
Thiring that dust is a little bit of the nose is a little bit of a painting of paints and flowing on a sea of electricity .
I often got my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who wrote the man who wrote the hall-hhhhallucinogens in Mexico .
I &apos;m going to be a lot of the tripped these trippped as hallucinogens because if you did you can &apos;t tell to any of being hallucinated .
It &apos;s possible to be abunte with chemicals that denian MAO , and they denive MAO .
Now it &apos;s the great : the beta-coal , and you find in this liana is inbitors of MAO , the same kind of necessary to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a pocket of plants , like these people have to be two morphologically not similar , but that if you combine in this way , create a chemistry that is the susum of the parts ?
We use the great eufemism of evidence and error , which can be infruted by the way .
But if we ask Indian , we say , we &apos;ll say , &quot; The plants talk about it . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribe , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuasks , who have neply in the forest , and that you can get into the same species .
If we ask them how to stick their tassonomy toxy , they &apos;ll say , &quot; I thought of the plants , the rest of you don &apos;t know it ? &quot; I said , &quot; No .
The solution is : you take 17 variety in a night of a lands of the four-band every one will get a different tone .
And this is not graduate Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than to count stami .
Now , &#91; I mean , the problem is that also the problem is that the ones of us who have to heart people who have pushed them , but somehow reduced to our real world , and it &apos;s going to go .
In fact , the 20th century , in 300 years , it &apos;s not going to remember the same as well as the time was where we stopped and , but rather like the one was where we stopped and have a very active active active active , and cultural distraction of mass diversity and cultural diversity and cultural culture of the planet .
All culcultures through centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibilities .
And the problem is not technology .
Indian Sioux didn &apos;t stop being Sioux when they put from the arco , and freceived as American didn &apos;t stop being American when they put on the horse and hot .
It &apos;s not the change or the technology of ethnosphere . It &apos;s the power of ethnosphere . It &apos;s the power .
The hard hard hard to be .
And if you give a look at the world , you &apos;ll discover that these are not destined to disappear .
They &apos;re living creatures and dynamics out of the existence from the forces of identified forces that go beyond their adaptation capability of adaptation .
That &apos;s what the disbosum is in the paintintings of Penan --
a peak peasian , in the souast ast ast , a people who lived free in the forest to a generation , and now reduced to a generation of the ride , and the next reducing the rights of the rivers , where you can see the river river , and the next titution of the life-and-to-and-a-a-half , where the nabinar Sar Mar , where the horizon , where the wave the horizon , and you can see the rist of the ride , and the wwitchchchchchchchchchchchecast , and the witchecast , where the welsesesel of the newaste the
It &apos;s ready to fill the wooden of the forest .
Or , in the case of the Yanomami , are the diseases that have the discovery of the gold .
If we put us on the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing many research research , you &apos;ll see the hard hard hard hard to be .
As you know the genocide , the extinction of a people , is constyle at universal level , but the ethnic destruction of the style of life of a people , not only is to be addicted , but I also also constrategy in certain environments , because it &apos;s part of the strategy of development .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of the Tibet until you go from the beginning .
I &apos;ve pushed the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in the Western China through the Western Tibet , and the same thing is behind the statistics we &apos;re going to Lhasa , and just came to Lhasa , I realized what &apos;s behind the statistics we &apos;re going to be talking about .
6,000 monuments sacred reduces in the dust and hurt .
1.2 million people killed from the military during the Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascritted in the Panchen Lama .
The one means that it was killed to the time of Chinese invasion .
Her uncle was falled with Sua Sainity during the diaspora that led the people in Nepal .
Her mother was imprisoned and her hit was repair .
It was brought to be born in caring at the age of two years , he hide in his gonna because it could not live without him .
The sister , who did the same , was mitted in education .
A day , it was called a race of a race of Mao and , and , for this transgrsion , was mitted to seven years .
The pain of the Tibet can be insopportable , but the spirit of the people is from the present .
And then , it turns out to a choice .
We want to live in the world monopian monopic world or we want to get the policy world .
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he died , he said that his largest fear was that , in our own view view of the world , not only we &apos;ll see the entire gamma of human imagination , but a day we &apos;re looking at the entire gamma of human imagination , but a day we &apos;ll wake up with a sleep sleeping until there were other possibilities .
And it &apos;s a humiliant to remember that our species is there for 600,000 years .
The Neolitica , who gave us agriculture , which has given us us us to the crack of the seed , and by by replace of the seed , by the next of the clam , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has been 300 years .
That &apos;s a story , I don &apos;t suggest that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to deal with the millencauses to come .
When to these myriades of cultures in the world is asked what you &apos;re human , they respond to 10,000 voices .
And that &apos;s in these answers that we all referred the possibility of being what we are : a kind of conscious species , that has to be able to be what people and all gardens can fix .
I took this on the north of Baffin , and the north of Baffin , when I went to cover of the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , and the Olaya , and the wonderful story of his grandgrandfather .
The government wasn &apos;t always gentile with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to stabilize our supremous supremate , we have them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refused to go .
The family , I theme for her life , and he took him all of the towns .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t feed the coldly .
The pieces of slitte in origin were made of fish skin skin skin skin skin .
The grandfather was not intimidded by the night night , &quot; Hethizard , and the blizard .
It &apos;s been tled , and it &apos;s hot the pantalons in the skin and defected in their hand . When I did I got a frozen hot , the working working in a moke .
It &apos;s got salive on the punishment of this cacy cholen , and when I became solido , killed a dog .
It &apos;s got a band created a bright , and created a bright , with the toilet , has been made a slitta , and it &apos;s been disappear on the banking , and it &apos;s disappear on the banking , and it &apos;s disappear .
We want to talk about horrise with nothing ? &#91; Risch &#93; And this , in different ways , &#91; Applauser &#93; is the symbol of the people of the world .
In the aprile of 1999 , the government reduced to Inuit the total control of an area of the largest area of California and Texmes them together .
It &apos;s their new pathria . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a independent territory . They all the mineral resources .
One of the splendid example of how a nation-state can reconcited with his people .
And , I think it &apos;s quite obvious to be at least as I think of of us was in these remote areas of the planet , I realized that they &apos;re not remote .
For somebody is home .
They representing seections of human imagination that they save the heat of time . And for us all these kids , as dreams of our children , as dreams , they become part of the nuda .
We &apos;re in National Geographic , we are convicted that politicians will never be anything .
We believe that polemc --
&#91; Applauser &#93; are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month .
156 countries transmate our television canal .
Our magazines are lls from millions of people .
Our job is traveling into the ethnosphere to bring our public places in the wonderful places that they will go away from what they will go away from how they saw and , hopefully , abstract will will be a central reveal of the exist of existence . We need to find a lifestyle life . And we have to find a lifetime in a pluralist and multiculticultical and multicultical a world of life in a pluralist and multicultural and multicultural world .
where the wisdom of all the people can contribute to our collective well-being .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things I wrote about this book that I hope you &apos;ve heard and try to evidence some connections , in case , you don &apos;t notice them .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the official dogma .
The dogma official thing ?
The dogma official of all the Western industrial society . The dogma official dogma official society . &quot; And we want to massive the welsewhere is is to do it is massive of the individual . &quot;
The reason is , on one side , in fact that freedom is itself a value , is useful , essential for human beings .
On the other one of us is in fact that if we are free , every one of us can act for all that that massizes our well-being , no one that decide in our welling .
The way of massize freedom is massive .
The more choices choices , more and the more and greater , and the greater freedom , is their well-being .
This is , I think , is so depth in the society that nobody would dream to be able to be in dubio .
And it &apos;s also deeply rown in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress is made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m going to allow me a simple note about conditions for injumps .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without contact the 10 variety of olium variety of oil , and the whales of the households that you can buy for you a number of conducts of the world .
Here &apos;s what the supermarket is .
And then you go to the electronic store : cast , CD , radio lettor CD , radio , piastra , light , bullettor .
And in this single store , there &apos;s a big number of audio components .
We can make six and a half of different combinations using the components that are in a only store .
You have to put it there is a very much choice .
Some of the world : the world of communications .
And once I was a child , you could get all the phone services for , at the peekeepers that were supposed to be Bell .
They were born the phone , didn &apos;t bought the phone , didn &apos;t bought it .
One of that , one of the other , was that the phone never crops .
These times , these times they went .
We now have a very much limited variety of phones , especially between phones .
Here &apos;s the phone phone .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , cuts , and I caught the nose of the nose , and the forgash .
If you don &apos;t have the case you saw in the store , you &apos;re very much certain you will get .
And what happens is that the end is that people get into the negotives and that question . And you know what is the answer ? The answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important acquists , you know the same as the same as explosion choices .
And there is blood , there is no longer in the United States that you go from the doctor and doctor you can do .
Instead , you go from doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do A , or B , &quot; Are you and these risks . &quot; Well , you can it be a good and these risks . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Dr. , what should I do I should be doing ?
And the doctor says , &quot; A has these benefits and these risks , and B has these benefits and these risks . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; Dr. if she was me , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor : &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
We call it &quot; autonomy of the malatory , and that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But in fact , it &apos;s not that you can move the weight and responsibility for making decisions that someone knows something , which is the doctor , to something else that &apos;s about -- and almost certainly is sick -- and it &apos;s certainly not -- and so in the ideal condition to make a decisions that is the patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing of pharmaceutical production , directed to people like me and you , if you think of it doesn &apos;t make sense , because we can &apos;t buy it .
But if we can &apos;t buy it , why do they advertiles them ?
The answer is that they want to ask for the doctor to ask us to change the receiver .
Something of the way is our identity is a question of choice , as you see in this vivignity is a question of choice , as well . I don &apos;t want to be forced .
And we can reinventing us as many times us as much as it is .
That means that every morning , in the morning , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I put the family and the matrichchest , a common time , the common perspective , for almost for anyone , was that you had the most pressive possible , and you started to get the most pressive possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not when , and what do after .
I mean , it &apos;s really to play .
I teach students very smart students , and I &apos;m going to be 20 percent in less of work than a time .
And not because they &apos;re less brilliant , because they &apos;re not diligent .
But why are I &apos;m imthoughtful , I mean , &quot; I would be going to be ? I &apos;m going to be doing it ?
&quot; Do I have to be more late ? I have to think before the children or the career ? &quot;
I &apos;m very logoring .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this implica don &apos;t complete the companies that assemble and not get a great voice to my own exame .
And they have to be .
Now , the job : we &apos;re lucky , as Carl underlying , because technology allows us to work every day , every day , every day , from every day , from Hotel Randolph .
And I &apos;m talking about , there &apos;s a angoline , and I won &apos;t say nobody , where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use me .
What does this amazing means , this incredible freedom of choice that we have to continually decide , continually at every moment , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing hot , with a phone , with a phone , the Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the hobes .
And if I &apos;m all spend , every minute that we see our child roving the game , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; I have to say to this call ?
&quot; I have to say this email ? I got to email this letter ? &quot;
And also when the answer is , it &apos;s all the experience of your son &apos;s experience of your son very different child than that would be in other conditions .
So , somewhere we look , small and big , things and big , stuff , life is a question of choices .
And once the world was this : That &apos;s the one of the world was , but it wasn &apos;t all about choice .
The world of today is what is : dilemma is : The dilemma is , &quot; Is it a good thing , or negative ?
The answer is Scipe .
We &apos;ve been born , we all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative .
All this coms choice two effects of two negative effects of people .
The first paradoxically , is that produced paradoxysis that it &apos;s very much of liberation .
And with a lot of options between which choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I give you a significant example : a study of the flight of flying fairly flip .
And I connected it was access to Vanguard data , the gigantic company , the gigantic company , with about a million customers in 2,000 different companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in the more , the percentage of adesive down .
With 50 sources , there is 10 percent in less than adesions as as well as as a matter of it . Why ?
Because with 50 sources that choose , is , it &apos;s sick , and choice is reached to the intomorrow .
And tomorrow , and I still tomorrow , tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course tomorrow .
You know that it doesn &apos;t only mean that these working on the old people are going to be for money , you know , the decision is so so that they can be decision is so so that they &apos;re also laying complex ,
Not participating , they &apos;re losing to five to a year from the dator of work , that would be very disposed to be there .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think that makes the world .
&quot; And to finish , for the ethernity : ketchup , or hhaonese ? &quot;
You would like to take the right decision , if it &apos;s for the ethernity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong wrong , and yet the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can avoid the parallex and do a choice , at the end , we &apos;re less satissssatissssatisssatissssatissssed by .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many of which is , you picked up , if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the alternative imaginative imagined us , and the remarkable of choice , and the repiling sssatisfaction from decision , and the reflat the decision , and the remarkers ,
And also when it was a good decision .
More choices , there are more easy to be displeased to any detail that is inssatisfaction of choice .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has clearly very well as as the value we are the things depends on what we can compare .
On the rest , when there are many options , it &apos;s easy to be to represent the alternative characteristics of alternative shot and be less subtle of the option that is choice .
Here &apos;s a example . I &apos;m sorry with everybody who are not New York .
But that &apos;s what you would probably think .
There &apos;s this couple of Hamptons .
A place of the lusse .
Spieces of splendida .
It &apos;s not missing . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , it &apos;s Agust . &quot;
&quot; All my neighbors in Manhattan is on . &quot;
&quot; I could talk right in front of the house . &quot;
And it &apos;s going to spend two weeks from the idea that &apos;s losing -- every day -- the possibilities of parking where it wants .
The costo---demining opportunity for what we have , even when choice was excellent is excellent .
And more are the options that we have to look , more the characteristics that are going to be able to be constitude as a costo-opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
It &apos;s about the time , and maybe of the living living slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you choose to be , you choose to not do the other .
And the things that we don &apos;t choose many attractive attractive that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : the growing of expectations .
I tried to my skin bought a new pair of jeans .
I &apos;m almost always jeans .
And one time jeans were just a kind of , bought and vestivate them and wress a lot of times , just after they brought them a life and jeans a lot of times , they were starting to go .
So , I went to buy a couple of a new time when the old people were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cutting . &quot;
And the committer said , &quot; You want to be a fit , and fleaking ? &quot;
I want to do it , or with the buttons ? &quot; Stonejjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjejjjjjjjejjjjjjjejjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjejjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjekhe , &quot;
&quot; You want to be a strikes ? &quot;
&quot; You know , you want to be lard , or strip , &quot; Continua .
I was sballoon , and after a little bit I could say , &quot; I want the kind of the only guy , that was the only kind of , and I was a time I tried to be , so for a moment I tried to all the people who had been in the jeans , and then I got the best jeans , with the best of jeans I had .
That was the very very good . I had the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I &apos;ve got a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was that I was that with all of that choice my expectations were altissue , jeans had to be perfect .
I had had minimes expected . I didn &apos;t expect anything exceptional when there was a kind of a kind of time , but when I saw 100 , you were very perfect .
What I had had been bubing , but not perfect .
And then I was talking to that I chose with what I was trying to be insodly in the expectations .
The added options in life life of people don &apos;t do that to increase the expectations that have to excellence the same .
And this will produce less satisfation , even when the results are good .
No one in the world of the marketing world &apos;s made .
Because if they knew it , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more to that .
&quot; It was better when it was worse , &quot; The reason that was better when you were worse when you were worse was still possible to meet .
In the world we live in the world where we live -- opulent , industrialized citizen citizen , the very very very , we can hope is that things are at the althetic .
You never surprised to be pleasant because your expectations , my expectations , you &apos;ve got a giganttle .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Bespelch expectations . &quot;
I mean -- small authographic moment -- which I &apos;m really sposed and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn &apos;t be able to do better , I didn &apos;t touched me .
But it &apos;s not a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of a couple of jeans , and you just have that kind of jeans is that when you &apos;re not very happy , and you ask you ?
Who is responsible ? &quot; The answer is clear-.
The world is the responsible . What could I do you do ?
When you have hundreds of jeans , and you buy a unsoddisfacing , and you ask who is , you ask who is , you know , you &apos;re the real , it &apos;s very clear that the responsible you are .
You could have done better .
And with hundreds of varieties , there are no excuse for the insuccess .
So when people make decisions , even if the result is valido , you feel inssed and , they &apos;re insodamn .
In the last years , depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a factor factor -- not the only , but important -- of this wave of depression is just that people have deludent experiences because the standard are too alts .
And when they have to explain this situation they think the hit is their fake .
So the final result is that we &apos;re better , but we &apos;re worse , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely fake .
There &apos;s no dubber that a little choice is better than I think it &apos;s better than that I didn &apos;t think of it &apos;s better than a little choice .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic value . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we have super------piece piece of the level where the choices are better .
Now , from political point -- I &apos;ve been finished -- I &apos;ve been finished by the political point , the nocy is the following .
What it allows all this in industrial choice is wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know about some of the world , where the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too poca .
So the faccenters that I &apos;m talking about is a bad event of modern , remarkable society .
And what it does depressing and angry is this : Steve Levitt spot about how those expensive expensive seats are inuseless . It &apos;s a money money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and dispendiose , is not that they are just useful .
I &apos;m deleterie .
They make worse .
If a little bit of what we do is in our society allows , you have a lot of choice , it &apos;s not just their life to improve but our life .
This is what economists call a better deal with a better deal with it .
A distribution of income re-re-re-re-re---time replacement .
To conclude , &quot; You can be all you want to be what you want . &quot;
You , you think , you &apos;ll think , &quot; What does that fish ?
&quot; It &apos;s obvious you can &apos;t do anything in a glass of glass . &quot;
&quot; A , a kind of a covered view of the world --
and I &apos;m interested in the way , I interpreted it .
But then , I realized , instead , I realized that the fish knows the long one .
Because the reality is that if you manda in frankle , you know , you can &apos;t get the freedom , you don &apos;t get freedom . You can &apos;t get freedom .
If you break the bocch of the way that everything you can diminize the sodly .
You get the paralysis , and you reduce the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too strange , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absorb of sphere is a recipe for injjewine , for the rovine .
Thank you .
