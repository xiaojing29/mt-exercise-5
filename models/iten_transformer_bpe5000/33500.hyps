Last year I showed these slides slides to show that the arctic ice ice ice to show that the arctic ice ice , which for almost three million years had the size of 48 United States continental , the U.S. continental , it &apos;s retroit of 40 percent .
However this subjected the gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t exhibition of the ice .
The arctic ice is , in a certain sense , the fearth of climate system .
It &apos;s expanded up and reverse retreat .
The next slide is going to be a reid carlated reaching for the last 25 years .
The glaces are reached in red .
You see , they expand to the blue blue blue .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter , which is summer ice .
You can see that the soft said , about five years or more , is like blood , that &apos;s like blood , that is that there was a blood , that is figured out of the body .
In 25 years , since this , so .
This is a problem because the interests that &apos;s all about the land land around the arctic ocean where there are huge amount of coal , and they &apos;re transformed into metane by the microbes , they turn into metane by the microbes .
I &apos;m going to the total of the atmospheric pollution , that amount could be doubling , that amount of not return .
In some lakes in Alaska little lagues in Alaska metane is already ribuling from water .
The Katey professor Katey Walter at University of Alaska team at a low-to-to-a lake team at the bottom .
Video : Wow : Wow ! Al Gore : You &apos;re good . The question is if we &apos;re also going to be it .
One reason is that this termal exchange termal surrise from the north .
This is a river at regime .
And the ported hadn &apos;t ever reached the same .
This is the Kangeraussuadian Redededge , in the southest of the Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level of the shelf on the shelf , here is where it &apos;s where it reaches the sea .
These currents are increasing rapidly .
On the other side of the planet : Antarctica , the biggest block of ice on the planet .
Last month , scientists have told that the ice &apos;s balance is in negative , and that the Western Antarctica , which pogate on the Western , which is particularly reached right in the sun in the skiest in the skiest in the sun .
It &apos;s six feet feet of the level of water , like in Groenland .
Sulil Himalaya , the third greatest block of ice , you see new lagues , that few years ago were glaciers .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population is half of the powerful water from the smooth .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the water of this city .
The ported is up .
But when it decreases , the same happens to the water .
In California , snow on the Snow War Nevada has been 40 percent .
The hyrichers are in crisis .
Sprevious predictions , as you read , they &apos;re grave .
The growing safe in the world brings to a remarkable increase in inceness .
The environmental disasters are going to be getting a rhythm and unprecedented .
It &apos;s over the last 30 years I was at the last 30 years I was at the last 30 years .
This is a way of all insustainable .
If you look in the historical context , you can see the consequences .
And we &apos;ve put 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the area of the Eastern Pacific , the Americas , to the Americans , to the west , and on both of the subcontinent , where there is a radal royal oxygen in in the ocean .
The greater cause of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , it &apos;s the fossil use of fossil fuel .
The oil is a problem , and coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with more emissions , together to China .
And he was proponated to build a lot of other centers .
But we &apos;re seeing a changing direction .
These are annullated projects in the last few years and some of the green alternatives .
Every way , there &apos;s a fight policy in our country .
The oil industrial and oil has spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote to clean coal , which is a bone .
And that image was reminds me --
Verice , in the Tennessee , where I saw , there was a loss of 3.8 billion litri liers of coal supply .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen it on the news .
This is the second largest fllow of the last flow in America .
It &apos;s happened around the Christmas .
Narrator of the coal of one of the coal industrial and .
I &apos;m going to do it . Frosty the carbon is a kind of allegro and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it &apos;s growing our economy .
Frosty the carbon is always fearing .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and the workers keep the living .
Al Gore : From here &apos;s a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest mineral society is Massey Coal . This is the Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I &apos;m going to be clear . Al Gore , Nancy Pelososh , Harry Re--- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima Protection of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Attore : At the same with ALergy , we see the climate change as a snakes to our business .
For this priorities is to invest a huge amount of money in a public effort to make and confused to make and confused the truth of coal .
In fact , coal is not spork .
We think it &apos;s clean -- it &apos;s also a good profumc .
So you don &apos;t prefer of climate change .
Let me do .
Video : Attore : Carbon -- you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
So let &apos;s make a turn into a structure at the avanguard for the fuel ,
Straordinarily ! See machines are a little noise , but this is the sound of the fuel technology .
The coal consumption is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology of fuel , but the remarkable technology that you see changes everything .
You look at this : this is the hate odien technology of clean .
Al Gore : So , the good alternative of the economic question is connected to economic issue and the national security .
Video : Comition : America is in the crisis ; the economy , climate crisis .
The filter connects to all : our dependence from fossil fuel fuel , like sports and oil .
But , there &apos;s a new , auduty solution to use .
Repower : 100 percent clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to reach America to work , make us more safe , and help stop global warming .
And finally , a solution that I drink to solve our problems .
Repower America . You &apos;re more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It &apos;s about reducing energy to America .
One of the fastest ways of getting to the dependence from the fuel that killing our planet .
Comparsa : The future is here . Vent , a new energy network .
Comparsa : two : New aging aging aging aging people &apos;s well-retributed jobs .
Complplplan : Repower . It &apos;s time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old African African said , &quot; If you want to go fast fast , go to the faster , you go to the faster .
If you want to go away , you go together . &quot;
We have to go far , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I did a LHC .
And you promise to return to the way to get back to the car how the works .
So I &apos;m here . And for those that the other time , the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever tried -- 27 kilometers of circumconference .
Her task is to reach the conditions that were there less than a billion-mild second since the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
That &apos;s just ambitious .
This is the machine under Genevra .
We were to be a little Big Bang in the refer .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLATLATLAATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLAS -- it &apos;s a half half feet .
This is a spectacular image of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions .
The 10 September of the last year we push the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was causes immense in the control room .
It &apos;s a picture of the first band of particles that had done all the around the LHC , and he &apos;s getting particles in a part of the LHC , and spread particles inside the relever .
In other words , when we see that image the 10 September , we knew that the machine worked , which is a big victory .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to make us exulate more or this , when somebody went Google and saw that the initial page was this .
That means we had a cultural impact beyond that scientific impact .
And it was a week later , there was a problem with the car , just about these filters here -- these dorati files .
These files took 13,000 ampampates when the car works at the most of the power .
Now , the technicians between you will look at the files and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . &quot;
And they can do it because when they &apos;re very cold become called the filters .
So , at least 271 degrees , at a lower temperature at the space of the stars , these files can bring that current .
In one of the giunture between the magnear magnear magnear magnear the MRRedwood .
So the files get up slightly , and the 13,000 ampines suddenly met a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think that these magnees are weighing over 20 tons , and they moved about 30 inches .
They &apos;re damaged about 50 magnees .
We had to take them , what we did .
We &apos;ve resoled them and wandering them .
They &apos;re going back back to them , they &apos;re going back to the sub-the-board .
I finally got the sea LHC LHC is going to be a new integrity .
We &apos;re going to accept that , and we &apos;re expecting to get data or July , and we keep our adventure to find out what the morning is that &apos;s the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these crashes reach the value of science and the valuable engineering engineering and frontier engineering .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s so hard , I think , is the value of things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of an Ingled scientist , Humphrey Davy , who , I guess , in the defense of inutilize experiments of its own own own , the clean was Michael Faraday , he said , &quot; Nothing is so dangerous for the progress of the mind of human mind , that is defined not there are no mysties in , that our own own , and that there are no mysties in , that are complete in nature , and that there are not about conquered not . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start asking you about rethink about when you , you play with kids , you play with the morning .
While you were like to reach them and grab them , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , and by by the space relationships .
So , space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand most part of the world around us .
So , as a computer inspired by the useful way of our interaction with physical objects , together to my consult Pacts , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking , &quot; And if , when we use a computer , instead of having the mouse , as a little bit of the mouse , like we could have the only information with the hands of their hands , we could have to defy them ,
and fix it to our pleasure ?
The question was so interesting that I decided to explore the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big interactive computer like a biscope .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big interactive computer like a biscope .
You can move with them , they can move with their hand , they can see their movement and they have a screen and they have a wireless radio .
But overwhelmed , they &apos;re physical objects , like the morning , you can just move them .
The Siftable is , example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physical , the movement , the other , the other other , the other , and as they become more physical , of the movement , of other , of how we can move them , we can explore new and fun style .
I &apos;m going to start with a little example .
This Siftable is to show video : if you get the video : if you cline it in a direction , the video will rotate so , if you start on the other side back .
These are constantly aware of others .
If I &apos;m released them , they &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re around .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can act a little bit .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can act a little bit .
They also have their own movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications was the way to use communities on data , for example , was to put in a liquid data , for example , &quot; let &apos;s call a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configured like a real frame of painting , and I can use them to pump in the central color , where they &apos;re missing .
and I can use them to the color in the central color , where they measure .
If we are too too , we can put a little bit of it .
There are also beautiful possibilities of learning , like languages , the mathematics and logic where people can try things very quickly , and see the results that are very quickly .
Now I &apos;m --
This is a Fibonacks us to a program of equations that I do with a equations program .
We have a game of words that it &apos;s in half between Scarabeer and Boggle .
Basically , to every Turn every Siftable , you get a letter on every Siftable , to every turn you got a letter on on the Siftable , and as you &apos;re trying to do it , and as you &apos;re trying to do it , and as you know , he &apos;s looking for it .
Then after about 30 seconds required , and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the kids came out to the Media Lab , I did so that I tried them and I tried them to try them and I went to a video .
They were very much pleased .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
You just say , &quot; Hey &quot; Compons of words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here is other people who try it .
This is our beta youngststers in the right way .
It actually wanted to be sweep them .
They were only morning morning morning for him .
Now , this is an application of a cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool for the languages . He &apos;s Felix . He &apos;s Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , lifestyle , they &apos;re associated with .
It can put new characters in the scene , lifestyle , they &apos;re associated with .
So , it &apos;s going to be out .
Video : The sun is surprising .
David Merrill : Now he took a trewer hours in the scene .
Video : The orange trewer .
Bel work ! Yes !
So you shake out the Siftable and putting them close to the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing their own story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a story with open final story , and it can decide him as it gets .
DM : It &apos;s a story with open final story , and it can decide him as it gets .
Video : Girway , cat .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , that I made of recently , to sample and execting music .
It &apos;s a tool , that I made of recently , to sample and performing music .
The Siftable here ague sounds like the basis , and the battery .
Every one of these has four different variations , and you can choose to use .
You can also put these sounds on a sequence that you can compose to your pleasure .
And then you just just touch a sound and a sequence .
These are actually you can actually control live , like the reverse and the filter .
And then you can do it to a particular sound and then cline to fix it .
And then there are general effects as time and volume , that you &apos;re apply to the whole sequence .
Let &apos;s look like , how it works .
Video : We &apos;re going to put a basis in two Siftable , &quot; sequence , &quot; we fix , we take them into a series , we extra , we extra . We add other basic .
Now I &apos;m going to put a line .
DM : Now , I &apos;m going to add percussions --
Video : And I &apos;m going to put the filter to the battery , so I can control the live live live .
DM : DM : I can poisze the whole sequence , when you know , it &apos;s time on one side or the other .
DM : And I &apos;m going to add the bottom to the bottom to give more expression .
DM : I can reclaims the sequence to the sequence .
So I didn &apos;t have to plan it before , but I can suddenly , making it longer longer or more coral .
And now , I can smoking the whole sequence of going to the left Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new human human interfaces always sewer as as they work our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to move to is that it &apos;s coming to this new generation of objects that we &apos;re going to take information to interact with digital media , that we want to get information in our world .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time to talk to all of you .
I &apos;m a writer .
I &apos;m going to write books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the fascinating of my life .
And I don &apos;t look like it .
But , I said , something specifically has happened in my life and my career , which led me to re-the whole report with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called &quot; Mangia , &quot; Prega , &quot; which , diversously , in which , undry , for some reason he came out in the world and became a big , senational , interational bestseller .
And the result is that everywhere now , people are getting me like I was convicted .
It &apos;s true --
They &apos;re all going to me now , and they &apos;re saying , &quot; Don &apos;t fear to be able to do better ?
You don &apos;t fear to go and write all the life without being able to create a book that can matter to someone ? &quot;
what can you want to matter ? &quot;
It &apos;s reassuring , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was an adolescent -- I was an adolescent .
I would go to the same reaction based on the fear .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you feel me that he couldn &apos;t have succeed ?
Don &apos;t you afraid the humiliation of reflies you ?
You don &apos;t afraid to do this mrescue for the whole life without anything that ever ever you &apos;ve ever got to die on a cumb of failure with the mouth of wildly to fill of failure cumble ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I &apos;m afraid of all those things .
I &apos;ve always had afraid .
And I also have a lot of other things that people can &apos;t even ininate .
And as the algae and other things .
But , as I was writing what I thought and I was asking about , and I would say , why is it ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logical that anybody should expect to be frightened by a work that you have to do .
But what is so specifically in creative companies to make us nervous about mental health as elessly as many other careers do they don &apos;t do ?
As my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don &apos;t remember one once in his 40 years of activity that was asked if he was afraid to be engineer ?
There was never -- that stuck of the engineer John , how does it go ?
It didn &apos;t work like this , you know ?
Every , chemicals like group have no certainly , in centuries , in centuries , the reputation of being alcohcolors .
We have a little bit of this reputation , and not just creative writers , but creative , we have this reputation of being enormous ununinstable to mentally forget .
And it &apos;s not to look at the sad constraints of creative , who , only in the 21st century , just in the 21st century , died young and often by their hand .
And the ones that are not suicked to be really disdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisappeared by their dones .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , &quot; Each book has killed me a little bit more &quot; A really , &quot; an amazing statement about their work of life .
But we don &apos;t throw it out when we feel that because we &apos;ve heard these things so long that we &apos;ve completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and the suffering are in a few ways of connected and that art , at the end , then you will always have to be on angosely , at the end , and it will always constraints to the corner .
And the question I want to ask all here today is : are you agree with this idea ?
It &apos;s good for this -- because it also looks like this . Because it also looks like for anything .
I think it &apos;s hating .
And I &apos;m also dangerous and I don &apos;t want to see it perpetuated in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our big creative minds .
And certainly , I know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start to the sense of support of support , and you know , overwhelmed the circumstances that are in my career .
And that &apos;s -- you know , I &apos;m young , I &apos;m a little bit young , I &apos;ve got about 40 years old .
I &apos;ve got about four work workers in me .
And it &apos;s very likely to write about what I &apos;m going to write about the world as the work that came out after the world , as the work that was really , as I think , as I &apos;m really ,
I &apos;m going to suck , because we &apos;re all more or less friends here -- it &apos;s likely to be in my own shoulder .
Oh , Gesu , that thinking !
You know this is the kind of thinking that brings a person to start drink gin the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would keep on doing this work that we work that we do this work that we do .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it seems to me , after a lot of thinking , that the way to work to continue writing is to create a protective , OK ?
I have to find a little bit of safety distance between me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural anx-safety distance of which reaction that you can get . And I was trying to find other societies , and I &apos;m trying to find other societies , to see if they could have some of the best ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthy ideas and more and more aware of the most awful ideas and more healthy ideas and more and more and more and more aware of it
how to help creative people people who are the emotional risks of creativity .
And that research brought me to the ancient Great and ancient Rome .
I &apos;m just just just going to be a little bit and then goes back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity selling creativity selling creativity from men , OK ?
They thought , creativity was this spirit looks like , and that they were divine to men from a few distant and unknown for some distant and unknown .
The Greeks called these spirits divini bees at creativity .
Socrate , wonderful , unlike , unlike having a demon that elargive wisdom from far .
Romani were the same idea , but they called that kind of spirit without a genius .
That &apos;s great , because Romani didn &apos;t think that a genius was really smart .
They believe that a genius was this kind of a divine that was literally lived in the walls of a little bit like the study of a little bit like the elsewhere to be constantly wising the work of the artist work and to model the outcome of that work .
Here is a EEEC------distance that I talk -- that &apos;s psychological construct that you protect from your work .
And everybody knew that was how he worked , right ?
So , the antic artists were protected by certain things , like the too narcism , not ?
If your work was exceptional you couldn &apos;t take it and all the merity-, everybody knew that you were helped by this genius .
If your failure work , it was not all your hot , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a inable .
And so people have to do a lot of time .
Then the Renissance came and all the time , and it &apos;s really great idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe over the world over all of the world and no longer to let space at the mitic creatures that writing detached deed by divinity .
This was the principle of rational rational , and people started thinking that creativity came completely from the idivide .
And the first time in the story , you start to referred this or that artist as a genius as a person with genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big error .
I think it &apos;s to allow someone , a simple person to believe that you are like a recipient , the essence and the source of all the mysties , creative , unknown and unknown and unknown and unknown and unknown and a very much of human payat .
It &apos;s like to ask someone to enjoy the sun .
And I &apos;m dealt and it &apos;s completely ego and it makes all these ingestimates on performance .
And I think it was a pressure to destroyed artists in passed .
And , if this is true , and I think it &apos;s true , the question is , and now ?
Can we do it diversously ?
Maybe I would go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t take 500 years of rational thinking in a talk about 18 minutes .
And they probably have people in the audience who would be reading scientific suspects on the notion of , you do that follows people to flow on their own own projects .
I &apos;m probably not going to convince you all about this thing .
But the question I want to ask is -- why not ?
Why don &apos;t you think that way ?
Because more sense of everything that I &apos;ve ever heard to explain the exasperating exasperating the imprevedibility of the creative process .
A process that , as anyone who has ever tried to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- knows , you don &apos;t coms rationally .
And in fact , it can sometimes seem completely paranormess .
I did this meeting recently recently with the extraordinary poem Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but that was a poetest for all life and said to me that during the Virginia , working in the rural Virginia , and he heard , in fact , when a poetry came from .
He said he was like a train air fragorious .
And that was going to rolling her .
It was feeling to get , because he was going to make the ground under his feet .
He knew that I had one thing to do that point and was , words , &quot; to run like a match . &quot;
And he was going to house and he was going to be followed by this poetry , and he wouldn &apos;t have to make any of paper and a match enough of paper and a match , and it would collect it and get it to the page .
Other times he couldn &apos;t be fast , so correctly faster and correcrectly to be able to get to the house and the roled the roled through and she was going to roled through the landscape , trying to go , and she said , &quot; another poet . &quot;
Then there were those times -- this piece of the piece I &apos;m not forced -- there were some moments when it was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was trying to paper and the poetry and put it through , and he said , that it was passing , and then he said , that it was going , and he said , that it was like to hallway with the other hand and the office .
And it was the poetry from the tail and put it in his body and moved the page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be presented on the page , but the other word at first .
So when I was thinking -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly the same as my creative process .
Not my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conducucucucucture !
I &apos;m a muil , and my way to work is ; I &apos;m wake up to the same orary every day and sweating and work and go up on the himself .
But even I , in my testardaggin my testablished , sometimes .
And I guess that many of you are doing .
You know , even though the work and ideas were going to give me a certain source of the source , I couldn &apos;t be honestly aware .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it to it not to losing your head , but rather , that it &apos;s going to be healthy ?
As I think , the best example of the best example I have a musician that I have a musician . I have a few years ago .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of the life was the incarnation of the art of the toward contemporary artist , to check , to check , to check , to domestic , to be a kind of completely interviews .
But then he was invecked , he soccer , and he was driving on a highway in Los Angeles , he changed everything for him .
It was going to be very quickly and all this little piece of melodia , which comes in in his head as inspiration does , elusive , and the hallway , and the wants , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and it &apos;s just unous , and the want , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and it doesn &apos;t know how to take it .
It doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a pencil .
So it starts to hear this kind of old anxiety , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to go up with this song .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to the panic , he stopped .
And he put a whole whole thing , and he did something completely new .
He just looked at the sky and said , &quot; I &apos;m going to see what I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you seem to do it ?
If you really want to be , you get a more hurt when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , you &apos;re going to importantly any other today .
You can disturbing Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his work process changed after this .
Not the work , the work was still dark .
But the process , and the fish that was reduced , and the genius was released when the genius , the genius that was going to take nothing else that problems and liberated it back to where it was , to be made that it wasn &apos;t to be a thing interorized and reminds .
but it was not a peculiar , wonderful bizarre , a conversation between Tom and this thing that is , it was not Tom .
So , as I was like that story started to change a little bit , the way I worked and already saved me once .
This idea , saved me when I was writing , &quot; Mangia , Prega , &quot; and fall in one of those cave disppppair that we &apos;re all working on and you don &apos;t do and you start thinking that will be a disaster , that it &apos;s going to be a disaster , that &apos;s going to be the worst book .
Not just bad , the worst book writing .
And I started thinking about how to throw this project .
But then I reminded of Tom that talked about air and I tried .
So , I got up my face on the missing missing and diress my comments to a vacuum angle of the room .
And I said to high voices , &quot; Seet , what we know that if this book is not going to be brilliant , it &apos;s not going to be entirely hit , no ?
Because I &apos;m putting all of this is putting all I have , I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to introduce your side .
OK . But if you don &apos;t , you know what , you don &apos;t do .
I &apos;m going to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I would like to be recorded that I was today to do my side . &quot; Because -- finally , it &apos;s like this , OK -- -- centuries ago in the North Africa of people were rown in the middle of the lone , dance and music that was going on for hours of the seveline , dance and so he was a lot of them .
And they were always magnifications , because the dancers were really wonderful .
But every time , it was rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became actually transcendent .
And I know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know that you &apos;ve all seen , at a certain point , a performance like this .
It was like the time she stopped , and the dancing drinks through a kind of lapal and not was doing anything else , like 1,000 noticed before , but it was all standing up .
And suddenly , it doesn &apos;t just look like a human .
But he accurate from the divinity of divinity .
And when this happened , in the time , people knew what he was , they called it .
They were constantly , and they started singing , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , God , &quot;
That is God , you know .
It &apos;s about storytelling -- when the More invaded south of the Southern of Spagna , I was preserve to change the centuries , Allah , Allah , Allah , &quot; Ole , &quot; Ole , &quot; , &quot; which you can still hear in the cords or flamenc .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , they &apos;re a magic , &quot; Allah , &quot; unable , &quot; uncomcomprehensive , &quot; uncomprehensive , a God .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes next day , for the dancer , when you wake up and you see it and it turns out to be the morning , of God , there is no more .
It &apos;s just a dead to a lot of ginocrace , and maybe it won &apos;t , ever ever ever ever they would get to that height .
And maybe nobody will sing the name of God still as a gira , and what so it has to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most sweet reconciliations to do in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so angosciant if you can &apos;t believe , advanced , that the most extraordinary aspects of your being .
But it just makes you get data in remote from a unimaginable source of this team of your life that squisition of your life that you have to go to somebody else .
And , you know , if we think that way it changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s certainly like I thought for several months in the book that I &apos;m going to be in the book that I &apos;m going to be on , the dangerous dangerous , and I was the dangerous , very quickly attempted .
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel electrized by this is , I don &apos;t have fear .
Don &apos;t flow you . It &apos;s just your work .
It &apos;s going to introduce you for your side , any one can be .
If your work is dance , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , if your work is dance .
If the divine , absurd genius , you &apos;ll decide to let me go out some kind of wonderful , for a moment through your effort , then &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Otherwise , you make the same dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot; to yourself . &quot;
I think and I think it &apos;s to teach it .
&quot; Ole ! &quot; to yourself , even for having had human love and tals to make a tals tals to make you presenting it ,
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I &apos;ve already talked about some of these projects on the human genes , what it means to mean and new genes .
We &apos;re starting to start digital , we started to digitize biology and now starting from that digital code , we &apos;re going into a new phase of biology , designing and synthesize life .
We &apos;ve always tried to ask big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; is something that many biologists , I think they &apos;ve tried to understand various levels .
We have tried different approaches , reducing it to the minimum .
We &apos;re digitize for almost 20 years ever .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the analog world of biology in the digital world of computers .
Now , we ask : can we regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome between those that can authoreplicate in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little more small .
We can get out of a hundred genes of genes that they &apos;re here .
But when we look at its metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our .
I think I &apos;m just -- this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at a time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this can bring to a cell .
So we decided that the only way to design was synthesize this chromosome so that we could change the components to bring them out of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of &quot; Can we synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Can you have a chemical consentence to produce these big molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create before ?
And in case , we can make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemical material that is just a piece of chemical material .
The speed with which we can digitize life is growing at the exponential rhythm .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , moving fairly , but it &apos;s getting better .
And our most recent results the results on a curve .
We started more than we started more than started .
The process has required , starting with a bioethical review before we started the first experiments .
But we found out that we &apos;re synthesize is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that produce small segments of DNA , and the long length of 30 50 letters , and it &apos;s a process : more mistakes are long , more errors .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these fragments and reach the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , to start digital information from the digital information of the genome of Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the framments , and we &apos;ve got the fragments of errors and get a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material that is inherent and we put it in bacteria , the bacteria have started reading this genetic code and to produce the viral particles .
The viral particles were then repair , they come back and they &apos;ve gone back and they destroy .
I &apos;ve talked about recently with members of the oil industry , I said , &quot; I &apos;m certainly understood this model .
They &apos;ve got more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually actually build its own hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things bigger .
We wanted to build the whole chromosome of the bacteria .
They &apos;re more than 580 thousand letter to genetic code .
So we thought we build it in the cassette of the virus , so that we can change the cassette to understand what the components of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard accuracy was a mistake for every 10 thousand .
We &apos;ve found out , resequenced it , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence we never have been able to do it work .
One part of the process is to design segments for long , which you get overwhelmers with all other segments of 50 to make a little smaller than working together .
We need unlike this .
You &apos;ve probably read that we put in the flyss .
So , I think , it &apos;s a genetic code on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters mitted up about 20 amminoacids , and there &apos;s a specific order to letters for each amminds .
So we can use the genetic code to write , frash , thoughts .
What we did at the beginning was authographing it .
Some of them were delused to the fact that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
We designed these segments to be able to just join with enzymes .
There are deeply , and they put them together .
And we started to assemble parts , starting with the parts , starting with the segments of five to seven thousand and and letter them to form segments of 24 mila letters to them , and they get to 72 thousand letter .
We &apos;ve made these segments in abundance so that we could sequenced it because we &apos;re trying to create a very very good process -- like you &apos;ll see in a little robbbbyers -- as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems like a basketball ,
When we get to these segments very long , more than 100 thousand basis , they don &apos;t grow more directly in E.
You get to the limits of the modern molecular biology .
So we &apos;ve been considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called a &quot; homological rewards , that in biology used to repair the DNA to repair the DNA to unting .
Here is an example .
This organism called Deinoccurs , can absorb three million radiation of radiation .
You can see in the upper require like his chromosome is destroyed .
And it was 12 -- 24 hours , it was just like it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that they can do it .
These organisms can be no longer dry .
They can live under empty .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life is in space , and you can get to the new environments of water .
Actually , NASA showed that this is happening .
This is a molecule that we built using these proceedures , simply using the lievated design appropriate segments .
The leverage them automatically .
This image was not taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It &apos;s a molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that they cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the publishing that we did a little time ago .
They &apos;re more than 580,000 letters , of genetic code .
It &apos;s the great-molecule structure ever created by the man .
It has a molecular weight for 300 million .
If we &apos;re going to be a 10-shapt , we would take a 142 pages only to move this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ? How do we work ?
Of course , you get a virus is a game game .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria .
It &apos;s even simple when it is eucarily cells as our : you just get the nuclear and put nuclear and put another , which is basically the cloning process .
In the archaea bacterium , instead of integrated in the cell , but we &apos;ve recently demonstrated that we are able to make a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another and to activate it .
We can clean a chromosome parent from a microbial species .
The two are different than men from mice .
We &apos;ve added up some genes in a way that we could decide that choose for this chromosome .
And then it swarm with the enzymes so that they kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was amazing -- and you &apos;re going to open our graph , sic-ic-fisticaog -- the new chchromosome is gone inside to the cell .
And we were thinking that we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried it anyway .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that a second or a third species have added a second or a third chromosome , on a few hand , add in a second thousands of new traits to that species .
So , who think about evolution as a gene once once you get to change , it doesn &apos;t have a much of biology .
There are enzymes called the fairs of re-deeply , that they also also make a DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell .
The mobile phone that we have put it .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other chromosome as a material , it has masticked it , and we found up with just the cell and the new chromosome .
It became blue because of genes that we &apos;ve put it .
And in a short lash of time , all the characteristics of a species , they went so forth , and it &apos;s transformed into a new species , based on the new software that we put into the cell .
All the proteins have changed , and members have changed , and when we read the genetic code exactly what we &apos;ve moved to you .
Now , this may seem like genetics , but by alchemy DNA , but by alchemy , we can change things in a very substantial way .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that you don &apos;t talk about genesis -- but of a progress of three and a half million years of evolution , and I &apos;ve already said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion where they will come back back in the digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s obvious enough when we think about our necessity .
We &apos;re going to go from six and a half billion people to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
I was born for example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each other in 1946 ; in 40 years , there will be four of them .
We &apos;re having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medicine and fresh for six and a half billion and a half billion people .
It &apos;s going to be even more hard to nine billion .
We use more than five billion coal , more than 30 billion barrels , more than 30 billion barrels .
That means 100 million barrels a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replace them , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to have the whole CO2 emission from these materials that end up in the atmosphere .
In today , because of the scientific discoveries around the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I think , that are designed components designed for the future .
The electronic industry has only a dozen about components , and think about how many different things came out .
Our limits here is data , principle data and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , because of these methods of synthesization , able to create what we call a combinatory .
We can build a big robot that can produce a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
You think of processing these 20 million genes or to try to optimize the processing to produce optimistic , new vaccines , we can change , thank you a little team , and we can change , thank more molecular biology that in the last 20 years .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemical production or chemical production , or chemical vaccines .
This is a few software instant programming software that we &apos;re working to be able to sit down and design species at computers .
Well , we don &apos;t necessarily know how they &apos;re going to be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
Now , we &apos;re focusing on the fourth generation .
You also have seen you that extract ethanol from the grain was an experiment .
We have depending on the third generation that will be used to be very soon at the zuckin zucchereral sugar , or different kinds of butanle .
But the only way biology that &apos;s having a big impact without increasing the cost of the food and limlimestone of them that , and we &apos;re working to design cells that can achieve this goal , and we &apos;re working out to design cells that can achieve this goal , and we think we can have the first fuel than , in order to be able to be able to be able to turn the CO2 into about 18 months .
The solar light combined CO2 is a metodo--- but in our discoveries around the world , we found several metods .
This is a organism that we described in 1996 .
It &apos;s going to the ocean , at about 2,500 feet deep to the webollist of water .
It creates from CO2 using molecular hydrogen as a molecular source .
We &apos;re trying to understand whether we can incanaling CO2 , which can easily be carried through tubes , converted that CO2 in fuel , to drive this process .
So , we could think that we could be able to increase what the question of what life is . &quot; And we can , versus -- we have the modest goal to replace to replace the entire oil industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do this for TED , where you can &apos;t ?
It would come to a major source of energy .
And we &apos;re working to use the same methods to create instantly vaccines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with flu , we are always forces of a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s about finding the vaccine .
I think it can change by changing building combinable vaccines in the anticius .
Here &apos;s how the future might start to look changing , now , the evolution of evolution , accelling evolution with synthetic bacteria , arches , and finally eucariote cells .
We &apos;re so so much about improving people .
Our goal is to make it .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the most fundamental work , the new technology that we brought to the Microsoft in the purchase to a nearly a year ago exactly . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s an environment where you can interact is at local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data .
We &apos;re seeing here , many gigables of digital photograph with a kind of a kind of zoom , and on , for a fast panoramic , despite the images like we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much the amount of information that we see , how big these collections collecting data or the images .
Most of them are communities photographs , but this for example is a scan from from Congress Library of Congress , and I &apos;m going to get in the 300 megamma .
It doesn &apos;t make a difference because the only thing that limits the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen at any moment . It &apos;s also very flessible architecture .
This is a book , all of not data from no images .
This is the Dickens .
To show you that it &apos;s just about text and not of images , we can do something like this , to really see that it &apos;s a real representation of the text , not of a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a electronic book .
I don &apos;t have the advice .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s a number of The Guardian .
Every image of a section of a section .
And really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading the real version of a magazine or of a me-like meant , which is nature a multi-type type type of half .
We also did something with the angle of this number of The Guardian .
We created a high-resolution fashion advertising -- much more than you use in a normal advertising -- and we put in the content of the content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or others models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really really shows some of these ideas to eliminating the space limits of space on the screen .
We hope that means to put people up and to other similar people and other similar porcheries , not to be able to be necessary .
Of course , mapart is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don &apos;t want to lose time , if I don &apos;t say that we have contribute to do in this field .
These are all the street roads over an underneath NASA geospatial image of NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually alive on the web ; you can go to the web .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which is a project called Photosynth , which is a project that &apos;s about two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research at very interesting computer that we did by Noah Snavely , a student at the University of Washington , with the help of Steve Seitz of Microsoft Rick Szeliski Rick Szeliski , and collaboration .
And it &apos;s from the live of the web , and I was running from Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from one image to the other and have this kind of experience of multiple experience .
But the spaceshial , images here has actually actually a meaning .
The computer algorithms have recorded these pictures together , so that they corresponds to the real places that the reals -- all the near the lakes -- all the bags near the Grases on Montagne Roccies were taken . So here you see the elements of a slip-up , or or panorfriend , and these things are all connected to the space level of a slightly linked .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;ve got time to show you some other other environment .
There are a lot more spatial .
I want to go directly to one of the Noades data -- and this is a previous prototype of the first time we have the last summer for you to see what I think is really the key key to the first summer that we have to do what I think is really the key key back to this technology , Photososynth of Noades -- and this is not necessarily evidence that we put in the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of Nothree-Dame , Nothree Dame images taken by Flickr . Baucucuch . And you get some images of types in shirt , other campus and so on . So , you get some of these sampus and so on .
So they &apos;re all images from Flickr and they were all connected to the space level this way .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this very simple way .
You know , I would never have thought to end work for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifying to get this kind of accounts here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different kinds of photocamers : from those cell phone phone to those SLR professional , a number of meaning , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to try and more strangered .
Many blocks , etc .
Somewhere here is a series of photographs -- there .
This is a poster Nothree Dame poster .
We can go from the poster to the physical view of this environment .
The essential point is we can do things with the social environment . This is taking data from the whole memory of the whole collective memory as the whole of collective memory as the land , from visual point of visual view -- and connects all those data together .
All those pictures become connected together , more than the parts of the parts .
You have a model of the whole of land emerges .
You think about this as the prolungent of work Stephen Lawler on Earth &apos;s virtual Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as people are using it , and the people are using it , and the ones that are the use .
Their pictures are marked metaphed with other people .
If you get someone is the idea of contrast all these sets saying the name , my picture of the Cathrial three Demail , you &apos;ve got wealth up three D. suddenly you get to the point of ingress in that meapapapart in that metaphor , using the pictures of the other cross-cross-by-to-bar , using anyone else , and having a kind of a moke cross-mooth and cross-user .
Of course , a consequence of course , all of the interesting virtual models of each other part of the interesting land , collecting not just by seen airplanes and satellite images and similar , but by the collective memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What your software is going to be doing is that at a certain point in the next few years , all the photographs of all the photographs are all in the world will be very much ?
BAA : Yes . What it &apos;s doing is basically to see .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the basement of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of seant information that a lot of these images have .
As you do a research of images , you know , you know , a sentence and the headline on the web page is a lot of information about the pictures .
Now , what happens if that picture is connected to all your pictures ?
So the amount of semaned interconnection and the amount of wealth that comes out of it is really enormous . It &apos;s a classic network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible . Compliments .
BAA : thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure of the ethnographic pleasant for ethnographic research is that you can live between who have no people in the ancient traditions , between who you have the antic traditions , you &apos;re touches in the rain stone of the rain stone of the waves , and the guuck in the waves of plants .
I think that the Skamani Jaguar , they still travel over the Via Lattea , or that the old old old Inuit &apos;s still cols of meaning , or that in Himalaya , the distinct of the Dhark , the importantly importantly in the Dhark , but to remember the central of anthrology , and the idea that the world we live that we live in in in which we don &apos;t exact in a sense , but it &apos;s just a reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that we have done , well or bad , a lot of generations ago .
And , of course , we all share essential essential .
We all come . We all procrease .
We &apos;re subjects to reach of initiation .
We have to deal with the inesorability of death , so we don &apos;t surprisingly surprisingly surprisingly , we &apos;re going to have to be dogs and we don &apos;t surprising .
We all have an art .
What it &apos;s the particular rhythm of the song , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that they &apos;re the forest Borneo , or the following of the Voodoo &apos;s trouble , or the desert warriors of the Kaisut in Kenya , Curandery in Kenya , or a cameras , or a cameras in the Sahara &apos;s heart of the Sahara .
He was my journey of journey in the desert a month , or an yak hallaker in in Qomolangma , on Man &apos;s curs , on Man &apos;s mother of the world .
All of these populations teach us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving around the world .
And , if you think a moment , it &apos;s a concept that it can give you hope .
And together , the world miriades of cultures of the world create a spiritual , and cultural life that happens the planet and cultural well-being , and it &apos;s important for the planet as a biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural race as a way to a ethnososphere and you can define the etnososphere , the total of all the concepts , dreams , mites , ideas , inspired , intuitions , brings , intuitions , brings up , intuition , remarkable ,
etnosphere is the wonderful patrimonium of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be as a kind of inquisitional .
And since biosphere was very much more , as a long as it was very quickly as the etnoses succeed in the etnoses and much more rapidly .
None biologist , for example , would say that 50 percent of all the species is about the horries , simply because it &apos;s fairly fliptical , or -- in the most apocaly -- in the most apocaly -- in the most optic field of biological diversity -- and you don &apos;t even get close to the most mystical diversity -- that of cultural diversity .
The whole thing is , obviously , the language loss loss .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not just a vocabulary or a vocabulary or a series of rules .
One language is the spraking of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle of the animous culture comes in the world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a stick , a thought , a ecosystem of spiritual .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re sitting in Monterey , at least half no longer is subsurrated in the ears of the children .
They &apos;re not taught to children , the one that means , unless than cames , which are already died .
What is more sad than you are going to be silence , of being the last talking about a language , the last talk about a language , you don &apos;t have to transmit the wisdom of the good or to anticipate the promise of children ?
This is a few people in the world &apos;s state of somebody in the world every two weeks : every two weeks . every two old or two weeks : every old old language ,
And I know somebody to say , &quot; Is it better ?
The world wouldn &apos;t be a better place if we were all talking about the same language ? &quot; Benissues . We &apos;re all yoruba .
We talk about kogi .
You &apos;re going to get a sudden what it means you can &apos;t talk to your language .
I &apos;d like to do a journey through the etnosphere --
a little journey in the ethnic , to give you a assage of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I say &quot; several ways of existing ways of existing . &quot; I mean , very different ways of existing .
Let &apos;s take for example , Barasana bimbe , in the SSSSee Amazon , the people of the anaconda &apos;s river , the people of the west , the edge of the west , in the west panish &apos;s &apos;s the latest panish of the waste ,
It &apos;s a people that can &apos;t be able to distinguish the color from the green color because the cells time .
They have a strange language and a rule , and a rule , called &quot; exogamia language : You have to marry a person that &apos;s talking a language that &apos;s about a different person talking about a language .
And all of this has roots in the mitological past , though the particularly , is that in these families are , and they &apos;re talking about six or seven languages because of marriage .
They &apos;re just listening to listen and then start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribe that I &apos;ve lived , the Waorans of Ecuador , a incredible people that had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionary have tried to take a fatal error .
They &apos;ve been going down down to photograph photographs that they react them that they react to the people that they were going to forest that people in the forest that they had never seen anything about bi-dimensional .
They &apos;ve been taken away from land , they turned to the research of a form or a figure or a figure and not out , they have the diavian that was that they were dealt , and they killed the five missionary missionary .
But the Waorani didn &apos;t kill just the foreigers .
They killed each other .
54 percent of the death was caused by themselves .
We were saved eight generations and we found two natural death cases , and when we &apos;ve been insisted to know , they admitted that one of them was invecked , and then they killed it the same . And then they killed it the same .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine 40 steps and recognize species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned a really interesting task when my Harvard professor , I was asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti between the secret of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes , and I impossessor weapons of Duvalier and Tonton Me .
To make sense of the Voodoo , I should have understand Voodoo culture and that Voodoo is not a black .
It &apos;s pretty a complex metaphor of the world .
Very interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christianity , Islam , Buddhism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has no faith religious faith . And instead and the Voodoo is not another distilled that the distilled of these religious concepts that are very deep nati in the tragic slavery .
What makes the interesting thing that &apos;s the intense is to report between life and death .
So the vives are doing the spirits .
Again can be invocated by the Great Achere , they respond to the race of the dance and replace temporary animation of live so that for a short active active active active active active to the bullet becomes the god .
So the voodooists like , &quot; You go to the white , you go to church to talk about God .
We &apos;re going to be in the temple and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re sitting , and is the spirit that drives you , how can you get bad ?
So you see these incredible events : following voodoo in the state of trance that touches impunids that touches impunishment , a rather strong demonstration of the body &apos;s mind when it &apos;s catalyzed in a state of extract .
And it &apos;s all the people that I have the most extraordinary is Kogi Kogi CSierra Nevada de Santa Marta RRRelentrional .
They &apos;re going to take ancient , the people in the charge , that once lived on the charge of Colombia in the waiting of the conquire , the people retreat on the volcanic massassassassassasses that you could get on the volcanic massive plan .
In a continent of blood blood , this people have never been conquered spagnoled by the spagnoled .
But I &apos;m government government has been government , but their formation is so extraordinary .
The young people are taken away from the families to three or four years , and they live secret in a world of dark and shadow the button of stone of the frozen frozen at the bottom of the payers for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years , by nine months of the gestation that they go to the user mother , now they &apos;re metaphor , they are now metaphor in the user of the Grands Mother .
All of this time , they &apos;re accultured to their society , values that predict that their prayers and just their prayers and forth their prayers , keep the balance -- or to say the wealth , or to say the weather ecological balance .
And so the term of this incredible initiation , they suddenly carried out and for the first time to be 18 years , see an although , the age of the first bank . And that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do with the sun kissing the beautiful valuable valuable bber , all that they &apos;ve learned in the theory is conference in the whole race . The pret ppppace . The pret pppppppppppppush . The first time is .
&quot; Viser ? Proprio as I said . &quot;
It &apos;s amazing . Now it &apos;s now to you . &quot;
They call them more brothers and say that we , rings , and rings , we are the colors of the world &apos;s destruction of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the indigenous populations and invoke Rau and the old story of the selling selling southern &apos;t , what it &apos;s a race of the simplicity or maybe invoThoreau and we &apos;re closer to the Earth of us .
The Indies are not nor feelings , no feelings of nostalgia .
There is no space for these things in the Asmat Asmat the Asmat , or in the Tibet , but thank you for time and rhyththids , but by time , they created a mystical of the Earth is not about the concept of being aware of close to the -- the concept of the Earth can only live because it &apos;s infused by human aware .
What does that say ?
It means that a young boy of Ande that Ande that mountain is an Apu that mountain is an Apu that will lead its destiny to be a human being deeply different , and it will have a very different ratio with the mountain or that place you can create a very different rocks with the mountain or that area is that we &apos;re going to be shoot .
which is the dimora of a spirit or a mineral caught is irrilever .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that define the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forest of Columbia Britannica believing that the forest they were going to be cut .
And that has made me a different human being different from my friends Kwakiutl that believe that the forest are Hukukukukukukukukukukukukukuk and the cannied cannied .
If you start to look at that cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of them sensations . We take this plant .
I took this picture to open up in the nord-Amazon the nordal Amazon .
Maybe some of you &apos;ve heard about the ayahuased , the most powerful psychoactive psychoactive repertorium .
What makes the ayahuascinating , is not the potential of the substance , but its elaboration . It &apos;s called the two elements .
On one hand , this lighting lious lights that keeps a series of Tial-coal , harmoline and harmoline , slightly hallucinogen , slightly hallucinogen and harmoline ,
And by by trying to the only plant , you have a smoke that alter a little bit of consciousness , but it &apos;s mixed with the leaves of a caffee family ,
This plan has powerful tripptamines , very similar to the serotonin , dimethyptamine , dimethoxyptamine .
If you ever see the Yanomami throwing it up for the birth , the substance that they do from a different set of species , it is methoxyptamines .
Tiring that dust on the nose is a little bit like being shooted by a charge of bear , and land on a sea of electricity .
I often need to my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who had taken the psychedelivered the age of the hallucinogen , with his discovery of the &apos; 30s in Mexico .
I think I &apos;m going to be hallucined to be a covered . Because if you &apos;re done you can &apos;t tell anybody to be hallucined .
It &apos;s possible to absus the orously if you get other chemicals that they denied MAO .
Now it &apos;s the beautiful : the Tibeta-coal , that are injury of MAO , the same kind of need to be able to potentially have the trippppptages . The question is : in a four-species of plants , like these people can find two defed defed by the way , you know , but if you combine in this way , create a chemical version that are , you know , you create a chemical version of the parts ?
We use the great eugly the great eugly , that can be infruted .
But if we ask Indians , we say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We &apos;re going to say , &quot;
What does that say ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuasca , who are born in the forest , and that at our eyes would come into the same species .
If we ask them how they stabipped their toxonomy will say , &quot; I thought , &quot; I understand it of plants , the rest of the rest of you don &apos;t know ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take the 17 varieties in a night of moon the filled with a different tone .
And this is not graduate at Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting that count stami .
Now , &#91; applausers &#93; the problem is that even those of us that have at heart people who have in the history of our real world , and they &apos;re going to be reduced to the margins of the story than our real world , and it &apos;s passing .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it &apos;s not going to remember his technological innovations or its technological innovations , but rather as the one was in which we stopped and passionate accepted , or a very accepted , or cultural , and cultural , cultural , and cultural , of the planet . Now the problem is . Now the problem is .
All the cultures through cultures have been involved in a dance for new possibilities of life .
And the problem is not technology .
Indians Six Indians have no smitted to be Six when they put on the arco and frecovered as Americans have no stop being Americans when they put on the horse and hot .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that threatening the technology that threatening of ethnosion . It &apos;s power .
The hard hard to domination .
And if you look at the world , you find that these are not cultures that these are not cultures .
They &apos;re living creatures and dynamics spinout of forces that go beyond their adaptation skills .
It &apos;s about the Penan --
a pet nomad of Sarawak , in the Southeast , a people who lived in the forest to a generation of the witnesses , and now reduced to a generation on the reduces , and now reduced to the reduced river , where you can see the river &apos;s river from the lim that seems to be brought away from Bornee , where the nurse , where the southern of Meriont , where the noms are the horizoned horizon ,
It &apos;s ready to fill the wooden wooden with the wooden .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that you have the discovery of gold .
If we move on on on the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the hard hard hard to dominate politics .
As you know the genocide , the extinction of a people , is convicted at universal level , but the ethnocid , the destruction of the style of a people , not only is to be contained , but it &apos;s a celebrated , it &apos;s part of the development strategivenue , because it &apos;s part of the development strategiveness , because it &apos;s part of the development strategivenue of development .
And you can &apos;t understand the Tibet suffering from Tibet until you start .
I &apos;ve path the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in the West , you know , I &apos;m going to go to Lhaaa with a young link , but only came to Lhasa young connection , but only it came to Lhasa with a young link , but just came to the same .
6,000 huments sacrice reduced in dust and centered .
1.2 million people killed the military in the Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was assigned to the Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed to the Chinese invasion time .
Suo uncle is fuel at Santity at the diaspora that led people in Nepal .
Her mother was imprisoned and her cold was being rich .
It was brought to hide in a career at the age of two hidden under his gonna because he couldn &apos;t have any living without him .
The sister , who did the same , was put in reduced reduced .
One day he reached a roled stick a rough band Mao and , for this transgression , was put to the forced to safety sets for seven years .
The Tibet can be insopportaable , but the spirit of the people is tener to be tener .
And it &apos;s all all the reduces to a choice .
We want to live in the world of the monocromatic monoccurreny or do we want to take the policy ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he died said that his greatest fear was that , in our world &apos;s view , we &apos;re going to see the whole gamorage of the world , we &apos;re not just going to see the whole gams of thinking of human imagination , but one day we &apos;re going to wake up with a sleep forgotten to the way that there were other .
And it &apos;s humiliating that we have to remember our species for 600,000 years .
The Neolitica Revolution , which has given us agriculture , that has made us rescue to the seed , by replacing the poetry of the ski , by creating the poetry of the specialization , by creating the gerarchy of specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has been 300 years .
That shared history is not suggestions to me that we have to all the challenges that we have to face in the millennia .
When you have these miriades of the world is asked what they want to be human , they answer to be human , they answer to 10,000 different voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all refer the possibility of being what we are : a kind of a kind of a way that all the people and the gardens can flow . And there are big moments of optimism .
I took this picture on the north end of Baffin the island , when I went to hunt with Inuit , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya lot of .
The canadese government has not always been gentile with the Inuit and the 1950s to stabilize our suprematia people , we were rhinely reahead .
The grandfather of this man refused to go .
The family , I &apos;m theme for his life , he took them all the weapons , and all his tooles .
You have to know that the Inuit don &apos;t feel cold , they exploitate it .
The skrooms were in origin , that was made of fish flying in the skin .
The grandfather of this man didn &apos;t put out of the night or the byells , or the byelard that was suffering .
It &apos;s flew away , he &apos;s hot , it &apos;s hot the panthoused in focused and defeced in their own hand . When I did it frozen , and they worked a sama .
It &apos;s spruial salive on the punch of this cow , and when it became solid , she killed a dog .
He shake the dog and created a bright , with the toracy , has a slice , he enliked another dog , and he &apos;s disappeared on the banks , and it &apos;s disappeared on the banking , the ca bank , the ca bank , and it &apos;s got handed up .
We want to talk about horarselling with anything ? &#91; Risate &#93; And this , in different ways , and so , in different ways , and so , in the symbol of the people in the Inuit and of all the Indies of the world .
In the aprile 1999 , the CCCCCCCalalalty government reduced the total of the world of Texas med .
It &apos;s their new patria . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s an independent land . They &apos;re going to have all the mineral resources .
One beautiful , an example of how a natione-state to re-state to re-roughly .
And , to end , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious to the ones that we have been in these remote areas of the planet , I realize that they &apos;re not remote .
It &apos;s house .
They &apos;re presenting sections of human imagination that go back to the time . And for us all of these kids , as the dreams of these kids , as the dreams of these kids , they become part of the geography of hope .
And we &apos;re convinced , we are convicts that politicians will never come to anything .
We believe that polemics --
And so , we don &apos;t have persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month , 35 million visits website has 35 million visits .
156 countries transmitted our television .
Our own magazines are lets of people .
Our work is traveling in the ethnososphere to bring our public in places of cultural wonders that they will go away from what they &apos;re going to go away from what they saw and , hopefully , abbracing for the central reveals of the central anthroughout the way , and we have to find a life in a pluralist and we have to find a liticultural life in a world of pluralist and and we have to find a life in a life in a life in a world , pluralist and and we have in a world in a life in a life in a life in a
where the wisdom of all people can contribute to our collective wisdom .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope you &apos;ve heard and I &apos;m going to tell you some links , in the case you don &apos;t notice them .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the official dogma . &quot;
The dogma official what ?
The dogma official society is the Western industrial society . The dogma official dogma : &quot; If we want to maximmize the well-being of our citizens . &quot;
The reason is , on one hand , in fact that liberty is itself , the way , it &apos;s precious , useful , is precious , useful , essential for humans .
On the other one is that if we are free , each of us can act to do everything that massize our well-being , without nobody who decisions in our well-being , without any one that decision in our well-being , without any decision in our own .
The way to massively is to male the choice .
The more choices of people , more of them , the more libere , and the greater is their well-being .
This , I think , it &apos;s so deeply royed in the society that nobody would be a doubt .
And it &apos;s also deeply rooted in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you a few examples of what progress made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m going to let me get a simple note about the stairs .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without counting the 10 variety of olive olive , and 12 acres of whales and 12 acets of the whale that you can buy a huge number of conditions in the circumstance that nobody of 175 .
Here &apos;s what the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic store : cases , CD lettor CD letter , radio , plaws , lificer , light , piat .
And in this single store , there &apos;s a big number of audio components .
We can make six million of different combinations using the components that there are in a store .
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice .
Other fields : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the telephone services , at the shelf that were supposed to be Bell .
They didn &apos;t buy the phone , you didn &apos;t buy it .
One consequence of that , between the other , was that the phone never made .
These times are gone .
We have now a nearly limited variety of phones , especially between cell phones .
Here &apos;s cell phones .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , lettor MP3 cut , cut the bylus , and forgotten for crice ,
If you don &apos;t have any still seen it in the store under house , you &apos;re very much certain that I will get .
And what happens is that people come in in the store and they &apos;re doing this question . And what is the answer ? The answer ? &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a phone that doesn &apos;t make a way .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important acquished acquished , the same explosion of choices .
It doesn &apos;t have health care : it doesn &apos;t happen more in the United States that you &apos;re going to go from the doctor and the doctor you , you have to do .
Instead , you &apos;re doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do it , or you could do it , or B , &quot; A has these benefits and these risks . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Dr. , what should I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; Well , these benefits , and B has these benefits , and B has these benefits . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you &apos;re saying , &quot; Dr. if she was , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result we call it &quot; autonomy of the malate , &quot; expression that makes it a beautiful thing .
But it &apos;s not that you move the weight and responsibility of making decisions that somebody knows that you know , the doctor , to someone else that knows -- and almost certainly malate -- and almost certainly malate -- and it &apos;s certainly sick -- and it &apos;s not the patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing of products , directly to people like me and you , that if you think about it doesn &apos;t make any sense , given that we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why do we advericize them ?
The answer is that they want you to call the doctor to ask them to ask them to recipe them .
Something that &apos;s the same as the same as we are ,
And we can reinvent us how many times it .
That means that every morning , at the risking , you have to decide what kind of person want to be .
I &apos;m going to the family and at the matriage , a long time the perspective , almost for anybody , it was that you married the most soon possible , and you start to make the most soon possible possible , and you start to make the most soon possible possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not even what to do after .
So , it &apos;s really really to play .
I teach students very smart students , and I &apos;m 20 percent in less of work than a time .
And not because they &apos;re not very brilliant , not because they &apos;re less diligenty .
but why are they imposing , I mean to wonder , &quot; I should be doing this now ? &quot;
&quot; Do I have to get away ? I have to think before children or the career ? &quot;
They &apos;re rogative interrogation .
And they &apos;re trying to answer these questions , even though this implica not to complete the tasks and not to get a nice voice to my own .
And they really have to do it . They &apos;re important questions .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , as Carl subjects , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , by the Hotel Randolph .
And the parentententesesesthetic , and I don &apos;t tell anybody where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use me .
What does this mean , this incredible freedom of choice that we have to continuously deciding , continuously at any moment , if we have to work or not .
We can go to the son playing calcium , with the mobile phone in a pocket , Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , typically , on the knees .
And even though they &apos;re all spends , every minute we see our son to roving the game , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; I need to answer this ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this ? I have to email this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is no , it makes the experience of your own son very different than what it would be in other conditions .
So , any part we look at , small things , and big things , and the materials and lifestyle , life is a question of choices .
And once the world was this : Whereas there were some possibilities , but it wasn &apos;t all about choice .
The world of today is , dilemma is : The dilemma is , &quot; Is it good thing good or denial ? &quot;
The answer is .
The positive layers we all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative .
All this is really , two negative effects of people .
The first , paradoxally , is that produced paradoxysis that it products paradoxysis that it makes paradoxysis , instead of liberation .
With a lot of options , you get to do it .
I give you a significant example : a study of volunteer in the volunteer .
A colleague had access to the data data of Vanguard data , the giant funds , with about a million clients .
What she found out is that for every 10 solutions that are offering in more , the percentage of adhesive scenes of two percent .
With 50 to offer you , there &apos;s 10 percent in less than adhesions , when they &apos;re only five . Why ?
Because with 50 funds that choosing , is hardly hard to decide , and choice is replaced to the indomans .
And tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course tomorrow .
You know that it doesn &apos;t just mean that these old work work that they will eat enough money , because they &apos;re not going to have enough money , they also want to say that the decision is so objobs that they also lose the complex funds of work .
They &apos;re not participating , they &apos;re losing up to five thousand dollars for year from work dator , that would be well disposed to the way .
So the parallex is a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think it makes the world like this .
&quot; And to end , for the ethernity : ketchup , maionese or maionese ? &quot;
You want to take the right decision , if it &apos;s for the eternity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the bottom , and they &apos;re wrong with the way .
So this is the first effect . The second effect is that even though we can avoid the parallex and make a choice , at the end , we &apos;re less satisfacts of how we would have been to be with less options that choose .
And that &apos;s why it for several reasons .
One of these is that with many of many people who choosing , if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could do a different choice that would be better . And what &apos;s going on is that the alternative imagined us , you know , you could do a different choice that would be better . And what &apos;s going on is that the decision ,
even when it was a very good decision .
The more choices there are , easier is to displeased any of detail that it is undramatic of the option choice .
And also , there is what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert , it &apos;s very well like the value that we give things to things depends on what we can compare .
From the opposable , when there are many options , it &apos;s easy to represent the alternatients of the option that you have to be less satisfied .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m sorry with all of the ones that are not New York .
But that &apos;s what you &apos;re probably going to think .
There is this couple of Hamptons .
a place of luxury .
It &apos;s all for them . Ot-day day day day day day . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not missing . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , it &apos;s Agust . &quot;
&quot; All my neighbors in Manhattan are away . &quot;
&quot; I could park right in front of the house . &quot;
And it goes to two weeks on the idea that it &apos;s losing -- every day -- the chance of parking -- the parking parking of where it wants .
costo-opportunity , we decrease satisfying on what we have , even when choice was excellent .
And the more the options we have to think , the more attractive characteristics .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things that tells us .
It &apos;s about the time , and maybe of the living slowly .
But the most important point is that whatever you choose , you choose to not do other .
The things that we don &apos;t choose many attractive that they can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : : the growing expectations .
I tried to my skin bought a new jeans .
I &apos;m almost always like jeans .
And jeans were just like , they bought them and dressed them and drestivate on , they were safety , just after you brought them to a whole whole life and they were all well , they started going to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple again when those old were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cutting . &quot;
The committed me , &quot; You want to slim fit , you know , faxed fit ? &quot;
You want them to be certain or with the buttons ? &quot; Stonewashed , &quot; or &quot; acidst &quot; ?
&quot; You want them to strapped ? &quot;
&quot; You know , you &apos;re going to take them ? Bla bla , &quot; Continuate to elencare .
I was sballoon , and after a little bit I could say , &quot; I want the guy that was the only guy , &quot; I was the only guy , &quot; he was , like , &quot; I got all sick jeans , and I got out of jeans , and then out of the jeans , and I got out of the store , I &apos;ve ever had .
It was the maximum . I had the best .
But I was worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse is that with all of that choice , my expectations were , jeans were , jeans were really perfect .
I was minimum , I was minimum . I didn &apos;t expect anything that was just like , but when I saw 100 different , steps , at least a kind of thing that was to be perfect .
What I did was good , but not perfect .
After I was compared to the one I was insatisfaction to the expectations .
The extra options in the life of people don &apos;t make the expectations that are on the excellence of the options themselves .
And this will produce less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing if they realize .
Because if they knew , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more like this .
&quot; He was better when you were worse , &quot; The reason he was better when you were worse is that when you were worse was possible to meet surprises .
So , in the world we live in -- opulent , industrialized citizen , with the perfeion of perfeition -- the most we can hope is that things are at the height of the expectations .
You never surprised to be pleased because your expectations , my expectations , they &apos;ve got ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Baxative &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , &quot; you want it . &quot;
I mean -- small autobiographical moment -- that I &apos;m really married and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t have to do better , I didn &apos;t have to do better , I didn &apos;t have to do better , I didn &apos;t have to do better , I didn &apos;t have to do better , I didn &apos;t have to do better , I didn &apos;t have to do better , I didn &apos;t have to do better , I not
But it &apos;s not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of a couple of jeans when there is just that kind of jeans is that you &apos;re not satisfied , and you ask , why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot;
The world is responsible . What I could I do ?
When you have hundreds of kinds of jeans , and you buy a satisfacfactor , and you ask , who is the responsible , it &apos;s just clear that responsible , it &apos;s very clear that responsible you are .
You could have done better .
With hundreds of variety , you don &apos;t get away .
So when people make decisions , even though the result is valid , they &apos;re feeling insatisfifts and give the blame .
And the last years , depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only , but important -- of this honest waving , of this honest waving , because standard are too .
And when they have to explain this situation think that the blame is .
So the result is that we &apos;re better , actually , we &apos;re better , but we feel worse .
Let me reminds you .
This is the official dogma , what we all get to good and it &apos;s completely fake .
There is no doubt that a little bit of choice than having any of it , but it doesn &apos;t have a lot of choice , and it doesn &apos;t be a lot better than a little .
There is a critical value , magic . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve overcome from a piece of the level where the choices are to make our life .
Now , from a political point -- I &apos;ve got almost finished -- I &apos;ve got to the political perspective , the following .
What it allows all this to the industrial society is wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know , where the problem is not too much choice .
The problem is that they have too bad .
So , the facceness that I &apos;m talking about is a mal-exclusive of modern , reasional society .
And what it does is depressing and angry is : Steve Levitt spoken . Steve Levitt talked about how much the expensive seats are . It &apos;s a money . It &apos;s a spread of money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and dispends , it &apos;s not just that they &apos;re just useful .
I have to be deleteries .
They do . They do us worse .
If a little bit of what we do is that in our society allows choice to be reversed in those where people are too too much possibilities , not just their life to improve but our .
This is what economists call a pareague improvement .
A redistribution of income redistribution of the income redistribution of this , excess that is that tories us .
And to conclude : &quot; Fabull , you can become everything you want . &quot;
You , people of culture , you &apos;re going to think , &quot; What does that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t get anything in a glass . &quot;
&quot; A rantrade imagination , a limited view of the world --
I &apos;m interpretation of this , I was like , at the beginning .
But then , I realized , instead , I &apos;m realized that that that fish the long knows that that the fish knows the long long knows .
Because the reality is that if you missing in frantumes , you &apos;re not going to be able . &quot; You don &apos;t get liberty . You don &apos;t get liberty . You get the paralleap .
If you break the moccia so that you can decrease satisfaction .
You &apos;re going to get the paralysis , and you reduce the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too strange , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of any symbolic symbolic , is a weapon for the inhappiness and I &apos;m going to the rovine .
Thank you very much .
