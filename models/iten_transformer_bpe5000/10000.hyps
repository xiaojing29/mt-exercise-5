Last year I showed these slide slide to show that the artica calving the artica , which is almost three million years of the United States continent , the U.S. U.S. continental continent , and it &apos;s restring of 40 percent .
But in the way that underlying the gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show it in the ice .
The artica glacial calculus is , in a certain sense , the heart of global climate climate climate system .
It &apos;s expanded up and you &apos;re ritira in the summer .
The next slide will be a remarkable required up to the last 25 years .
The loss of the loss are signed in red .
As you see , you &apos;re going to go to the blue box .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter , which is the summer of the summer .
You can see that the cosidder ice , five years or more , it &apos;s like the blood , that &apos;s like the blood , which here is the body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been by so ,
This is a problem because the remarkable waving around the ocean , where there are huge among the ocean , where there are enormous amount of coal , and you can be transformed in the microbes , they &apos;re transformed in the microbes .
I &apos;m going to the total initial atmosphic of global warming , that amount of the way , that &apos;s the amount of it could be double , super-up .
In some proper laghi proper lying in Alaska meters are already going on on the water .
The professored Katey Walter University of Alaska University of Alaska team on a little bit ,
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Lore is well . The question is if we &apos;re going to be that .
This is that this scary scary extra termal surrrich of the Groenland .
This is a regime to the regimes .
He took them never reached the brings .
This is the Kangerlussuademic , in the southern obviest Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea level of the sea sea , here is where the sea the sea .
These are increasing up rapidly .
On the other side of the planet : Antartide , the largest block of the planet .
The last month of the scientists have dicced that the ice is in the negative , and that the Antarccccles on some iunar the Western artide , is particularly particularly in the soulder .
Equal six feet of the actual level of the actual level , like in Groenland .
Suli Himalayas , the third largest block of ice , you see new laghi , which a few years ago were glaciers .
The world &apos;s the world required half of the water .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the water .
The brought is increased .
But when it dimines , the same happens to the water .
In California , the neve in the Sevada is deminuity of 40 percent .
The hyrici are in the crisis .
The previous previous , as you read , they &apos;re grass .
The growing certainly certainly in the world leads to a remarkable increase in the world leads .
The environmental disaster are increasing out to a ritory and without previous .
Four times more than the last 30 years than the last 30 years of the 75 .
This is a remarkable to the whole insustainable .
If you look at the historical context , it can see the result .
In the last five years , we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the corn area of the East Pacific , the Americans , to the U.S. Americans , and on both parts of the subcontinent , where there is a radical dygal impover-oxygen in the ocean .
The greatest cause of global warming , together to the deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of good fossil fuel .
The oil is a problem , and the coal is even worst .
The United States are one of the two countries with more emissions , together to China .
And it proponed to build many other centers .
But we &apos;re seeing a change of direction .
These are the annullayers in the last years and some of the alternative .
And so , there &apos;s a political lave in our country .
The industrial industrial and oil are speso 250 million dollars in the last year to promote coal coal , which is a layer , which is a symptomorrow .
And that &apos;s the picture I would remember something --
I know Natal Natal Tennessee , where I saw , there was a loss of 3.8 billion lights of the coal fairs .
Maybe you have seen the news .
This is the second big flection of the flow of the flow in America .
It &apos;s happened around Natal .
The public use of the Cala of the industrial industrial industrial .
Video : The carbon , &quot; Frosty the carbon or happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and growing our economy .
Frosty the carbon , it &apos;s more clean .
It &apos;s at good price , adorable and the work work with the workers .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The largest society on the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : The Blankenship : I &apos;m going to be clear -- Al Gore , Harry Repuzzy -- not know what they &apos;re talking .
Al Gore : So the Allem &apos;s Prottion of Clima Clima has to launch two campaign .
This is a one of them , a part .
Video : The ALergy : The ALergy : The ALergy : The Somomo :
For this our priority is to invest a big amount of money in a fort , and confused to make public public public public and confused the truth .
In fact , the coal is not sports .
We think it &apos;s a good profound -- it &apos;s also a good profound .
So , you don &apos;t prevent climate change .
Let me go to us .
Video : Attore : Cbone , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
So we &apos;re doing a around a five-looking structure for how coal coal coal coal structure .
Straordinarian ! The machines are a little rumorous rumorose , but that &apos;s the sound of the technology .
The consumption is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology , but the remarkable technology that you see everything .
You have a look at it : this is the mern technology of clean .
Al Gore : Infine , the positive alternative , the positive alternative , and that in the national security .
Video : The America is in the crisis ; the national security , the national security , the climate crisis .
The philo that connected to all our dependence of the fuel fuel , as the coal fuel and oil oil imported .
Now , there &apos;s a new , audacy solution to use it .
Real America : 100 percent of the energy , in 10 years .
A plan to remate the work , and to help us to make us more sure , and to help stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that bastes to solve our problems .
Real America . Scoprite than .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It &apos;s about re-energy energy .
One of the faster ways of brings to take the dependence from comfortable to kill our planet .
Comparsa : The future is here . I feel , the future , a new energy .
Comparty number two : Neggs invest to jump jobs .
Complan : Real America . It &apos;s time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old proverbio African says , &quot; If you want to go to the speed , you go to the speed .
If you want to go back , you go back . &quot;
We have to go , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I did a introduction on LHC .
And promises to reach to back to you to go back to the car .
So , I &apos;m the other time , and for the other time , there was not , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever attacked -- 27 miles of circles .
His task is to reach the conditions that were there there to a billion millililiondest of the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
This is simply environmental .
This is the car under Ginevra .
I have to the rhy-Big Bang Bang in the rilevators .
This is what I work . This is called ATLAS -- is the 44 feet and has a diameter diameter diameter .
This is a picture of ATLATLAS in building so you can see the proportions .
The 10 secember of the last year we have acceso the machine for the first time .
And that photographed by ATLATLAS .
It was because of immense of immense in control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first fashion particles that he had done all around the LHC , going to go into the well-HC , and deliberately , with a part of the HC , and spread particles in the right-vast .
In other words , when we see that this picture the 10 secret , which the car worked , which the car works , which is a big vitty .
I don &apos;t know if it was that he was going to be able to do that , when somebody went on Google and vids that the page was this .
That means we &apos;ve had a cultural impact beyond that scientific impact .
It &apos;s just a week later , it was a problem with the car , to just these films here -- these philes .
These files are 13,000 ampampampating when the car works works at the same same .
Now , the technical between you will look at the philes and they &apos;ll say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . &quot; I &apos;m philes too good . &quot;
And instead can do that because they &apos;re very cold to become the depends .
So , at least 271 degrees , to a nurer temperature to the space between stars , these files can bring that current .
In one of the giant of the SC , the magneti in the LHC , there was a fair of factory .
So the philes are going to be slightly , and the 13,000 ampamping up a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , that &apos;s more impressive if you think that these magnetworks more than 20 tons , and that they moved from about 30 feet .
It &apos;s a danneat about 50 magnetic magnetic .
We had to task them , what we did .
We repristed and travel .
They &apos;re now back to all the underground .
LHC will be new well-HC will be going to be new .
We &apos;ll go it , and we expect to get the data or the lighting or the light-, and continuing so our adventure to find what the universe are in the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents , these reaching dibacked on the value of science and engineering engineering . It &apos;s easy to confuture .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s so hard , I think that &apos;s the value of things like LHC .
I &apos;d like to conclude with words of a Inglese , Humphrey Davy , which , I guess , in the inutionary , and he said , &quot; No , &quot; No is a chael Farch . He said , &quot; No is a dangerous for the progress of human mind , which the progress of human mind , which the ideas of the ideas of the ideas are definitely , which is not mysters , which we don &apos;t have the new monks are , and that our our monke-on are not in .
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to rethink when you , you &apos;re playing with children , play the morning .
While you &apos;re able to get them and to make them , and you know , and they learn them , and they learn to think and solving problems and solve problems and manipulating space .
The spacal argument is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , by the information that inspiring from the useful of our interaction with physical objects , together to my Jeevan Kalithi , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalii , I started to ask me , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of the mouse as a computer , instead of having the roughly a digital , we can move on a little , potential , which is , the hands of the hands of the hands of the hands of the hands of the hands , with both hands of the hands of the hands ,
and it &apos;s it to our pleasure ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the Siftable .
In few words , a Siftable is a big interactive computer , as a biscraped biscraped .
In few words , a Siftable is a big interactive computer , as a biscraped biscraped .
You can move with the hand , they can see it with your hand , you can see it , &quot; and they have a wireless and they have a wireless radio .
But in the other , they &apos;re physicists , like the morning , you can move it up .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem ecosystem to manipulate the digital information to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physical , and they &apos;re aware of the movement , some of others , and as they become more physical , and as they become more physical , and others , as we can explore new and fun and fun fun and fun and fun people of interaction .
I &apos;ll try to do with some simple example .
This Siftable is configurated to show the video : if you &apos;re going to show the video : if you &apos;re going to get it so , if you &apos;re going to get up on the other hand back .
These are interactive to you are aware of the other .
If you shouldn &apos;t them , they &apos;re interested in what it is around .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can agitate a little bit .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can agitate a little bit .
They also have their inclination and inclination .
We found that one of the interesting interesting interesting implications of the interaction was that we can use the data , to put a color on the data , to just a bunch of the color as if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurates like you can see it for the color , where you &apos;re going to use it .
and I can use it to put them for the color in the central , where you &apos;re going to get it .
If we can get too , we can get a little bit of it .
And I &apos;m also beings , as the opportunity to open , like the languages , the mathematics and logic , where people can try things quickly , and see the results , and see the results of the results , and see the results of the immediately .
Now , I &apos;m --
This is a Fibonacks that I do with a equations of equations .
Here we have a game of words that is in the middle of Scarabewoggle and Boggle .
It &apos;s basically , to every turnal letter -- in every Siftable , Pressessessessentially , to every Britable , and as you &apos;re trying to compose words , and while you &apos;re trying to comfortable words him control on a dione-dione-ftable .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you have a new set of letter and new set of letter and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the children came in in the Media Lab , I did it in a video .
They liked up a lot of them .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of apply , you don &apos;t have to give people many instructions .
You just say , &quot; You know , &quot; How many words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s the other people that try .
This is our moon , the most young tester , there &apos;s the right .
It was actually wanted to impleasure them .
They were just the morning , for him .
Now , that &apos;s an application of a interactive careful careful .
We wanted to build a tool for the appreneurance of the languages . He &apos;s Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , solving the Sifty , they associated with them .
It can put new characters in the scene , solving the Sifty , they associated with them .
Here &apos;s , you &apos;re doing the sun .
Video : The Sun is sister .
David Merrill : Now he took a treatment in the scene .
Video : The treatment treatment .
Bel work ! You !
So you shit the Siftable and put them out of the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing your story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a story with the final open , and it can decide him as you can decide him as you can decide him as you can decide him as you can decide him as you can decide him as you can decide him as you can decide him as you can decide him to the end .
DM : It &apos;s a story with the final open , and it can decide him as you can decide him as you can decide him as you can decide him as you can decide him as you can decide him as you can decide him as you can decide him as you can decide him to the end .
Video : Vola , gat .
DM : The last example I have the time to show is a tool , made of recent , to go and execting music .
It &apos;s a tool , which is a tool , to go and extremely and execting music .
The Siftable here are on the ground , and the bacteria .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose to get .
You can put these sounds in a sequence of a compose to your pleasure .
And it simply touch it a sound and a sequence . &quot;
These are actually you can control from the vivious , as the reverse and the filter .
The acks to a particular sound and then incline for the travel .
And then there are general as time and volume , which is applied to the whole sequence .
Let &apos;s look like .
Video : We &apos;ll try and put a base in two Siftable , &quot; We &apos;re going to put it in a series , the we adadded up a series , we add another basic .
I &apos;m going to put a line .
Video : Now I &apos;m going to adadded of the percussions --
Video : And I &apos;m going to put the glass on the bacteria , so I can control the effect from alive .
Video : DM : I can reach the entire sequence of inclining the whole sequence of the time .
Video : I &apos;ll add the filter to the bottom to the bottom to give more expression .
Video : DM : I can reach the sequence of &quot; to fly . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to be planning , but I can sudden , and make it more corta or more corta .
And now , I can finally , I can smoking the entire sequence of the left the Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new interfaces as as they work as our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this time , and also some possibility that we &apos;re trying to bring out the lab .
The concept I want to transmate is that &apos;s coming this new generation of objects to interact with digital media , which will be going to be information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the now to talk to you with all .
I &apos;m a scritual score .
I &apos;m going to be my profession , but it &apos;s more than that .
It &apos;s also love and the bedying of my life .
And I don &apos;t look like that can change .
But , he said , something particular happened in my life and my career , and in my career , which led me to re-up with this work .
The particular thing is that I &apos;ve been written this book , this biography called &quot; Mangia , Prega , Am , &quot; which , in some reason I was going to get in the world and become a great sensational , to some right , and he got a big sensational sensational , bestyestler .
And the result is that everywhere you &apos;re going to get people to me like I was conducted .
It &apos;s true -- conducted .
They &apos;re all right now , and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t have fear to do better ?
You don &apos;t see it fear to write for all life without that we could be able to create a book that can be able to someone ? &quot;
that can be importing someone ? &quot;
It &apos;s roughly , you know .
But it could go to , I remember that I remember that I remember that I was a little bit more than 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was a scritual -- I was a scritual .
I &apos;d be inherently against the same reaction .
And people say , &quot; Don &apos;t that I would not be successful ?
You don &apos;t fear that the reflection of the reflection ?
You don &apos;t fear to do this for all of life without anything that else came out and to die on a cumb cumb .
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
I fear , I fear of all those things .
I &apos;ve always had painting .
And I also fear of many other things that people can &apos;t ininary .
As the alga and other things spaves .
But , as I thought , and I would ask me , and I ask me , why ?
Is it a rational rational ?
It &apos;s logic that everyone wealth to be spaving by a work that you &apos;re born to do .
But what is that particular in the implant implant to make us nervous about the mental health mental health , as a other careers do not ?
As my father , for example , he was a chemistry and not remember one one one one time in his 40 years of activity in the activity that he was asked if he had painting to be engineer ?
He never -- that stuck us was never -- that stuck us ?
It didn &apos;t work so , you know ?
Onestly , the chemicals like a group don &apos;t have any of course , in the security , and they &apos;re making the depressed depressive .
We have enough this reputation , we have enough this reputation , and not only creatives , but creatives of all this , we have this reputation of initially inally .
And it &apos;s not going to look at the tristes of the magnifts of the magnifts that , only in the 20th century , they die and often for them .
And the ones that are not suicked to be really unicated by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before he said , &quot; East , first interview said , &quot; Every book book has been killed a little bit more &quot; A wonderful amazing air .
But we don &apos;t get it when we feel that we heard these things so long that we &apos;ve heard these things so we &apos;re all interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and the suffering are in some ways of the art , and the end , you will always be to the angosccccope .
And the question I want to take all here today is : you agree with this idea ?
It &apos;s right to you that -- because it also look at a little bit of distance to me not well for anything that I would be able to me .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s dangerous and I don &apos;t want to see the perpetuated pepeated in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better encourage our great creative creative minds to live .
And I know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start to get that feel that I was a little bit of the circumstances , especially to the circumstances in my career .
I &apos;m really -- you look , I &apos;m pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I still have about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything I &apos;ll write about it right now , and it &apos;s going to be juded by the world as the work that he was in my book .
I &apos;ll be to be a little bit , because we &apos;re all more or less friends here -- it &apos;s likely to my spread .
Oh , Gesus , which thought !
You know that &apos;s the kind of thinking that leads a person to blow in the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would continue to do this work that we do this .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it seems to me , after many reflect , which the way to work to keep writing is to create a protective psychological psychological , right ?
I have to find a few security of me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural natural natural beings on which is written , and I tried to do it . And I was trying to look through the time , trying to see through the time , trying to see if they could have some of the best ideas and more sane and more sane ideas to see if they could have some better ideas and more sane ideas and more sane and and , I was trying to see how to do it to do it .
how to help people who are creative people to deal with the inherent risks of creativity .
And that research took me to the ancient Great and ancient Rome .
You go because I &apos;m a gira and then I go back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity selling creativity sely ?
It was thinking that creativity was the spirit of the beddying and that sell people from a few people from a few surprising and unknown , for reasons and unknown .
The grew us called these spirites .
Soccurriculum , he believed to have a demand that elargive to a long long .
The Romani were the same idea , but they called the spirit of the spirit without body .
The Romani is great , because the Romani didn &apos;t really think a genius was somebody particularly smart .
They believe a genius was that a genius was this kind of divine that he had to live in the study of a neighborhood , a little bit like the eleven-to-up , and they sell it out to the nose of the artist and to model the outcome of that work .
Here &apos;s the eonal -- here is the distance of which is the distance of the way -- that &apos;s that psychological deeptional psychological results from your work .
And everyone knew that was so that it was so that it worked , right ?
So the artists were protected by certain things , like , for example , the too narcism , not ?
If your work was excited to you could not get it and all the meritness , everyone knew that they were helped by this genius .
If your failed work , it was not all your hot , it was not all your hot , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a incapable .
And so the people who conceived the creativity in the West for a long time .
Then the Raissance came and everything , and it changes , and nacaath-one idea of the universe and the mysters and the mysters and the mysters and the mysters and the mysters that desk the divinity .
This was the principle of the rational humanity and people started thinking that creativity came from the idivided hyduo .
And for the first time in history , you know , it &apos;s actually reference this or that artist to a rather than a person with a person in the genius .
And I have to say , I think it was a big mistake .
I think I &apos;m allowed to put someone , a simple person to believe that a recipe of the source , and the essence and the sisters of all the mysters , and unknown and eternal and eternation and eternal a lot of a lot of the phones .
It &apos;s like to ask someone of ingoating the sun .
It &apos;s detains and detains all these ingestible ingestible to all these ingestible to the performance .
And I think it &apos;s been this pressure to have the artists in the past 500 years .
And if that &apos;s true , and I think that &apos;s the question , and I think it &apos;s the question , and now ?
We can do it diversity ?
You go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can &apos;t have to be able to dog about 18 minutes .
And there is probably people between the audience that solged would be a scientific remarkable , and you &apos;re probably going to do people are in the notion of their own projects .
It &apos;s probably not convinced you all about this thing .
But the question I &apos;d like to take is -- why not ?
Why don &apos;t you think about this way ?
Because it has more sense of anything that ever ever heard to explain the explanting explanting of the creative process .
A process that I &apos;ve ever tried to do something -- so , that &apos;s basically , all here -- you know , it &apos;s not comfortable .
And , in fact , it can sometimes look completely paranororous .
I did this inherently with the wonderful poeer Ruth Stone , which has now 90 years , but that was a little little bit for the whole life and said that during the Virginia , and he said that during the Virginia , and he felt it &apos;s in the fields , and I felt it &apos;s going to be in the landscape .
He said that it was like a fragorous fragorous .
And that was going to ring to go from the landscape .
It felt it , because it was tremendous to do the ground under his feet .
He knew that I had a single thing to do to do that point and it was , &quot; to do that . &quot;
And he was going to go to home and it was initiated by this poem , and it would not have to take a piece of paper and a math , and it &apos;s pretty quickly , and it &apos;s going to collect and it on the page .
Sometimes I couldn &apos;t be fast , so correcent and correcent and correal and correal poem and correfuel and she would continued to be able to go to the landscape and she would continued to roled through the landscape , trying to be able to be able , and he would continued to be race through the landscape , and he would continued to be a little bit ,
Then there were those times -- this piece of not the size , I &apos;ll never -- there was the moments that was almost perdating , right ?
So , he was going to be looking for paper and the poem and the poem and he was it in the way that was going , and he said , which was like you halling , and he said , that he was like hallunged with the other hand and the office .
He was the poem from code and the hot and the crising in his body and the transcating on the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page , and the contrary , from the last word to the first word to the first word .
So when I feel it -- it &apos;s pathesk , it &apos;s exactly the ugual process .
Not all my creative process -- it &apos;s not a conducucucucture .
I &apos;m a mud , and my way to work is ; I wake up to the same orar the same orar every day and to go up and go up and go up up .
But even I , in my testestables , I have striscized against that thing , sometimes .
And I think it &apos;s also many of you the han made .
You know , even though the work and ideas that they came to a certain source , I could not know it .
And what is that ?
And how can we relate to it in a way to do not lose the head , but , rather , rather , which is it &apos;s going to be well-up , which is we can be sat .
And as I &apos;m about , the best example of the Saits Tom Waits , which I interviewed in a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life is the incarnation of the neighborhood , trying to control , to try to check , to get these species of impulse , to ask these species of impulse .
But then invecchive , and he was a day , and a day he was driving on a Los Angeles , and he was going to change all .
He was going to be fast and all of a sudden , and it &apos;s a little framedia , which comes in his head as a inspiration , and it wants to hot , and the wants , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the desider , but it doesn &apos;t know how to get it .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , it &apos;s not a math , it &apos;s not a recorder .
So I started to feel this old ange of old ange , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to be able to sweet , and I &apos;ll be obliver .
I &apos;m not enough enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to go to the panic , you &apos;ll stop .
He took the whole mental process and made something completely new .
I &apos;m just going to look at the sky and he said , &quot; I &apos;m not driving ? &quot;
&quot; Ti seems to write a song right now ?
If you really want to be a more more than one time when I can take care of it .
Altrain , you go to importantly something else today .
I &apos;m going to disturbing Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his process works after that .
Not the work , it was still hard to be hard to be .
But the process , and the fish fishing fishing that was that attorniqued when he took the genius , the genius out of him , and the genius that problems and I got it back to where they were doing it back to where it was done , and I was done that they didn &apos;t be a thing interorized , and I was taken .
but it &apos;s really a lot of the peculiar , wonderful bizarre bizarre to Tom and this strip and outside that there was not Tom .
So , how I felt that story that story to change a little bit , the way I was working and already saved me a time .
This idea , I &apos;ll save when I was writing &quot; Mangia , Prega , &quot; and fell in a bunch of the disperation that we &apos;re all working on something and we &apos;re working on something and we &apos;re working on something and we can start thinking about something and we can &apos;t start to think that it &apos;s going to be a disaster , which is the worst book .
Not just good , right , right the worst book .
And I started thinking about geping this project .
But then I remember of Tom I talked to the air and I tried to it .
So I got my face on the loscritical and diress my face to a vast angle in the room .
And I said to a high vices , &quot; Sents , what we know that if this book is not going to be good .
because I &apos;m seeing that I &apos;m going to put it all I have , no longer than that .
So if you want to be better , you have to introduce you and you to do your side .
Okay . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know , I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;ll just go to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to please that it was recorded to me to do my side , &quot; because -- at the end is so , OK -- the end is so OK -- the hit &apos;s so , OK -- the end of the North of the people were dance to the dance of the dance and and sacred music that they went on to hours and hours to the lab and and the lab and the lab and the although .
And they were always magnifed , because the ballerini were fantastic .
But every single , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became actually transcending .
And I know what I know , because I know that you have seen you all , in a certain point , a certain point , a performance .
It was like the time you stopped up , and the ballerine walked through a kind of portal and it was not different from the usual , and it was not different from the way , but it &apos;s all halled .
And suddenly , you &apos;re not just like a human human .
But it &apos;s accounted by the divinity of divinity .
And when this happened , I was the people knew what was , the people knew what was , they called her .
They were going to bunch the hands and starts to dog , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curious notes -- when the Main invaser , when the Main &apos;s Spagna , I was this abstract with them and the footprint in the damage , Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah &quot; Oh , I can still hear in the fairor in the flamenco .
In Saign , when a artist is made something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , the hole , Allah , &quot; uncable , &quot; uncure , &quot; uncles , &quot; uncure , and it &apos;s a bunch of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need .
But , the problem comes the day after , for the ballerine , when you wake up and discover that are the 11 in the morning of Martedday and the balling God there is no longer .
It &apos;s simply a mortle with a lot of bad ginocoly , and maybe it &apos;s not going to each other to to that althetic .
And maybe nobody will dog the name of God as a gira , and what &apos;s going to do with her life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most pyelement to make in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so coroscivvent if you can &apos;t believe , advanced the aspects of your being being by you .
But it &apos;s just that you &apos;re given you in the required out of a source of this team of your life that &apos;s part of your life that you have to go to someone else when you &apos;ve fined .
And , you know , if we think it &apos;s all about it .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s certainly like I thought , for a few months in the working working of the book that I &apos;m going to be a dangerous , the dangerous dangerous , and it &apos;s danger , and it &apos;s been able to the great successful .
And what I have to have to tell me when I feel electrized with this is , not to have paar .
Not the button . It &apos;s just your work .
Continua present-up to your side , any one can be .
If your work is balling , you &apos;re balling .
If the divine , you &apos;re genius to get a little bit of left , to take some kind of wonderful , for a only time through your forces , then &quot; Ole ! &quot;
And you do it , you do it .
&quot; You &apos;re Ole ! &quot;
I think it &apos;s about it , I think it &apos;s taught to teach it .
&quot; Ole ! &quot; to you know the same , even for the human love and testestables to you get up .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As I &apos;ve already talked about some of these things about the human genome , about what can significant and discovery of new genome .
Now we &apos;re starting to the new time : we started to digital biology and now now now to digital code and now we &apos;re going to go into a new fase of biology , design and synthesizing and synthesizing life .
We &apos;ve always tried to take big questions .
&quot; What is the life ? &quot; That &apos;s something that many biologists think they have to try to understand varards .
We tried different approaches , reducing it to minimi terms .
We &apos;re digital by almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to move from the analogical world of the biology in the digital world .
Now , we ask , we can regenerate the life , or to create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycopor genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome genome , which is the little little bit of the lab that can authoreplication in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome for crearne one more small .
We &apos;re able to eliminate a hundred genetic genes of the genes of the 500 than the genes are here .
But when we &apos;re a look at his map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our .
It &apos;s simple . This is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one one at the time , it &apos;s very imlikely that this can bring to a living cell cell .
So we decided that the only on to design reduce it was synthesize this cromosome in a way to get to change the components to take some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the avoid we started the synthesize a cromosome ? &quot;
Can the chemistry of producing these great molecules that never could do before ?
And , in case , we can make a cromosome ?
A chromosome is simply a chemistry of chemical material .
The speed that we &apos;re able to digital life is growing on the exponential life is growing .
Our ability to write the gene code , instead , designing , but it &apos;s going to be able , but it &apos;s better .
And our most recent results the results of a exponential curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process has required many passages , starting with a bioethic review before the first experiments .
But we found that synthesize DNA is very hard .
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that producing little segment of DNA , of the long , and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the most errors are .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these framents and corret the mistakes .
And that was our first attempt , to start with digital genome information of Phi 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the framments , acting the correction of the mistakes and get a molecule of about 5,000 letter .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material and we put it in the bacteria , and we put it in bacteria , and they started reading this genetic code and produced the viral particles .
The virals , then you &apos;re reported by cells , they &apos;re back and they destroyed the Ecles .
I talked about recent with the oil industry , and they say that they have certainly to have this model .
They have more than you have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build his same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in the big things .
We wanted to build the whole cromosome .
I &apos;m more than 580 middying to the gene code .
So we thought we &apos;ve thought we built it in the cassasses of viruses , so that we &apos;re going to change the components of a cell cell cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the way , in 1995 , the way .
We found , resequence , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence that original sequence never been able to do it .
A part of the process is designed cheap , you know , you &apos;re going to get out with all the other segments to 50 to 50 to make the little little little bit of the time that working together .
We &apos;ll take elements in the unics here .
You &apos;ve probably read that we &apos;ve read that we put the fliver .
Think it : We have a genetic code on four letter , C , C , Good and T.
Three of those letter , and they put together codificate about 20 amminoacids , and there &apos;s a specific specific order to each amminds to .
So we can use the gene code for words , frass , thoughts .
What we did at the beginning is authograin .
Some people have deluser been deluser .
We designed these segments to potential them simply to do it with the fairly fying them .
There are a filled that they refing them and put them together .
And we started assembling of parts , starting with the parts , by five to seven mid-letter , and unendles in a way to form to form it segments in the way to get to 72 mila to the letter .
So , let &apos;s take these segments in the abundance , so we can try to create a very very much rooms -- as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , that &apos;s the tabellon a player .
When we get to these very long segments , more than 100 mid-based segments , not grow more directly in Ecles .
You get to the molecular biology tools .
So we &apos;ve considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called the homologist called the homologist , which in biology , which in biology is able to unfying the segments .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinoccurrics , it can absorb three million rad rad .
You can see in the high high hours like his cromosome is destroyed .
In 12 , 24 hours is reassembled exactly how it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be a completely secure .
They can live under the vast .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life in space , and you can see new environments of water .
In fact , NASA showed that this is showing that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built these processes , just using the lieven-making design appropriate design .
The lievil absemble them .
This image is not been taken with a electronic microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It &apos;s a molecule that we can see it with a slightly light .
These are the photos that copring a period of six seconds .
This is the publishing that we did a little time ago .
I &apos;m more than 580,000 letter code .
It &apos;s the largest molecule of a defined structure ever created by man .
It &apos;s a high molecular molecular five-to-million .
If you &apos;re pass it with a careful careful 10 without spaces , you would like 142 pages to transcating this genetic code .
Now , how do we do that ? How can we act it ?
Of course , you take a virus is a game .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when they &apos;re using bacteria .
It &apos;s more simple when it is eucariote cells like our : you can just get the nuclear nuclear and put another , which is basically the clonation process of clonation .
In the archaea , the archaea is instead of integrated inside the cell , but we &apos;ve been able to do a trapistring of a chromosome from a cell to a cell cell to another and activer it .
We clean a cromosome cromosome .
The two are different as men from mins .
We added some gene in the more way to decide that you can get to take this cromosome .
And then the buttoldest with the falls in a way to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell is amazing -- and you &apos;re learning about it , and you &apos;re learning our graphical graphical romosome is gone inside the cell .
And we were thinking that we could not go beyond , but we tried to get it in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that tantisisim species have added a second or a third chromosome from some part , and I &apos;m going to a thousand new tricks to the species .
So , who think about evolution as a gene , and it &apos;s not really really understood of biology .
There are the literacy called &quot; required of restrip that to say the DNA .
The cromosome was in the cell , it was not a one .
The phones using the phones that we have pushing it .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other cromosome , and he recognized the pisticated , and we got it with only the cell cell and the new cromosome .
It became blue because of the genes that we have a bunch of genes that we put it .
And in a short short time , all the characteristic of a species are going to be lost , and it &apos;s transformed in a new species , based on the new software that we put in the cell .
All protects are changed , the proteins are changed , and when we read the gene code de exactly what we &apos;ve spent .
Now , that could look like the genetic alchemy , but it &apos;s going to change the DNA , we can change things in a very substantial way .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that here is not genesis -- but of progress to start by three million years and a half of evolution , and I said that maybe maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the explosion Cambrian explosian version of the Cambrian .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s enough obvious when we think about our necessity .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion and a half billion people to 9 billion in the next 40 years .
Right to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now , there are three people on the planet for each other in 1946 ; in 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re getting problems now to find food , water and clean water , medicine and the water , and gas , gassub for six billion people .
It &apos;s going to be more to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion barret billion coal , more than 30 billion barret .
That means 100 million barle day day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to reach them , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
We have to find all the CO2 emission of CO2 emission from these materials that fins in the atmosphere .
At the time , thank you to the scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the design components for the future .
The electronic industry has only a dozen dozen , and think about how many different things came out .
Our limits here are principle data , and the same thing about biological and the imagination .
Now we have some techniques , because of these methods , and able to create what we call genomics combinatory genomics .
We can be able to build a big robots that can produce a million cromosomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomes .
Think of the processing 20 million genes or to try to optimize the process to produce the processes , new vaccines , new vaccines , new vaccines that in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s simply a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemical production or chemical production or the energy production of ethc vaccines .
This is an old istic of some software programmed programmed that we &apos;re working to be able to sex and design species at the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how they &apos;re going to be .
We know exactly what is their gene code .
We &apos;re focusing on the fourth generation .
You also saw you can see that extract etanol from the grain was an experiment .
We have the second generation and third generation of the generation that will use enough to zero-sum ck in the cloan or different kinds of butanle ,
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increase the cost of food and limlimest-up and limlimited food in the matter , which we &apos;re working to design cells that can reach this goal , and we think we can achieve this goal , and we think that we can achieve the first fourth generation in about 18 months .
The solar light combined with CO2 is a metodo--- but in our discoveries in the world , we found different metods .
This is a organism that we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
You &apos;re going to be in the ocean , about 2,500 feet of the well-falls of the water .
They believe meters from CO2 using hydrogen molecular energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand whether we can indog CO2 , which can easily be transported by your dots , to be driving that CO2 in coal , to drive this process .
So , we think we might be able to increase what the question of what the question is , &quot; which is the life is &quot; is , we have the destruction of the chemistry of the entire oil oil industry .
So if you can &apos;t do it by TED , where you can &apos;t it TED , where you can &apos;t it ?
It would be a main source source of energy .
We &apos;re working for the same methods to create vaccines .
You saw this year with the influence , we &apos;re always back to a dollar , and with a dollar in the least when it &apos;s about the vaccine .
I think what you can change in the anticipe .
Here &apos;s how the future it could start look like , now , the tree of evolution , accell-evolution , accell-brings , and inend cells , arches , and inend cells .
We &apos;re so much to make people .
Our goal is to do enough to make enough to live enough long to try to do it . Thank you very much .
Before I &apos;ll show you , the most quickly , the most quickly , some work , the new technology that we took to the Microsoft in the following a year . This is Seadragoning almost a year ago exactly . This is Seadragon .
This is a environment where you can interact is to the local level that remoon with a huge amount of visual data .
So here we &apos;re seeing many gigabyte of digital photos with a kind of zoom and continuous , for a fast panoramic , and we &apos;re seeing the images as we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these are great collect of data or images .
Most of the gee getic photographs , but this for example is a deaths of the Big Congress , and reentral in the gamma gamma 300 megaps .
It &apos;s not a difference because the only thing that limits its presents of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time . It &apos;s also a very flessible architecture .
This is a whole book , of course , it &apos;s not images .
This is the Casa desolate of Dickens . Every column .
To show you that it &apos;s just about the textt and not images , we can do something like that , to see that that &apos;s a real representation of the text , not a picture .
It &apos;s a little artificial way to read a electronic book .
I don &apos;t get it .
This is a more realistic example . This is a number of The Guardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a seat .
And it really gives you a pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading the real face of a daily , which is to a daily nature , which is to a multiple kind of a half .
We also made something with the corner of this number of the Guardian .
We created a public bunch of the high resolution -- much more high-resolution -- and we put it in a normal -- and we put it in the content .
If you want to see the characteristic of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific patterns .
And that really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
And I hope that this means that this means to put people in the way to put up up and other porcheries , I was not to have to be necessary .
Of course , the maps is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don &apos;t want to lose time , if we don &apos;t want to say that we have to give you in this field .
These are all the strade in the U.S. Sovovovovovoved a geospace picture of NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually from the Web ; you can go to the Web ; you can go to see .
This is a project called Photosynth , which fight two different technologies .
A is Seadragon and the other is a visual search to the Savely , a student of the University of Washington , with the help of Steve Seitz Szelki .
And it &apos;s from the Web , I &apos;m going to deal with Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from another image to another image and have this kind of experience to resolution .
But the actual column column , the actual skills here has actually a meaning .
The algoritms of the computer visualization have recorded these images together , so that correspond to the places that the reduces -- all the neighbor to the Montagagagues on on the Montagagagement -- they &apos;re going to see the elements of a slightly , and these things are all the spread . This is a re-stable set of the things are all the spspatial level .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more spread .
I want to go directly to one of the original data of Noah-ahs -- and this is a very very evident of Photosynth that we &apos;ve done to work for the first time the time the summer -- to show you what I think is the key key key to the technology , the Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily evident to the environments that we put in the web .
We had to worry about the legal aspects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of the Nobody Dame images took from Flickr . Bast . Bast NoDame Dame Bast in Flickr and you get images in the maglit and so on . Olickr and so on . Oach of these conconstant image that &apos;s discovering to this model .
So they &apos;re all images from Flickr and they &apos;re all connected to spatial level in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this simple way .
You know , I never thought of fining to work for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratificent to get this kind of accounts here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different kinds of photocaming : from those cell cell cell phone , and a significant number of these professional phones , and they would put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to try to try those more strip .
A lot of the block is a lot of them , etc .
And in the part of the here is a series of photographs -- eccolumn .
This is a poster of Nobody Dame recorded .
We can go from the poster of the physics of this environment .
The essential is that we can do things with social environment . This is taking data from the entire memory , by the entire memory , from the entire memory , from the point of view -- and connected those data together .
All those pictures become connected together , more than the sum of the parts .
You have a model of the entire emerge that .
Think about this as the prolder of Stephen Lawler on Earth virtual Earth .
It &apos;s something that grow in complex complex complex complex as people are using it , and the people who are using it .
They &apos;re marced with metaps with a meadow other people .
If you &apos;re the idea of contrast , you all these willing to all these people say , my photic photic cattattedge of NoDame suddenly , and I can use the kind of ingress , and I can use the picture of ingress in in that space , in that metaphor to that metaphor the picture .
Of course , a result of all the same thing is that virtual models of every interesting part of the Earth , and they &apos;re willing to the airplane and satellite images and satellite images , but from the memory memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I figured ? What &apos;s your software is going to feel like a certain point , in the next years , in the next years , all the photographs , all the photographs to everybody in the entire world will be printed with ?
BAA : Yeah . What is doing is that is actually to discover .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , you &apos;re going to be , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the remarkable information seant that many of these images can be .
As you do a research research on the Web , you &apos;re digit , and the text on the Web has a lot about pictures of information to the pictures of the picture .
Now , what happens if that picture is connected to all your photos ?
So the amount of interconnection and the quantity of the wealth that was really huge . This is a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really amazing .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the lights when you traveling and one of the didimented dimented the walls is that that can live between who who have no forforeigate antic , between the wind , who have the past in the wind , and touch it in the wind , and you can get it in the wind , and you can get it in the wind , and it &apos;s the people who are in the wind , and the people who who are the anti-to-based .
And the way we think that the sciamani Jaguar travel Jaguar , or the mites , or the mites of the Inuit &apos;s still cold , or the Himalayas , the budget , or the budget , and the budget the &apos;s respect of the Dharm , to remember the central of the Dharm , and that the idea that the world we have no matter of the way , but it &apos;s just a model of reality , but it &apos;s actually , it &apos;s just a model of reality ,
The result of a particular set of choices that our stirpe has done , well or bad , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share the extra actual actual actual actual actual actual strikes .
We all all all of the projecting .
We are overwhose ose initiation .
We have to deal with death , so we don &apos;t care about it , and we &apos;re allowing it and whaling --
We all have an art .
What it &apos;s the particular is the ritory ritory of the song , the ritory of the dance of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that the Penan of the Borneo , or the follow of the Voodoo , or the Haiti , or the guerriers of the desert Kaign Kaign , the Curst of the Ande , or a camp in the Sahara .
He was my journey of the journey in the desert a month ago , or a walls in the values of the War , the Mest , the mother of the world .
All these populations are teaching us that there are other ways of existing other ways of people to think , others are moving in the world .
And if you reflect a moment , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
Insiant , the miriades of cultures are creating a spiritual race and cultural cultural life that &apos;s been important for the planet and it &apos;s important for the planet as the biological race .
And you can think about this cultural race , as a ethnososphere and you can defined the total orders of all the concepts , and inspiration , ideas , inspiration , ideas , inspiration , and inspiration in being by the human imagination from the human alba .
The etnosphere is the great paintment of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbox of what we are and what we can be as a kind of inquisitive .
And because the biosphere is a very , as well as well as a successful way .
Nobody biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all the species is or the orest ipotential , because it &apos;s fying , or -- in the most apococalite , in the field of biological diversity -- and you don &apos;t even get a little bit of the most good ipotential -- that of the cultural diversity .
The surance of all that is , of course , the loss .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just compost by a vocabolary or a series of grammaticks .
A language is the spraking of human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle with which the soul of every culture comes in the world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a bunch of the mind , a thought , a ecosystem of the spirituals .
And of the 6,000 languages , while we &apos;re here in Monterey , at least half the people are not most suspended in the ears of the children .
They don &apos;t get to teach children , the which means means , to say , to less than not not something that they &apos;re already death .
What is the most tristes of being a roughly , of being the last one language , of the last one language , the people who don &apos;t have to transmit to the promise or anticipate the promises of the promises ?
This is a few weeks , is the state of someone in the world &apos;s two weeks : every two weeks , every two weeks , a few weeks , and the door with their hot , and the door with a anti-language language .
And I know someone of you will say , &quot; Is it better ?
The world would not a better place if we &apos;re going to leave the same language ? &quot; Benisate , then we talk about all yoruba . Let &apos;s talk about the damage .
Let &apos;s talk about kogi .
You &apos;ll have a sudden what it means means you can &apos;t talk to your language .
I &apos;d like to do a journey through the etnoshere --
a little journey in the spechere to give you a bunch of what we &apos;re lying .
A lot of us dimenticing that when I &apos;m saying , &quot; different ways of existing ways of existing .
Let &apos;s take for example this bimbo Barasana , in Amazony , the people in the Amazony , which credit creation from the dums of the dinner fying from the dinner bound of the boundation of the bunch of the sacrrrice .
This is a people that &apos;s not able to distinguish the blue blue from the green green because the birth birth is identified in the forest , which depends the people .
They have a damage and a language , and a bunch , depend in the language , &quot; exogy &quot; : you have to have a person who talks a different language .
This has the rooms in the past mitological , yet the particularly the particularly , and the particularly the particularly in these families because of the matriririages of the mystery of the mysts .
They &apos;re limited to listening and then they start talking .
Let &apos;s take one of the most interesting tribe with which I lived , the Waorani of Ecuador East , a incredible popular popular people in 1958 .
In 1957 five measured missionar-tail-making mistake error .
They made it down to the top photographs that required them in the top of the willing , and declining that this people in the forest , and they had never seen anything about the bi-dimensional bi-dimensional .
They collect the photos , they took the research , and they &apos;re not going to be a figure and , not by the diavoid , they have killed the five missionar-ble-up .
But the Waorani don &apos;t kill the foreign .
They kill between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by their own .
We &apos;re saved to eight generations and we found two of natural death and when we &apos;ve insisted to know , they took one of them to be invited that one of them was invecing , and then they killed it . And then they killed it . And then they had a remarkable knowledge .
The caccidators were able to recognize the animal animal from 40 pass and recognize the species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assignment to a really interesting task when my professor Harvard , I was asked to go to Haiti to the basic basic secret in the secret of Duvalier and the Tonton Macoutes to make the fairs to make the fairly zomes to make the zoms to do the zomes .
To give a sense to a miracolous sense , I should understand the Voodoo and that Voodoo is not magic .
This is rather a complex view of a complex view of the world .
A lot of interesting interesting .
If I asked you to ask me the great religions , what would you say ?
Cristian anthort , Islam , Ebraism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-S-Saharan Africa has not faith . And instead and the Voodoo is not another one that the distilled of these religious religious religious .
What makes a voodoo is the intense is the intense to the report between life and death .
So the vights are going to hide the spirites .
The spirites can be invocated by the Grands Actually , they respond to the dance of the dance and they replaced in the way that for a short time , and it &apos;s a short active active .
And that &apos;s to that the doodooists like &quot; Vwhite who go to talk about God .
We have to go in the temple and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re posite , is the spirit that you can do it ?
So you &apos;re seeing these amazing events : following voodoo in the state of trance that touch impunizones who touch impunizones in the body when it &apos;s catalyzed in a very exciting state .
And in the people with which I &apos;ve lived the most extraordinary people who lived the Kogi Santa Marta , in the Colombia security in the Colombia security .
I have to have the ancient of the tirangggggers that once they live on the plant plant , the people who are employees , the people who are going to be on the volvolume of the plant plant that you get on the plant plant plant plant .
In a drug of blood , this people who never been conquaint , this is never been conquisised by the spagers .
And in the fact that they have been by a cler , but they were so extraordinary .
The young follow people are brought by families to three or four or four , and live secret in a world , and they live in a world , and they &apos;re standing on the bottom of the glacier .
Two , nine years of the nine years choose to reproduce the nine months of gestation that transating in the mom of the mother , now are metaphor in the LLast Mother .
For this time , they &apos;re acculturated to values , values that previous to their preacious and only their preaciers and the preacious balance , or to say the equilibrium , or to say the ecological equilibrium .
And in the term of this incredible initively required out and for the first time in life , at the age of 18 years , and they see an algrade . And that actively the first butter , when the sun the sun the valuable valuable , when the sun the falls of the beautiful landscape . The prever of it , and he says , &quot; I &apos;m going to go and he says , and he says , &quot;
&quot; Vist ? I said .
It &apos;s amazing . Now it &apos;s a lot of you to protect it . &quot;
They call a lot of the world and they say that we , fratework , we are the colpping of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the indigene and the environment we think of the environment , and the old history of the notion of the notion of the notion of the notion of the notion , which is a bad thing to be to Thoreau and we say that these people in the Earth of us .
The indeed people are not nor no nor ininitional people .
There is no space for these things in the Asmat the Asmat or in the Asmat , but thank you to the time and the rites , but thank you to the time and the rites , they created a mythic mystic of the world , but it &apos;s the conceiver : the concept that the Earth can live because it &apos;s only infected by the human knowledge .
What does that mean ?
It &apos;s saying that a boat Ands of Ande who grow a box that the mountain is an Apu that will be a deeply different and it will be a deeply different and it will have a different relationship with the mountain or that place that you grow a little bit different with the mountain or that a little boy of the mountain or that a rock of rock rock to be scan .
That &apos;s the dimmer of a spirit or a three-mineral is irrilevels .
What is interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Britannics , which the forests you have to be cut .
And that has been a human being different from my Kwakiutl that the forests are the dimate of Hukukukukuk and the bal balls and the bal bal balls that live in the world , the spirites that are going to the Hamsa .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create reality , you can start to understand some of them , you can start to understand some of them ,
I took this picture to the aprile in Amazon narrow .
Maybe some of you have heard about the ayahuash , the most powerful psychoactive psychoactive .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuash is not the potential drugs , but his electric .
On one side , this liant lessons that &apos;s contains a series of Tioline , and hardden hardly , and hardly hallucinogene .
And by trying to the only plan an inform of the caffic smoo , but it &apos;s mythically chose with the family of a bunch of the family of a caffic caffection of the caffection is Psychchchecking .
This plant is a triptamine , very similar to the seriotonine , dimethylyppylypppyypppamine .
If you ever see Yanomomomami pull on for the nose , the substance that they do from a different set of species , you &apos;re going to have a methyllypppamine .
You can get that dust the dust is a little bit like to be disappear by a flip of distoring and land on a sea sea sea sea .
I &apos;m going to get to a professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has been the pisssweet was , with his discovery of the fungi hallucinogens in the &apos; 30 in Mexico .
And I &apos;m my tapes , you can &apos;t have to classificate these triptamine , because if you &apos;re done to tell nobody to be hallucinated .
It &apos;s possible to assume if they &apos;re going to be abunte with other chemicals that denian MAO .
Now , it &apos;s the nice , the Tibeta-coin that liana are injewers of MAO , the same kind of necessary to potential trippping trip the question of the question , in a 80,000 species of plants , how these people do these people are doing these people doing these people are doing these these people who are doing these people who are going to find a chemistry of the size of the size of the parts of the size ?
We use the great eufemism of the evidence and the error of the error , which can be a wealth .
But if we ask the Indians , they &apos;ll tell us &quot; The plants are going to say . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuash , which distinguished in the forest , and that you would get in the same species .
If we ask them how they stopped their tasses to say , &quot; I was thinking about it , &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take the 17 variety in a night of the lands and each other dozens and each other dog .
And with this is not graduate to Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than content the stami .
Now , &#91; applausers &#93; the problem is that also the problem is that also the people who have to have peaks them in the world &apos;s history of the story of our real world , and it &apos;s going to move .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it &apos;s not going to remember for his guerre or its technology , but rather like the time was we stop and abbracing and we used to have a good activity , and we used to accept the mass of biological diversity and cultural destruction of the planet . Now the problem is not the problem .
All the cultures have been involved in a dance for new possibility of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux have no stop to be Sioux when they put it up with the arm and fasted as Americans have no stop to be American when they put it on the horse and hot .
It &apos;s not change or the technology that mines the technology that are minds the power of etnoshere . It &apos;s the power .
The wall wall of the domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you find that these are not destined to disappear .
They &apos;re living living and dynamic in the existence from the existence of the forces that go beyond their ability to adaptment .
And it &apos;s that you have disbosyent in the painting of Penan --
a nomade of Sarawak , in the sest , in the super west , a people who lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now reducing to a generation and now , and the next titution on the rights of the rights , where you can see the river on the lifeed , where the river , where the wasting Cerian Mar Cerian , where the nine Mar Cest Mar Cerial Mar Casian , where the n------or , and the wititit-up , and the witurururururururururururururururururvast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast ast , where the Mar C
You &apos;re ready to reempiting the path the forest .
Or in the case of the Yanomami , are the diseases that have been in the discovery of the world .
If we &apos;re going to go on the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing many research , you &apos;ll see the wall of the political domination .
As you know the genocide , the extinction of a people , is conducted to the universal level , but the etnocide , the destruction of life of a people , not only is to be an announced , but it &apos;s a bunch of development .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of the Tibet until you &apos;re not part of the beginning .
I &apos;ve lost the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in China , the Western China through the Western Tibet , and in Lhasa with a young people , but only come to Lhasn , and it turns out what &apos;s behind .
6,000 monuments in the dust and wwwindow and centers .
1.2 million people killed by the military in the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical at Panchen Lama .
The Chinese means that it was killed to the Chinese invasion .
Suo guy is founded with Sua Santity in Santity , in the diaspora .
Her mother was imprisoned and his cold was to be remarkable .
It &apos;s been brought to hide in a career at the age of two birth , because he didn &apos;t have to live in him .
The sister , which has done the same , it was mitted in the reeducation .
A day has invertised a day , he was a bunch of Mao and , for this transgrsion , was med to seven years .
The Tibet of Tibet can be insopposite , but the spirit of the people is from the people is from the present .
And it &apos;s finally , all you reduce to a choice .
We want to live in the world monocromatic monotony or we want to take the policy world ?
The great anthrologists at Margaret Mead , before he said that his largest bear was that , in our own vision , we &apos;re going to go to this vision in the world , we &apos;ll not just see the whole gamordering of human imagination . And it &apos;s a very limited thinking , but a day day we &apos;ll be able to be able to be able to pert it up to the other possibility that they were more possibility .
And it &apos;s uliant to remember that our species is existed for 600,000 years .
The From Neolitica , which has given us us us us us to have the farmers , which has been socking to the poem of the sciaming , and we &apos;re talking to 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has to be 300 years .
That &apos;s the story not suggests that we have the answers that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to deal with the millenni to come .
When to these myriadi of cultures are asked what human , they respond to 10,000 vices .
And that &apos;s in these answers that we all refing the possibility of being what we &apos;re : a kind of a kind of thing that we &apos;re all the people and the gizes can fit . And there are great moments of good .
I took this picture on the north of Baffin the island of Baffin , when I went to the bunch of the Flaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya story of his grandfather .
The Chinese government is not always been gentile with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to stay our supremate , and we &apos;ve got to give them in the colonies .
The grandfather of this man refuted to go .
The family , I &apos;ll throw his life , he took all the people , and all his actual actual actual actual .
You have to know that the Inuit is not the cold , they can be the cold ,
The pots of the sliters in origins were made of the weight of the walls there .
The grandfather was not in this man didn &apos;t intively intively by the night or the boundation that suffering .
It &apos;s a gattolated , it &apos;s hot the pantalons in the pantage and defecated in their hand . When I did it , they &apos;re conzable , and they &apos;re conzable , and they &apos;re working with a lamamamamed .
He &apos;s got to salive on the dden dying of this caught and when it became solid , he killed a dog .
He &apos;s shopped the dog and created a briddddaughter , and he has created a slited slited another dog is snat on the bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbing , and and and and and and and and and and and
We want to talk about horse with nothing ?
In the aprile 1999 , the Chinese government has reduced to the Inuit , the total area of the largest California and the Texas they together .
It &apos;s their new painting .
It &apos;s a independent territory . Controlder all the resources .
One splendid example of how a natione-state can rererecilivation with his people .
And , to finish , I think it &apos;s rather obvious to the ones of us is in these remote areas of the planet , and they &apos;re not remote .
For someone is home .
They &apos;re presenting sections of human imagination that they &apos;re going to get the alba . And for us all of these children , as the dreams of our children , are being part of the children , become part of the hope .
To end , we have to end , we have to convince that politicians will never be .
We believe that polemical the polemical --
&#91; Applausers are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the better institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month our site . Every month our site .
156 countries are transmate our downnal dog .
Our rescues are lected by millions of people .
Our work is traveling in the ethnosphere to bring our public places in the world , in the way , and it &apos;s a lot of time , and they &apos;re hoping , to be able to the centers of the anthroughout the cenal anthroughout the way the existence in the diversity , and we have to find a life in a pluralyle and we have to find a life in a world , and we have to find a life in the world , and we have to find a life in the way they &apos;re in the way ,
where the saggezes can contribute to our wisdom .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope you &apos;ve heard and provered some connecting , in the case you &apos;re not notice .
I &apos;d like to start with what I call the &quot; dogma official dogma .
The dogma official official ?
The dogma official society of all the industrial society . The dogma official society , &quot; If we want to stay the well-being . &quot; The way to do that is the individual to do it is the individual . &quot; The way to do is that is the individual . &quot;
The reason is , from a side , in fact that freedom is in the fact that the freedom is pretious , essential for human beings .
On the other one is that if we are free , each of us can act to do all of us can act to do what the well-being , no no one that decide in our well-being , no no one that decide in our .
The way to mit is a massive freedom is massive to the choice .
The more choices , the most people have , more libing , and the more is their freedom , is their well-being .
This , I think , it &apos;s so dying in the society that nobody has dredreams of them to put it in a dust .
And it &apos;s also deeply dattached in our lives .
I &apos;ll show you some examples of what progress has been able to be able .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly great .
I hope I put a simple note on the conditions for injump .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without content the 10 variety of olids , the 10 variety of the waving , the 12 acets you can buy a huge number of people who can buy you a huge conducting number of 1555555555555555,000 different people who are 175 .
Here &apos;s the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic store , to buy a stereo : cast , the CD , radio , piastra , radio , piastra , light , light , light , light , light , light , and it &apos;s bought a stereum .
And in this single store store , there is a big number of audio .
We can make six million different combinations using the components that there are in a store .
Bisogna admit that there is a lot of choice .
Other fields : the world of communications .
And once , when I was a child , you could get all the phone services , to the remarkable services , to the mmmmed Bell .
It was a bunch of the phone , it didn &apos;t buy it .
A result of that , in the other , was that the phone is not puzzle .
These times they went .
We have a variety of the phones , especially between phones , especially between phones .
Here &apos;s the phones of the future .
My favorite is that in the middle , MP3 , and I &apos;ll cover the nose of the nose , and forth for the chchchchchchchchchchrich .
If you don &apos;t have seen in the store , you &apos;re very much looking at the house , you &apos;re very much to get .
And what happens is that people come in in the negotives and does this question , what is you know , what is the answer is &quot; No .
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t make a troppe .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the buy of the time , it &apos;s the same explosion the choices .
And the health care : not happening in the United States that you &apos;re going to go from the doctor and the doctor you &apos;re going to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; Okay , we could do A , or B , &quot; A has these benefits and these risks . &quot; Well , they have these benefits and these benefits .
You say , &quot; Dr. hours , what I would do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A has these benefits and these risks , and they have these benefits and these benefits . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebble , &quot; Dr. if you were , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result we call it &quot; authonomy of the malated , &quot; expression that does look like a beautiful thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not that one to move the fish and responsibility of taking decisions from someone who knows something , and the doctor , to someone who knows anything -- and it &apos;s not any of the ided , and so in the ided condition to make a very good news .
There is a huge marketing of products drugs , direct to people like me and you , that if you think it &apos;s not a sense , because we can &apos;t buy it .
But if we can &apos;t buy it , why they advert them ?
The answer is that they want to ask the doctor to ask them to ask them to ask us to change the recipe .
Something that is the fundamental thing is our identity ever is a choice of choice , as you see in this vigning , &quot; We don &apos;t want to forced children . They &apos;ll read their sat at the right time , &quot; we have to invent .
And we can reinventing us how many times we &apos;re going to be able to be .
The thing is that every morning , to the risis , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I &apos;m going to the family and the matrimonium , a long time , and it &apos;s a common , and it was that there was the most presents that you were going to be able to be able , and it was to be able to be able .
The only real choice was with who , not when you know , and not when you know what to do after .
Even day , all it &apos;s really to play .
I &apos;m going to be very smart , and I &apos;m going to do it for a time .
And because they &apos;re not because they &apos;re not because they &apos;re not because they &apos;re not because they &apos;re not because they &apos;re not because they &apos;re not because they &apos;re not not because they are less diligene .
but why are they imposite , you ask , &quot; Do you know , I should be shouldn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; You should be a little bit later ? I have to think before children or the career ? &quot;
I &apos;m interrogative logorants .
And they &apos;re trying to answer these questions , even though this implica not complete the companies that assigns and not to get a good voice .
And they have to really do that .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , as the subject Carl , because the technology allows us to work every day , every day , from every day , from every day , except from Hotel Randolph .
And in the parenting , there &apos;s a coroline , and I &apos;m not going to say no one where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t tell that , because I want to use it .
What means , this incredible freedom of choice that we have to do that , we have to continuously , continuously in every time , if we have to work or not .
We can go to the to-to-bound , with the phone , with the Blackberry in other , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the bylackberry .
And even though they &apos;re all spend , every minute we see that we see our son &apos;s partnership , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; Did I respond to this called ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? I have to abbox this letter ? &quot;
And when the answer is &quot; no , &quot; no , this makes the experience of your son &apos;s partnership .
So , anywhere we look , little things and great things , things and the materials and style , life is a choose .
And once the world was that , that there was some possibilities , but it wasn &apos;t a question of choice .
The world of today is a dilemma is , &quot; Is it a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Sepden is Sepden .
The positive positive layers , we all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative .
All of this choice , two negative effects on people .
The first , paradoxally , is that produced instead of liberation .
And with many options between which choose , becomes very hard to do that .
I &apos;ll give you a significant example : a fairs of flying fairs .
A colleague has been accessed to the Vange , the giant giant society , with about a million customers in 2,000 different companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offerte in the most , the percentage of the two percent .
With 50 source offerts , there is 10 percent in the less than adesions when they &apos;re available ?
because with 50 source of which choose , is bad hard to decide , and the choice is reduced to the injected .
And I &apos;m still in the orchchorks , and I ask , and of course , I &apos;m going to be .
You can &apos;t only mean that these old work from old people who are going to be enough money , because they don &apos;t have enough money , it &apos;s so dostical that lose the source is so dostical source of work .
Not participating , they &apos;re lying to five to five dollars for a year from the dator of work , which would be well be able to versary them .
So the paralive is a result of the result of the most choose .
And I think it &apos;s the world so .
&quot; And to end , for the eternity : ketchup , or a mess ? &quot;
You would like to take the right decision , if it &apos;s for the eternity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and yet the condition .
So that &apos;s the first effect . The second is that if we can avoid the paralysis and to make a choice , to the end , we &apos;re less sweeping with less options of how we would choose .
And that &apos;s this for a lot of reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions of the people who choose one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could make a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us in the hatatch , and the plant reaching the choice , and the plant reduced to the choice of the decision , and the plant required to the decision , and the remarkable , and the one of these is that that that we would be able of the alternative .
And when it was a good decision .
The more choices , there is more easy to be unpleasure than any detail that is insodly insoil of the option .
Instepping , there is what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has been very well stamp as the value that we &apos;re going to do things depends on what we &apos;re going to do .
And the rest , when there are many options , it &apos;s easy to represent the characteristic of the alternative , and to be less sodden , and to be less sodden in the option of the option that you &apos;re going to be choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m going to have all the ones that are not New York .
But that &apos;s what you probably think .
There is this copy to Hamptons .
A luse of luser .
Spia splendida . Otma day day . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not a way . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , maliction is Agust . &quot;
&quot; All my neighbors in Manhattan are . &quot;
&quot; I could parking right in front of the house . &quot;
And it &apos;s spent two weeks on the idea that is perdating -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The costo-opportunities diminuum opportunities for what we have , even when the choice is , and when the choice was excellent .
And the more are options that we have to consider , the most of the acaunteen-opportunities .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
It &apos;s about the time , and maybe of the living living slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you choose , you choose to do it .
The things that we don &apos;t choose many attractive that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : the growing of the growing expectations .
I tried to my skin in the bought a new jeans .
I &apos;m almost always jeans .
And you know , the jeans were just a guy , bought and bought them , and they were sat , and they were sat , just after they brought them a lot of times , they were starting to go to go .
So , I went to buy a new couple of jeans , and I said , &quot; I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
The committed me , &quot; Li wants , you &apos;re going to be fit , fit ? &quot;
You want to do it with the certain hits ? &quot; They &apos;re willing ? &quot;
&quot; Li wants ? &quot;
&quot; See , it takes the bil ? Bla bla , &quot; Continugly .
I was sweep , and after a little bit I could say , &quot; I want the guy to say , &quot; I want to be a idea that was , so for a moment I tried to all the people who were sick , and then they came out of the unknown , with the best plant jeans that I had ever ever ever ever ever ever .
It was the very very much . I got the best choice .
But I feel worst .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worst that I was the whole choice of my waiting , my jeans had to be perfect .
And I was the beginning I was waiting . I didn &apos;t waiting to me anything except when there was a kind of time , but when you saw 100 different , the kind of time , at least a kind of thing , at least a kind of thing to be perfect .
What I had to buy was a good , but not perfect .
After I started that chose to the chose with what I was trying to do in the waiting for expectations .
The added options in the options of the people don &apos;t do that increase the ecretty of the options .
And that will make less sweddisfation , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing if you can see .
Because if they knew it , you don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more to that .
&quot; He was better when he was worst , &quot; The reason it was better when you was worst was able to meet the surprising of the surprised .
In the world we live in the world we live -- opultimate , industrialized addictous , the most of the most of the most we can hope is that things are at the althetic .
You &apos;re never surprised to be a pleasure because your waiting waiting , my waiting , and my waiting , and I &apos;m ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Baxis , &quot; Baxh , &quot; Yes , you want . &quot;
I mean , little authographic moment -- which is really sposite and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I don &apos;t have to do it .
But it &apos;s not always a bad thing .
And finally , a result of the bought a couple of jeans , when there is just that kind of jeans is that when you &apos;re not sodden , and you ask you , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot;
The world is the responsible . What I could do you do that ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a unundressodresh , and you ask you who is the responsible , is the responsible , is the responsible , is the responsible , you &apos;re going to you .
You could make better .
And with hundreds of various various , there are not in the insuccess .
So when people make decisions , even though the result is valido , you feel insodying , and they &apos;re going to be damage and they &apos;re going to cold their own .
In the last years , depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only important , but the important one -- of this waving depression is just that people have been deludent because the standard standard are too alts .
And when they have to explain this situation thinking that the cold is .
So the final result is that we &apos;re better , in the real , but we feel worst .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we &apos;re all to take for good and it is completely fying .
There is no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than I don &apos;t have any any any of the choice is better than a little choice .
There is a critical value , magic value . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we have to have a piece of the level that we have to have to be able to be .
Now , from the political point -- I have almost finished -- I have almost finished -- the notion is the following .
What it allows all this to the industrial society is the wealth material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you &apos;re talking about , where the problem is not that they have too choice .
The problem is that they have too puts .
So the cencenters that I &apos;m talking about is a malent of modern modern , remarkable society , the Western society .
And what it does depressing and array is this : Steve Levitt told you yesterday , how those expensive and seats are ineful .
I mean , these choices , complicated and dispendiose , it &apos;s not that they are simply used to inutilizero-way .
I &apos;m a deleterie .
They make it worst .
If a little bit of what in our society allows a lot of choice , in the people have too few possibilities , it would not only be their life to improve , but also our .
This is what economists called a implant implant .
A redistribution of the income ago , but only in the poor -- because of this choice in the most of this choice in the remarkable choice .
To conclude , &quot; Flle , you can get all you want to be what you want to --
You , people of culture , you think , &quot; What does that fish ? &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t get anything in a glass . &quot;
&quot; A cast imagination , a limited view of the world -- &quot;
and I &apos;m interpret I interpret it , at the beginning .
But then , I think we &apos;re thinking , instead of the time I realized that that the fish knows that the long .
Because the reality of the fact of the fact that if you &apos;re lying the bocol , in the way that &quot; all it &apos;s possible . &quot; You don &apos;t get the freedom . You &apos;re the paralysis .
If you take the bocks in the way that all divents as as a swedden .
You get the paralive , and you reduced the well-being .
They all need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too strip , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the assume of the sphere is a recipe for the inhappiness and , and I &apos;m theme , for the rovine .
Thank you .
