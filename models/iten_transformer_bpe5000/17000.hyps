Last year I showed these slides to show that the artica glacial calculal acial calculal acial calculus , which is restrip of 40 percent .
However this sub-up the gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice .
The artica glacial acial ice is , in a sense , the heart of global system .
It &apos;s expanded up of the summer and you get summer .
The next slide is going to be a carrelated , the next few 25 years .
The glaces were signed in red .
As you see , they go to the blue sweet .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter ice in the winter ice .
You can see that the costs of the ice costs , of five years or more , is like a blood , which here was here fiorized from the body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been from that , so .
This is a problem because the warming warming demonstrate the terrain around the ocean , where there are huge amounts of coal coal and that , slum , they &apos;re transformed into the microbes .
I &apos;m going to get the total of the atmospheric inquitation of global warming , that amount could doubling , super-up , super-this point point of not around .
In some of the lagues of Alaska metan is already reflip from water .
The professored Katey Walter of the University of Alaska team of Alaska team of the 15th of the Alaska team that was a very low team last inverse .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You &apos;re good . The question is if we &apos;re going to be it .
A reason is that this extra termal exchange the Groenland from the north .
This is a river at regime .
The ported never had been himself to be like .
This is the Kangerlussuaestion , in the southereeeland of Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea level of the glaces on the ground , it &apos;s where the sea is where you get the sea .
These currents are increasing .
On the other side of the planet , Antarties , the largest block of ice on the planet .
The last month scientists have depths have declared that the balance of ice is in negative , and the Western Antary artist , which is particularly in some submarine islands , is particularly hit .
It &apos;s about six feet feet of the ocean , like in Groenland .
Suli Himalaya , the third largest block of ice , you see new lakes , which a few years ago was glacious .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population reported half of the water .
Sulle Ande : this glacier &apos;s the source of the water of this city .
The ported is increased .
But when it decreatures , the same happens to the water .
In California , the snow on the Sierra Nevada is demined of 40 percent .
The hypen kidnicks are .
The previous predictions , as you know , they &apos;re free .
The increasing safe in the world &apos;s increasing inceness .
The environmental disaster are increasing to a rhythm outside and unprecedented .
Four times more more of the last 30 years I was before 75 years I was going to do .
This is a lot of unsustainable .
If you look at it in the historic context , they can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day .
Look at the same time the area of the Pacific Pacific , the Americans , to the United States and both of the subcontinent , where there &apos;s a royal impovercome oxygen .
The greater cause of global warming , together to the forestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossil fuels .
The oil is a problem , and coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two of the more emissions , together to China .
And it was to make a lot of other central central other coal .
But we &apos;re seeing a change of direction .
These are the annullated projects in the last years and some alternative proposes of the versus .
At every way , there &apos;s a struggle in our country .
The industrial and oil has spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the coal of the last year to promote the coal , which is a symphony .
That picture me would remember something --
Verso , in the Tennessee , where I live , there &apos;s been a loss of 3.8 billion liers of the coal fouries of coal .
Maybe you have seen it on the news .
This is the second largest flow of the flow of America .
It &apos;s happened around the Natale .
The public advertising of the industrial industrial was this .
Video : Say the carbon , it &apos;s a very happy , and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it &apos;s growing our economy .
Frosop the carbon and more cleaner .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and the workers keep the workers .
Al Gore : From here is a great part of the West Virginia .
The largest society is Massey Coal . This is his administrator . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I &apos;m going to be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosy , not know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Allem &apos;s Protection of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is a one of them , a part .
Video : The ALergy : At the ALergy we see the climate change as a threat at at our business .
For that our priorities is to invest a lot of money in a public effort to make public and confused the truth of the coal .
In fact , the coal is not spork .
We think it &apos;s puzzles -- it &apos;s also a good profumo .
So you don &apos;t preocuption of climate change .
Let me do .
Video : Attore : Carbone can &apos;t tell you about it .
So we &apos;re going to do a turn in a structure to the avanguard for how it &apos;s coal .
Straordinarily ! The machines are a little rumorous , but this is the sound of the technology of the pulit .
The coal consumption is between the major causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology that you see changes everything .
You have a look at this . This is the odiern odial technology .
Al Gore : The end , the positive alternative , you can connect to the economic question and the national security .
Video : Human : America is in the crisis . The economy , the national security , climate crisis .
The filter that the links all : our dependence from fossil fuels , like the spork and oil .
Now , though , there &apos;s a new audace , I &apos;m going to use it .
Really , 100 percent of cleaned energy , in 10 years .
A plan to reach America to work , make us more safe , and help stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that basts to solve our problems .
Repower . You &apos;re more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It &apos;s about re-energy to America .
One of the faster ways of getting to get the dependence of the fuel that kills our planet .
Comparsa : The future is here . Vent , a new energy .
Compitator : Number two : New York investiments for jobs .
Same : Repower : It &apos;s time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old African proverbian said , &quot; If you want to go speed , go from soles .
If you want to go , you go together . &quot;
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I was a introduction about the LHC .
And you promise to return you to get back to you how the car works .
So I started here . And for the ones that the other time was not , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever tried -- 27 kilometers of circles .
His task is to rereach the conditions that were present less than a billiondespite of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
That &apos;s just ambitious .
This is the car under Ginevra .
And I did this little bit of these threats the threats .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLATLAS -- is largo to four meters .
This is a picture of ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLAS .
The 10 secret of the last year we &apos;ve got the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLATLAS .
It was caused to be in control .
It &apos;s a picture of particles that had done all the around of the LHC , entrepreneuring in the LHC , deliberately , with a part of the LHC , and spreading particles in the heavy .
In other words , when we saw that the 10 secrets , we realized that the car worked , which was a great vitty .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to do us exultle , when somebody went on Google and saw that the initial page was this .
That means we &apos;ve had a cultural impact beyond the scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the car , had to just these files here -- these files .
These files take 13,000 ampampwhen the car works at the very very well of the power .
Now , the technical technical and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . They &apos;re the too good . They &apos;re too good . &quot;
And instead can do it because when they &apos;re very cold , they &apos;re very cold of the subtle .
So , at least 271 degrees , at least 271 degrees , the files can bring that current that current .
In one of the gigunture between the most of the magnetes in the LHC , there was a defect of factory .
So the files are going to be slightly , and the 13,000 ampampsuddenly met a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think these magnees are more than 20 tons , and that they have moved about 30 centimetmeters .
They &apos;re damaged about 50 magnetic magnees .
We had to take them , what we &apos;ve done .
We &apos;ve been repristined and woulders .
Now , they &apos;re now coming back all to their underground .
I &apos;m going to the LHC is going to be again integror .
We &apos;re going to account , and we expect to get data to juggggggggs , and we continue our adventure to find what the universe is .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these crosses reach the dibattached on the value of science and the engineering engineering engineering .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact of getting beyond the limits , I think it &apos;s the value of things like the LHC .
I &apos;d like to end with the words of a Inglese scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , I guess , in defense of inutilize experiments of his own pupillo was Michael Faray , he said , &quot; Nothing is a very dangerous for the progress of human mind , which is not mystery , which is not mystations in nature , which is not mystations in the end , and that doesn &apos;t have a quick in the exist in the world . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start asking for rethink about when you , you play with children , you play with the morning .
While you could get them and reach them , and you get them and move them , and you know , you know , and you know , and to reach them and spacacacactivity .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , by the useful inspired by the useful of our interaction with physical objects , together to my consultant Pacts , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalii , I started to ask me , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of having the mouse as a roll of mouse as a passion , we can have the same same roll . We can have the same same same defairly mimimimistake of the hands , we can actually have a certain amount of sure ,
and fix it to our please ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable , is a big interactive computer as a bisceight .
In a few words , a Siftable , is a big interactive computer as a bisceight .
They can move with your hand , they can see , &quot; they can see &quot; they &quot; between them , feel the movement and they have a wireless radio wireless .
But overwhelmed , they &apos;re physical objects , like the morning , you can move them .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as they get more physics , conscious of the other movement , and as they become more physics , and as they become more physics , conscious , of the other , of the other , of the other , of the other , of the other , of the interaction , of the interaction .
I &apos;m going to try with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show video : if you &apos;re incline it in a direction , the video will rotate it like this , if you &apos;re going back back .
These acactives are aware of the other people .
If I do it , you know , they &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re around .
If they &apos;re circumbes , they can see it , they can be a little bit .
If they &apos;re circumbes , they can see it , they can be a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interesting interaction was that we could use common gestures on data , to example , &quot; a color like a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configured like you to see , and I can use them to get them to the color in the central , where they get .
and I can use them to get them to the color in that central , where they get .
If we &apos;re too , we can put it a little bit of it .
I &apos;m also beautiful possibilities of learning , like the languages , the mathematics and joyable of logic , where people can try and see the immediately .
Now , I &apos;m --
This is a sequence of Fibonacks that I do with a equations .
Here we have a words that &apos;s in half of Scarabees and Boggle .
It &apos;s basically , at every turnal of every Siftable on every Siftable , Pressentially , at every turnal of every turnal Siftable , and while you &apos;re trying to understand words the words of a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds remissing , and you have a new set of letter and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the children came in in the Media Lab , I did in the Media Lab , I &apos;ve made it and I was a video .
They were very much .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of applied is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
You just say , &quot; You know , &quot; You know , &quot; You know what to do .
Here &apos;s other people who try it .
This is our little tester tester , there on the right .
It was actually , it wanted to be impllary .
They were just morning , for him .
Now , this is an interactive carton .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of the languages . He &apos;s Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , solving the Sifaim them .
It can put new characters in the scene , solving the Sifaim them .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : The sun is surprising .
David Merrill : Now he took a treatment in the scene .
Video : The arange treatment .
Bobs ! Yeah !
So , you shake Sifttent and put them close them up ,
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing his story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a story with the opened , and it can decide him as you get .
DM : It &apos;s a story with the opened , and it can decide him as you get .
Video : Vola , gat .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , I realized that I was a recent , to try and execting music .
it &apos;s a tool , to get a tool , to sample and perform music .
The Siftable here are sound like the base , the bottom and the battery .
Each of these four different variations , and you can choose which you use .
You can also also also put these sounds in a sequence to your pleasure .
And it just just just toutouch a &quot; sound and a sequence . &quot;
These are actually you can control from the vivive , like the revers and the filter .
And it &apos;s a particular sound and then incline to beach it .
And then there are general effects as time and volume , that are applied to the whole sequence .
Let &apos;s look like it works .
DM : We &apos;re going to try and put a base in two Siftable . &quot; We &apos;re going to take it in a series , we put it in a series , we add another base .
I &apos;ll put a line line of the bottom .
Video : Now , I &apos;m going to add percussions --
Video : And now I &apos;m going to put the filter of the battery , so I can control the effect from the vive .
Video : DM : I can reach the whole sequence of time , and then on the time .
Video : And now I &apos;m going to add the bottom to the bottom to the bottom to give more expression .
Video : DM : I can reach the sequence . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to plan it , but I can improvise , make it flip , make it flip , and it &apos;s more corporters .
And now , finally , I can smoking the whole sequence of the left Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new new interfaces , more more more more more resements like our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this perspective , and also some possibilities that we &apos;re trying to get out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that we &apos;re coming this new generation of objects that we &apos;re going to bring out of digital media , which will bring information in our world .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the now of talking to all of you .
I &apos;m a writer .
I &apos;m going to talk about this is my profession , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the fascinating of my life .
And I don &apos;t look like to change .
But , he said , something particular happened in my life and in my career , which has led me to reeating the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called &quot; Mangia , Prega , &quot; which , in the previous books , for a few reason came out of my books , for a few reason came out in the world and became a great sensational , and it became a great sensational , and wearing a great sensational , and it became a great sensational ,
And the result is that everywhere now , people treatment like I was conducted .
It &apos;s really -- conducted , conducted !
They &apos;re all going to me , and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t fear to do better than you do better than you do better than it ?
You don &apos;t fear to go to write for all life without being able to create a book that can importantly create a book that can matter to somebody ? &quot;
that can &apos;t matter to somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s resurrassurant , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a scrape -- I was a writer .
I was going to go back to the same reaction .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you get it to success ?
You don &apos;t fear that the refigured ?
You don &apos;t fear to do this to be a whole of life without anything that happens to be out of and to die on a cumb of every violating with the mouth of failure ?
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
Yeah , I &apos;m afraid of all of those things .
I always had fear .
And I also fear of many other things that people would not have to be initized .
As the algae and other things .
But , as I think I &apos;m going to write what I thought and I would ask me , why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logic that anyone should expect to be frightened by a work that you &apos;ve been born for doing .
But what &apos;s that special in the creative entry of the entry of the mental health as elsewhere that are not doing ?
As my father , for example , he was a chemical engineering and I don &apos;t remember a single time in his 40 years of activity in which he was asked if it fear to be engineer ?
And it was never -- that block of the engineer , how do it ?
It didn &apos;t work that , you know ?
Onestly , chemicals like a group don &apos;t have certainly , in the centuries , the reputation of being alcolized .
We have a writers , we have a little bit of this reputation , and not just creative writers , but creativity of all of these , we have this reputation of being enormously ununstable .
And it &apos;s not the other that look at the trads of the magnifies of the magnifies of creative minds that only in the 20th century , they die and often and often .
And the ones that don &apos;t have suicked to be really disappeared by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , &quot; Every little book has killed me a little bit more , a really fashion about their work .
But we don &apos;t throw away when we feel like to say why we &apos;ve heard these things so long we &apos;ve completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and the suffering is in some of the way , and the suffering is always a few legate and that art , at the end .
And the question I want to ask everybody here today is : you agree with this idea ?
It &apos;s good at this -- because it &apos;s also about a centimeter of distance to me , it &apos;s not good for this supposition .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s dangerous , and I don &apos;t want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better encourage our big creative minds to live .
And I know that , in my case -- in my situation -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start to fight on the circumstances , overwhose circumstances where I am in my career .
That &apos;s -- I mean , look , I &apos;m quite young , I &apos;m a young , I &apos;m a very young , I &apos;m a young time ,
I still have about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that any thing I wrote about this right now , then it &apos;s going to be judicted by the world , as the work that was in my last book .
I &apos;m going to be slavor , because we &apos;re all more or less friends here -- is likely that my greatest success is to my day .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that &apos;s a person to start dying in the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would keep doing this work that we love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it looks like , after many reflections , which the way to work to continue to write is that of creating a construct psychological construct , OK ?
I have to somehow to find a safety distance between me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxiety of which reaction that &apos;s going to get . And as I was trying to look through the time , looking through time , trying to find other societies to see if they could have to have better and more societies to see if they could have to have better and more human ideas to see . And I think I &apos;m going to be able to see if they could have a better and I think about it .
how to help people manage the untonight of the emotional creativity .
And that research me brought me to the ancient Great and ancient Rome .
You &apos;re just going to do it , because it &apos;s a gira and then goes back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity came from the men , OK ?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit is this spirit look at the human beings , and that came to a few of the distant and unknown , for distant and unknown .
The Green were these spirits of the beekeepers of the demons of creativity .
Socrate , wonderful , believed to have a demon that elargive wisdom .
The Romani were the same idea , but they called the kind of spirit without a genius .
which is great , because the Romani didn &apos;t really think that a genius had a very smart .
They thought a genius was this kind of divine that had a kind of divine that was literally in the walls of an artist , a little bit like the elevent of a lot of a lot of the work of hidden the work of that work .
Here &apos;s eye--- here is the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological construction that you &apos;re protected by your work .
And everybody knew that it was so that it was , right ?
So , the antichi were protected by certain things , like the too narcisism , like , the too narcism , not ?
If your work was exceptional , you couldn &apos;t take it tens , everybody knew that you were helped by this genius .
If your work failed , it wasn &apos;t all your time , it wasn &apos;t all your time , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a incapable .
And so people have to have the han concept of creativity in the West for a long time .
And then the Rense came and everything else , and it changed this great idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe above all the the of the universe above the universe above the creatures that desk the creatures of the divinity .
This was the principle of the rational humanity and people started thinking that creativity came out of the idivided .
And for the first time in history , you start to reflip this or that artist as a genius that artist with a person with the genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think it &apos;s permit to somebody , a simple person to believe that you can be like a recient , the essence and the source of all the mysters , creative , unknown and unknown ethernal and a philillion .
It &apos;s like to ask somebody of ingoate the sun .
It deapse and details all these ingestimates on the performance .
And I think it &apos;s been this pressure to destroyed the artists in passed .
And if that &apos;s true , and I think that &apos;s , the question is , and now ?
Can we do it differently ?
Maybe you can come back to a more understanding of human relationship and mystery creative .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can &apos;t get 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And probably people in the audience that would be reading the scientific notion of the public notion of the notion of , they do , they follow people are becoming out of their own projects .
It probably doesn &apos;t really really really enjoy you all about this .
But the question I &apos;d like to ask is -- why ?
Why don &apos;t you think about this way ?
Because it has more sense of anything else that I &apos;ve ever heard to explain the explanning of the creative process .
A process that , as anyone ever tried to do something -- so , basically , all of here -- you don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t have rationally coms .
And , in fact , it can sometimes seem completely paranororms .
I did this reported recently with the extraordinary poem Ruth Stone , which has now 90 years , but it was a very poem for all of life and said that during his childhood in the Virginia , worked out in the Sample , and he felt it , in if a poetry came from the landscape .
He said it was like a frageous train of the air .
And that was going to come up to her from the landscape .
It felt that , because he was going to do the land under his feet .
He knew that I had one thing to do to do at that point and was of , words , &quot; corrupt as a matta . &quot;
And he would be going to go home and it was followed by this poetry , and it wouldn &apos;t have to get a piece of paper and a math faster , and a math faster , and then he would pick it up and mistake it on the page .
And again , I couldn &apos;t be fast enough , so correct and correct without getting to the house and the poetry and correct would continue to rotate through and her performed her and she would continue to rotate through the landscape , looking , as she said , &quot; another poet . &quot;
Then there were those times -- this piece I didn &apos;t forget -- there was moments where it was almost losing , right ?
So , he was running home and was trying to paper and poetry and the poetry of paper and he was going to be in the same while he was going , and then he said , which was like , if you were halled with the other hand and the office .
And he was poetry by the code and he would put it in his body and transction on the page .
And in these cases , poetry would be presented on the perfect page , but at the contrary , the last word at the first word .
So when I thought , I thought , it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly the same same as I was .
Not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conducucucucucture .
I &apos;m a mud , and my way to work is ; I wake up at the same orar every day and to work and go up and to work on it and to get up up .
But even I was in my aggin my testyard , I strike against that thing , sometimes .
And I guess many of you the han made .
You know , even if the work and ideas came up to me from a certain source of the source of you , I could not be honestly .
And what is this ?
And how can we relate to it in a way to do not get the head , but , rather , what &apos;s going to do is refer ?
As I think , the best example of the same contemporary example I have the Tom Waits , which I interviewed several years ago for a journal .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the major of life was the incarnation of the incarnation of the same artist , trying to control , management , to look at these species of impulses creativity .
But then I was invecked , he hot , and a day he was driving on a highway in Los Anes , he changed all for him .
He was going to be fast and all of a sudden this little framment of melody , which is in his head as inspiration , elusively and the hell , and the desider , and the desider , but it doesn &apos;t know how to take it .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a matite , it doesn &apos;t have a recorder .
So he starts to hear this kind of old ansia , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to setting up up with this song even even .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t do enough , and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to go in the panic , he stopped .
He &apos;d put the whole whole thing , and he did something completely new .
He just looked at the sky and said , &quot; Same , don &apos;t see that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; You know , it seems to write a song now ?
If you really want to be in a moment , it &apos;s more hurt .
Altrain , you &apos;re going to importantly , you know ,
You can see the cohen Cohen . &quot;
And his work process changed after this .
Not the work , the work was still dark as always always .
But the process , and the fish was that was reduced when he was reduced when the genius , the genius that came out of him , the genius that was , and it was going to be a interorized thing that didn &apos;t have to be a interorized thing that it didn &apos;t be a interorized thing .
but it &apos;s not a lot of this peculiar , a conversation between Tom and this strike , but it was not Tom .
So , how that story I was to change a little bit of the way I was working and already saved me once .
This idea , I &apos;d save me when I was writing , &quot; Prega , &quot; and fall in a of those cave of the disperation where we &apos;re all working on something and we &apos;re working on something and we can &apos;t do and start thinking about it , which is the worst book .
Not just bad , the worst book wrote .
And I started thinking about to think of this project .
But then I remember of Tom I talked to the air and tried .
So I grew my face on the manecritically and I was in the vacuum angle .
And I said , &quot; I said , &quot; Spresent , what we know if this book is not going to be really brilliant , it &apos;s not going to be really blind my , no ?
Because I &apos;m seeing it , I &apos;m putting all I have , I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to be better ,
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know , I don &apos;t do anything .
I &apos;m going to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to be recorded that I was presented to me to do my part . &quot; Because it &apos;s what -- it &apos;s like this , OK -- they &apos;re not going to do in the deserts of the North Africa people had been dances for the dances of the dances of the dances of the dances of the moon and the hass .
And they were always magnifies , because the ballerini were professionals and were fantastic .
But every one , I rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became really transcending .
And I know what I &apos;m talking about what I know , because I know you &apos;ve got a few of a point , a performance .
It was like the time stopped , and the ballerin walked through a kind of portal and was not anything different from the usually , like 1,000 notes before , but it was all halling .
And suddenly , you know , you know , it &apos;s not just like a human .
But it &apos;s accounts from the divinity of divinity .
And when this happened , the people knew what was , people knew what was , they called it .
They were in the hands and started to sing , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
I was historic notes -- when the Mors invased the south of Spagna , preserve this habits with them and the ready to be able to change in the centuries of the &quot; Allah , Allah , &quot; the hole , &quot; which you can still hear in the corride or flamenk .
In Spagna , when a artist did something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , and I &apos;m a , the guy , Allah , I &apos;m really , a figuable , &quot; uncomcompreable , this is a flip of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes next day after , for the dancing day , when you wake up and discovered that are the 11 of the morning of the morning of God there is no longer .
It &apos;s just a lot of bad beekeepers to the ginoces , and maybe it &apos;s not going to get that altitude .
And maybe no one will get the name of God still while a jeer , and what has to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most payon reconciliations to make a creative life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so angosciant if you can &apos;t believe , advanced , the most extraordinary aspects of your being being from you .
But just believe that it &apos;s data that &apos;s all the time , you know , a unimaginable source of this team of your life that you have to get to something else when you &apos;re finished .
And , you know , if we think it &apos;s all change .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s certainly like I thought about for different months in the work of the book that I &apos;m going to do , the dangerous , I &apos;m going to do , the dangerous , and I was following the great great great success , and it &apos;s certainly as well as I think ,
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel electrized by this is , I don &apos;t have fear .
Don &apos;t get you . It &apos;s just your work .
It &apos;s going to talk to you for your side , any can be .
If your work is dancing , you can blow .
If the divine , it &apos;s genius to get a little bit of wonderful wonderful , for a few of wonderful wonderful , for a only time through your wiring , then &quot; Ole ! &quot;
You know , you do it the same dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot;
I think it &apos;s weak to teach it .
&quot; Oh , &quot; in you . &quot;
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As I &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects on the human genes , what can mean and the discovery of new genes .
Now we &apos;re starting a new path : we started to digitize biology and now starting from that digital code we are getting into a new fase of biology , designing and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing life .
We always tried to ask big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists , I think they tried to find out of various levels .
We tried different approaches , reducing it to the minimum terms .
We &apos;re digitizing by 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the analogy of the digital world of computers .
Now , we &apos;re going to ask : can we regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is a map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genitalium .
And we tried to get more more more , the genome to create a little bit more .
We can actually get a hundred genes of the genes of about 500 that are here .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our .
It &apos;s simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this can bring to a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to design was synthesize this cromes in a way that we could change the components to take the components to take some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the &quot; can we synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Can the chemistry contain these big molecules that we never could make it first of creating before ?
And in case , we can do that , we can make a cromosome ?
A cromosome is just a piece of chemical material inert .
The speed that we can digitize life is increasing exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , of refairly , but it &apos;s improving .
And our most recent results the results get exponential curve .
We &apos;ve got more 15 years ago .
The process has required a lot of passages , starting with a bioethic review before the early experiments .
But we found that we &apos;re synthesize the DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that produce small segments , of the long DNA , the length of 30 to 50 letter and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the most mimistakes .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments and the mistakes .
And that &apos;s been our first attempt , to start by digital information genome of Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , actually , he did the mistakes , and you get a molecule of DNA molecule .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical materials and we put it in bacteria in bacteria , the bacteria , the bacteria have started reading this genetic code and make them the viral particles .
The viral particles then have been reported by cells , they went back and they &apos;re destroyed .
I &apos;ve talked about recently with the oil industry , saying they &apos;re certainly going to tell them that they have certainly understood .
They have more than you .
We think this is a situation where the software can actually build his same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things greater .
We wanted to build the whole chromosome .
They &apos;re more than 580 mile letter code .
So we thought we &apos;ve been building it in casses of the size of the virus , so that we can change the casses of understanding what the components of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genes for the first time in 1995 , the standard accuracy was a mistake for every 10 midden .
We found it , resequenced it , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence we had never been able to do it work .
One part of the process is designing long long , 50 letters that overwhelmed with all the other segments of 50 letter to make smaller substity that work together .
We &apos;re unic elements .
You probably have read that we &apos;ve got to put the shligrade .
And think about it that : we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , C , G and T.
Three of those letters together codificate about 20 amminoacids , and there &apos;s a specific order to letter in every ammines .
So we can use the genetic code to write , frash , thoughts .
What we did in the beginning was self-replaced .
Some people have been delused by fact that it wasn &apos;t poem .
We designed these segments to be simply to join them with with enzyme .
There are me that they repair them .
And we started to assembling parts , starting with five to seven mile letters , including them , unendles in a way to form of 24 mies to 24 mila letter segments to get to 72 to the letters .
And we &apos;re made these segments in abundance , so that we could find out that we &apos;re trying to create a extreme process extreme extreme process ,
We &apos;re trying to automatically automatically .
So , this looks like the tabellon of a baskon player .
When we get to these very long segments , more than 100 basis , they &apos;re not going to grow more directly in E.
It &apos;s coming to the modern biology of molecular biology .
So we &apos;ve been considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called the reaching homologist , which is useful to repair the DNA to be able to unting the DNA segments .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinoccurred , it &apos;s a lot of radiation , can absorb three million radiation .
You can see in the upper riquader of the destroome is destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours , 24 hours , just as it was before .
There &apos;s thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be completely completely .
They can live under vacuum .
They &apos;re completely sure that life exist in space , and you get to find new environments of water .
And it &apos;s really , NASA showed that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we &apos;ve built using these processes , just using the lievished with the design of the segments of the segments that we &apos;ve built .
The lieventually assembly .
This picture was not taken with a microscope microscope , but with a regular rull .
It &apos;s a molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that cover a time of six seconds .
This is the publishing that we &apos;ve done a little time ago .
They are more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the largest molecule molecule that ever created by the man .
It has a higher molecular weight .
If you &apos;re very pass with a 10 without spaces , you &apos;d like 142 pages to transform this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ? How can we get it ?
Of course , you take a virus is a game .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria .
It &apos;s easier even when it &apos;s eucarily cells like our : you can just just get the nuclear , and put another , which is basically the clonation process .
In the bacterium that &apos;s the chromosome is instead of integrated inside the cell , but we &apos;ve recently demonstrate that we can do a trapify of a cell to another and activate it .
We can cleaned a chromosome that was a microbial species .
The two are different as men from tops .
We &apos;ve added a few gene in a way to decide what to do for this cromes .
And then he &apos;s shelter with the enzyme so that he has been killing all the protein .
And when we put it in the cell , it &apos;s been studipendo-five-of-fisticato-fisticatoes -- the new chromosome is went inside the cell .
And we started thinking that we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to get it over there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that tantissir species have added a second or a third chromosome from some of a few of new trouble , in a second thousands of new traits .
So , who thinks evolution as a single gene of the time , it doesn &apos;t really understand much of the biology .
There are enzyme called the &apos; enzyme of remarkable to make DNA .
The cromosome that was in the cell , you didn &apos;t have one .
The mobile phone -- the chromosome we have a pair it .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other cromes as materials , and it has masticked it , and we found out with only the cell and the new cromes .
It &apos;s become blue because of the genes that we have put .
And in a short amount of time , all the characteristics of a species , they went to perse , and it turned into a species , based on the new software that we put in the cell .
All protected protected , memories are changed , and when we read the genetic code .
Now , this may seem like genetic alchemy , but by by the software we can change things in a very substantial way .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that it &apos;s not about genesis -- but of progress from three million years and half years of evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion where they will be new species of the Cambrian .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s enough when we think about our necessity .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion and half billion people at 9 billion in the next 40 years .
Right for example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one .
We &apos;re having problems now to find food , water and clean , medicine and welline , the gas and gas for six billion and half billion people .
It &apos;s going to be even more to do it for nine billion .
We use more five billion coal bits , more than 30 billion barrels .
That means 100 million barbars a day .
When we try to get biological processes , or any kind of process to replace them , it &apos;s a huge challenge .
And we have to see all the CO2 emission from these materials that end up in the atmosphere .
And in the day , thank you to the scientific discovery in the world , we have a databases with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the design components for the future .
The electronic industry has only only only a dozen about components , and you think about how many different things came out .
Our limits here are data principles of biological reality and the imagination .
Now we have techniques , thank you to these methods of synthesization , able to create what we call genomic genomic genomic .
We can build a big robots that can produce a million crumes a day .
Think of processing these 20 million genes of different genes or to try to optimize the processes to produce opher , new vaccines , we can change , by making more biology molecular , and creating more biology molecular biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemical production or chemical vaccines , production ,
This is an instantany of some software programmed that we &apos;re working to be able to seat and design species .
Well , we don &apos;t know how they &apos;re going to be .
We know exactly how their gene code .
Now we &apos;re focusing on the fuel of fourth generation .
You also saw you that extract ethanol from the grain was a hadn experiment .
We have depend of second and third generation that will use enough to be forforeigchererererereral sugar of the highest value of the butanol .
But the only way biology can have a big impact without increasing the cost of food and limits the cost of food and limits the available available to be to make the CO2 in matter . And we &apos;re working for cells that can achieve this purpose , and we think we can get the first coal of quarter in about 18 months .
The sunlight combined with CO2 is a metodo--- but in our discovery in our all over the world , we found different metods .
This is a organism that we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
It &apos;s going to be in the deep ocean , about 2,000 feet of the ocean &apos;s temperature .
It creates meters from the CO2 using molecular hydrogen as energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can incanal CO2 , which can easily be transported by tubes , to drive this process .
So we think we might be able to increase what the question of &quot; which is what the question of &quot; is , &quot; What &apos;s life , &quot; is , &quot; We have the fashion goal to replace the entire oil industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do it by TED , where you can you do it from TED , where you can &apos;t do it by TED , where you can &apos;t do it by TED , where you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can &apos;t do it by TED , where you can &apos;t do it .
It would be a major source of energy .
And we &apos;re working for the same methods to create instantanem vaccines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with flu , we &apos;re always back of a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s about the fair .
I think what you can change is building combinable vaccines in anticipe .
Here &apos;s how the future could start to look change , now , the tree of evolution , accellyle evolution with synthetics , arches , and finally eucarily cells .
We &apos;re so much as we &apos;re getting the way to improving people .
Our purpose is to make a way of living enough to try to make it . Thank you very much .
So , first of all I &apos;m going to show you , the most fundamental work , the new technology that we &apos;ve taken the Microsoft in follow with a year . This is Seadragon . This is Seadragon . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s a environment where you can interact is at the local level that remoon of data .
Here we &apos;re seeing a lot of digital pictures like digital photos of a kind of zoom and continue , for a fastership , for a fast-panoramic ,
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these data are these pictures of data or images .
Most people have digital photographs , but this for example is a scanning of Congress from the Biary of Congress , and it &apos;s going to go into the gamma of 300 megapixel .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that limits the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any moment . It &apos;s also a very flessible architecture .
This is a whole book , a whole book of data .
This is the Casa &apos;s desolate of Dickens . Every colonna represents a capture .
And to demons that &apos;s just a headline and not images , we can do something like that , to see what it &apos;s a real representation of the heads , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a little electronic book .
I don &apos;t recommend it .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s a number of The Guardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading the real caracy version of a magazine , or a daily spacem , which is for a multipless of half .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of The Guardian .
We &apos;ve created a high-resolution adrise -- much higher than what you &apos;re used in a normal publishing . And we &apos;ve got to put you in a normal content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific specifications .
And this really really demonstrates some of these ideas to get out of space on the screen .
And we hope that this means to put the people in and other kind of ports , and to other similar porcheries , I didn &apos;t have to be necessary .
Of course , the mapapaps is one of the most obviously , for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don &apos;t want to lose time , if I don &apos;t say we have to give you in this field .
These are all the roads in the United States overwhelmed by NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually from the website . You can go to see it .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which fighting two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research at the computer that &apos;s very interesting computer made by Noah Snavely interesting by Steve Seadly Seitz &apos;s aid Seitz . Rick Szeliki .
And it &apos;s from the living on the Web , management by Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from one image to the other kind of experience of resolution .
But the space collocation here has actually a meaning .
The algorithms of visualization , they recorded these pictures together , so that they correspond to the real places that they &apos;re all linked to the Grass -- all the right next to the lagues -- they &apos;re taken .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you a few other environment .
There are a lot of the more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data set of Noah-up -- and this is a previous prototynth of Photosynth that we &apos;ve done work for the first time . And that &apos;s really , I think I &apos;m really the key behind this technology , Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily evidence that we &apos;ve been in the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and forth .
This is a reconstruction of Nobody &apos;s Cauctedral . Basta . Basta , Nobody &apos;s three Din Flickr and you get pictures of these kinds of gaps and you get pictures of these kinds of sample and then he said . And so on . Ogns , and you get a picture that &apos;s discovery to be a picture that &apos;s discovery .
So , they &apos;re all pictures made by Flickr and they were all linked to space in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to navigate this .
You know , I &apos;d never thought of end to work for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifically , you get this kind of accounts here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different kinds of photocamers , from the mobile cell phones . And a significant number of those professional .
And if I can , I try to try and look at the most strains .
Many of them are blocked by faces , etc .
And somewhere there is a series of photographs -- it &apos;s got a series of photographs --
This is a poster of Nothing Dame recorded .
We can go from the poster physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with the social environment . This is taking data from the whole memory of the whole memory of the whole memory of the view -- and connecting all of those data together .
All those pictures get together , the more of the parts of the parts .
You have a model of the entire that emerge .
And think about this as the prolungation of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complex , as people use it , and the advantages that are benefits for the useful , they &apos;re useful for the use .
Their pictures are mark with metaded meadapted by other people .
If you &apos;re in somebody is the idea of contrast all these sounds saying , my picture of the Nothing , my picture of Nothing , you know , my picture of NoDDimprovisisisely , and I can use it as a place of ingress in that space , in that metaphor , using the pictures of everyone else , and having a social experience of the cross-mo-the-cross-moons of the cross-mo-mo-mo-mo-the-fit .
Of course , a consequence of all of that are virtual models of all interesting , the interesting , and collected , not just by the plankets and satellite images and satellite images and satellite images , but from the collective .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I &apos;m going to get it right ? What your software will be going to hear is that at a certain point , in the next years , all the pictures are all all all the world will be basically connected by everybody in the world will be basically connected ?
BAA : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is actually about it .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , you ,
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about requires of information seanti-of-of-images .
As you do a research research of pictures on the Web , you get a sentence and the heads on the Web is a lot of information about pictures .
Now , what happens if you do this picture is connecting to all your pictures ?
So the amount of seeds interconnection , and the amount of requires that would be really enormous . It &apos;s a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible .
BAA : Thank you very , very , thank you very much .
One of the primary pleases when you travels travels and one of the delicious research is the living of the living of the people who have no forgotten traditions , between the world &apos;s hits the past in the wind , the hatry , the trouble in the wild , the fills of the plants .
And the thought that the shamani Jaguar travel again , the old old old Redwood , or the old old Himalaya , and the old old pipppan in Himalaya , the distinct of the Dharrrron , and the idea that the world we live in a sense of the remarkable , and the idea that the world we live in a sense , but it &apos;s just a model of reality , but it &apos;s a reality , just a model of the reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stirpe has done , well , or bad , many generations ago .
And of course , we all share of the essential trade-.
We all of the . We all procrease .
We are extra subjects .
We have to be the inexorability of death , so we don &apos;t surprised it .
We all have a art .
What it &apos;s the particular rhythm , the rhythm of the dance of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that the Penan of the Borneo , or the follow of the Voodoo of Haiti , or the Reserriers of the Kaithrobust , or a campaigor a camp in the Sahara &apos;s heart of Ande , or a cammelt in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my journey company in the desert a month ago , or a hallevator of the Keak values in Qomolangma , on Molangma , on Meran &apos;s mother .
All of these populations teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And , if you reflect a moment , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
Insides , the miriades of cular the world are creating a spiritual and cultural life that has been a spiritual and it &apos;s important for the wealth of the planet , so , as a biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural race as a ethnosphere and you can defining the etnosphere , the total of all concepts , dreams , with ideas , , inspirations , inspiration , inspiration , the inspiration of the consciousness of evolving .
The ethnosphere is the great pathium of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and of what we can be as as a species .
And because biosphere was very , very , it &apos;s been really consumption to be very quickly .
No biologist , for example , would say that 50 percent of all the species is , or the ord of the sumsumintion simply because it &apos;s fliptical , or -- in the most apocalyptic field of biological diversity . And you don &apos;t even get closer to the most mystic diversity -- that of cultural diversity .
The one of all of that is , of course , the loss of language .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not composed by a vocabulary or a series of grammical rules .
A language is the spraked of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle of which is the middle of every culture comes in the world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a stick , a thought of spiritual possibilities .
And of those 6,000 languages , while we &apos;re sitting in Monterey , at least half not come in in the ears of the children .
They &apos;re not teaching children , the one that means , less you know , less I &apos;m campaign .
What is more tristes of the being had to be the silence , of being the last last few of the language , the last last few of the language , you don &apos;t have to transform the wisdom of children or to anticipate the promise of the children ?
This is a few years of the state of somebody in a few of the world every two weeks of the world every two weeks of the old old sets and bringing the last last last few weeks .
And I know somebody of you say , &quot; Is it better like that ?
The world would not a better place if we were talking about all the same language ? &quot; Benize , then we &apos;re all yoruba . We &apos;re talking about damage . We &apos;re talking about damage .
Let &apos;s talk about kogs .
You &apos;ll get a sudden what it means you can &apos;t talk to your language .
I &apos;d like to do you do a journey through the ethnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a bit of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , &quot; different ways of existing . &quot; I mean , really different ways of existing .
Let &apos;s take for example this Barasana bimas , in Amazon section , the people of anaconda , which creates the midance of the Amazon &apos;s riving the mist of the west the rist of the west wild .
It &apos;s a people who can &apos;t be able to distinguish the color of the blue color from the green because the time birthday , where you &apos;re depending on the forest , where the people .
They have a strange language and a matriage rule , called &quot; exogram language , &quot; exogram , &quot; You have to sposing a person who talks a different language .
All of that has been in the mitological , but the particularly the particularly about these families of the summit is that in these families , where you &apos;re talking to six or seven ing-of-the-none language .
They &apos;re just listening and then they start talking to it .
Let &apos;s take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived , the Waorani of Ecuador , a incredible populations that had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionaries have tried a touch mistake .
They &apos;ve been taken out of the top photographs that they were retrouble , and forget that they were amichevolved , forest that people in the forest of the forest plual forest had never seen anything of bi-dimensional .
They collect the pictures from the earth , they &apos;ve been taken to the form or a figure , and not by finding anything , they have been conclused that they were treated to the diavies of the diavies .
But the Waorani didn &apos;t kill only the foreigers .
They killed between them .
The 54 percent of mortality was caused by themselves .
We &apos;re saving eight generations and we found two natural death cases , and when we &apos;ve insisted that one of them was invecting a lot of them was invecting , and then they have a incredible knowledge of the forest .
The cattains could recognize the animal urine for 40 pass and recognize the species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned a really interesting job when my professor was asked me to go to Haiti , I was going to Haiti in the basis of the secret of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes of the poison .
For a sense of the miraculous , I should have to understand Vodoo culture , which the Voodoo is not magic .
It &apos;s quite a complex metaphor of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristith , Islam , Buddhism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Sharian Africa has no faith of religious . And instead and the Voodoo is not the other than the distilled of these religious religious concepts .
What makes the interesting voodoo is the intense relationship between life and death .
So , the beds are becoming .
The beekeepers can be invited by the Great Accord , they respond to the dance of the dance of the dance of the vivious , so that for a short active active active active , the following becomes the gods .
And that &apos;s why you &apos;re like to say , &quot; You &apos;re white you &apos;re going to talk about God .
We say in the theme and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re post , is the spirit that you are , how can you do it wrong ?
So you see these incredible events : follow voodoo in state of trance that touches on the body when it &apos;s catalyzed , you know , the unfairly strong demonstration of the body when it &apos;s catalyzed in a state of extreme .
I &apos;m in all the people with which I lived the most extraordinary people are Kogi SSanta Marta , in the Hombia .
They have to be the ancient civilization that once they were living on the aid carrying plant of Colombia in the charge of the conquician , the people would be retreated on the volcanic masses .
In a continent that has never been conquised by the spageed .
And I &apos;m not a clever , they &apos;re governance , but they &apos;re really really really extraordinary .
The young people are taken away from families to three or four years , and they live secret in a world of buian and shadow in a hoods of stone .
Two periods of nine years choose about to reproduce the nine months of gestation that transporting the nine months , now they &apos;re metaphor , now , they &apos;re metaphor of the Grands .
For all of this time , they &apos;re acculturated to their society , values that previous that they &apos;re predicting their prayers and just their prayers and just their prayers -- or to say the ecological balance .
And the term of this incredible initiation , it suddenly taken out and for the first time in life , at 18 years , they see a fairly . And in that activities of the first bank , when the sun kets the sun &apos;s the beautiful landscape , all that they &apos;ve learned in a whole whole thing that they learned about in the whole landscape . The priest is a step of the repainting .
&quot; Vist ? Proprid as I said .
It &apos;s amazing . Now it &apos;s now . &quot;
They call the major brothers and say that we , the threats , you &apos;re threat , we &apos;re the colpaid of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the Indigenes and the environment we invoon R-and the old story of the selvacuum history of the selvacuum , which is a race of his own , or maybe invoding Thoreau and we say that these people are more close to the Earth of us .
The Indies are not no sensitive sentimental sentimental .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the malarian Asmat or in the ezes of the Tibet , but by the time and the rites , they created a mythic myc of the Earth is not about the conception of the arrange of the world &apos;s very good .
What does that mean ?
That &apos;s a little bit of the Ande that a kid of Ande that the mountain is a spirit that will lead to the mountain is a very different human being deeply different , and it &apos;s going to have a very different relationship with the mountain or that place that &apos;s a mountain , or that place a mountains of rockets , which is a massive rock of rockets you &apos;re going to be in the rockets of rock .
which is the dimmmit &apos;s dimmit , or a threeral is irrelevant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that define the relationship between the individuals and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Britannica believe that the forests that the forests that they were going to be cut .
And that &apos;s a human being different from my friends Kwakiutl , which are the dimmmatic decredimed Hukuk and the berites of heaven and the berites of the world , the dog of the world , the who live in the Hamsa .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create reality , you can start understanding some of them sensations . We take this plant .
I took this picture to open the Amazon the Western Amazon .
Maybe some of you &apos;ve heard of the ayhuasks , the most powerful substance of the shamanic repertory .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuasks is not the drugs of the substance , but his elaboration . It &apos;s composed by two elements .
On the one side , this liana legning that contains a series of Tioline , hardddogene , a little hallucinogene .
And by trying to take the only plant , it &apos;s a smoke , which alter a little bit of consciousness , but it &apos;s mixed with the leaves of a caffection of the coffee Psychchtry to live .
This plant contains powerful powerful powerful , triptamine , very similar to the serotonin , dimethyptamine .
If you ever see Yanomami pull up for the nose of the substance that are made by a different set of species , it &apos;s a methyptamin .
Tirating that dust for the nose is a little bit like being shown by a file card of dipinches and land on a sea of electricity . &#91; Risry &#93; &#91; Risate &#93; not creates a distortion of reality .
I &apos;ve got often often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has taken the pissssnaked up in the 190s .
And I mean , I don &apos;t have to classification these triptamine as hell because if you &apos;re done , you can &apos;t tell any of being hallucined . &#91; Ris&#93; The ptamine ptamine , but they can &apos;t be abunte to be abunte because they are obviously obviously because they are obviously obviously because they &apos;re in the intestabligentage .
It &apos;s possible to be abunte , it &apos;s just if you &apos;re abunte with other chemicals that denian MAO .
Now it &apos;s the beautiful : the birth of the A........ , the same kind of remarkable to be able to make the triptamine . The question is spontaneous . The question is spontaneous . The question is spontaneous , in a reflectively not similar , but if you combined in this way , they create a chemical chemical version that &apos;s upper chemical version that &apos;s upsum in the sum of the parts ?
We use the great aurism of the proof and the error , which can reveal violpheres .
But if we ask the Indians , they say , &quot; We &apos;re the plants talking about it . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayaatheist , which distinguished neply in the forest , and that we have the eyes would come in the same species .
If we ask them how they &apos;re going to be able to tell us , &quot; I thought , &quot; I think , &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is , you take the 17 variety in a flip of the filling and each other will be with a different tone .
And with this is not graduate at Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than count the stami .
Now , &#91; now &#93; the &#93; the problem is that also the people who have to heart people who have to heart people have been paid them , but in some way of the margin of the history of our real world , and passes .
In fact , the 20th century , in 300 years , it &apos;s not going to remember the 19th of its technology , but rather like the one was where we stopped and enabled with it and we used it and enabled actively , or passionately , the problem of biological diversity and cultural culture of the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All the cultures have been involved in a dance for new possibility .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux have no smell of Sioux when they put it from the arco and frecovered as Americans have no stop being American when they put from the horse and hot .
It &apos;s not the change or the technology of ethnosphere . It &apos;s the power of ethnosphere . It &apos;s the power .
The hard hard to domination .
And if you look at the world , you &apos;ll find that these aren &apos;t destined culcular cular .
They &apos;re living and spinal dynamic in the exist of the exist forces that are beyond their adaptance ability to .
It &apos;s a disbone of the disbosyggggen of the Penan --
a populations of Sarawak , in the Water , a people who lived in the forest to a generation of the forest to a generation ago , and now reducing the generation and now , and now reducing the ridge of the fiums , where you can see the river of the ridge that looks like to get back to the middle of the Mar Cinese Mar , where the Sea dionm , where the Symom , where the wave of the horizon , where you can see the wave ,
It &apos;s ready to get the wooden with the soth of the forest .
Or , in the Yanomami , are the diseases that came with with the discovery of the golden .
If we &apos;re going to get on the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the hard hard hard hard to see the domination of the political .
As you &apos;re the genocide , the sumsumness of a people who , is constyle at the universal level , but the ethnocience of the style of a people , not only is no one not only conducted , but I also also also also supplemented in certain environments .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of Tibet until the beginning .
I &apos;ve been 6,000 miles from Chengdu in the Western China through the Western Tibet , coming in Lhasa with a young link , but just came to Lhasa with a young link , but just came to Lhasa with a young link .
6,000 monuments sacred reduces in dust and centers .
1.2 million people kills from the military during the Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascrited at Panchen Lama .
which means that it &apos;s been killed to the time of the Chinese invasion .
And it was in Saint , in Santity during the diaspora that &apos;s brought the people in Nepal .
His mother was imprisoned and his cold was to be rich .
It &apos;s been taken of birth to two years . It &apos;s been taken under two years of birds , because it couldn &apos;t live without him .
The sister , who did the same , it &apos;s been med in education .
A day he had a day hot hot fashion a fashion , and , for this transgrsion , was a mitter at the forced for seven years .
The pain of Tibet can be insopportability , but the spirit of the people is from the present .
It turns out to a choice .
We want to live in the world world &apos;s monotonies , or we want to get the world policy ?
The great anthrologist Margaret Mead , before we die said that his largest landscape was that , in our own vision to go to this vision amorage of the world , not only we &apos;ll see the whole gamma of human imagination , but a day we &apos;ll see a day day we &apos;ll see a day we will wake up with a sleep sleeping to see the gamord that there are other possibility .
And it &apos;s a humiliating that our species is exist for 600,000 years .
The Neolitica Revolution , which has given us agriculture , which has been made us overfight on the seed , replace by replace , by replace , by making the poetry of the skin with the next clapping , creating the 10,000 years ago .
The modern world industrialized has to be 300 years .
That shared story doesn &apos;t suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to have to be in the millennia to come .
When to these myriades of the world is asked what you to say to be human , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all reflip over the possibility of being what we are : a kind of conscious species , that has to make all the people and the garden can fix .
I took this on the north of Baffin , when I went to cover of the whale ised whale with Inuit , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , and the man , Olaya , and the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The government is not always gentile with the Inuit &apos;s been the world , in the &apos; 50s to stbilire our supremacy , we &apos;ve been asked them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refuted to go .
The family , I &apos;m theme for his life , and he took them all the topic .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t get the cold , they do it .
The pieces of the sliters were made of fish fish were made of weighed fish .
The grandfather of this man didn &apos;t intimidded by the night or the bard that was suffering .
It &apos;s been disgacked , it &apos;s hot the pantalons in the skin in and defected in their hand . When I did it was frozen , and they work with a moon .
He &apos;s got salive on the dramppped of this caccounts and when it became solid , he killed a dog .
He shake the dog and created a brillighter , with the toracy , and he &apos;s got a slitta , he &apos;s imbrillied another dog , and it &apos;s disappear to the bankisa , and it &apos;s disappear to .
Let &apos;s go to talk about horrist with nothing ? &#91; Ris&#93; And that , in different ways , &#91; Applausers &#93; is the symbol of the people of the Inuit and the symbol of the world &apos;s resilience .
In the bears 1999 , the Chinese government has reduced to Inuit &apos;s control of a larger area of the largest land of California and Texas a lot of Texas mapes together .
It &apos;s their new pathries . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a independent land . They &apos;re all the minerary resources .
One mark of example of how a nation-state can reconciate with his people .
And , to end , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious to the people of us have been in these remote areas of the planet , and I realized that they &apos;re not remote .
For somebody is home .
They represent seats of human imagination that they &apos;re at the alba of time . And for us all of these children , like the dreams of these children , as the dreams , become part of the geography of hope .
And we end , we of National Geographic we are convinced that politicians will never come to anything .
We think the polemc --
&#91; Applausers &#93; not persuasively , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month our site .
156 countries transmit &apos;s going to be the television .
Our magazines are licenses from millions .
Our work is traveling in the ethnosphere to bring our public places in the world of wonderful cultural , in the world &apos;s going to be abled by how they saw and , and hopef, abbracing for the central reveal , the world of exist . And we have to find a lifestyle in a world of life . And we have to find a livestyle in a world of life in a world pluralist and multiculticulticultical and the covered that we have the recovered in a world in a world in a world in a life in a world in a
where the wisdom of all the people can contribution to our well-being welled .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that book I hope you &apos;re going to call some links , and I &apos;m going to tell you some links , in the case you &apos;re not notice .
I &apos;d like to start with what I call &quot; the &quot; dogma . &quot;
The dogma official what ?
The dogma official of all the West industrial society . The dogma official . The dogma official , &quot; If we want to massize the well-being of our citizens . &quot;
The reason , on one side , in fact that the freedom is in itself , in fact , it &apos;s precious , essential , essential , for human beings .
On the other one of us can be free , each of us can act for all of us , and we can act for all that that we have a lot of our well-being , no one that decide in our well-name .
The way to massize freedom is massize choice .
More choices have , more more libers , and the more is their freedom , the greater well-being .
This , I think , it &apos;s so deeply rown in the society that nobody would be dream of going to put it in doubt .
And it &apos;s deeply rown in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what the progress has made .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m going to put me a simple note about the conditions .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without contar the 10 variety of olium extreme of olized oldest of the 15 blocks that you can buy for a huge number of conducting the 15 of the same thing that nobody of 15 .
Here &apos;s what the supermarket is .
Then you go to the electronic store to buy a stereo : cast , lettor CD , radio , plastra , light , light , light , light , light , light , light , light , bulullificator .
And in this single store store , there &apos;s a big number of audio components .
We can make six million different combinations using the components that there are in a only store .
You have to put it that there &apos;s tanti-very , very ,
Other fields : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a kid , they could get all the telephones that were desire , at the same time , at Mma Bell .
They were born the phone , you didn &apos;t buy it .
A consequence of that , in the other , was that the phone never crypa .
These times are gone .
Now we have a variety of phones , especially between the cell cell phones .
Here &apos;s the cell phones .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , he was caught , and forcing in the snose , and forth of the kitchrole .
If you &apos;re not seen it in the store , you &apos;re very well certain that I &apos;ll get it .
And what &apos;s the end happens is that people come in in the store and does this question . And what is the answer ? The answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t make any tropes .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important acquished acquists , it &apos;s the same explosion choices .
And there is health . It doesn &apos;t happen to the United States that you &apos;re going to go from the doctor and say , what you have to do .
Instead , you &apos;re doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; Well , we could do it , or a B , &quot; What has these benefits and these benefits . &quot; It has these benefits and these benefits . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Dr. you say , &quot; Dr. , what should I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; At it &apos;s these benefits , and these benefits these benefits , and the benefits . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you get to say , &quot; Dr. if she was me , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not like she . &quot;
The result of the malated &quot; autonomy of the malarise , &quot; expression that it looks like .
But it &apos;s not that one to move the weight and responsibility to make decisions that somebody knows something , which is the doctor , to someone else that &apos;s no one of it -- and almost certainly it &apos;s sick -- and it doesn &apos;t know anything -- and it doesn &apos;t know anything -- and it &apos;s not a condition -- and so it doesn &apos;t have the patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing of pharmaceutical products , direct to people like me and you , that if you think it &apos;s no sense , because we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why do they advert them ?
The answer is that they want to ask you to ask them to ask them to ask them to ask them .
Something of that , as we &apos;re our identity to be a question of choice , as you see in this living , &quot; We don &apos;t want to forced children . They &apos;re not going to forced the time . They &apos;re not going to get an identity : we have to invent .
And we can reinventing us how many times we aggrade it .
which means that every morning , at the saving , you have to decide that kind of person .
I &apos;m going to the family and matririst , a common time time , the perspective , almost for anyone , was that it was that you had a little bit more , and it started to make the most preserved , and then it started to make the most possible possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and even what do after .
I mean , it &apos;s really to play .
I teach students very smart , and I &apos;m going to get 20 percent in less of work than a time .
And not because they &apos;re less brilliant , not because they &apos;re less diligant .
But why are they imthoughtful , &quot; I mean , I would say , &quot; I would be going to do it now ? &quot;
&quot; I should be going to get away later ? I have to think before the kids or the career ? &quot;
They &apos;re logorants .
And they &apos;re trying to answer these questions , even if this implica not complete the homework that I don &apos;t get a beautiful voice to my exame .
And they have to really do it . They &apos;re important questions .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , as Carl underneath , because technology allows us to work every day , every day , from all day , every day , from the Hotel Randolph .
And it &apos;s a angle , and I didn &apos;t tell anybody what the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this incredible liberations of choice we have about this work ? Is it that we have to continually decide , continually , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing hot , with the phone in a pocket , the Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the binknees , and the notebook , and the note , the gocneize .
And even if they &apos;re all spending , every minute we see our son reovaries , we &apos;re also asking us , &quot; I have to answer this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? I have to email this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , &quot; all this makes the experience of your son very different than the game .
So , from any time , we look , little and big things , the materials and lifestyle , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : That &apos;s all of the possibilities , but it wasn &apos;t a question of choice .
The world today is a good thing about this : The dilemma is , &quot; Is it a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is .
We &apos;ve been in the positive lets . So I &apos;m going to talk about the negative .
All of this choice is two negative effects of people .
The first , paradoxygen , it &apos;s that it &apos;s paralysis .
With many options between which choose , becomes very difficult to do it .
I give you a significant example : a study of the flip plans .
A colleague had access to Vanguard data , the giant society of pension , with about a million clients , with about a million clients of the employees in 2,000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of adhhhesive down two percent .
With 50 sources , there &apos;s 10 percent in less than adhhhhhhhit &apos;s available to only five . Why ?
Because with 50 sources of which choose , it &apos;s sick to decide , and choice is reduced to the intomorrow .
And in tomorrow , and tomorrow , tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course , tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course , tomorrow , and of course , tomorrow
You know , it doesn &apos;t only mean that these guys are going to be able to dog , because they &apos;re not going to have enough money , you know , the decision is so unexpected the funny of the dator &apos;s dums .
They &apos;re not going to participate , they &apos;re losing to five dollars for a year from the dator of work , which would be well disposing them .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think that &apos;s made the world .
&quot; And to end , for ethernity : ketchup , or maionese , or maionese ? &quot;
You would like to make the right decision , if it &apos;s for the ethernity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong wrong , and yet the wrong condition .
So that &apos;s the first effect . The second is that even if we can avoid the paralysis and to the end , we &apos;re less satisfacts from the result of how we would have been with less options .
And that &apos;s about different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of conditions that you choose , and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would be better . And what happens is the alternative . And what happens is that the imaginative imagined us to the hamong the choice , and the repisssatisfaction from the decision ,
even when it was a good decision .
More choices , there &apos;s easier displease , any detail that &apos;s insodisplease .
And it &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has clarify very well , how the value we &apos;re depends on the things that we &apos;re confronted .
On the rest , when there are many options of possible options , it &apos;s easy to represent the alternative features of alternative shown and be less sationffying about option of the option that you have choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m sorry with everybody who are not in New York .
But that &apos;s what you probably think .
There &apos;s this copy to Hamptons .
A lusse place .
He &apos;s about splendida . Ottttle newspaper . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not missing . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , malition , it &apos;s Agust . &quot;
&quot; All my neighbors to Manhattan is away . &quot;
&quot; I could park right in front of home . &quot;
And it goes to two weeks later from the idea that &apos;s losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The costo-opportunity decreatures decreatures for what we have , even when the choice is excellent .
And the more are the options that we have to think , more the actual characteristics of us will be going to be constantly to be constantly for opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
It &apos;s about the moment , and maybe of the living slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you choose , you choose to not do the other .
The things that we don &apos;t choose many attractive attractive that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : the increasing of the expectations .
I tried to my skin bought a new couple of jeans .
I &apos;m always always always jeans .
Once the jeans were just like , they bought and they were willing them , they were uncomfortable , they were uncomcomfortable , just after they brought them a life and washed a lot of times , they started to go .
So , I went to buy a couple of them again when the old old old people were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
And the bet said , &quot; You know , you know , &quot; What does the fit , fit ? &quot;
You know , I want to look at the clothing ? &quot; Stonejjjjjjjjjejjjjjjjjejjjejjjejjjejjobs , &quot; or &quot; ? &quot;
&quot; You know , &quot; Do you want ? &quot;
&quot; You know , you want to do it or stretch ? Bla &apos;s &quot; Continulian elenjoy .
I was sballoon , and after a little bit I was able to say , &quot; I want the guy that was the only guy , which was the only guy , I was a little bit of them , and I was a jeans , then I came out of the jeans , and I went out the best couple of jeans that ever had .
It was the very very well . I had the best .
But I was worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse that I was that with all of that choice , my jeans had to be perfect .
And I was minimum waiting . I didn &apos;t expect anything that was in the remarkable when it was a kind of 100 different , but when you saw 100 different , steady , at least a kind of thing .
What I had been buried was , but not perfect .
After I started the chose with what I was insodly , I was insodly to the expectations .
The adds of options in life of people don &apos;t do that to increase the expectations that have respect to the excellence of the same options .
And that &apos;s going to produce less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world &apos;s supposed to do it .
Because if they knew it , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more to that .
&quot; It was better when it was worse , &quot; The reason why it was better when it was worse that when you was worse , you know , when you was worse , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , when it was worse , you know , when you &apos;re worse , &quot;
In fact , in the world where we live -- opultimate , industrialized citizens with the waiting for perfetion -- the very very , we can hope is that things are at the expectations .
You never surprised it . You &apos;ve ever been pleasant to be pleasant , my waiting , you &apos;re ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Baswaiting it . &quot;
I mean , I &apos;m a little authographic moment -- which I &apos;m really really married .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t have to do better , I was acked .
But it &apos;s not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of the bought a couple of jeans , when there &apos;s just that kind of jeans is that when you &apos;re not satifffed , and you say , &quot; Why ? &quot;
And who &apos;s responsible ? &quot; The answer is clares .
The world is responsible . What could I do ?
When you have hundreds of jeans , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re the responsible , and you ask the responsible , it &apos;s okay .
You could have better .
With hundreds of variety available , there are no excuse for the insuccessful .
So when people take decisions , even if the result is valido , you feel inssatisfacfaces and damage the cold to their own .
In the last years , depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a factor factor -- not the only , but important -- of this waving depression is just that people have deludent experiences because the standard are too altitude .
And when they have to explain this situation think the cold is .
So the end result is that we &apos;re better , but we &apos;re worse , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the dogma official , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely filled . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little choice of it &apos;s better than having any time , but it wasn &apos;t going to be a lot more choice is better than a little bit .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic value . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve got a piece of the level where they choices make our life .
Now , from the political point -- I almost finished -- I almost finished by the political point , the nocy is the follow .
What allows all this whole choice in industrial society is the wealth of the material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that too too much choice .
The problem is that they have too pite .
So the faccenters that I &apos;m talking about is a malleaves of modern , reaunal society .
And what it makes you depressing and angry is this : Steve Levitt talked about yesterday and comfortable seats for a lot of money . It &apos;s a weightful of money . It &apos;s a spreading of money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and dispendiose , it &apos;s not just useful .
I &apos;m deleteries .
They &apos;re worst worse .
If a little bit of what we are in our society allows you to have a few choice , in the people have too few possibilities , it &apos;s not just their life to make it better , but also our own life .
This is what economists call a improvement of the economic pareeean .
A redistribution of income distribution of the income distribution of this , not only to poor -- because of this choice in it .
And I mean , &quot; You &apos;re all , you can become what you want . &quot;
You , people of culture , you think , &quot; What do you think about that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious you can &apos;t do anything in a glass of glass . &quot;
&quot; A imagination , a limited vision of the world --
I &apos;m going to go to this , I was like this , at the beginning .
But then , I thought , instead , I realized that the fish knows the long time .
Because the reality of the fact of the fact is that if you &apos;re missing the boccia , so that you can &apos;t get the freedom .
If you break the boccia in a way that all divents you can diminize the satisfation .
You get the paralysis , and you &apos;ll reduce the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost course too stretch , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic , is a recipe for inhappiness and , I &apos;m going to get it .
Thank you .
