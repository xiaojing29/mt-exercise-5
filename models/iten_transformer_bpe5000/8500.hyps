Last year , I showed these slide slide to demonstrate that the calculus , which was about three million years has had the size of the 48 , the United States of the continent , it &apos;s restrip , it &apos;s restrip of 40 percent .
But that &apos;s the way that it &apos;s gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice of the ice .
The calculate glacial calculate is , in a sense , the heart heart of global climate system .
It &apos;s expanded up and you get away from summer .
The next next slide will be a carrelated revenue to seventually the last 25 years .
The glacies are replaced in red .
You see , you see , you expensive .
That &apos;s the ice in the inverse ice , which you &apos;re going to be summer .
You can see that the costs costs of ice or more , five years or more , is like the blood , which is a blood , here fuorized the body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s past from so .
This is a problem because the warming warming is the ground ground ground on the ocean arttttttle where there are huge amount of coal well-conzable amount of coal .
I &apos;m going to the total of the atmosphpherer-warming , that would be double , that &apos;s a lot of waste , super-layed ,
In some lagues in Alaska little proper lagues .
The professored Katey Walter of the University of Alaska team has been recently with a team a little little little at the last inverse .
Video : Wow ! Gore : Looking is well . The question is if we &apos;ll be it .
It &apos;s a reason that this scary scanning the Groenland from north .
This is a river at regime .
The ported never had to reach free free .
This is the Kangerlands , in the southern ovest of Groenland .
If you want to know how to the sea level of the sea level of the glad on the ground , here is where the sea .
These are increasing roughly .
On the other side of the planet : Antarties , the largest block of the planet .
The last month of the last month , the bulull of ice is in negative , and the Antin the Western Agygyle , which pogy on some sun sun , it &apos;s particularly relief in the sun .
Equival six feet of the actual level of acts , like Groenland .
Sulla Himalaya , the third largest block of ice , you see new laghi , which was glaghi were glacies .
40 percent of the world population has required half of the water potable to the seventually .
Sulle Anyyyard : This glad is the source of the potable water .
The took it is increased .
But when it deminded up , the same happens to water .
In California nnow , in California nnow is deminuded of 40 percent .
The sticks are in cripes .
The previsions , like you know , they &apos;re grass .
The growing growing for sure in the world door to a remarkable remarkable .
The environmentmentally are increasing a ritory of the normal and without the previous .
Four times more than the last 30 years later later , I was 75 .
This is a lot of the insustainable .
If you look at the sub-historic context , you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we &apos;ve got 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day .
Look at the middle of the Pacific area , from the Maybe , from the Maybe , and on both both the subcontinent , where there is a radical impoversional seventually impoverts of oxygen in the oceans .
The greater causes of global warming , together to the deforestation , which is 20 percent , it is the use of good comfortable .
The oil is a problem , and the coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two of the world with the more emissions , and China .
And it was proponed to make a lot of other central central central .
But we &apos;re seeing a change of direction .
These are the annullated projects in the last last years and some of the versus of vers .
And so , there &apos;s a political lastonight in our country .
The industrial industrial and oil have speses 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the coal can , which is a douse-flit .
And that &apos;s the picture recreceived me --
I know , I &apos;m Natal , where I live , where I saw , there was a loss of 3.8 billion liers of the coal flowers .
Maybe you have seen on the news .
This is the second largest flusual flow in America .
It &apos;s happened around the Natal .
The public advertia of the industrial industrial industrial industrial .
Video : Suret carbon , it &apos;s a kind of a very very alleg .
It &apos;s ababove here in America , and it makes our economy .
It &apos;s more pulit .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and the work work are going to be pend .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The largest minerary society in the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : I &apos;m going to be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelos. I &apos;m not saying what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima Clima has launched two campaign .
This is a part of them .
Video : The ALergy : The ALergy we see the climate change as a minaces of our business .
So , to this priorities is invest a huge amount of money in a very very high amount of money in a waste to make public public public and confused the truth .
In fact , the coal is not spork .
We think it &apos;s pulit -- it &apos;s also a good profumo .
So , not premimise to climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : The Attore : CC. I &apos;m you &apos;ve heard a lot of a lot .
So , let &apos;s do a little bit about the structure at the avantex .
Straordinariarily !
The consumption of coal warming is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology , but the remarkable technology that you see everything .
You have a look at this is the odiern technology of the coal fuel .
Al Gore : Inally , the positive alternative is connected to the economic security and the natives of the natives .
Video : Does America is in cripes ; the global economy , the nation-security , the climate crisis .
The philo that connection to all our dependence from the combustible , as the coal fuel , as the coal fuel .
Now , but , there &apos;s a new new , audace solution to use .
Really , 100 percent of energy , in 10 years .
A plan to remate America , to make us more sure , and help stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that basts to solve our problems .
Really , America . Scoin-more .
Al Gore : This is the last last .
Video : You know , it &apos;s about rerequires to America .
One of the faster ways of remarkable ways to dependence from the combustible that killing our planet .
Sun : The future is here . I feel , sun , a new network .
Does a number two : Numumber two , they &apos;re very very much more retributed .
So , I mean , America . It &apos;s time to be realististic .
Al Gore : A old provered African African African says , &quot; If you want to go to the speed , go from soli .
If you want to go away , you go together . &quot;
We have to go back , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I did a introduction on the LHC .
And you promised to return to return to the machine .
So , they comi here . And for the other time , the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever attempted -- 27 kilometers of circles .
And his task is to reach the conditions that were presents less than a billion dollars a second second from the universe -- until 600 million times the second universe -- until 600 million times the second .
All this is just environmental .
This is the machine under Ginevra .
And I &apos;m going to be a little bit in the remarkable .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- is about 44 meters and has a diameter diameter diameter diameter .
This is a picture of ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLAS .
The 10 secember last year we &apos;ve got the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLATLAS .
It was because of immense , in the room of control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first fascinating particles that had been doing all the around the LHC , entring in the LHC , and splision particles , with a part of the HC , and spread particles in the remarkable .
In other words , when we see that image the ember 10 sector , understand that the machine was a great vittory .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to make us more optired , or this , when somebody went on Google and saw that the page was this .
That means we &apos;ve had a cultural impact on the scientific scientific impact .
It &apos;s just a week later , it was a problem with the machine , it had to these films here -- these films ms -- these films ms .
These files take 13,000 ampampating when the machine works at the massive power .
Now , the technical between you will look at the films and they &apos;ll be , &quot; I &apos;m not true . I &apos;m too good . &quot;
And instead of them can do it because they &apos;re very cold to become the substers .
So , at least 271 degrees , at a nurse temperature to the space between stars , these files can bring that current .
In one of the giunture between the magnetic the magnetic in the LHC , there was a difest of factoration .
So the films are going to be shall over the mind , and 13,000 ampampssent consequently they met a resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think that these magnetic magnetic fish , and that they were moved about 30 centimeters .
It &apos;s been dramatic .
We had to task them , what we did .
We &apos;ve got repressed and reached .
They &apos;re going to come back to them to the back back .
The end of the LHC is going to be new .
We &apos;ll be going to enjoy , and we expect to get data to judgggged , and continue so our adventure to find what the universe is .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents requires re-based on value of the science and engineering engineering engineering .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so difficult , the fact that it &apos;s the value of the things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of a Inglad Inglese , Humphrey , which , I think , in the difense of the unttent of his puplle , his pupppppped it was Michael Faraday , said , &quot; No , &quot; is a danger for the progress of the defining of the definition of the definition of the definition .
Thank you .
I want to start asking obvious of represents when , you &apos;re going to do with the morning .
While you understand how to reach them and make them , and you learn them , and they learn to think and to think and to think and to be able to think and the problems of the space .
The space is deeply connected to the way we understand much much part of the world around us .
So , by the inspired by the useful of our interaction with physicists , together to my consultant , and my collaborator , and my collaborator .
and put it in our pleasure ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the Sifty .
In powers , a Siftable is a big interactive computer like a biscope .
In powers , a Siftable is a big interactive computer like a biscope .
You can move with your hand , they can see it , &quot; you can see , &quot; between them , feel the right and they have a screen and a radio wireless .
But most of the way , they &apos;re physicists , like the morning , you can move to move it .
The Sifty is the example of a new ecosystem ecosystem .
And as they become more physicists , conscious of the right movement , of the other , the man who become more physicists , conscious of the movement , the other , of the other , of the other , of the other , of the other , of the interaction .
And I &apos;ll start with some simple example .
This Sifty is configured to show video : if you &apos;re going to see video : if you &apos;re going to be so if you &apos;re going to be so if you &apos;re going to get back .
These remarkable interactive is configures .
If you affect them , they &apos;re interested in .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can be agited a little bit .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can be agited a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realize that one of the interesting interesting interesting interaction was the interaction of the interaction was the way to use of the data , to example , &quot; a color like if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurated like to the green , and I can use them to make it to be able to use it .
And I can use them to put it in the central color , where they &apos;re going to be .
If we &apos;re too too , we can get a little place .
I &apos;m also beautiful possibility of the ability to apprecise , like the ing-joyling , where people can try to try things quickly , and see the results of the immediately .
I &apos;m going to be --
This is a sequence of Fibonacks that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a game of words that is at half between Scarabeabeo and Boggle .
It &apos;s basically , at every turning a letter , you know about every Sifty , Pratatically , to every turnnone of the Sifty , and when you &apos;re trying to understand him on a dionary .
And then , after about 30 seconds of remissing , and you have a new set of letter and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the children came to the Media Lab , I did it in a Media Lab , I &apos;ve been made a video .
They were very much .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of applied is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot .
You just have to say , &quot; You know , &quot; You know , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here is other people who try it .
This is our little young young young young , there , there &apos;s the right .
It was really wanted to impleased them .
They were just morning .
Now , this is an interactive applied .
We wanted to build a tool for the appreneurse . He &apos;s Felix .
It can make new characters in the scene , solving the Sifties , they &apos;re going to do it .
It can make new characters in the scene , solving the Sifties , they &apos;re going to do it .
Here &apos;s doing it .
Video : The sun is sun .
David Merrill : Now he took a treatment in the scene .
Video : The treat the treatment .
Bel work !
So , you shake the Sifties and put it can make the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing your story .
Video : Hao !
DM : It &apos;s a story with the final final , and it can decide him as you get .
DM : It &apos;s a story with the final final , and it can decide him as you get .
Video : Vola , gat .
DM : The last example that I &apos;ve got a tool , I made of a tool , and I &apos;ve got to make music .
It &apos;s a device , I did for the campeck and execting music .
The Siftable here are songs , like the base , and bacteria .
Ogngnant one of these has four different variations , and you can use .
You can also get these sounds in a sequence to compose to your pleasure .
And it just doing it just touch a sound &quot; sound and a sequence . &quot;
These are actually you can control from the vivious , as the reverse and the filter .
The acks to a particular sound and then incline for travel .
And then there are general , as long and volume , and it &apos;s the whole sequence .
We &apos;re going to look like .
Video : DM : We &apos;ll try to do it a base in two Sifttttle , &quot; we put a series , the testing , we add another base .
Now , I &apos;m going to put a line .
Video : DM : Now I &apos;m going to add to percussions --
Video : DM : And I &apos;ll put the filter in battery , so I can control the effect from the vivious .
Video : DM : You can make the whole sequence of inclining the whole sequence of the other side or from the other side .
Video : DM : And now I &apos;ll add the bottom to the bottom to give more expression .
Video : DM : You can make the sequence of the volo . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to be planning , but I can suddenly , make it more than the cord .
And now , I can smoking the whole sequence of inclining to the left Sifty . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new interfacts of the brain is more more like the work as they work as they work our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this perspective , and also some chance we try to get out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmitted to the new generation of objects designed to interact with the digital media , which will be information in our world .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the now of all of you .
I &apos;m a scritice .
See books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the fascinating of my life .
And I don &apos;t know what it can change .
But , said , this something that was happened in my life and in my career , and I took me to reef the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I wrote this book , this biography called &quot; Mangia , Prega , Am , Am , Am , &quot; which , diversity from my my world and became a big sensitive sensitive , and I &apos;m going to be a big sensitive sensitive sensitive .
And the result is that everywhere , people are now , people treated me like if I was conducted .
It &apos;s true -- conducted , conducted !
They &apos;re going to be now all worried and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t have the most to do you do better ?
You don &apos;t have a little bit of write for all life without the more to make a book that can be able to create a book that can be able to somebody ? &quot;
What can you know ? &quot;
It &apos;s rough , you know .
But it might be worse , I remember that I was going to be more than 20 years ago , when I was a adolescent -- I was a clower -- I was a scritice .
And I was going to be reaction on the landscape .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you have to have successful ?
You don &apos;t have the painting of the refigured you ?
You don &apos;t have the painting of this to be a little bit of life without nothing to come out and die on a cumb cumped to a cumb cums with the cums of failure ? &quot;
You know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; You know . &quot;
You know , I &apos;m afraid of all those things .
I &apos;ve always had painting .
And I also have a lot of other things that people would not be able .
How the alge and other things spaves .
But , as I &apos;m talking about write what I was , and I &apos;d ask me , why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logic that anybody should expect to be spaved by a job that you have sent sevent to do .
But what is that there is a particular particular in the creative impressed to the mental health as well as well as much of the mental health .
How my father , he was a chemist and he was a chemist and I don &apos;t remember a single time in his 40 years of activity in the activity that was asked if it was a engineer ?
He was never -- that block of the engineer , like this ?
It didn &apos;t work so , you know ?
Onestly , engineers like a group didn &apos;t have , in the chemistry of the reputation of being alcolized depressive .
We have a writers , we have enough this reputation , and not only creative . But we have this reputation of being huge unless unmentally .
And it &apos;s not going to look at the tristes of the magniques of the magniffying creative that , only in the 20th century , they &apos;re young and often for them .
And also the ones that they don &apos;t seem to be really disappeared by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before we die , in the last interview said , &quot; Every book has killed me a little more . &quot; A little bit more . &quot; A little bit more .
But we don &apos;t say when we feel that we feel about this stuff , because we heard these things very long , we &apos;ve been interested in a few of the way we &apos;re totally interiorized and the suffering are somehow how much of the angosence and the art , the end , the end , the end , the end , the end , and the end is going to be in the angosent , and the end , the end , and the end , the end , you will always be going to
And the question I want to ask to the all of this today is : you do this idea ?
It &apos;s good for you , because it also look at a centimethththrow of me not good for nothing this supposition .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s dangerous , and I don &apos;t want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better encourage to live .
And I think , in my case -- in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start to the covered to the circumstances , all of the circumstances in my career .
I &apos;m going to be -- I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I &apos;ve still about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything I &apos;m going to write from now in the world , as the work that was after the world , as the work that was after the spaves of my last book .
I &apos;m going to slavor , because we &apos;re all more or -- it &apos;s likely that my greatest success is to my spread .
Oh , Gesus , &quot; You know !
You know this is the kind of thinking that &apos;s a person to start to start dinner to the nine in the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I &apos;ll stop it continue to do this work we do .
So , the question is , what is it &apos;s going to be , how ?
And so I &apos;m going to be , after many reflying , which the way to keep to write is to make a psychological design , OK ?
I had to find a distance of safety between me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural natural natural natural thing that I &apos;m going to get to be able . And , as I was trying to do it with the time , trying to find out of other society to see if they could have have some of the best ideas and more more .
How to help people people who are creative to manage the emotional inherent .
And that research has taken me to the Great and old Rome .
You do do it for me , and then I do it .
In the Great Great and ancient Rome -- people don &apos;t seem to believe that the creative creativity came from men , OK ?
It was thinking that the creative spirit is looking at the divine and that sell people from a few people from a few undistant and unknown .
The great-called these spirits look at the devices of the demons . &quot;
Soccurred , he believed to have a demon a demand .
The Romans were the same idea , but they called the idea of the body .
The Romans didn &apos;t think that a Romans didn &apos;t think that a genius was a very smart .
They were believed that a genius was this kind of divin that he believed literally in the dogue of a study of a neighborhood , a little bit like the elevent , and it came out to the point of the artist of the artist and model of the artist and model of the result of the work .
Here &apos;s etional -- here is the distance of which is the distance of the thing that you get from the results of your work .
And everyone knew that was so that it was , right ?
So , the antic artists were protected by certain things , like for example , the too narcism , no ?
If your work was excited to be able to be able to take and all the merge , all they were helped by this genium encourcoureum .
If your work failed , it was not all your work , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genium to be a inable .
And so people han concept of the people who think in the West for a long time .
And then the Rince came and everything came and changed , and they &apos;re going to be the human idea in the universe , over all of the universe over the universe over over the universe and mysters without the sweet creatures that they said from the divinity .
This was the principle of humanity and people started thinking that creativity came to think that creativity came from the idivided to the iduo .
And for the first time in history , you understand it to reference this artist or the artist as a rather than a genium person with a genium .
And I have to say , I think it was a big mistake .
I think it &apos;s allowed to somebody , a simple person to believe that I &apos;m like a recipe , the essence and the sweweet people &apos;s the unseen and the life-constable and the ercauses of a phillion , a phillion .
It &apos;s like to ask somebody of ingoare .
It &apos;s really distores the ego and believe all these ingesession of the performance .
And I think it was this pressed to be destroying artists in the mistake .
And , if this is true , and I think it &apos;s , the question is , and now ?
Can we do it diversity ?
And I &apos;ll go back to a more ant-relationship with human relationship between humans and mystation .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can &apos;t be going to be 500 years of the rational talk in a 18 minutes .
And there is probably people between the audience that solleverage would be very good , the notion of the notion of , insusuit , you do it &apos;s going to be dramatic .
It &apos;s probably not going to convince you all about this thing .
But the question I would like to take is -- why not ?
Why don &apos;t you think it in this way ?
Because it has more sense of anything else that has ever heard to explain the exassusuing exassusume of the creative process .
One process that , as anybody who never tried to do something -- so , basically , all here -- you don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t know rationally .
And , in fact , it can sometimes look completely paranorous .
I did this instrument with the extraordinary poeeted poeeted Stone , which has been a poeetly poeer for all life and said that in his childhood , working on his childhood , working out in the Virginia , and it was out in the camps , and I felt it was coming in the camps .
He said , it was like a frorous frorous .
And it was going to be ring to her from the landscape .
It felt it goes to the ground , because it could be tremendous land under his feet .
He knew that I had a only thing to do to do that point and was , his words , &quot; to go to the point and he was , &quot;
And so it was going to go to the house and it was done by this poem , and it wouldn &apos;t have to make a piece of paper and a piece of paper and a pretty quickly quickly , and it was going to be going to be in the page .
Sometimes , I couldn &apos;t be fast enough , so correded and correct without the waste to the house and correds without getting to the house and she was going to be going to go through and her performed to the landscape , trying to go through the landscape , and he said , &quot; another poet . &quot;
And then there were those times -- this piece never dimentional -- there was never -- there was a little time .
So , he was going to go home and was trying to paper and the poem of paper and it was a matched in the way that was going to go , and then he was like it , he was like , if you were going to be hell with the other hand and the office .
It was the poem from code and the canded the body and transcated the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the page , but the next word at the last word .
So when I felt -- it &apos;s pathesk , it &apos;s exactly the ugual to my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conducucucucture .
I &apos;m a mule , and my way of work is ; I sweapons on the same orarise every day and sweet it .
But I have , in my testestyard , I &apos;m strised against that thing , sometimes .
And I think it also many of you hhan made .
You know , even though the work and ideas came to a certain source of a certain source of a certain source I couldn &apos;t be honestly .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it to it not performing the head , but , rather , what &apos;s going to do is sample ?
So , as I &apos;m about , the best example of the same , I have the musician Tom Waits , which I &apos;ve interviewed in a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life was the incard of the artist of the artist of the artist of the replaced artist .
But then I &apos;ll invecked , and he was driving on a day , and a day he was driving on a Los Angeles , changes all .
He was going to be fast and all of a little bit of a little framing of melodia , which comes in his head as inspiration , and it &apos;s a hallalling , and the desypeck , and the desycle , but it doesn &apos;t know how to take it .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a big piece .
So , I started to feel this kind of thing to be growing in him , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to be able to be employees .
I &apos;m not good enough , and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to go into the panic , you stop .
It &apos;s going to mit the whole process and made something completely new new .
And he just looked at the sky and said , &quot; I &apos;m not going to see that I &apos;m going to be driving ? &quot;
&quot; Ti seems to be able to write a song now ?
If you really want to be , you can get more more than a moment , when I can take care of you .
Altrain , you &apos;re going to be something else today .
You know , I &apos;m going to disturbing Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his process changed after this .
Not the work , it was still hoscy as always .
But the process , and the fish was that attempted it was reduced when he took the genium , the genium that was caused to him to be a little bit of problems and the trade it came back to the back where they were doing it was not to be a thing about it .
But this peculiar , wonderful , wonderful bizarra collaboration with Tom and this straign &apos;t .
So , how the story that I felt that story to change a little bit also the way I was working and already saved me a time .
This idea , I saved when I was writing , &quot; Maneating , Prega , &quot; and falling in a cave of the disperation that we &apos;re going to be working on something and we &apos;re working on something and we &apos;re working on something and start thinking that it will be the worst book .
Not just good , right the worst book wrote .
And I started thinking about geting this project .
But then I remember Tom that I talked to the air and try .
So , I get my face in the way , I &apos;ll get my comments to a vacuum of the room .
And I said to high vices , &quot; Sents , what , both know that if this book is not going to be good cold .
Because I &apos;m going to see it all I &apos;m going to do , I don &apos;t have this more than that .
So if you want to be better , you have to presented and make your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know , I don &apos;t have any .
I &apos;ll be doing it .
And I &apos;d like to do for the argue that I was presented to me to do my part of the eventually , OK -- I &apos;m going to do my side of the North people were dance to the dance of the North of the North of the North of the North of the East of the East of the ham of the North .
And they were always magniflew , because the herins were professional and they were fantastic .
But every time , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became actually transcending .
And I know what I know about what I know , because I know that you have seen , a sense , a performance .
It was like the time , you &apos;re stopped , and the ballerin a kind of portal and not was doing nothing different from usual , and it was not different , but everything was going to be done .
And suddenly , you don &apos;t look like a human human .
But it &apos;s happening from the diagnosed in the fire of divinity .
And when this happened , you know , people knew what was , the people knew what was , called his name .
They were going to be the hands and started dying , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curious notice -- when the Mors invased Mors invased the Spagna , I was this abstrstrike with them and it changes in the search . &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , &quot; &quot; Ole , &quot; I can still hear in the corrids or in the flamenk .
In Spages , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , I &apos;m going to do , &quot; Allah , I &apos;m going to understand , &quot; unlike , &quot; I understand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alah , it &apos;s a bunch of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need .
But the problem is the next day , for the next day , for the same time , when you get the daughter and find that are the 11 of the morning and I &apos;m going to go down .
It &apos;s just a dumping to the ginockey , and maybe it &apos;s never going to each each to each each to to that althetic .
And maybe nobody will be the name of God still , and what must do with God . So , what &apos;s to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most peckitch to make in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so angoscivant if you can &apos;t believe , advanced the most extraordinary , which is the most extraordinary .
But it just makes you just data in the prestired of a source of a kind of a kind of a kind of part of your life that you have to get something else when you get .
And , you know , if we think in this way .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s because I thought about a few months in the working of the book that I &apos;m going to be able , the dangerous , the dangerous dangerous , and I &apos;ll be done in my great great .
And what I have to keep saying to me when I feel like this is , I feel not that they don &apos;t have paking .
Don &apos;t get you . It &apos;s just your work .
You &apos;re going to presented for your part , any can be .
If your work is balling , you know , you know .
If the divin , you &apos;ll get a decide to you get a decide to let me get a little bit of wonderful , for a moment through your forforces , then &quot; Ole . &quot;
Only , you do it .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot;
I think it &apos;s going to teach it .
&quot; Ole ! &quot; &quot; You know , even only for having a human love and testestytttttals from to represent .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
You know , I &apos;ve been talking about some of these these projects on the human genome , about what can significant and discovery of new genes .
We &apos;re going to start with a new perspective : we started digital biology and now now to start from that digital code , we &apos;re going to get into a new fase of biology , designing and synthththesizing life .
We always tried to ask the big questions .
&quot; What is the life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists I think they have to be able to understand vary .
We tried different different tricks , reduced it to minimes .
We &apos;re digitizing from 20 years .
When we &apos;ve been sequenced the human genome was to go from the world analogical world of the digital world .
Now , let &apos;s ask : We can we regenerate life , or to create a new life of this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genitalium .
And we tried to reduce the genome to believe a little little bit more .
We can get to eliminating a hundred geneuuary about 500 .
But when we look at his map map of the map , it &apos;s relatively simple to our map .
It &apos;s a simple thing .
But when we look at all the genes we can get , one at time , it &apos;s very imlikely to make a living cell cell .
So , we decided that the only one on the design of the design of this cromosome in a way to be able to be to be able to be able to be able to take some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the avoid of the &quot; can we synthesize a cromosome ? &quot;
Can the chemical demonstrates these big molecules that are never done to create before ?
And , in case , we can make a cromosome ?
A cromosome is just a piece of chemical material .
The speed with which we can digalize life is growing growing up to the rethink of life is growing up .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , and I refinding rather lently , but it &apos;s better .
And our most recent results the results of a curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process has required a lot of passes , starting with a review before the first experiments .
But we discovered that synthesize DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that make little segment of DNA , of the long chains of 30 losness and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the most errors are .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these frament frament and correct the mistakes .
And this was our first attempted , to start by digital genome of Phi 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that killed bacteria .
We designed framments , effectied the correction of the mimistakes and get a molecule of about 5,000 letter .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material , and we put it in bacteria , and bacteria have started reading this genetic code and make it genetic particles .
The viral particles are then going to reduce the cells , they come back and they have been back and they destroying the Eals .
I talked about recent with members of the oil industry industry industry , say they have to them that they have all compublicly compublicly composition .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build his own hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in the big things .
We wanted to build the whole cromosome .
They &apos;re more than 580 mid-letter code .
So we thought of building it in cables of the size of the viruses of the viruses of the viruses of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequence this genome for the first time in 1995 , the way , in 1995 , the basis of a mid-based mid-based mid-based mid-based .
We &apos;ve discovered , resequence , 30 errors . If we used that sequence never would be able to do this .
A part of the process is designed to design segments that you &apos;re really sovoved to the other segments of 50 letter to build a little little little little little little little little little little little working .
We &apos;ll take it untic elements here .
You know , you know , you know , we put in the grade .
Think of it , we have a genetic code on four letter : A , C , Gs and T.
Three of those letter to mate about 20 amminoacids , and there &apos;s a specific order to letter for every amminoacids .
So we can use the genetic code to write , frasass , you think .
What we did we have done at the beginning is authograp .
Some people have been delused by fact that it wasn &apos;t poem .
We designed these segments for potential to get them just to the entirely .
There &apos;s a lot of me that reflew them together .
And we started to assembling of the parts , starting with segments from five to seven mile mile to seven mile mile to the 3-meeting to the crisis to their way to get 72 mile to 72 mile .
And at every step , we produced these segments in ababove so that we &apos;re trying to make a very very much roostoog -- like you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re looking for automatize the process .
So , this seems to be the tabellon a lot of basket .
When we get to these very long segments , more than 100 mid-based on , they don &apos;t grow more directly in the Eles .
You get to the limits of the molecular biology .
So we &apos;ve been considered other mechanisms .
We knew another mechanism called the requires , called omologist , which is useful to repect the DNA to rebuild DNA DNA segments .
Here &apos;s a example .
This organism , called Deinoccurcurrics , it can be absorb three million rad of radiation .
You can see in the top top of the top as his chromosome came to destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s required exactly like before .
There &apos;s thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be completely completely .
They can live under the vacuum .
They &apos;re absolutely absolutely absolutely sure that life in space , and you get to new environments .
In fact , NASA showed that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built using these processed processed , just using the lieventually with the design appropriate segment .
The lieventually assemsemble .
This picture was not taken with a microscope with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a molecule that we can see the little little bit of the lawinder .
These are pictures that coat a period of time .
This is the publishing published that we did a little time ago .
They &apos;re more than 580,000 letter code .
It &apos;s the largest molecule of a defined structure ever created from the man .
It has a high molecular fish .
If you &apos;re going to be a caracting to 10 without spaces , you would like 140-page code .
Now , how do we do this ? How can we do we do it ?
Obviously , tramite a virus is a game .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria are using bacteria .
It &apos;s more simple when it &apos;s euckarily , as our : you can just get nuclear , and put another , which is basically the process of clonation .
In the archaea , the chromosome is instead of integrated in the cell , but we &apos;ve been demonstrate that we &apos;re able to make a trapished a cell to a cell to a cell to a cell to another and active it .
We can clean a cromosome cromosome .
The two are different as the men from mouth .
We &apos;ve added some gene in a way that we could decide what you could be able to decide what you &apos;re going to be able to decision .
And then it &apos;s sweet with the translated to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was amazing -- and you &apos;ll be apprecise our graph -- the new sophisticatoome -- the new chromosome is coming into the cell .
And we were thinking that we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to get more , but we tried to get more in there .
This is one of the most mechanisms of evolution .
We discovered that tantissim species have added a second or a third chromosome from some part , I &apos;m going to a second thousands of trouble , and I &apos;m going to a species .
So who think about evolution as a gene only gene to the time , it doesn &apos;t understand much much of biology .
And they have been called called &quot; &quot; requires of restrial .
The cromosome was in the cell , it doesn &apos;t have a remarkable .
The cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell . We have a pit-up .
It &apos;s expressed , and recognized the other cromosome , and recognized the other cromosome , and we &apos;ve been taken with the cell and the new chromosome .
It became blue because of the genes we &apos;ve put it .
And in a short short short of time , all the feature of a species are going to be lost , and it turned out of the new new species , based on the new software .
All the proteins are changing , members are changing , members are changing , and when we do the genetic code exactly what we transfered .
Now , this may seem like , you might seem to be genetic alchemia , but it will change the stuff in a pretty well enough way .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that here is not about genesis -- but I &apos;m going to start from three million years and a half of evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the Cambriana where they will be able new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s enough when we think about our needs .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to give a example : I was born in 1946 .
Now , there are three people on the planet for every existing in 1946 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re getting problems now to find food , water fresh and water , medicine and wealth for six billion and a half billion people .
It will be more dying to do it for nine billion .
We &apos;re going to use five billion fuel billion fuel , more than 30 billion bars .
That means percent million barlier day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to repair them , it will be a huge challenge .
In the more we have to keep all of CO2 emission from these materials that finding in the atmosphere .
In today , thank you very scientific discovery in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that they &apos;re the components of the future .
The electronic industry only only a dozen of components , and think about it , and think about how many different things are solved out .
Our limits here is data , it &apos;s principles from the biological reality and from our imagination .
We have now some techniques , thank you to these methods , in order to create what we call a genomic genomic .
We can build a big robot robot that can produce a million cromosomosomes a day .
Think of processing these 20 million genes of different genetic genetic genetic processes , new new vaccines , new new vaccines , we can change , and make more biology molecular biology now in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a selection selection .
We can choose for survival , produced chemical production or chemical vaccines .
This is an ancient istic istic software with a programmed software that we &apos;re working to be able to sexize it .
Well , we don &apos;t know how they will be .
We know exactly what is their genetic code .
Now , we &apos;re focusing on the coal coal fuel .
You &apos;ve seen this extreme anol from the grade is a experiment .
We have been deeping of second and third generation that they &apos;re going to be very soon enough to the coal zuccher than the covering or different butanle .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increasing the cost of the food and limited the food food and limited the available to make CO2 in matter , the first time we &apos;re working to design cells that they can reach this purpose , and we could be the first coal of the fourth of the generation in about 18 months .
The solar solar light combined with CO2 is a methodo--- but in our discoveries in the world , we found different metods .
This is a organism that we described in 1996 .
It &apos;s going to be in the ocean , about 2,500 feet feet of the water .
They believe metan electrical hydrogen using molecular hydrogen as source of energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can incancans , which can easily be transported to tramite the CO2 in the coal , to drive this process .
So we think we might be able to be able to increase what the question of the question is , &quot; which is the life life is , &quot; We have the desert to rejugging the whole chemistry of the whole oil industry .
Except . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can &apos;t do it ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And then , we &apos;re working for the same metods to create vaccistant vaccinting .
You &apos;ve seen this year with influence , we &apos;re always back to a dollar , and with a dollar , and find the right vaccine .
I think what you can make vaccine in anticipe .
Here &apos;s how the future might start look at changing , now , the tree of evolution , accellating evolution , accelling evolution with the synthetical bacteria , arches , arches , and then euckiding cells .
We &apos;re so much from improve people .
Our purpose is to make enough to live enough enough to try to make it . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the most quickly , a few work , the new technology that we took the Microsoft in the follow to a year . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s a lot of a environment that you can interact is to the local level that remodities with a huge amount of data .
Here we &apos;re seeing many many gigabyte of digital picture with a kind of digital . And I &apos;m going to make a fast panic , so much panoring the images like we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big is the amount of information that we see , how much of data or images .
Most of the digital photos , but this for example is a scanning scanning from the Biotecececa Congress , and reentral in the Congress , and reentrephoto .
It &apos;s not a difference because the only thing that limited the presents of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen in any moment . It &apos;s also a very flessible architecture .
This is a whole book , not images of images .
This is the Casa desolate of Dickens . Every colonna represents a caple .
So , to be a lot of text and not images , we can do something like this , to be a thing , to see that it &apos;s a real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little bit artificial to read a electronic book .
I don &apos;t have a recommend .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s a number of The Guardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a sexition .
And it really gives you a little bit of read the real version of a real version of a real view or a daily mechannels , which is to nature .
We also made something with the corner of this particular number of the Guardian .
We &apos;ve created a public fashion the high resolution -- much more than that it &apos;s using a normal normal published published -- and we put it in the extra extra .
If you want to see the feature of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even specific models .
And this really ditatatails some of these ideas to get the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that this means that that you put up to the people at the people , and to get a lot of things , I didn &apos;t have to be much more .
Of course , the mapaps is a more obvious to this kind of technology .
And on this field , I don &apos;t want to lose time , if we don &apos;t say that we have to contribute to this field .
These are all the strade in the United States Sovraped over a geospatial image of NASA .
So now we &apos;re going to do something else .
This is actually from the web . You can go to the web ; you can go to see .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which fighting two different technologies .
One is Seadron and the other is a very interesting research to the computer computer .
And it &apos;s from the web , I &apos;m going to manage Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from a picture to another and have this kind of a multipil experience .
But the space of the space of the images here has actually a meaning .
The computer algorithms of the computer visualization have been taken these images together , so that I &apos;m going to the re-re-stable .
I don &apos;t know if I have a time to show you some other environment .
There &apos;s a lot of space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data of Noah--- and this is a very evidence from a Photosynth of the first time the time the first time the time the time the first time the time the time the time the key key to show you what I &apos;m going to do is the key to the key to the technology , Photosynth of the site .
We had to worry about the legal aspects and saying .
This is a reconstruction of the cattattattempties of Nobody Dame . Badigit . It &apos;s a picture that &apos;s discovered .
So , they &apos;re all images from Flickr and they &apos;re all connected to space space in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this very simple way .
You know , I never have thought of I &apos;m going to end work for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifically , we get this kind of accounts here .
I think you see that it &apos;s a lot of different kinds of different kinds of photocaming : from those cell cell cell cell cell cell cell , a significant , you know , a significant number of different kinds of things .
And if I can , I &apos;m trying to try to look at the more stranthip .
Many of them are blocked by faces , etc .
And somewhere where is a series of photographs -- eccold .
This is a poster of Nobody recorded .
We can go from the physics of this environment .
The essential is that we can do with social environment . This is to take data from the whole memory . This is taking data from the entire memory , from the whole memory -- and connection all those data together .
All those pictures become connected together , more of the susugar .
You have a model of the whole emerge .
Think of this as the prolungation of Stephen Lawler on the virtual Earth .
It &apos;s something that grow in complex man , as they are going to be , and the people use it , and the wantages to get with the use .
They &apos;re mark with metaped with a lot of people .
If somebody is the idea of contrast all these sationally said , my picture of the cattattattemptise of Nobody Dentation , I have to be dramatic , and I can use it in the space , and I can use it for immergery to the space , using picture of anybody else , and having a social experience of the kind of the kind of a cross-to-to-to-tox-to--to--to--to--to---to-----------------to-to-based experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience of the idea of the experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience experience of the idea of the ctic
In course , a consequence of all this is very very much more , and they &apos;re very much more interesting than the land , collective , and they &apos;re not just a long way of travel and satellitary memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand that ? What what your software will be be doing is that at a point , in the next few years , all the pictures of the world will be be done by anyone in the entire world will be basically connected with the world will be be princt together ?
BAyye : Yes . What &apos;s doing is doing is that .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , you know , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the images .
The thing is very interesting if you think about remarkable information that many of these images have been able to be .
As you do a research research , you know , you get a frase and the text on the web has a lot about the information to the images .
Now , what happens if that picture is connected to all your picture ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of remarkable to remarkable . It &apos;s a classic . It &apos;s a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really amazing .
BAgain : Thank you very much .
One of the main pleased when you traveling and one of the delivers of the research research is the able to live between who didn &apos;t forget the traditions , between who have the past in the wind , the hotball , you touch it in the wind , guilty , you can see it in the wind , driven in the wind , you can be the plants .
Basti thinking that the sciamans Jaguar , or the Lattea , or the mites of the Lattea , or the mites are still cold of the Dharm , or the subject , or the distinct , the distinct budget , to remember the Dharm of the Dharm , to remember the world that we live in the most sense of the world that we live in a sense of the world , but it &apos;s actually ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stirpe has done , well or bad , many generations .
And , of course , we all share trouble .
We all all do it .
We &apos;re also also a rit-ritual .
We have to deal with the death death of , so we don &apos;t surprise and we &apos;re going to do --
We all have a art art .
What it &apos;s the particular thing that &apos;s the particular one of the song , the ritory of the song , the ritory of the culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that the Penban of Borneo , or the follow of the Voodoo &apos;s Saiti , or the guerriers of the desert Kaign Kenya , the Curandwaste , the Curandwaste , or a cammellilier in the heart of the Sahara .
And he was my company company in the desert a month ago , or a month ago , or a website in the values of the world .
All these populations are going to teach us that there are other ways of exist , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And , if you think a moment , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
Insides , the miriades of cultures are a raves of the world believe a spiritual life and cultural that it wanted the planet planet and it &apos;s important to the planet as a biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural raves like a very ethnosties , you can definitely defining the total sum of all the concepts of all the concepts , inspired , and inspired , the inspiration of the consciousness .
The etnosphere is the great pathium of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbox of what we &apos;re and what we can be as unquisitive .
And because the biosphere was graved to be really less less less than it was the very very much more quickly .
No biologist , for example , it would be 50 percent of all the species is the orest of the summer of the summer is the orest , or -- in the most aptment of the most aptal -- and you don &apos;t get a little bit of biological diversity -- and you don &apos;t even get a little bit of the cultural diversity .
The one of all of that is , obviously , the perspective language .
When you &apos;re born 6,000 lingue , you know ,
One language is not composition by a wocabolarian or a series of grammaticals .
One language is the same thing .
It &apos;s the middle of the middle of which is a whole culture comes in the world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a bunch of mind , a thought , a thought , a kind of spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 lingue , as we &apos;re sitting in Monterey , at least half the half not subjecting in the orectors .
They don &apos;t get the kids , the means , less that it means , less that they &apos;re already death .
What is the most trister of being a silent , of the silence , of the last talking a language , of the last talking to a language , of the wisdom of the housness of the people or to be promised with the promising of the kids ?
This is a little bit of the world has been a few of the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks , a old language .
And I know , what somebody will say , &quot; isn &apos;t that ?
The world would be a better place if we were going to leave all the same language ? &quot;
We talk about kogi .
You &apos;ll see it &apos;s a sense of a thing to say , &quot; I don &apos;t want to talk about your language .
I &apos;d like to do you do a journey through the etnosties --
a little journey in the nosphere to give you a stretch of what we &apos;re allowed .
Many of us dimented when I say , &quot; different ways of exist . &quot; I mean , I mean , really , it &apos;s very different ways of existing .
We do for example this bimbo Barasana , in Amazon the field of the well-based , the people &apos;s anaconda &apos;s flying from the river of the west the flower .
It &apos;s a populated people that is not able to distinguish color from the green green because the time you can identify in the forest , which is identified the people .
They have a strike , and a regarguguing , &quot; exogogical exogogical language , &quot; You have to sposing a person who &apos;s talking a different language .
All this has been dramatic in the past mitological , but the particularly these families is that in these families that you &apos;re talking about six or seven ling-lands .
They limited listen and then they start talking to .
We take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived , the Waorans of Ecuador , a popular popular that had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionar-commitment .
They &apos;ve done it , by the top photographers that required them in the top of the waste , dealing that this people who had never seen nothing .
They &apos;ve been collected the picture of land , they &apos;ve been doing a form or a shape or a figuring and , not find nothing , they have been conclent that was the diavoid , and they killed the five missionary missing the lance .
But Waorans don &apos;t kill only the strange .
They were killed between them .
54 percent of mortality was caused by their own .
We &apos;re risaled to eight generations and we found two natural death and when we &apos;ve got to know , they have a lot of them was invested that one of them was invected to the same .
The capapapers were able to recognize the animal from 40 pass and recognize the species .
In the first &apos; 80s , I was assigned a task of Harvard , I was a very interesting task to Haiti , I wanted to Haiti to Haiti in the basic basic of Duvalier and the Tonton Macoccades , and impossesss of the popoison Macoces .
To give a sense of miracious miracious , I had to understand the Voodoo &apos;s not magnera .
It &apos;s pretty much complete view of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the big religions , what would you say ?
Cristian anththaking , Ebraism , Ebraism , etc .
It &apos;s always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has not faith to religious . And instead , and I &apos;m not not . And I &apos;m not the other than the distilled of these religious religious .
What makes the great voodoo is the intense relationship between life and death .
So the vivious they &apos;re going to be born .
The spirits can be invocated from Grands Actually , they respond to the ritory of dance and replaced the temporary to the vious way that for a little bit of the follow .
So , to this doodoooooic voodoooods to talk about God .
We get God in the temple and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re sitting , is the spirit that you can do it ?
So you &apos;re seeing these incredible events : follow low woodoo in the state of the trance that touched impunccate a rather waste demonstration of the body when it &apos;s catalized in a state of the mind in the body , in a state of the body .
And in all the people with which I lived the most extraordinary are the most extraordinary .
And I think of the ancient civilization that once once lived on the plaible-to-carefully of the military Colombia in the conquent , the people have the skills , the people have a flying plant .
In a continent of blood , this people who was never conquisted by the spaces .
And so , I &apos;m government government from a clero , but they have been been been been so extraordinary .
The young follow , they &apos;ve taken away from families to three or four years , and they live secret in a world , and they live in a world of the stone of the loul-year .
Two years of nine years choose about to reproduce the nine months of gestation that they translation in the mother , now , I &apos;m metaphor , now , I &apos;m metaphor the Grands Mother .
For this time , they &apos;re acculturated to the values of their society , values that are workers and only their preayers and only their preayers .
And the term of this incredible begins , they &apos;re suddenly taken out and for the first time in life , at the age of 18 years , you see a very high . And in that I think of the first bags , when the sun the clock of the first bags , all that they &apos;ve learned in this picture is going to be a conference . The previous thing about his sent .
&quot; Vist ? You know , I said .
It &apos;s amazing . Now , it &apos;s now to you protect it . &quot;
They call the most people called the most people and say , fratets , are the poor cold , we are the cold of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the indeed populations and the invothered environment , and the old history of the noble selselselling , which is a concept of the noble , or maybe invooid Those , and we say that these people are more close to the Earth of us .
The indeed people are not noses ninitional people are noses from nostaly .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the paludes of the Asmell , in the Tibet , but thank you long and the rites , and they created a mystic mystic , they created a myththic of the Earth is not the notion of the Earth . But on a most good intuition . But the Earth is a real deal with the idea of human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
It means that a little bit of the Anyde who grow up with the mountain is a spirit of Apu that will be a deeply different and it will be a deeply different , and it will be a little bit different with the mountain or that &apos;s a little bit different with the mountain or that mountain a little bit of the mountain of the mountain is a massive .
What it &apos;s dimer is a mineral or a mineral ced .
What is interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between individuals and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Britannannica believe that the forests you have to be cut .
And this has been a human being different from my friends Kwakiutl that they believe that the forests are the dimatic dimmitted the wilddramatic and the berites the wildddals that they live in the world , the spirits that they live in the world , the spirits that they live in the world , the detail that they live in the Hukkkukle .
If you start to look at that these cultures can make different , you can start to understand some of them all kinds of things .
I &apos;ve been taken this picture to aprile in Amazon the Amazon nest Amazon .
Maybe some of you &apos;ve heard about the ayahuash , the most powerful psychoactive repertorium .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuasks is not the potential to the potential for the basically , but its elaboration . It &apos;s composition . It &apos;s composition .
In the side , this is a lot of a lot of a little bit of a coal meat , hardddramatic and hardddramatic .
And I &apos;m going to take the only plant , it has a little bit of the coscience , but it &apos;s mixed with the waste of a caffecting family &apos;s said , Psyphphoto of the caffection is Psychchchecking .
This plant is powerful powerful powerful trillion , very similar to the seriotonin , dimethyltrypped , five , methypypamine .
If you ever see the Yanomomami pulling up to the hidden the basically , it &apos;s a different set of species , &quot; Look , it &apos;s a methypypypyppyppyppyypppypppamine .
You can get that dust about the birth is a little bit like to be been been shown from a caretic caric card and land to land on a sea sea of the waste .
I was going to be often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has been scaped the was pucinogen , with his discovered of the fungi hallucinogens in Mexico .
Second my tesis not a classification of these triptamine as although you &apos;re done because if you &apos;re done , you can &apos;t tell any of any of being alucinated .
It &apos;s possible to be assumermerely if you abunte with other chemicals that denaturate MAO .
Now , it &apos;s the beautiful : the Tia-coal meat that liana are in this liana injeckitchers . The same kind of the same kind of wear . The question spontaneous question spontaneous . The question spontaneous is , in a 80,000 species of plants , like this . But if you can find two moral moral . But that if you can be a chemist . But that if you can be a chemist .
We use the great eufemism of evidence and the error , which can reveveal himself .
But if we ask the Indians , there will tell us &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuasks , which distinguinguish neckkly in the forest , and they would get in the same species .
If we ask them how they &apos;re going to be able to be &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought , &quot; I would say , &quot; I &apos;m going to be able to the rest of the rest of the rest of the right . &quot;
The solution is : you take 17 variety in a night of a path and every dinner and every dinner .
And so , you don &apos;t have graduate Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than the staps .
Now , &#91; now , &quot; the same thing that also the problem is that also the people who have been heart people who have been poor people find the poor people are pped in the world of our real world , and it &apos;s over over .
In fact , the century , between 300 years , it &apos;s not going to remember for his guerre or his innovation , but rather like the was where we stop us and abbracing it , and we &apos;ve been stopped with the mass mass of biological diversity and cultural planet .
All the cultures are involved in the world , they &apos;ve been involved in a new way of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux didn &apos;t stop to be Sioux when they put it up with the arm and frecovered as American American American American American American .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that minds the technology that mines the power of etnoses .
The wall fly .
And if you give you a look at the world , you &apos;ll see that these are not destined to worry .
They &apos;re living and dynamics are living out of the existence from existence to the existence of adapttation .
And it &apos;s the disbought to the painting of the Penboses --
a nomade of Sarawak , in the suest hasian , a popular west that has lived lightened in the forest to a generation , and now reduction on the waste , and the next titution of the fumums , where you can see the river from the lim that it seems to be a half of the Mar , Mar , where you can see the river , where you can see the SSwealthenthenthenththenthenthesthesh ,
You &apos;re going to repair the repair with the forest .
Or , in the case of the Yanomami , are the disease that I get to the discovery of the old .
If we put on the mountains in the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the whole dumping of the politics of politics .
As you know , the genocide , the physics of a popular physics , but the unconductor , but the hetnocium , the destroyed of a people , not only is the announced , but it &apos;s part of the development of the development of the development of the development of the development .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of the Tibet until you &apos;re not part of the beginning .
I lost the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in China in the West to the West Tibet , coming to Lhasa young windlililiged , but only came to Lhasa young colleague , but only came to Lhass .
6,000 monuments sacri redying in the dust and the centers .
1,2 million people killed from the military , in the Cultural Rivolution .
The father &apos;s father was ascritical at Panchen Lama .
The Chinese means that it was killed to the time of the Chinese invasion .
Suo guy is fuel with Sua Santity during the diaspora that has taken the people in Nepal .
His mother was imprisoned and his cold was a rich .
It was taken to be a carcing covered to the age of two years , under his gonna , because it couldn &apos;t live without him .
The sister , which has done the same , it was mitted in the field of reeducation .
A day has invered a fashion a fashion a fashion , and this transgrsion , it was mitted to seven years .
The pain of Tibet can be insportraits , but the spirit of the people &apos;s trouble .
In the end , it &apos;s all reduced to a choice .
We want to live in the world monotyromatic world , or we want to accept the world of the monotyal monoth ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before we die said that his biggest was that , in our our vision was that , in our world , not only we &apos;ll see the whole whole gamma of human imagination .
And it &apos;s uth-remember that our species is exist for 600,000 years .
The Neolitica Neolitica , which has given us us us us the farming of the cult of the seed seed , which is a poem of the soup with the prosja , creating the edge of the skin of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world industrialized has to be 300 years .
And that &apos;s the subtle story not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges we have to deal with the millllands to come .
When these miriades of the world is asked what you to say to be human , respond to 10,000 vices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all requires we &apos;re doing the possibility of being what we &apos;re : a kind of a configured , that all the people and all the people can fire .
I &apos;ve been taken this on the end north of the Baffin , when I went to cocket of the Falallows with the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , and I &apos;ve told my my grandfather .
The canadn government has not always been gentile with the Inuit , and in the &apos; 50s to be pushed our supremimimise , we &apos;ve been going to give them in colonies .
The grandfather &apos;s not the grandfather &apos;s refed to go .
The family , I &apos;m going to come back to his life , and all of his life , and all his attrepherves .
You should know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t have the cold , you can get it .
The pots of the sliters in origin were made of fish were made in the skin of caribore there .
The grandfather didn &apos;t have this man didn &apos;t put on the night night or the bard or the bard that was a bard .
It &apos;s sweat , it &apos;s hot the pantalons , you &apos;ve been calculated the pantalons of focused and defecated in their hand . When I did it &apos;s conztions .
It has been salive on the side of this cold cold , and when it became solid , and when it became solid , he killed a dog .
He &apos;s shopped the dog and created a briddaughter , with the cabables , has created a slited slited another dog is sweet , the chisa , wheel of ccrisis to the banking .
We want to talk about horse with nothing ? &#91; Ris&#93; And this , in different ways , &#91; &#91; Applausi &#93; is symbl of the Inuit &apos;s symbl and all the people of the Indians .
In the aprile 1999 , the canadese government has reduced to Inuit the total of a larger land of California and Texas a maps .
It &apos;s their new pathria . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a independent territory . We &apos;re all the mineral resources .
One splendiest example of how a nation-state could rerererereflect with his populations .
And , to end , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious to the people who we have been in these remote remote of the planet , make it not remote .
For somebody &apos;s house .
They have a search of human imagination that they requires to the alba . And for us all these children , as the sets of these children , become part of the waste .
To end , we have to National Geographic we &apos;re convinced that politicians will never be nothing .
We believe that polemics --
&#91; Applausers ers don &apos;t persuasive , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and perhaps we have the better institution to tell the world the world . Every month our site has been 35 million lived .
156 countries transmate our dog .
Our revivivious are lets from millions of people .
Our work is traveling in the nososphere to bring our audience in places of wonderful and cultural , from which they will be ababove how they will be ababled by how they have seen , so much time for the central reveveal of the East ast ast ast ast ast ast ast diversity , and we have to find a style of life in the world , and we need to find a life in the world , and we have to find a style in the world of a world .
where the saggee of all the people can contribute to our well-being collective .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope you &apos;ve heard and put some of evidence , and I &apos;m going to show some connection , in the case not notice .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the dogram official official . &quot;
The dogma official thing ?
The western official society society is the West society society the dogram , the official official society , &quot; If we want to massive our adadadult adult . &quot;
The reason is , from a side side , in fact that the freedom is predicted , it is predicted , useful , essential for human beings .
On the other is the fact that if we &apos;re free , each of us can agree to do everything that that that massive our well-being , no one that decide our name .
The way of massive freedom is massive of the choice .
More choices , the most of people have , more libing , and the greater is their well-being .
This is , I think , is so deeply rown in society that nobody would be able to put it in the society that nobody would be able to put it in the society .
And it &apos;s also deeply rown in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has resist possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not very big .
I &apos;m going to put a simple note about the conditions for injjumping .
In my supermarket there are 175 conditions , without content , without contact 10 variety of olium and the 12 acets of the olished friends that you can buy to make you a huge number of the most most of the people in the circitional circumstance .
Here &apos;s what the supermarket .
And then you go to the store store , to buy a steretic stumps : CD , radio , plastra , radio , plastra , amounts .
And in this single store store , there is a big number of audio .
We can do six million million combinations using the components using components that there are in a store .
You have to admit that there &apos;s a lot of choice .
Altri camps : the world of communications .
And once , when I was a child , they could get all the phone services , to the phone services that they were proved by mom , and Bell .
It was born the phone , it didn &apos;t buy it .
One consequence of that , between the other , was that the phone never done .
These days are gone .
We have a little bit of the phones , especially between phones , especially between cell cell .
Here &apos;s the cell cell cell .
My favorite is in a middle , I &apos;m going to MP3 , cut cut the bird of the bird , and forgotten for the crossing me brulelelling .
If you don &apos;t have seen in the store , you &apos;re very much much , you &apos;re very much much that you will be .
And what the end is that people get in the negotiate and do this question , and it &apos;s the answer ? The answer is &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t too much much .
So , in other ways of life that are much more important than the tricks , it &apos;s just explosion the same explosion of choices .
You have to be healthcare : it doesn &apos;t happen in the United States that you &apos;re going to be on the United States that you have to do .
Instead , you &apos;re from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do a A , or B , &quot; A , &quot; A has these benefits and these risks . &quot; You have these benefits and these benefits . What do you want to do ? &quot;
Take the dums , &quot; Dr. , what would I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A has these benefits and these risks , and these risks and these benefits . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you &apos;re going to be , &quot; Dr. if you were , what would do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not . &quot;
The result of the result of the malated , &quot; expression that it does seem like a beautiful thing .
But it &apos;s not that one can move fish and move the weight of the decisions of somebody knows something , and it &apos;s the doctor , or something else , it &apos;s the ided of the ideal thing -- and it doesn &apos;t know -- and it doesn &apos;t know , in the ideal condition to make it decisions that it &apos;s true .
There &apos;s a huge marketing of products that are drugs , directly , direct to people like me and you , which if you think it &apos;s no sense , which we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why they adversus them ?
The answer is that they want to ask the doctor to ask the doctor to ask the requires .
Something that is the most fundamental thing as our identity has ever been a question of choice , as you see in this vignant , &quot; We don &apos;t want to forget the kids . &quot; Don &apos;t do the right now . &quot; We don &apos;t have to invent .
And we can reinvented us .
The means that every morning , you have to be decide that kind of person to be .
I &apos;m going to the family and the matrimonium , a long time , the perspective , skip almost for anyone , was that you were going to be able , and it started to make the most pressive .
The only one real choice was with who , not when , and what do after .
Other , all it &apos;s really played to play .
I &apos;m going to be very smart students , and I &apos;m going to 20 percent in a long job .
And because they &apos;re not because they &apos;re not because they &apos;re not because they &apos;re less diligent .
But why are it implanting , I mean , &quot; Do you do it ? &quot;
&quot; Do I should be worse ? I think about the children or the career ? &quot;
They &apos;re interrogative .
And they try to respond to these questions , even though this implant doesn &apos;t be the company that assigned that I don &apos;t get a beautiful voice .
And they have to really do it .
Now , the work : We &apos;re lucky , as Carl subjjjobs , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , every day , from the Hotel Randolph Randolph .
And it &apos;s a hangoline , and I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; I &apos;m not going to be any , where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use it .
What is , this incredible liberty of choice that we have about work ? It &apos;s that we have to continuously decide , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son play play , with the cell cell cell in a pocket , the Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the notion .
And even though they &apos;re all spend , every minute we see our child roving the partner , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; Did we &apos;re also asking this called ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? I have to abbox this letter ? &quot;
And also when the answer is &quot; not , &quot; This makes the experience of the partnership of your son very different than that it would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the look , small things and great things , and it &apos;s a lot of choices .
And once the world was this : You know , there was some possibility , but it was not a question of choice .
The world today is what &apos;s like this : The dilemma is , &quot; Is it a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Saking is .
The positive lated them , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative .
All this is the choice of two , actually two negative negative .
The first , paradoooooded instead of liberation .
And so , with the choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
You &apos;ll offer a significant example : one study of the plans of pensive pensive .
A colleague has been accounded to the Vangigantic gigantic society , a lot of pension , with about a million clients in 2,000 companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in the more , percentage of the size of the two percent .
With 50 source offer , there is 10 percent less less less adesions when they &apos;re available to be available when they &apos;re available only five .
Because with 50 source of which choose , it &apos;s bad to decide , and the choice is replaced to the intimate injected to the injumped .
And in the ories , and I have in the orest , and of course , I &apos;m not going to be .
You know that it doesn &apos;t only mean that these work who are going to be good for the cani , because they don &apos;t have enough money , it will be good enough , it &apos;s so dostical that allowed the source of work .
Not participating , they &apos;re going to be able to five dollars a year from the dator of work , which would be well disposes .
So the paralive is a consequence of the have too choses .
And I think it &apos;s the world .
&quot; And to end , for the eternity : ketchup , send or maionese ? &quot;
You would like to take the right decision , if it &apos;s for the heternity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong way , and yet the condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that if we can avoid the paralyssis , at the end we &apos;re less sweden , the result of the result of the result of the way we were going to be options .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of the people who choose , you buy a , and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine you could make a different choice . And what &apos;s going to be better . And what &apos;s going to happen . And what &apos;s going to happen is the alternative to us of choice , and the remarkable to the demining of the decision , and the demindddance , and the demining ,
And also when it was a good decision .
More choices there are , more , it &apos;s easily displeased anything that it &apos;s undress of the options .
And then , there is what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has been very well stamaten as the value we &apos;re going to the things that we &apos;re going to do .
On the rest , when there are many options , it &apos;s easy to represent the fefeature of the alternative of the alternative and being less seventually , the option of the option that you have to be choice .
Here &apos;s a example . I &apos;m going to be a whole of the New York .
But that &apos;s what you probably think .
There &apos;s this packle Hamptons .
It &apos;s a place of luser .
Spig splendida . Otttttle . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not a way . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , &quot; Agust . &quot;
&quot; Everybody my neighborhood in Manhattan are . &quot;
&quot; I could be parchegyed right in the house . &quot;
And it &apos;s going to be two weeks from the idea that &apos;s lost -- every day -- the ability to talk about it .
The costo-opportunity diminds the sodly , for what we have , even when the choice was excellent .
And the most options we have to think , the most of the unless features to us up with the same opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This vignant tells us a lot of things .
It &apos;s about living the moment , and maybe of living in the time .
But the most important point is that anything you have to choose , you &apos;ll get the other .
The things that we don &apos;t have many attractive attractive actively what we do .
I say , &quot; spiral point : Can you have expectations .
I tried to my skin bought a new new new jeans .
I &apos;m almost always jeans .
And they were the jeans were just a kind of guy , buy them and they were scomods , they were scomoon , only after they had them to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple of new new when the old were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
The committed me , &quot; Li want to be , you know , you know , relaxed ,
You want to do with the cernial or with the cles ? &quot;
&quot; Li want to be straight ? &quot;
&quot; Seight wants to cook or stretches ? Bla , &quot; Continught , &quot; Continught .
I was sbalored , and after a little bit of it , and after a little bit of the guy , which was the only guy . &quot; It was a kind of a moment I was , so for a moment I was going to come out of the store , and then the way out the store , and then the other couple of jeans who had never .
It was the massive . With that had the best choice .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for the whole book .
The reason I was worse that I was worse with all of that choice were altissue , jeans had to be perfect .
I had been expected to be minimed . I didn &apos;t expect to be a kind of a kind of thing , but when you saw 100 different , I saw 100 different , dent , at least a kind of thing .
What I had been buying , but it didn &apos;t perfect .
After I started talking about the chosed that I was inso-inso-disdisappeared to waiting to expectations .
The added options in life of people don &apos;t do that increasing the excellence of the same options .
And this will be less sweden , even when the results are good .
Nobody &apos;s a marketing world if you realize .
Because if they knew it , you don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is going to be more to this .
&quot; You was better when it was worse when it was better when it was worse when it was worse when you was worse when you was worse , you could meet the skily .
In the world where we live -- opultimate , industrialized adult adult adult -- the massive of the perfeature that we can hope is that things are at the alteze that things are at the althetic .
You &apos;ve never surprised to be surprised because your expectative , my waiting , you &apos;re ingiganttite .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Baswaiting . &quot;
I mean , little author , I &apos;m really sposed and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t have it .
But they &apos;re not always going to be a good thing .
And then , a consequence of buy a couple of jeans , when there is just that kind of jeans is that , you &apos;re not doubbbbbbbblew , and you ask , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot;
The world is the responsible . What could you do it ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a inso-bought a inso-re-responsible , and you ask who is the responsible , is the responsible , is , it &apos;s just like the responsible .
You could do better .
And with hundreds of variety available , there are no sweet for the inform .
So when people take decisions , even though the result is valiid , you feel insssweet , and they feel insseventually .
In the last years , depression is exploded in the world world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only , but that is the only one , but that &apos;s just the most people have experiences to make the standard .
And when they have to explain this that the cold is their own .
So the final result is that we &apos;re better , but we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the dogma official dogram , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely fresh . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than I didn &apos;t have any any any part of it is better than a little choice .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic value . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve been safe from a piece of level where the choices choices have to our life .
Now , from the political point -- I almost finished -- I was a political point -- I &apos;m a little bit of a political , the nocy is the follow .
What it allows all this to the industrial society is the remarkable material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have no choice .
The problem is that they have too puts .
So the thing I &apos;m talking about is a bad bad bad to be about is a modern of modern , rerequires .
And what makes depressed and arrgrade is this : Steve Levitt has talked about yesterday , and they were talking about yesterday .
I mean , this is that these choices , and they &apos;re not just unuseful .
I &apos;m not saying to deleteries .
They do worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows us to have a lot of choice in the people have too much much chance , it &apos;s not just their life to make it , but also also our life .
This is what economists call a implant implant .
A distribution of income in in , all of the poor -- not only to poor -- because of this choice in except that it &apos;s mend .
To end up , &quot; Fille , you can become everything you want to be . &quot;
You know , people , you &apos;ll think , &quot; What makes that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t make anything like a shocx . &quot;
&quot; A imagination of the world , a limited vision of the world -- &quot;
and I &apos;m going to be interpretated so , at beginning .
But then , I think about it , instead , I realized that that that fish the fish knows that the fish knows .
Because the reality of fact is that if you &apos;re managed to frankle , so that it &apos;s possible . &quot; You don &apos;t get freedom . You don &apos;t get freedom .
