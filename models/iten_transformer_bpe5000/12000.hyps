The last year I showed these slides to demonstrate that the arglacial acial wear , which for almost three million years had the size of the 48 , the size of the United States continent , it &apos;s reaching of 40 percent .
But in this underneath the gravity of the problem because it &apos;s not exhip the ice of the ice of the ice .
The artica glacial acial , is in a sense , the heart of the climate system .
It &apos;s expanded .
The next slide is going to be a remarkable relationship to the last 25 years .
The glaciers are payed in red .
As you see , you &apos;re going to go to the blue skill .
That &apos;s the ice in the inverter , which is the summer ice .
You can see that the coscosts of the cost-old old old or more , is how the blood , which here was exposed to the body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been so on .
This is a problem because the remarkable land interests , the ground of the artical land where there are enormous amount of fuel , where there are enormous amount of fuel that , they &apos;re transformed in meters .
I &apos;m going to be a total of the atmosphere , that amount of global warming , that can double , that amount could double , overwhelming this point of not around .
In some sounds like a little profound lagues in Alaska metan is already refer from the water .
The Katey Walter of Alaska Walter of Alaska , and a team print a team print that last inverter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Well , it &apos;s well . The question is if we &apos;re going to be able to be .
And that &apos;s why this is that this thermal exchange the Groenland .
This is a river at regime .
The ported never reached levels like that .
This is the Kangerlussuaimed , in the southern Southern Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea to the glacier on the ground , here is where the sea .
These currents are increasing .
On the other side of the planet : Antarctttle , the greater blockable of the planet .
The last month , the scientists have delared that the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the West Are , who rain on some island , which pogy on some island of the submark , is particularly relief in the soulder .
Equival at six feet of the level of the actual , like in Groenland .
Sulle Himalaya , the third largest blockin , you see new lagues , which a few years ago they were glasses .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population of the water .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the water water water water than this city .
The ported is increased .
But when it &apos;s decreates , the same happens to the water .
In California , the Nevada is deminuity of 40 percent .
The hydrop are in the crisis .
The previous previous , as you read , they &apos;re grasses .
The growing certainly in the world door to a remarkable remarkable .
The environmental disaster are increasing to a strength of normal and without previous .
Four times more more than the last 30 years I was before 75 years I was before 75 .
This is a remarkable age of all insustainable .
If you look at the historical context , you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we &apos;ve add 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the time , the area of the Pacific , the Americans , to the U.K. , and on both the subcontinent of Indian subcontinent , where there &apos;s a radical radical radical radical radical radical radical radical radical radical radical radical .
The greater cause of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , it &apos;s 20 percent , it &apos;s the fossil fuel fuel .
The oil is a problem , and the coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two of the more emissions , together to China .
And it was proponed to build a lot of other cles .
But we &apos;re seeing in a change of direction .
These are the projects annullate projects in the last years and some of the green alternative .
And so , there &apos;s a lighting politics in our country .
The coal and oil is speso 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the fuel , which is a very pray .
And that image would reminded me something --
Very Natal , in the Tennessee , where there was a loss of 3.8 billion liers of coal four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-dollar lar loss ,
You may have seen it on the news news .
This is the largest flow of the flow in America .
It &apos;s happened around Natal .
The public advertising of a coal of coal industrial .
Video : See , â™« Frosty the carbon and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and growing our economy .
Frosty , the carbon and more clean .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and the working working working on the path .
Al Gore : From here is a big part of the West Virginia .
The largest minerary societies on the mountains is Massey Coal . This is its administrator .
Video : The Blankenship -- I &apos;m going to be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelososes , Harry Reid -- don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima Prottion of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is one of them , a part .
Video : The ALergy in the ALergy , we see the climate change as a serious threat at our business .
For this priority is invest a large amount of money in a nurge of money in a public foreign and confused the truth on the fuel .
Actually , the fuel is not sports .
We think it &apos;s pulist -- it &apos;s also a good profumor .
So , you don &apos;t preocuption of climate change .
Let me do .
Video : Attore : However -- you &apos;ve heard a lot of a lot of a lot of it .
So we &apos;re doing a turn around a structure at the avanese , for how the fuel fuel fuel .
Straordinarily ! The machines are a little rumorous , but this is the sound of the fuel technology of the fuel technology of the fuel technology of the fuel technology of the fuel technology .
The coal consumption is between the major causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology of the pulit that you see changes everything .
You &apos;re looking at : this is the odiern technology of clean .
Al Gore : The end , the positive alternative , you know , and at that the national security .
Video : Suring America is in the crisis ; the national security , the climate crisis .
The filter that the links of the fuel , our dependence of fossils , as the fuel fuel and the imported oil .
Now , there &apos;s a new , audace solution for using circustomy .
Really , 100 percent of the clean , in ten years .
A plan to put America to get more safe , and help stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that basts to solve our problems .
Really , America . Scoprite more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Say is to re-energy .
One of the faster ways of bringing to dependence from the fuel fuel that killing our planet .
From the future is here . I feel , like , a new network .
From 2 : 2 : Ngging the investments for jobs of work well well well well ,
French America . It &apos;s time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old old prover-African says , &quot; If you want to go fast , you &apos;re going to go to the faster .
If you want to go away , you &apos;re going to go back ,
We have to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
The last year at TED I did a reduction on the LHC .
And promising to return to the car on how it works .
So , you know , and the ones that the other time was not , the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever attempt -- 27 kilometers of circence .
His task is to reate the conditions that they were less than a billion ardesyable of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
This is simply environmental .
This is the car under Ginevra .
We have to go into these mini-Big Bang inside the relevators .
This is what work . It &apos;s called ATLATLATLAS -- is a 44 meters .
This is an ATLATLATLAS in construction so you can notice the proportions .
The 10 sector at the last year , we &apos;ve got the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLATLATLATLAS .
It was because of immense festhate in control .
It &apos;s an image of particles that he had all around the LHC , entring in the LHC , entring in the LHC , and deliberately , with a part of the HC , and spread in the relevator .
In other words , when we saw that the 10 sector , I realized that the car worked , which is a great vitty .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to make us more or this , when somebody went on Google and I saw that the initial page was this .
What means we have a cultural impact on the scientific impact on the scientific .
About a week later , it was a problem with the car , had just to these filters here -- these films .
These filters take 13,000 ampamping when the car works at the very high .
Now , the technical of you will look at the films and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . &quot; I &apos;m films too great . &quot;
And instead can do it because when they &apos;re very cold to become the costs of the superconducucucuctor .
So , at less 271 degrees , at a nurine in the stars , these films can bring that current the stars , these films can bring that current .
In one of the giunture between the older of novemyle in the LHC , there was a defest of factory .
So the films are going to be slightly , and 13,000 ampsuddenly met a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think of these magnees is more than 20 tons , and that they &apos;ve moved about 30 feet .
They &apos;re damaged about 50 magnetic magnetic .
We had to thresh them , what we did .
We &apos;ve got repristinted and reached .
They &apos;re now now now return all to their underneath .
The end of the LHC is going to be a new integrity .
We &apos;re going to enjoy , and we expect to jugging or and and I continue our adventure to discover what they &apos;re in the universe .
Now , of course , in some way , these crossing crossing the value of the value of science and engineering of frontier . It &apos;s easy to container . It &apos;s easy to constantly future .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so difficult , the fact of going to go beyond the limits , I think is this value of things like the LHC .
I &apos;d like to end with words of a English scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , I suppose , in the defense of inutives of its own clean , his clean . He said , &quot; No is so dangerous for the human mind , which is not so much for the human mind as the science as the human science as the human science as the science as the human is defines , which is not there are a mystic monke-in nature , which is a quick monke-up ,
Thank you .
I want to start asking about rethink about when , you &apos;re playing with kids , play with the morning .
Whereas you understand how to reach them and do , and let them go and move them , you learn to think and solve problems and refying the space and manipulating space .
The space argument is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , by the usually , by the useful way of our interaction with physical objects , together to my consultant , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to ask me , &quot; And if , when we use a computer , instead of having the only mouse of the mouse as a pass of the mouse as a pass of a mouse , we could have the only affairs of the hands , we can actually have a lot of it ,
and I do it to be pleasure ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big interactive computer .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big interactive computer .
You can move with your hand , they can see the hand , they can see the right , and they feel the right and they have a radio wireless radio .
But more of all , they &apos;re physical objects , like the morning morning , you can just move them to affect them .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem and how to manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physical , conscious of the movement , and as they &apos;re doing more physical , and as they become more physical , and how they &apos;re going to be more physical , of the other , of how we can do , we explore new and fun of interaction .
I &apos;m going to try to do with some simple example .
This Sifty is configurate to show video : if you &apos;re going to be in a direction , the video is going to be so if you &apos;re going to incline from the other hand back back .
These reactivities are aware of the other .
If I relief them , they &apos;re interested in what it is around .
If they &apos;re surrounded , you notice and they can agitate a little bit .
If they &apos;re surrounded , you notice and they can agitate a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We realized that one of the interesting interesting implications of the interaction was the way to use of the data , to example , &quot; a color like if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configured like of green and I can use them to be able to use them to the color in the central , where you &apos;re miss .
and I can use them to put them in that central , where you &apos;re missing .
And we can get too , we can put a little bit of place .
And I also think , as well as as the languages , like the languages , the mathematand games of logic , where people can try things quickly , and see the results of the things , and see the results .
Now I &apos;m --
This is a Fibonacks that I do with a mouth program .
Here we have a words that &apos;s in half Scarabe-and Boggle .
And basically , at every turning , you &apos;ve got a letter on every Siftable , Pratically , you &apos;re going to have a letter of case on every Siftable , and while you &apos;re trying to understand him .
And then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new set of letters and new bills new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the kids came in the Media Lab , I &apos;ve done in a way that I was trying to do it and I turned a video .
They &apos;re very pleasuures very much .
And one of the interesting things of this application is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
You just say , &quot; You know , &quot; You know , &quot; You know what to do .
Here &apos;s other people who are provides it .
This is our moa tester tester , there on the right .
It actually wanted to be impleasure .
They were only morning , and he &apos;s just in the morning .
Now , this is an application of a interactive cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of the languages is Felix .
It can be able to put new characters in the scene , by the Sifty of them .
It can be able to put new characters in the scene , by the Sifty of them .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : The sun is sisting .
David Merrill : Now he took a treatment in the scene .
Video : The arange treatment .
Bel work !
So , you shake the Sifty and put close close them ,
Video : Well !
And by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by inventing their story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide him as a flu .
DM : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide him as a flu .
Very , gat .
DM : The last example I have time to show is a tool , which is made of recent , to sample and and to work .
It &apos;s a tool , and it &apos;s a tool , and to go to and play music .
The Siftable here are on the ground , and the bacteria .
And one of these four different variations , and you can choose which .
You can also also also put these sounds on a sequence of your pleasure .
And it just by doing it by doing it , and a sequence . &quot;
These are actually you can control from the alive , like the rivers and the filter .
The acks to a particular sound and then incline and then incline and .
And then there are general effects as time and volume , which are applied to the whole sequence .
We &apos;re looking at how it works .
Video : We &apos;re going to try and put a base in two Siftable , &quot; sequence , we &apos;re going to do it in a series , we &apos;re going to add , we add another base .
Now , I &apos;m a low line .
Video : DM : Now I &apos;m going to add some percussions --
Video : And I &apos;m going to put the filter on the bacteria , so I can control the effect from the alive .
Video : DM : I can &apos;t reach the entire sequence of the whole sequence of the time , or from one side or the other .
Video : And now I &apos;m going to add the bottom to the bottom to give more expression .
Video : I can know reach the sequence of the flu . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to planning it before , but I can suddenly make it more , and it &apos;s a long time or more corporate .
And now , I can smoking the entire sequence of inclining on the left the Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is build new interfaces , more more like our own own own and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the results of this loses , and also some possibilities that we &apos;re trying to bring out from the lab .
The concept I want to transmate , is that &apos;s coming this new generation of what we were designed to interacting with digital media , which will will be information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the now of talking to you all .
I &apos;m a scriting scritation .
I &apos;m going to be my profession , but it &apos;s more of this , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the love and the boy of my life .
And I don &apos;t look like it .
But , he said , something particular is successful in my life and in my career , which has brought me to report the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I &apos;ve been recently written this book , this biography called &quot; Many , Prega , Am , &quot; which , I &apos;m going to be a great sensational , and I &apos;m going to be a great sensational , drinking seller .
And the result is that everywhere they &apos;re going to happen , people treat me as if I was convicted .
It &apos;s true -- conducted ,
They &apos;re all worried about me and they &apos;re all worried and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t have fear to do ?
You don &apos;t have fear to be able to write for all life without able to create a book that can importantly create a book that can importate somebody ? &quot;
What can you need to be able to someone ? &quot;
It &apos;s rance , you know .
But it could go worse , in the part of that I remember that more 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was an adolescent -- I was a scritation .
I would go to the same reaction with the landscape .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you have success ?
You don &apos;t have feed that the uth-fell ?
You don &apos;t have fear to do this , all of life without anything that &apos;s ever coming out and die on a cumb , and to die on a cumb , and to die on a wild cums ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
You know , I have a landscape of all of those things .
I always had landscape .
And I also have a lot of other things that people can &apos;t inate .
As the algae and other things .
But , as I write what I thought and ask me , and I should ask me , is why ?
Is it a rational ?
It &apos;s logic that anyone who should expect to be spaving from a work that sent seven-up work .
But what &apos;s there so particular in the implant , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to be on the mental health health , as a way that other carefully don &apos;t do ?
As my father , for example , he was a chemistry and not reminus of one single time in his 40 years of activity in which he was asked if he was asked if he was a landscape ?
And it never -- that stuck of the engineer , how do it ?
It &apos;s not working so , you understand ?
Onestly , the engineers like a group don &apos;t have any of course , in the centuries , they make the reputing reputing depressed .
We have enough to be a lot of this reputation , and not only creative writers , but creativity of all of these , we have this reputing to be enormous member instantly .
And it &apos;s not something else that look at the trade of the magnificent of creative magnifers that , only in the 20th century , they die and often .
And even the ones that are not suicked to be really disappear by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before we &apos;re going to die , in the last interview said , &quot; Each book has killed a little more amazing , &quot; A wonderful affermation about their life .
But we don &apos;t blow when we feel that , because we heard these things so so much interiorized that in a way we have completely interiorized and accounts the noon that creativity and the bulk are in a way of all of the way of the angosence .
And the question I want to ask to ask to all here here is : you agree with this idea ?
It &apos;s good for you , because it &apos;s also looking at it for a centimeter of me , it &apos;s not well for anything about this suppose .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous and I don &apos;t want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better encourage our big creative minds .
And I know that , in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start to fire to start to be able to start to be able to start with the circumstances in my career .
That &apos;s true -- I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I &apos;ve got a lot of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything I &apos;m going to be right now in the world as the work that was going to be right now in my own book .
I &apos;m going to be on , because we &apos;re all more or less friends here -- is likely that my biggest success is to my own own own split .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to blow in the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would continue to do this work that we do this work .
So , the question is , how ?
And so it seems , after a lot of reflective , which the way to continue to write is that to create a protective psychological construct , right ?
I have a way of find a distance of security between me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural natural natural advance on which I would do , and I &apos;m trying to do this for all the time , I started looking for all the time , I &apos;m trying to see if they could have have some better ideas and more , and to see if they could have some better ideas and more , and more , and I &apos;m going to see if they could have a little bit more , and I &apos;m going to get a few other people to see
about how to help people people are creative in order to manage the emotions of the risks of creativity .
And that research me brought me to the ancient Great and ancient Rome .
You &apos;re doing it because I &apos;ve got back in circle and then go back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people don &apos;t seem to create that creativity sell that creativity sell that creativity sell ?
And it thought the creativity was this spirit looks at the divine and that sell men from a few surprising distant and unknown , for reasons , for reasons and unknown , for reasons .
The grew in these spirits , they called the Sademic . &quot;
Soccurrenrenewisly , he believed to have a demon that elargive sent from away .
The Romans were in the same idea , but they called the the spirit of the spirit without a genius .
The great , because the Romans didn &apos;t really think that a genius was really smart .
They create a genius was this kind of divin that was living in literally in the walls in the neighborhood of a neighborhood , a little bit like the electric . And that &apos;s a lot of how the work .
Here &apos;s eonal -- this is the distance of which I talk -- that &apos;s the psychological construct that you protect the results of your work .
And everyone knew that was so that it was so that it worked , right ?
So , the anti-of-of-the-things , like , for example , too narcism , no ?
If your work was excited you could not take and everything , you know that you were helped by this genius , everyone knew that you were helped by this genius encoureum .
If your work failing , it was not all your work , right ?
Everyone knew that was your genius to be a incapable .
And so people have han concept creativity in the West for a long time .
And then the Rinsance came and everything , and it &apos;s all of this great idea ; we can be the human at the universe , and the mysters and mysters and without more to let the universe , and the mysters and the divinity .
This was the principle of the rational and people started to think that creativity came out of the idivided by the iduo .
And for the first time in history , you know , it &apos;s what a kind of a rather than a genius as a person with genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big error .
I think I &apos;m going to allow somebody , a simple person to create to be like a recipient recipe , the essence and the source of all of the mysters , unknown , unknown , unknown and eternone of the divine , and unknown to give the fragile pliance ,
It &apos;s how to ask someone of ingoate the sun .
It &apos;s a completely details the ego and create all of these ingestible and expectations on the performance .
And I think it was the artists in the transition of 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think that is , and I think it &apos;s going to be , and now ?
We can do it ?
And it &apos;s a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery creative .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can &apos;t have 500 years of thought in a 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience who solving would be legitimate scientific notion on the notion of , insuit , you do that they &apos;re doing people who are filled to their projects .
It &apos;s probably not convinced you all about this thing .
But the question I &apos;d like to ask is -- why ?
Why don &apos;t you think in this way ?
Because it has more sense of everything that I &apos;ve ever heard about to explain the explanting explanting of the creative process .
And one process that , as anyone who has ever been trying to do something -- so , basically , you don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t understand rationally .
And , in fact , it can look completely paranorous .
I &apos;ve done this inate inate with extraordinary poetest Ruth Stone , who has 90 years , but it was a poeet for all life and said , during the middle of the life , and he said , during the field , and he was working in in the camps , and he felt it , in the field , and I felt it was in the exhible-up .
And he said , it was like a big fragorous .
And that was going to rotate on her landscape .
And it was going to be , because it was tremendous to be on the ground under its feet .
He knew to have one thing to do to do at that point and he was , his words , &quot; to go like a match . &quot;
And so correcent to be done by this poetry , and it didn &apos;t have to make more than take a piece of paper and a math enough enough , as the way , as the trapart , and it &apos;s going to collect the page .
And then , you couldn &apos;t be fast enough , so correcent and correcent , and correcent without able able to get into home and the poetry and correcent poetry and she would continued to rotate through the landscape , looking at , as she said , &quot; another poet . &quot;
And then there were those times -- this is not the size , I &apos;ll never dimensional moments that was almost lost , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was looking for paper and the poetry through , and he was a hell in the while that he was going on , and then he said , which was like he was going on , and the office .
And it was the poem from and he took it into his body and the transcated on the page .
And in these cases , the poetry and page , and intattached to the perfect , and the last word at the first word at the first word .
So when I felt it -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly the same same equal process .
Not all my creative process -- it &apos;s not a container .
I &apos;m a mud , and my way of working is ; I &apos;m wake up at the same orary every day and sweapons and go up and go on and go up and go up and go on .
But even I &apos;m landing , in my testyard , I &apos;ve strisciated against that thing , sometimes .
And I think also many of you , even many of you the han done .
You know , even though the work and ideas came to me from a certain source source , I could not be so much .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it in a way to do not get the head , but , rather , which is that we &apos;re going to be healthy ?
And as I &apos;m about , the best example of the contemporary example I have the musician Tom Waits , which I interviewed different years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , and you know , in the most of life was the incarnation of the same same same toxing , trying to control , management , to try , management , to be very interacting to be totally interyzed .
But then I &apos;m going to invecting , and one day , and a day when he was driving on a self-construcada in Los Angeles , it changed all for him .
It was looking at the fast and all of a little piece of melodia this little framing of melodia , who gets in his head as inspiration , and the wants , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the desyred , but it doesn &apos;t know how to take it .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , it &apos;s not a math , it &apos;s not a recorder .
So , it starts to hear this kind of old ange is growing in him , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to be able to employed by this song even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even
I &apos;m not enough , I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to go into the panic , they stop .
It &apos;s going to put the whole mental process and made something completely new .
He just looked at the sky and said , &quot; I &apos;m not going to see that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Do you look like that can write a song ?
If you really want to be , I &apos;m going to be a more time when I can take care of you .
Altrain , you &apos;re going to importantly something else today .
You know , I have to disturbing Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his work is working process .
Not the work , the work was still hoscaur as always .
But the process , and the ange of the process , and the fishing was repair when he took the genius , the genius that out of him was caused to be a very , and they went back to the back where it was , actually actually , by making that it wasn &apos;t being a interorized thing thing that &apos;s interorized and torate .
But yeah this peculiar , wonderful bizarre , and this straight , and this stranterly , but it wasn &apos;t Tom .
So , how the story I was going to change a little bit , even the way I worked and already saved me once .
This idea , I was saved when I was writing , &quot; Many , Prega , &quot; and fallen in one of those cave of disperation in which we &apos;re all working on something and we &apos;re not going to be a disaster , which is the worst book .
Not only really good , right the worst book .
And I started thinking about gecting this project .
But then I remember in Tom , I talked to the air and I tried .
So I got my face on the manoscritical and I gave my comments to a vacuum of the room .
And I said to high high voices , &quot; Sents , what we know , if this book is not going to be very brilliant , isn &apos;t it going to be really cold , no ?
Because I &apos;m going to have a lot of it , I have no longer longer than that .
So if you want you to have to talk and do your part .
Okay . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know , I don &apos;t do anything .
I &apos;m going to be going to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I would like to be recorded that I was presented to do my part , &quot; Because at the end is so , OK -- centuries does in the deserts of the North of people were dance , the dance of moon , dance and the music that was so , OK -- and the music that went on and the alba .
And they were always magnifies , because the dancerors were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every single , I &apos;m going to be a hell , and one of these artists became actually transcending .
And I know what I know about what , because I know you all seen , and a point , a certain point , a performance .
It was like the time , it was like the time , and the ballerin a kind of portal and it was not something else else , but it was all of the way , like 1,000 noticed before , but all you &apos;ve got all all of them .
And suddenly , you know , you know , as a human .
But it &apos;s accounts from the divinity of the divinity .
And when this was the time , people knew what it was , they called it with it .
They were told the hands and started to bay , &quot; Allah , &quot; Allah , Allah , God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curious note -- when Mors invasing the south of Spagna , I was this abdine with them and the ready to be in the seass , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , &quot; which you can see in the corries or flamenk in the corries or flamenk in the flamench ,
In Spagna , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , &quot; Allah , I am , Again , magnifically , &quot; ununable understanding , and it &apos;s a foundation of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need .
But , the problem is the day , for the dancer , when you &apos;re seeing daughters and I find that are the 11 in the morning of Martedesday , and I &apos;m the middle of God &apos;s not the more .
It &apos;s just a lot of housing with a lot of bad ginocks , and maybe never will be able to each other to that althetic .
And maybe nobody will dogs the name of God still while , and what &apos;s going to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s difficult .
This is one of the most pay-res-doing life life .
But maybe not to be so angosciant if you can &apos;t believe , advancing , which the most amazing aspects of your being being on your own being on your own being on your own being being on the same .
But just crete you just , you know , it &apos;s a source of a source of a source of the source of this team of your life that you have to go to someone else when you &apos;ve finished .
And , you know , if we think in this way .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s certainly like it , and it &apos;s certainly like the work of the work that I &apos;m going to get , the dangerous , I &apos;m going to be able , the dangerous , and I &apos;m going to do this great great success .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel electrized by this is , not having painting .
Don &apos;t get you . It &apos;s only your work .
Continua present-presented , for your hand , whatever it can be .
If your work is balling , you &apos;re balling ,
If the divine , it &apos;s genius to you decide to let me get some kind of wonderful , for a only time through your forces , then , then &quot; Ole ! &quot;
And you &apos;re going to do it .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot; to you know the same .
I think , and I think it &apos;s debate it .
&quot; Ole ! &quot; to you know the same , even for having a human love and testestables to make a testals , you know ,
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects on what the human genome can mean and the new genome of genes .
Now we &apos;re starting a new path : we started to digitize biology and now now to be starting from that digital code in a new phase of biology , we &apos;re doing and synthesizing life .
We always tried to ask a big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists I think we &apos;ve been trying to understand the various levels .
We tried different approaches , reducing it .
We &apos;re digitizing by 20 years old .
When we sequenced the human genome was was to go from the analogical world in the digital world of the computer .
Now , we &apos;re asking , we can we regenerate life , or create new life of this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little little bit more .
We &apos;re able to eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 of genes that are here .
But when we &apos;re looking at its metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our .
I think , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this can bring a living cell .
So we decided that the only one on to design is synthesize this chromosome in a way that we could actually change the components to bring the components of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of &quot; can we synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Can we have the chemistry constraints these big molecules that we &apos;ve never done to create before ?
And , in case , we can we make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is simply a piece of chemistry material .
The speed with which we &apos;re able to digitize life is growing to be growing exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , design , rather slowly , but it &apos;s improving .
And our more recently results the laptops on a exponential curve .
We &apos;ve got more 15 years ago .
The process has required a lot of passages , starting with a bioethics before the first experiments .
But we found that DNA is very difficult .
There are thousands of cars in the world that make small segment of DNA , of the long DNA , of the long , and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the most segment is , the most errors .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments and correct the errors .
And this was our first attempt , to start by digital information of the genome of Phi 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , we &apos;ve designed the correction of errors and I got a molecule of DNA of about 5,000 letter .
The interesting part is when we &apos;ve taken this piece of chemistry and put it into the bacteria , the bacteria , the bacteria have started reading this genetic code and make viral particles .
The viral particles were then reduced by cells , they &apos;re back and they &apos;re going back and they &apos;re going back and they &apos;re going back and they &apos;re going back and they &apos;re destroy .
I &apos;ve talked about recently with the oil industry , say that they &apos;re going to be talking about this model .
They have more of you .
We believe that this is a situation where software can actually build his own hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in the big things .
We wanted to build the whole cromosome .
They &apos;re more than 580 myth l-letter code .
So we thought we &apos;ve thought we &apos;re building it in the cassette of the virus , so that we can change the cassette and understand what the components of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard of the age was of a mixer for every 10 mixer .
We found , 30 errors . If we had 30 errors . If we used that original sequence would never be able to do it work .
A part of the process is designed to design sweather , which is 50 letters that you &apos;re overwhelming with all the other segments of 50 letter to build a little little little bit more working together .
We &apos;re going to try elements on this .
You &apos;ve probably read that we &apos;ve been able to put on the flyle .
And I think , we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , C , EC , EEO and T.
Three of those letters together , and they &apos;re going to be about 20 amminoacids , and there &apos;s a specific order to lay for every ammasses .
So we can use the genetic code to write , frash , thoughts .
What we did at the beginning was authograin .
Some of them have been dolphusers in fact that it was not poem .
We designed these segments to do just uning with it .
There are a lot of me refer and put them together .
And we started to assembling the parts , starting with five to seven to seven thousand and mom , unendles in a way to form of 24 mila , including them to make a lot of them , until we get to 72 , and the letter .
And we &apos;ve been produced these segments in abundance , so that we &apos;re trying to create a very robyed processing , and we &apos;re trying to create a minute .
We &apos;re looking for the process .
So , this is the tabellon a basket player .
When we get these very much long , more than 100 , more than 100 , they &apos;re not going to grow more directly in Eation .
You get to the limit of the modern instruments of molecular biology .
So we &apos;ve been looking at other mechanisms .
We know about one mechanism called the homologist called the omologist , which in biology , we use to repair the DNA to be able to unting the DNA to undo the segments .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinocate radiodurans , can absorb three million rad of radiation .
You can see in the top requader as his destroyed chromosome is destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly like it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely completely completely .
They can live under any empty .
I &apos;m absolutely sure life in space , and you &apos;re sounds in space , and you &apos;re sounds for the water .
Actually , NASA has shown that this is going to happen .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built using these processes , just using the lieventually appropriate design appropripropriate with the design appropriate appropriate .
The lieventually assemble .
This image was not taken with an electronic microscope , but with a rule microscope .
It &apos;s a very big molecule that we &apos;re going to see the with a microscope .
These are photos that copring a period of about six seconds .
This is the publishing publishing that we did a little time ago .
They &apos;re more than 580,000 letters .
It &apos;s the largest molecule of a structure ever created by the man .
It has a high molecular molecular weight .
If we &apos;re going to be a 10 without spaces , we would like 142 pages to transform this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ? How can we active it ? How can we active it ?
Of course , you know , you know , a virus .
It &apos;s a little more complicated when they use bacteria .
It &apos;s more simple when it is eucarious cells like our : you can just just extreme nuclear and put another , which is basically the process of cloning process .
In the archaea , the chromosome is integrated inside the cell , but we &apos;ve been able to do a complete trapior a cell to a cell to another and to accomplish of a cell to another and to accomplish .
We have clean a cromosome from a microbial species .
The two are different as the men from mtops .
We add some gene in a way that we could decide what choose for this cromosome .
And then the sand with the fleg with the fleg .
And when we put it in the cell , the outbreak of the amazing -- and open our graphicato-fyle , the new chromosome is inside the cell .
And we were thinking that we didn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to get more in there .
This is one of the greater mechanisms .
We found that tantissix-species , they put a second or a third chromosome from some part , add in a second thousands of new trouble of the species .
So who think of evolution as a only gene to change is not a lot of biology .
And they have been called called a remarkable restrial to report the DNA .
The cromosome that was in the cell , it was in the cell .
The mobile phones , the chromosome we have put it .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other cromosome as material , and it has masticked , and we &apos;ve been in only the cell and the new chromosome .
It &apos;s become blue because of the genes that we put .
And in a short short of time , all the characteristics of a species are gone , and it &apos;s transformed in a new species , based on the new software that we &apos;ve put in the cell .
All of the protection are changed , and members are changed , and when we &apos;re looking at the genetic code exactly what we &apos;ve transfered .
Now , this could look like genetics , but we &apos;re allowing the software , we can change things in a very very , basically enough way .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that here is not about genesesesis -- but progress to start with three million years and a half million of evolution , and I &apos;ve already said that maybe we &apos;re to create a new version of the Crian explosion Crian , which will be new species based on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s enough , when we think about the necessity .
We &apos;re going to spend six billion and a half billion people to nine in the next 40 years .
Right to give an example , I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each other in 1946 ; in 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find food , water , and water , food , inal medicine and wealth for six billion people .
It &apos;s going to be more to do it for nine .
We &apos;re going to start more than five billion fuel bars , more than 30 billion bars .
That means 100 million bars a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or or any kind of process to replace them , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
And we have to realize all of CO2 from these materials that are going to end up in the atmosphere .
And at the day , thank you to the scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think , they &apos;re designs for the future .
The electronics industry has only a dozen about components , and think about how many different things are solved .
Our limits here is data , and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , because of these in synthesization of synthesization , able to create what we call genomics combinatory genomics .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can produce a million cromes a million cromes a day .
Think about processing these 20 million different genes or to try to optimize the processes to make them , new vaccines , we can change , we can change , we can change , we can change , and create more molecular biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a selection .
We can choose for survival , chemical production or fuel , or fuel production , etc vaccines .
This is an instantly of some software programmed that we &apos;re working for being able to be able to sex and design species .
Well , we don &apos;t know how they &apos;re going to be .
We know exactly what they &apos;re exactly what they &apos;re like .
Now we &apos;re focusing on quarters of the quarters .
You also have seen that extract ethanol from the gran experiment .
We have a lot of second and third generation that will use enough to be in the sugar , or different kinds of butan-four-four-four-to-fourth , like the doctor or different kinds of butanle .
But the only way biology is going to have a great impact without increasing the cost of food and limb food , and limb the cost of food and limb the food in matter , which we &apos;re working for cells that can reach this goal , and we think that we can have the early cocoal , in about 18 months .
The solar solar light with CO2 is a metodo--- but in our discoveries in the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism that we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
It &apos;s going to be in the ocean , about 2,500 feet of the webollition of the water .
It &apos;s creating a metan using hydrogen molecular as a source of energy .
We &apos;re looking for if we can inary CO2 , which can easily be transported by tubes , converted that CO2 in fuel , to drive this process .
So , we think we might be able to increase what the question of what life is the question of what life is the question , &quot; is , &quot; we have the dest goal of re-fill . We have the dest dest of the entire oil industry .
So , you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can you do it ?
It would be a major source of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working on the same metods to create instantly vaccines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with influence , we &apos;re always back of a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s about to find the vaccine .
I think what you can change building combinable combinable vaccines in anticipe .
And that &apos;s how the future could start look at changing , now , the tree of evolution , accellular bacteria with synthic bacteria , arches , and then then , and inend cells .
We &apos;re so so on the way to improve people .
Our goal is to do in a way of trying to make it . Thank you very much .
First of all , I &apos;ll show you , the faster , a little bit of the new technology that we brought to the Microsoft in the following of a year ago exactly a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s a place where you can interact is local level that remoon , which is a huge amount of visual data .
We &apos;re seeing a lot of digital giabyte of digital photos with a kind of a kind of wem constantly , and continuous , for a fast panic , , we want .
And it &apos;s not matter how much the amount of information that we see , how big these are these collected data or images .
Most of the digital photographs , but this for example is a provenient scanning extensive scanning of Congress , and reentry in the gamma of 300 megapixel .
It &apos;s not a difference because the only thing that limited the prestations of a system like this is the number of please on your screen in any time . It &apos;s also a very flessible architecture .
This is a book , it &apos;s a book of data , it &apos;s not a book .
This is the Casa desolate of Dickens , and it &apos;s a cape .
And to show you that it &apos;s really about the text , and we can do one thing like that , to see that it &apos;s a real representation of a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a electronic book .
I don &apos;t advice it .
This is a more realistic example . This is a number of Guardian .
Each image is the beginning of a seat .
And it really gives you a pleasure and the great caracy of a real caracy or a daily view or a daily shelf , which is to nature multiple kind of a half .
We also made something with the corner of this number of Guardian .
We created a high resolution by by the high resolution -- much more , which is a normal publishing publishing -- and we &apos;ve put it in a normal publishing content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that this means that we have to give people people , and to other porcheries like that , I didn &apos;t have to be need .
And of course , the maps is one of the older applications for this kind of technology .
And on this field . I don &apos;t want to say that we have to give you in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States overwhelming on the United States .
So now we &apos;re going to go to something else .
This is actually actually from the wave ; you can go to see it .
This is a project called Photosynth , which is a two different different technologies .
A is Seadragon and the other is a visual research at the very interesting computer made by Noah Snavely , a student of the University of Washington , with the help of Steve Seitz . It &apos;s great collaboration . &quot;
And it &apos;s from the wave , I &apos;m in the Web .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can spend from another image to another and have this kind of experience of resolution .
But the space of the space space of the images here has actually a meaning .
The algorithms of computer visualization have been recorded these images together , so that I &apos;m going to reach the reducing places that -- all the closest in which imagining -- all the close close to the Montagues -- they &apos;re scaped . So you see the elements of one of a slippay-stable de-stable .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other other environment .
There are a lot more space .
I want to spend directly to one of the original set of Noah--- and this is a very much prototynth of Photosynth , which we &apos;ve done worked for the first time the summer -- to show you what I think is really the key key key to show you what we &apos;ve got in the website . And it &apos;s not necessarily evident to see what we put in in the website . And it &apos;s not necessarily evident to see the environments .
We had to worry about expecting and and so on .
This is a reconstruction of the Nobody &apos;s Cacacactual cattattedge of Nobody images . Badigit . Badigit . And you get images of these guys in magniques , other campets and and and and and forth . Olickr . Olickr . And I &apos;m one of these arge , and it &apos;s discovery that it &apos;s discovered that it &apos;s all the model .
So they &apos;re all images from Flickr and they &apos;re all linked to space level this way .
And it &apos;s possible to be able in this simplly .
You know , I would never be thought of going to end working for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifying this kind of accounting here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of different phones of phones . And from those phones who are in the professional .
And if I can , I try to try to look at those more stranks .
Many of the faces are hetc .
And as a few part here is a series of photographs -- ecraining .
This is a Nobody &apos;s a few Nobody recorded .
We can go from the physics of this environment .
The essential is that we can do things with social environment . This is taking data from the entire memory , and the whole memory of the entire memory of the whole memory of the visual view -- and link all those data together .
All of those photos become connected , more of the parts .
You have a model of the entire emerge .
Think about this as a prolunging of Stephen Lawler on Earth virtual Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complex as as the people use , and the whose are are going to be able to get it .
Their photos are marked with metadded by other people .
If you &apos;re in a contrast of contrast , all these sation-called the name , my picture of the Nobody caught , and I can use it as a point of uncaught , and I can use it as a point of ingress in that space , in that metaphor , using the picture of anyone else , and have a social experience of kind of a cross-moot-based experience .
And of course , a consequence of all these are very extremely elaborate , of all interesting , collective , not only by the airplane , and the satellite images , and the satellite images .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I understand what your software is going to be doing is , in the next years , all the next years , all the photographs , all the photographs with anyone in the world in the entire world will be very connected with ?
BAB : Yeah . What is doing is doing is actually discover .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , in images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the images .
The thing is really interesting , if you think about the seanch of information that many of these images can be able to be a lot of these images .
As a little bit of images on the Web , you &apos;re digit , and the text on the Web page has a lot of information about the images .
Now , what happens if that picture is connecting to all your picture ?
So the amount of interconnection , and the amount of remarkable to get it is really enormous . It &apos;s a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really amazing .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure when you travel and one of the dolphonic research is the way that you can live between who don &apos;t forget the anti-living pleasure of the anti-based pleasure , the hair , the housing , the housing , the rain , and the famong the plants .
Basti , the sciamans Jaguar , Jaguar , or the Melan , or the Arab , or the Inuit &apos;s still cold me , or the Inuit &apos;s still cold , the distinct of the harm of the Dharma , to remember the Dharma of the harm of the harm of the harm of the subject of the Dharm , and that the idea that the world we have no matter , but it &apos;s only a model of a model of the reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stirpe has done , well or bad , many generations .
And , of course , we all share of essential strength .
We all all of the hibition .
We &apos;re also extended the initiation .
We have to deal with the inexorability of death , so we don &apos;t surprised and whaling --
We all have art .
What it &apos;s the particular is the race of the song , the rituum of every culture .
It &apos;s not the leaders that are the Penan of the Borneo , or the following of the Voodoo &apos;s Borneo , or the desert Kaised in Kenya , the Curandero , or a cammelting in Kenya , or a cammas .
He was my company in the desert a month ago , or a month ago , or a yak evator of the yak in Qomolangma , the mother of the world .
All of these populations are teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And , if you reflects a moment , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
And in the world , the myriades of cultures are creating a spiritual race of spiritual life and cultural , which wants the planet to be like biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural race as a in a ethnosphere and you can definitely defining the total of all concepts , all of the concepts , all , and inspiration , the ideas , inspiration , the ideas , inspiration , the ideas , and inspiration of the consciousness .
The ethnosphere is the great pathium of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbols of what we are and , we can be in how species of inquisitive .
And as the biosphere was very , very , as it &apos;s happened to the ethnosphere and unfortunately , too quickly .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all the species is or is about the orest arm , because it &apos;s not the most apocalite of the most apocalite of biological diversity -- and not get it to even even even even even even even even even even even even a little bit of cultural diversity .
The whole thing is , of course , the mobile language .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just composite by a vocabulary or a series of grammaticks .
A language is the spraking of human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle with which is the animate of every culture is in the world .
Each language is a forest of mind , a shelf , a thought , a thought , a ecosystem of spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re sitting in Monterey , at least half , it &apos;s not more subsurrated in the ears of the kids .
They &apos;re not more teaching to the kids , the which means , to less than not cambones something , which they &apos;re already death .
What is more tradow of being a silence of the silence , of being the last talking a language , of the last talking a language , not having to transmit , or to anticipate the promise of the kids ?
This orrying is the state of someone in a few weeks , every two weeks , every two weeks , every two weeks , a few weeks , and door with it in the last last last silly of a language .
And I know somebody of you will say , &quot; Is it better ?
The world is not a better place if we &apos;re going to let all do the same language ? &quot; WBenisite , then we &apos;re all yoruba . We &apos;re all yoruba . We &apos;re going to talk about the tank . We &apos;re going to do all yoruba .
We &apos;re talking about kogs .
You &apos;re going to have a trailer what it means is not to be able to talk about their language .
Now I &apos;d like to do a journey through the etnosphere --
a little journey in the ethnosphere to give you a little bit of what we &apos;re lying .
Many of us forget that when I say , &quot; different ways of existing , &quot; I mean , really , in order to be very different ways of existing .
We take for example this bimbo Barasana , in Amazon sectors , the people from the Amazon , which creates to the mix of the milk of the milest in the front of of the milest in the floulder of the milk of the milk in the bread ,
It &apos;s a people who are not able to distinguish the color blue from the green because the celests because the celests of the blue time , which is identified in the forest of forest , which is the people .
They have a kind of strange and a role , and a rule , called &quot; exogy language , &quot; exogy &quot; : You have to sposite a different language .
All of this has radical roots in the past mitological , though the particularly , and it &apos;s in these families that are in these families , because of the match representing six or seven ing-the-none language .
They &apos;re limited to listening and then they start talking to .
We take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived , the Waorans of Ecuador East , a incredible popular that has the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionary miss have been trying to be a made of a made of a made .
They &apos;ve done it down on the top photographs that they reritened them in the order of the return that this people , forest that this people in the forest pluvial forest had never seen anything about bi-dimensional .
They &apos;ve collected the picture , they &apos;ve been taken on the ground , or a form or a form or a figure and , not by the way , they have concluse that was the diavoid , and they killed the five missionary .
But the Waorans don &apos;t kill the foreign .
They killed between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by their own .
We &apos;re eight , we &apos;re at eight generations and we found two of natural death , and when we &apos;ve insisted that one of them was invested that one of them was invecting , and then they kill it . And then they kill it . &#91; Ris&#93; Ad Ad every way , they had a incredible knowledge of forest .
The caccidators were able to recognize the animal urine , and to recognize the species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned a really interesting task when my Harvard professor , he asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to intrust-to-based task , to the basic basic force of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes , and Tonton Macoutes , and I imposing myself for the gunless than the goms .
To make sense of a miraculous , I should understand the culture Voodoo and that Voodoo is not magic .
It &apos;s pretty much of a complex vision of the world .
Many interesting interesting .
If I ask you to tell me about the big religions of the world , what would you do ?
Cristianity , Islam , Buddsm , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always let , thinking that the sub-S-Saharan Africa has no faith . And instead and Voodoo , and the Voodoo is not the other religious religious religious source of nates during the tragic .
What makes the voodoo is the relationship between life and death .
So the vights are doing the spirits .
The spirits can be invocated by the Grands Actually , they respond to the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the way that &apos;s so that for a short short short , the following thing .
And that &apos;s why you &apos;re going to say , &quot; You &apos;re white who are going to talk about God .
We dancing in the temple and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re posing , is the spirit that guide you , how can you do it ?
So you see in these incredible events : the voodoo in state of trance that touch is that touch impunishment of the body &apos;s mind , very strong , the body is catalyzed in a state of extremendous excited in a state of extreme extrance .
And in all the people with which I lived the most extraordinary people who lived the most extraordinary are the Kogi CCCCs , in the Colombia security .
And then , they &apos;re going to be a tyrange that once they live on the aid plant on the aid plant , the people have the conquician , the people are retreat the volcanic mass-up , the insurance of the insurance ,
In a drug continent of blood , this people have been conquistate , this is never conquistate by the spagers .
And in fact , they &apos;re government by a clever , but their formation is so extraordinary .
The young people are the families with four or four , or four years , and they live secrets in a world made of good and adominally adadmit for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years , they &apos;ve been given you to reproduce the nine months of gestation that translated into the mom of mother , now are metaphor in the Maath--year-old ,
For this time , they &apos;re acculturated to the values of their societies , values that they &apos;re going to see that their prefer and only their preacious balance -- or to do the cosmic balance .
And the term of this incredible initiation , they &apos;re suddenly taken out and for the first time in life , at the age of 18 years , and they see an alba . And in that activities of the first bleap , when the sun sun the sun of the beautiful landscape , all of the time , all that they &apos;ve learned in the whole slow-up . The pret does a step and says ,
&quot; What ? I &apos;m going to tell you .
It &apos;s amazing . Now it &apos;s a lot of it . &quot;
They call it more more , and they say that we , brothers , are the minors , we &apos;re the hair of the destruction of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think of the Indigene and the environment we call Rousseau and the old story of the weline , which is a concept in its simplicity or maybe invoon his simplicity or invoon , and we say that these people are more close to the Earth .
The Indies are not nor no sensitive sensitive , is inated by nor .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the Asmat Asmat Asmat or in the Tibet , but thank you at time and I went to the time , and I started , they created a mystic of the idea of the Earth , not the concept of the idea of the Earth , it can be able to live because it &apos;s only infected by aware of human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
It &apos;s saying that a kid &apos;s a boy of Anes that &apos;s a little bit of the Age that mountain is a spirit of Apu that will be a depor to be a very different , and it &apos;s going to have a different seven--year-old boy that grown up with the mountain or that a mountain of rock of rocket that &apos;s a massive ament of rocks to be scaving .
which is the dimora of a spirit or a tiny tiny is irrileving .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia Britannics , and they were used to be cut .
And that &apos;s a human being different from my friends Kwaucucucucucates that they believe the forests are the forests are the dimora of Hukukukukukukuk-to-the-, which are in the Hamaf , the world that are in the beginning of the Hamaf , the Samatch of the Hamatch .
If you start to think that these cultures can create different different , you can start to understand some of them , you can start to understand some of them feeling .
I &apos;ve taken this picture to open the Amazon nine Amazon nine .
Maybe some of you heard about the ayaaf , the most powerful psychoactive , the most powerful psychoactive repertoire .
What makes it reliant the ayaaf , it &apos;s not the drug of the basically , but its processing . It &apos;s what &apos;s made . It &apos;s what &apos;s made of two elements .
From one side , this liana lessly liver that containing a series of moal-coal , harmful and dogene , lighting housing .
And by by having the only plant ant , it &apos;s a bluaster that alter a little bit of the consciousness , but it &apos;s myth with the family of a caffecting family of a caffection of the caffection is .
This plant is contains , very similar to the serotonin , dimethyppyppyppyppyyppyytamine .
If you &apos;re going to see Yanomami pulling on for the hide , the basically that they make a different set of species , it &apos;s a different set of species , it &apos;s a different set of species , it &apos;s a different set of species , you know , you know , the Yypamine .
Thirare the dust on the hibbbust is a little bit like to be shown by a shoulder of the bodies of eyes and land on a sea of electricity . &#91; Ris&#93; &#91; Ris&#93; Don &apos;t create a distorsion of reality .
I &apos;ve got often to be with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has been himself the fourth was pitch , with his finished fungi in Mexico .
And I &apos;m going to be in my tamine as as allucinogens as as allucinogens , because if you &apos;re done , you can &apos;t tell anybody to be hallucinted . &#91; Ris&#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; trtrouble , because they &apos;re deny because they &apos;re obvious because they &apos;re obvious in the intestine , demonoin-dates .
It &apos;s possible to assus the orally only if they &apos;re abunte with other chemical suspended chemical suspended .
Now , it &apos;s the great , the mos that are in this liana are ininjitors of MAO , the same kind of need to be able to potential trip . The question is a fer of 80,000 species of plants , like these people are in this lian inflate , as they do these people are in this way , but that if we combinated in this way , we create a biochemistry , and that if it &apos;s a computer version of the parts ?
We use the great eufeminism of evidence and error , which can be being being being intimate infrued .
But if we ask the Indians , they &apos;ll tell us , &quot; The plants are going to say , &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayawars , which distinguished neckicely in the forest , and that we would get in the same species .
If we ask them how to stay their tasses will say , &quot; I thought , &quot; I thought I understand it &apos;s plants , the rest of the plants , you don &apos;t know everything ? &quot; I &apos;ve got to be &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take 17 variety in a night of a lack of sun and each other .
And you don &apos;t have a graduate in Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting that count the stami .
Now , &#91; applausers &#93; the problem is that also the ones of us who have to the Indies are peacks in the history of the history of the history of the history of the history of the history of the history of the world , and it &apos;s also also also also on the world , and it &apos;s going to go beyond .
In fact , the 20th century , in 300 years , it &apos;s not going to be reminded for its technological innovations , but rather like the one was where we stop and enjoyed and we &apos;ve abbracked it , and we &apos;ve abbracing the mass of mass and cultural genal diversity of the planet . Now , the problem is not change .
All the cultures through the centuries in a dance for new life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux have not to be Sioux when they put it from the arm and frecovery as American , they have no stopped to be American when they put from the horse and hot .
It &apos;s not change or technology that threatening the integrity of ethnosphere . It &apos;s the power .
The hard daughter .
And if you give a look at the world , you know that these are not destined to disappear .
They &apos;re living creatures and dynamics in the existence of forces , they &apos;re also in the existence of the forces of adaptment .
And it &apos;s a disbosing of Penan --
a nomads of Sarawak , in the southern sy , a people who lived free free free in the forest to a generation , and now reducing to a generation , and now , and then the prostitution on the wave , where you can see the river the river , where the wave of the likes that it seems to be a half of the himself , where the nine , where the wave that it &apos;s been wave , where the wave ,
You &apos;re ready to repile the wave with the forest .
Or , in the case of the Yanomami , are the diseases that have come with the discovery of the old .
If we put on on the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the hard daughter of politics .
As you know the genocide , the physical extinction of a populations , it &apos;s convicted to the universal level , but the etnocium , the destruction of a people , not only is constyle , but it &apos;s also ununless to be constraints , because it &apos;s part of the strategy .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of Tibet until you &apos;re part of the beginning .
I &apos;ve lost 6,000 miles from Chengdu in China , in the Western Sweather , coming to Lhasa with a young connecting , but only came to Lhasa with a young connects , but only came to Lhasa . And it &apos;s the statistics that we &apos;ve been talking about .
6,000 monuments in the dust and wells .
1.2 million people killed the military during the Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical at the Panchen Lama .
The Chinese means that it was killed at the time of the Chinese invasion .
And it &apos;s been in Sua Santity during the diaspora during the diaspora that has brought the people in Nepal .
His mother was imprisoned and his cold was being rich .
It &apos;s been brought to birth in a career at the age of two birth , because it didn &apos;t have to live without him .
The sister , who did the same , it was put it in reeducated .
A day has invertised a hot hot , a man &apos;s sheled , and , for this transgrsion , it was put on the forced in seven years .
The pain of the Tibet can be insopposable , but it &apos;s the spirit of the people is from tener .
And then , it &apos;s all the time , it &apos;s got to a choice .
We want to live in the world monocromatic , or we want to accept the world policy of diversity ?
The great anthrologist Margaret Mead , before we die said that his biggest landscape was that , in our our our world , we &apos;re going to see the entire gma of the human imagination . We &apos;re going to see the whole gma of human imagination .
And it &apos;s a humiliating to remember our species is there for 600,000 years .
The Neolitica Revolution in the Frenrenrenewelling , which has made us overfight on the seed , and we have to replace the poetry of the socking with the next of the clesis , creating the gerarchy of the particular claim of specialization , and we &apos;re talking about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has to be 300 years .
That &apos;s a story not suggests me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we &apos;re going to have to be able to come in .
When to these myriades of cultures are asked what to say to be human , they respond to 10,000 different different vices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all reflies the possibility of being what we are : a kind of aware , that has to make all the people and the gisters can fit . And there are great moments of great great times .
I &apos;ve taken this picture on the north of Baffin , when I went to the Inuit , when I went to the Inuit , and this man , and this man , Olaya , and this man , and this man , Olaya , and this man , and this man , Olaya .
The canese government is not always gentiles with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to staff our supremate and in the &apos; 50s to stay our supremous colonies .
The grandfather &apos;s a man refair of us to go .
The family , I &apos;m going to tempting all of the weapons , and all of his attracting all of my toxy .
You have to know that the Inuit &apos;s not the cold , they do it .
The pines of the slave in origin in origin , they were made of fish in skin skin skin .
The grandfather &apos;s not a man didn &apos;t intie at night or from the artica or from the bull , or from the bultimard or the byle that was a bull .
It &apos;s been gacked , it &apos;s hot the pantalons in the background and defectly in their own hand . When you did it &apos;s congelate , the work with a moon .
It &apos;s got a salive on the punch of this cold , and when I became solido , and when I became solido , he killed a dog .
He shake the dog and created a brighter , with the cables , and it &apos;s a slyed , has created a sliter , has imself to another dog , and it &apos;s unappear on the banking , and it &apos;s been disappear on .
We want to talk about horse with nothing ? &#91; Risate &#93; And this , in different ways , &#91; Applausers &#93; is the symbl of the resilience of the people in the world .
In 1999 , the Chinese government reduced to Inuit &apos;s dealing to Inuit , the total control of a larger territory area of California and Texas mall together .
It &apos;s their new painting . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a independent territory . Controllate all the minerary resources .
A plendive , as a natione-state can re-re-re-re-re-re-in-state ,
And , to end , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious to the people in those remote areas of us , and they realize that they &apos;re not remote .
For somebody &apos;s home .
They are representing sections of human imagination that they &apos;re going to get the altimate time . And for all of these kids , as our children , as the dreams of our kids , are become part of the hope .
And we &apos;re in Geographic , we &apos;re convinced that politicians will never be any .
We believe that polemics --
&#91; Applausers &#93; are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month our website has 35 million visits .
156 countries transmitted our television dog .
Our reviews are lected by millions of people .
Our work is travel in the ethnosphere to bring our public places in a wonderful places of cultural wonderful and cultural places that they &apos;re going to have gone from how they &apos;ve seen , abbracing , for the central anthropology of the anthrology of the exist anthropology : the world of the exist , and we have to find a style in a world pluralist and multicket a lithesis and multicket of the world and multicket in a world and multicket in a world and multimate and multimate world in a world in a
where we &apos;re all the people can contributing to our collective well-being collective .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope you &apos;ve heard and try to test some links , in the case , not notice them , in case , not notice .
I want to start what I call &quot; the official dogma . &quot;
The dogma official thing ?
The dogma official of all the West societial social society . The Western official official , &quot; If we want to massive the well-being . &quot; The way to do it is massive the individual freedom . &quot;
The reason , from one side , in fact that liberty is in itself a value , is pretious , it &apos;s pretious , useful , for humans .
And the other is in fact that if we are free , each of us can act to do everything that we have our well-being , because of our well-being , without any one that decide in our well-being , because of our well-being , and we decide , and no one of us to do all that that we have to do all that that we have to do all that that massive ,
The way of massive the freedom is massive the choice .
More choices , more they &apos;re libing , and more is their freedom , is their greater freedom , is their well-being .
This is so radical , it &apos;s so deeply radical in the society that nobody would dream to be dreaming it .
And it &apos;s also deeply rown in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly great .
I &apos;m letting me a simple note about the standing for injump .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without contact the 10 variety of olium extreme and 12 acets of olium and 12 acets , you can buy for a huge number of conditions in the inccious circents that nobody of 175 times you &apos;re already ready of your degree .
Here &apos;s what the supermarket .
And then you go to the electronic store , to buy one stereo : cast , the CD , radio , plastra , light , light , light , light , lifer .
And in this single store store , there &apos;s a big big audio .
We can make six million different combinations using the components that there are in one one store only store store .
You &apos;ve got a lot of choice .
Alther fields : the world of communications .
And once I was a child , they could get all the telephone services , and so that they could have been able to moke that they could get from mom Bell .
They were nulked the phone , you didn &apos;t bought it .
A consequence of that , in the other , it was that the telephone never .
These times they went .
Now we have a lot of different phones , especially between phones , especially in phones .
Here &apos;s the phones of the future .
My favorite is in the middle , and MP3 , cut cut the bird of the bird , and forth for the chromantic chromium .
If you don &apos;t have any even seen in the home , you &apos;re very much of the house , you know that &apos;s going to get .
And what the end is that people are going to get into the negotives and it &apos;s doing this question , and it &apos;s the answer ? &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cellphone that doesn &apos;t too too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the buy of the same explosion .
Assistence : not going to happen in the United States that you &apos;re going to be on the doctor and the doctor you &apos;re going to do .
Instead , you &apos;re from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; Okay , we could do it , or B , &quot; You can do it ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; Dr. r. &quot; What should I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A has these benefits and these benefits , and these benefits these benefits and these benefits . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebits , &quot; Dr. if she was me , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result we call it &quot; autonomy of the malate , &quot; expression that makes it look like a great thing .
But it &apos;s not that one move the fish and responsibility of the understanding of the decisions of someone knows something , which is the doctor , or whatever , it &apos;s the doctor , and it &apos;s not -- and so it &apos;s not in the ideal condition , and so it &apos;s not a certain way -- and so it &apos;s not the patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing of drugs of products , direct to people like me and you , which if you think of it &apos;s not any sense , because we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why they advertising them ?
The answer is that they want to ask the doctor to ask the doctor to ask us to ask the receiver .
Something about this is our ordemic as is our orthan is a matter of choice , how you see in this living , &quot; We don &apos;t want to forcing kids .
And we can reinventing us how many times we &apos;re aggrade .
The thing is that every morning , at the risis , you have to decide that kind of person want to be .
I &apos;m going to the family and the matriage , a long time , I &apos;ve been working on the top of the most preserved for anyone , was that you had the most preserved as possible , and they started to make the most preserved as possible .
The only one real choice was with , not when , and not , and not what what to do after .
So , it &apos;s really really to play .
I teach students very smart , and I &apos;m going to be 20 percent in less than a time .
And not because they &apos;re not because they &apos;re less diligents .
But why are I &apos;m imposed , I mean , I should do it ? I &apos;m going to be going to be doing it ? I should do it now ? &quot;
&quot; I should I think about the kids or to be thinking before ? I have to think before the kids or to be ? &quot;
They &apos;re very logoring .
And they &apos;re trying to answer to these questions , even though this implic uncomplete the companies and not get a great voice to my voice .
And they have to be doing that . They &apos;re important questions .
Now , the work : We &apos;re lucky , as Carl underoll underneath , because technology allows us to work every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from the Hotel Randolph .
And I &apos;m going to be a angoline , and I &apos;m not to say to anybody , where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use me .
What does , this incredible freedom of choice that we have about the work ? It &apos;s that we have to continuously decision , if we have to work or no .
We can go to see our son play , with the mobile phone in a pocket , the Blackberry in other , and the notebook notebook , and the notebook , and the notion , and the notion , and the notion , and the notion , and the note , and the notion , and the notion , and the notebook , and the
And even though I &apos;m all spend , every minute we see , every minute we &apos;re also asking , &quot; I &apos;ve also wondering , &quot; I should answer to this ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer to this emails ? I have to abbox this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is &quot; no , &quot; This makes the experience of your son &apos;s very different than what it would be in other conditions .
So , anywhere we look at , small things and big , things , life is a lot of choices .
And one time the world was this : That was there were some possibility , but it wasn &apos;t a choice .
The world of today is a good thing , or the dilemma is , &quot; Is it a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Simplus .
We &apos;re all the positive layers , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative .
All of this choice , two negative effects on people .
The first , paradoxically , it &apos;s producing instead of liberation .
And so , with many options of which choices , it becomes very difficult .
I give you an example of a significant study of the volunteers of volunteers .
A connected , and it has been accessed to the data of Vanguard , the giant company , with about a million of the source of a million of climate , with about a million of climate ,
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offer in the more , the percentage of adesione scenes of two percent .
With 50 sources , there &apos;s 10 percent in less than adesions , when they &apos;re available to be available to when they are available . Why ?
Because with 50 sources of which choices , it &apos;s sick to decide , and choice is reaching it , and choice is reached to the intimate injected .
And in domans , and more in domans , and domans , and of course , I am , of course , I &apos;ve got no .
You know that &apos;s not only only means that these old old old people are going to have food because they &apos;re not enough money , even enough , even say that decision is so that they &apos;re also going to say that the decision is so that they &apos;re also going to say that the decision is so that they &apos;re going to be so much money ,
Not participating , they &apos;re lying until five dollars from the dator of work , which would be well well , they would be well be able to be well .
So the paralized is a consequence of having too much choices .
And I think that &apos;s a world .
&quot; And to end , for the eternity : ketchup , or maionese , you &apos;re feeling or maionese ? &quot;
You would like to take the right decision , if it &apos;s for the ethernity , isn &apos;t it ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and yet the condition .
So this is the first effect . The second effect . The second is that , if we can avoooke the way , we &apos;re less southern &apos;t , we &apos;re less options of how we would we have been with less options .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions of which choices , if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you would have a different choice that would be better . And what what &apos;s going on is that the alternative imagined us to maricate the soulder , and the reaching plant reaction the sation-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-on ,
And also when it was a great decision .
The more choices , there &apos;s more easy to be unless detail of any detail that is insatisfaction of the option choice .
And there is what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has been very well , how the value that we &apos;re going to the things that we &apos;re going to depends on what we &apos;re going to do .
And the rest of the other , when there are a lot of options , it &apos;s easy to represent the alternative of alternative , and be less less less than the option that you &apos;re choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I use with everyone who are not in New York .
But that &apos;s what you &apos;re probably going to think .
There &apos;s this copy in Hamptons .
A place of susk .
Spire splendida . It &apos;s all for them . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s nothing . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , it &apos;s Agust . &quot;
&quot; Everyone my neighborhood in Manhattan are on . &quot;
&quot; I could park up in front of home . &quot;
And it &apos;s two weeks , from the idea that &apos;s perdating -- every day -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The costo-opportunity decreates the soddisfation for what we have , even when the choice was excellent .
And the more are the options that we have to think , more attracts of the most attracts of us against how we constantly do it .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
It &apos;s about the time , and maybe of the living slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you choose , you choose to do not do other .
The things we don &apos;t choose so much attractive attractive that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : the growing spiral .
I tried to my skin bought a new couple of jeans .
I &apos;m almost always jeans .
And one time jeans were just a kind of guy , they bought them and vote and they were sounds like , just after they were sounds , only after they took them a lot of times , they started to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple of new when the old ones were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
The committed me , &quot; You &apos;re going to do it , you know , fit , relaxed ,
You &apos;re going to do with the cernier or with the bottons ? &quot; Stonekhed and &quot; ? &quot;
&quot; You &apos;re going to struggle ? &quot;
&quot; Seight wants a lot of stricks ? Bla , &quot; Continule , &quot; Continule .
I was sweep , and after a little bit I was able to say , &quot; I want the guy -- that was the only guy . &quot; He didn &apos;t have any maledeaths , and then I came out of the unknown , and then I came out of the unseen jans , with the best few jans , with the best of jans that I had .
It was the very very much . And so we had the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand it .
The reason I was worse that I was that with all of my expectations , the jeans had to be perfectly .
I had been waiting for me , I didn &apos;t expected anything except when there was only a kind of time , but when you live in 100 different , I would have to be perfect .
What I had to be buying was , but not perfect .
After I started to do that I was insation-sation-made in confronted to expectations .
The add of options in life of people don &apos;t do that increase the waiting for the eccellence of the same options .
And that &apos;s going to produce less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
No one in the world of marketing if you realize .
Because if they knew it , you don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth of the most results this .
&quot; It was better when you was worse , &quot; The reason why it was better when you were worse , it was even even even even met as possible as you were even even met surprising the pleasure .
In the world where we live in the world where we live -- opulent , industrialized addictancy -- the very very much that we can hope is that the things are at the waiting for the expectation .
You &apos;ve never surprised to be surprised because your expectations , my expectations , you &apos;re ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Baxation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes , you want it . &quot;
I mean , I mean , a little authographic -- which I &apos;m really really great studies .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t have to do , I &apos;m not a lot of me .
But it &apos;s not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of buy a couple of jeans scomodes , when there is only that kind of jeans is that when you &apos;re not sation-on , and you ask , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who &apos;s responsible ? &quot; , the answer is clara .
The world is the responsible . What would I do ?
When there are hundreds of types of jeans , and you buy one insatisfactor , and you ask you who is the responsible , it &apos;s very clear that the responsible , you &apos;re going to be .
You could do better .
And with hundreds of variety , there are no excuse for the insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even though the result is valido , you feel insatisfacfacts and they &apos;re going to be insatisfactory .
In the last years , depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only important , but important -- of this is the great , of this depression is just that people have been too althy .
And when they have to explain this is they think that the cold is .
So the end result is that we &apos;re better , and we &apos;re better , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely phones . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little choice of choice is better than a little choice , but from this isn &apos;t going to be a lot better choice .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic value . I don &apos;t know what .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve got enough to be able to be able to be able to be our life .
Now , from politician -- I &apos;ve been nearly -- from the political point of view , the nocy is the following .
What allows all of this choice in industrial society is the wealth of this stuff .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too paid .
So the factory I &apos;m talking about is a mal-exclusive society of modern , reaching Western societies .
And what makes depressing and angry is this : Steve Levitt told you yesterday , and they talked about how much and comoils for bimes are inutives . It &apos;s a splirector of money .
I mean , these choices , complicated and dispendious , it &apos;s not just they &apos;re just inutives .
I &apos;m adopt deleterie .
They &apos;re doing worst .
If a little bit of what in our society allows a lot of choice , it &apos;s not just a lot of choice , not only be their life to improve , it &apos;s not only their life to improve , but also our .
This is what economists call a improving way .
A distribution of income , it &apos;s good to all -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in excess that we &apos;re going to do .
To end , &quot; Flle , you can become everything you want to --
You &apos;re , people of culture , you &apos;re going to think , &quot; What do you create that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t be any in a glass of glass . &quot;
&quot; A sense of castrate , a limited view of the world --
and I &apos;m going to go to this , I started .
But then , I realized that , instead , I realized that that the fish knows the long time .
Because the reality of fact is that if you &apos;re manda in frankness , so that &quot; everything is possible , &quot; You don &apos;t get the freedom . You &apos;re going to get the freedom .
If you break the bocol in a way that all of divents as as much as a satisfaction .
You &apos;re going to get the paralysis , and you reduce the well-being .
Everyone is need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too strike , maybe even for fish , and certainly certainly for us .
But the asype of some symbolic , is a recipe for inhappiness and , and I &apos;m going to get the injury .
Thank you .
