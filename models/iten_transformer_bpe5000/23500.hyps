Last year I showed these slides to demonstrate that the glacial calear , which for almost three million years had the size of 48 , the United States continental dimensions , it &apos;s retroying 40 percent .
But this underneath the gravity of the problem because it &apos;s not exhibition of ice .
The glacial ice ice ice ice is , in a sense , the clean of global climate climate system .
It expands of winter and retreated in summer .
The next slide is going to be a carrying reveness of the last 25 years .
The glaces are reported in red .
As you see , they go to the blue blue the dark blue .
That &apos;s the winter ice in the winter , which is summer ice retreat .
You can see that the perenabled ice , five years or more , is like a blood , that &apos;s like blood , here , which is a blood , here , which is that there was a body .
In 25 years , it was like this .
This is a problem because the interests that are interests the land around the artic ocean where there are huge amount of fuels of coal ocean , where there are huge amount of fuzzy , come into the metal ocean .
I &apos;m going to the totality of the atmospheric atmospheric pollution , that amount of the amount of waste , that amount of not around .
In some deeper lagues in Alaska metan , the meters are already referred from water .
The Katey Walter of the University of Alaska was a team prices that was a team prices last winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You &apos;re good . The question is if we will .
One reason is that this is the Earth &apos;s Groenland from the north .
This is a river at the glacial rubber .
The lapse had never reached that .
This is the Kangerlussuadier , in the southwest of the Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level to be shapes on land , it &apos;s where it reaches the sea .
These currents are increasing .
On the other side of the planet : Antarctica , the biggest ice block of ice on the planet .
Last month , the scientists have told that the ice of ice is in negative , and that the Western Antarctica , which rain on some islands , and it &apos;s particularly reaching in the sun .
It &apos;s about six feet of the water , like in Groenland .
Suli Himalaya , the third largest block of ice , you see new lakes , that few years ago , they were glad .
40 percent of the world &apos;s going to get half of the willing with that smom .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the potential water of this city .
The ported is increased .
But when he demines , the same happens to the same thing is .
In California , the snow on Sierra Nevada is deminuity of 40 percent .
The hyhyriririries are in the crisis .
The previsions , as you &apos;ve read , they &apos;re grave .
The safety growing in the world door to a remarkable increase in the inceness .
The environmental disaster is increasing a rhythm outside of normal and unprecedented .
Four times more numerous in the last 30 years of the previous 75 .
This is a unsustainable time .
If you look at it in the historic context , they can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the highly Pacific area of the Eastern Pacific , and on both the parts of the subcontinent , where there is a radical impoverwhelming of the oceans .
The greatest cause of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two of the most emissions , with China .
And he would proponates to build a lot of other central central .
But we &apos;re seeing a change of direction .
These are the annullated projects in the last few years and some of the versus of the versus .
At any way , there &apos;s a politics in our country .
The industrial and the coal and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the last year to promote coal coal , which is a bone .
That picture would remember me something --
Verice Natal , in the Tennessee , there was a loss of 3.8 billion liers of cocoal fasters .
Maybe you have seen it on the news .
This is the second largest flow of the flow of the flow of America .
It &apos;s happened around the U.K.
Naliice , a coal of one of the coal industrial was this .
Video : His the carbon , it &apos;s a kind of allegry and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and grow our economy .
Frosooid carbon is more clean .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and workers keep the workers keeping the fashion .
Al Gore : From here is most of the West Virginia .
The biggest minerary societies is Massey Coal . This is his administrator . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I &apos;m going to be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelososy -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Dotection of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : At the next year , we see the same climate change as a sweet threat at our business .
So , our priorities is to invest a huge amount of money in a publishers that will make public reverse and confused the coal truth .
But actually , coal is not sports .
We think it &apos;s pulit -- it &apos;s also a good profumo .
So not preupon climate change .
Let me do .
Video : Carbone pulit -- you heard of it .
So let &apos;s do a turn into a structure at the avanid structure for how clean fuel coal .
Straordinarily ! The machines are a little noisy , but this is the sound of the puillion fuel technology .
The coal consumption is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology that you see changes everything .
You look at a look , this is the puzzle odial odial odial odial .
Al Gore : The end , the positive alternative , you can connect to economic and that national security .
Video : America is in crisis in crisis , the national security , climate crisis .
The filter that connection all : our dependence from fossil fuels , like coal coal coal and oil imported .
Now , though , there &apos;s a new , audacy solution to use .
Repower : 100 percent clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to reach America work , make us more safe , and help stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that drinking solution that we &apos;ve got to solve our problems .
Repower America . Scoper more .
Al Gore : This is the last one .
Video : It &apos;s about re-energy to America .
One of the faster ways of bringing to dependence from the fuel that killing our planet .
Comparsa : The future is here . Very , a new energy network .
Comparsa : two : New aging aging aging for jobs that are well well retributed .
Complational : Repower . It &apos;s time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old African African African African African said , &quot; If you want to go speed , go from solers .
If you want to go away , you go together . &quot;
We need to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED I did a LHC :
And you promises to go back to you to go back to you how the car works .
So , I &apos;m here . And for those that the other time there were not , the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever attemed -- 27 kilometers of circles .
His task is to reate the conditions that were at less than a billionth of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
It &apos;s just ambitious .
This is the car under Ginevra .
We &apos;re going to go through these mini-Big Bang in the relevers .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLAD -- it &apos;s what I work . It &apos;s called ATLATLATLAD -- it &apos;s what I work . It
This is an ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLAS in construction so you
So 10 secember last year we &apos;ve got the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLA
It was because of immense fleat the control of control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first of particles that had done all the around the LHC , and he comes into the LHC , deliberately , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles in the heat .
In other words , when we see that picture the 10 September , we know that the machine worked , which is a great vicuable vittory .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to make us more or this , when someone went on on Google and vide that the beginning page was this .
That means we &apos;ve had a cultural impact beyond that scientific .
About a week later , there was a problem with the car , had to these filters here -- these dored files .
These files 13,000 ampampes when the car works at the most of the power .
Now , technical between you look at the files and they say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . They &apos;re too good . &quot;
And instead , they can do it because when they &apos;re very cold , they &apos;re going to be the superconducucuction .
So , at least 271 degrees , at a lower temperature to the space between stars , these files can bring that current that current .
In one of the giountures between the most of the magnets in the LHHC was a defect of factoration .
So the files are going to warm up , and the 13,000 ampampes suddenly met an electrical resilience .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magnets are weighted over 20 tons , and that moved about 30 centimeters .
They &apos;re damaged about 50 magnetic magnetic .
We had to take them , what we did .
We reinated them and waste .
They &apos;re now coming back to their underground .
I &apos;m going to the LHHC is going to be integrated .
We will go and go and expecting the data or daughter , and continue so our adventure to find out what the universe is that &apos;s the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents reaching the value of science and the frontier of science and frontier engineering frontier .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s the fact that &apos;s the value of things like LHC .
I &apos;d like to end with the words of a English English scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , I guess , in the defense of his cleaning , his pupillo was Michael Faday , he said , &quot; No is so dangerous for the progress of human mind as the progress of human mind as the mind as we return the define as well as as the science as a conquent to us , and that &apos;s complete is complete , and it &apos;s complete a conquent to us of a a lot of our our own own own own . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start asking for rethinking about when you , you play with children , you play with the morning .
And as you know how to reach them and grab them , and you learn them , and you learn them , actually learn to think and solving problems and reach spatial relations .
Now , the spacecraft is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , by the useful information of our interaction with physicists , with my consultant objects , with my consulating Patatatory Jeevan Kalanii , I started asking to ask me , &quot; And if , when we use a computer , instead of having the only slow of the mouse as a digital pass that moves us to a desktop , we could have affect physically information with both hands , hands ,
and fire it to our pleasure ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big interactive computer like a biscope .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big interactive computer like a biscope .
You can move with the hand , they can see them , &quot; they can see &quot; between them , hear their movement and they have a wireless radio .
But the above all , they &apos;re physicists , like the morning , you can move it just reach grab .
The Sifmonetly , the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physicists , awars of their movement , and as they become more physicists , and as the other movement , as they become more physical , of the movement , of the other , of how we can explore new interaction .
I &apos;ll start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show video : if you incline it in a direction , the video will round to go back .
These interactive portraits of others .
If you can do it , if they &apos;re interested in what it &apos;s going to be around .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they &apos;ll see it and they can act a little bit .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they &apos;ll see it and they can act a little bit .
They also have their own movement and inclination .
And then we realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was that we could use common gestures on data , for example , &quot; a color like whether it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configured like green sweet and I can use them to use them to the central color in that central color , where they put it .
and I can use them to the central color in that central , where they put it .
We can get it too , we can put a little bit of it .
And there are also beautiful possibility of learning , like languages , the languages , the mathematics and logic , where people can try things things , and see the results that immediately .
Now , I &apos;m --
This is a Fibonacks that I do with a equations program .
Here we have a words that &apos;s half between Scarabeers and Boggle .
Basically , to every turn out of every Siftable on every Siftable , you got a letter to every Siftable , you got a case on every Siftable , and while you try to compose he &apos;s looking at him at him , and while you try to understand him on a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds re-mischive , and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the children came to the Media Lab , I did in the Media Lab , I &apos;ve made a video .
They &apos;re very pleased .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of apply is you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
You just say , &quot; Compons of words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s the other people who try it .
This is our younger Tibeta younger tester there there on the right .
It actually wanted to be employed .
They were only morning , they were just for him .
Now , this is an applying of an interactive cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of the languages . He &apos;s Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , seating the Sifmonettable .
It can put new characters in the scene , seating the Sifmonettable .
So it &apos;s doing out of the sun .
Video : The sun is surd .
David Merrill : Now he led a treatment in the scene .
Video : The arange treatment .
Good job ! Yeah ! Yeah .
So , you shake the Siftable and put them in the Siftable , and put them up --
Video : Bau !
and by inventing their story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a very open story with the open open , and it can decide him how you get off .
DM : It &apos;s a very open story with the open open , and it can decide him how you get off .
Video : Gola , cat it .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , which I &apos;ve got to show you is a tool , and I can do music .
It &apos;s a tool , which is done by the campion and performing music .
The Siftable here is lengagement from sounds like the low-and battery .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also also put these sounds on a sequence that you can compose .
And then it just by doing it to touch a sound and a sequence .
So , these are actually that you can control from vivive , like the revers and the filter .
And the acks to a particular sound and then incline for a roll .
And then there are general effects as time and volume , which are apply to the entire sequence .
Let &apos;s look like it works .
Video : We &apos;re going to try and put it in a Siftable in two Siftable , we put them in a series , we extended them in a series , we add basic , and we add basic .
I &apos;m going to put a low-line .
Video : DM : Now , I adding of percussions --
Video : And I &apos;m going to put the battery to the battery , so I can control the vive effect from alive .
Video : DM : I can reveal the entire sequence to the entire sequence to the time from one side or the other .
Video : DM : And now I &apos;m going to add the bottom to the bottom to give more expression .
Video : DM : I can reach the sequence of the flying face .
So I didn &apos;t have to planning it before , but I can improvise , make it longer or more coral .
And now , finally , I can smoking the entire sequence of the left Siftable , the Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new human interfaces more resements like how we work our brain work and the body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the outcomes of this path , and also some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that &apos;s coming this new generation of objects that we &apos;ve got this new generation of the digital objects that we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the hour of talking to all you .
I &apos;m a writer .
I &apos;m books in my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the fascinating of my life .
And I don &apos;t look like it .
But that , I said this , something that particular has been successful in my life and my career , which led me to reach the entire relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called &quot; Mangia , &quot; Prega , &quot; which , diversously , by my previous books , for some reason that came out of my previous books , for some reason , and became a great senational , the interational , and it &apos;s interational .
And the result is that everywhere you go now , people treating me as if I was convicted .
It &apos;s true -- conducted , admit !
They are all been worried and they say , &quot; Do you don &apos;t fear to do better than do ?
You don &apos;t fear to go and write all the life without able to create a book that can matter to someone else to make a book that can matter ?
what can you care about someone ? &quot;
It &apos;s reassuring , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember that I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent writer .
I went to the same reaction with the fear .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t I feel like to do not success ?
You don &apos;t fear that the ulilililifted you ?
You don &apos;t fear to make this mesh for all of life without anything that &apos;s ever coming out and to die on a cumb cumb with the mouth wheel full of failing ?
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I &apos;m afraid of all those things .
I &apos;ve always had fear .
And I also have fear of many other things that people would not be in .
Like the algae and other things .
But as I thought , I was writing what I thought and ask me is why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logical that anyone who would expect to be slow from a work that &apos;s been born to do .
But what &apos;s there so particular in the creative companies to get us to the mental health as as as well as as a many other reeable to reach them ?
As my father , for example , he was a chemist engineering and I don &apos;t remember one time in his 40 years of activities that he was asked whether he was fear to be engineer ?
We had never -- that block of engineer John , how do it is ?
It didn &apos;t work so , you know ?
Onestly , chemicals are not certainly , in the centuries , in the reputation of being alcclearly depressed .
We have a writers , we have enough to this reputation , and not just a writers , we have this reputation of being enormous instables .
And it &apos;s not going to look at the sad contete of the creative minds that , only in the 20th century , died young people and often .
And the ones that don &apos;t have suichyhydons seem to be really disfacts from them .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , &quot; Each of my book has killed me a little more , &quot; A remarkable , and a little more , &quot; A remarkable ,
But we don &apos;t throw out when we feel saying this because we heard these things so long that we &apos;ve got completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and the suffering are somehow how related creativity and the suffering are somehow related the angosce , then then , it will always constrained to the angososce .
And the question I want to ask everybody here today is : Would you agree with this idea ?
It &apos;s good for this -- because it also looks like a centimeter of a distance to me , it &apos;s not good for this .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous , and I don &apos;t want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better encourage our big creative minds to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start to fire to that I felt that I was in my career .
That &apos;s true -- that &apos;s a lot of young , I &apos;ve got about 40 years old .
I &apos;ve got still about four work workplace in me .
And it &apos;s very likely to write about what he writing about now , and then it &apos;s going to be judicted after the very success of my last book .
I &apos;m going to be suit , because we &apos;re all more or less friends here -- is likely that my greatest success is to my spal spes .
Oh , Geso , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that brings a person to start dying in the nine morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would keep on doing this work that we work that we love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it turns me , after a lot of reflective , which the way to work to go and write is to write is to create a protective psychological construct , right ?
I have to find a few safety distance between me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural advance that I &apos;m going to do it , and I was trying to do for all last year , looking for all the last year , looking through other societies to see if they could have better better , and try to find other societies and more societies to see if they could have better better and more , and find them societary ideas that I &apos;m going to do societetary and I &apos;ve got to go through
how to help people manage to run the emotional risk of creativity .
And that research led me to ancient Greece and ancient Rome .
I &apos;m going to go because it &apos;s a round and then back .
In the ancient Greece and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity selling creativity selling from men , OK ?
And it thought the creativity was this spirit looks like , and that came to men from a few distant , and unknown for some distant reasons and unknown for distant and unknown for distant reasons .
The Greeks called these spirits of the demounds of creativity .
Socrate , wonderful , believed that he believed had a demon that held wisdom from far away .
Romories were the same idea , but they called that spirit without a genius .
Which is great , because the Romorn didn &apos;t really think that a genius were kind of intelligent particularly intelligent .
They believed that a genius was this sort of divine that would lived in the study of a dvine of a doubt of a neighborhood , and a little bit like the elevening the work of hidden the work of the artist , and model the outcome of that work .
Here &apos;s eastern -- here , that &apos;s the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological construct that you protect from your work .
And everybody knew it was so that it worked , right ?
So , antichi antichi were protected by certain things , like the too narcism , right ?
If your work was exceptional , you couldn &apos;t take it all the mereed , everybody knew that you were helped by this genius .
If your failed work , it wasn &apos;t all your fault , right ?
They all knew that it was your genius to be a unable .
And so people have han conceived creativity in Western for a long time .
Then the Renaissance came and everything changed , and it changed this big idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe over all of the mysters and without leap space to the mobile creatures and desk in the middle .
This was the rational principle of humanity and people started thinking that creativity came from selling .
And for the first time in history , it started to referred to this or that artist as a rather than a person with the genius that artist as a person with the genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big error .
I think that allow someone , a simple person to believe that they &apos;re like a recient recient as the source , and the smile , and the surrounding all the mysters , creative , unknown and unknowable and a lot of giving to the pitch for the pair of human payoff .
It &apos;s like to ask someone to enjoy the sun .
Deform and deapse and it completely makes the ego and creates all these expectations on performance .
And I think it &apos;s been this pressure to destroyed the artists in the midden 500 years .
And if that &apos;s true , and I think it &apos;s , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do it differently ?
Maybe back to a more ancient understanding of humans and mystery creative relationship .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t go to 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And probably people in the audience who would be reading scientific suspects on the notion of the notion of , insuitable , you do that follow people , and they follow their their projects .
I &apos;m probably not going to convince you all about this .
But the question I &apos;d like to ask is -- why not ?
Why don &apos;t you think about this way ?
Because it has more sense of anything that I &apos;ve ever heard to explain the imprevedibility of the creative process .
One process that , as anyone ever tried to do something -- so , basically , all of the one of them who has been been doing something -- you don &apos;t understand rationally .
And in fact , it can be completely paranormess .
I &apos;ve done this recently recently with the extraordinary poem Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years old , but it was a poem for all life and said to me that during his childhood in the Virginia , working in the fields , and he felt it , in if a poetry came from the landscape .
He said he was like a air train train train .
And that came to the roling her from the landscape .
It was to come , because he was to make the land under his feet .
He knew he had one thing to do at that point and he was , words , &quot; run as a matta . &quot;
And he was going to go home and came to this poetry , and have no one of paper and a card enough , and a match enough , as the traps , and then he would get it down and get it down and grab it on the page .
Sometimes , he couldn &apos;t be fast , so correcal and correcal and correcal would have to get into home and the poetry and get the rolated poetry and continued to rating through the landscape , and she would continue to rating through the landscape , and she said , &quot; another poem . &quot;
Then there were those times -- this piece I never forget -- there were times when there were some moments that was almost losing , right ?
So , he was running home and he was trying to paper and the poetry and card it through , and he he was going to go and he said , &quot; which was like , &quot; as if you put together with the other hand and the offices .
And it was offered poetry and reach into his body and transmitted it on the page .
And in these cases , poetry would have presented on the perfect page , but the contrary , from the last word to the first word to the first word .
So when I was thinking about -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly equal to my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- they &apos;re not a conducucucucucuck .
I &apos;m a mulo , and my way to work is ; wake up to the same orary every day and work and go and go over the goffly .
But even I even , in my rooms , I &apos;ve got liscized against that thing , sometimes .
And I guess a lot of you have the han done .
You know , even if the work and ideas came to me from a certain source , I would not be honestly known .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it in a way to not to lose your head , but rather , that we stay healing healthy ?
As I think , the best example of the contemporary example I have is the Tom Waits , which I interviewed several years ago for a journal .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the most of the life was the incard of the same time that we were the incard in the art of the time , trying to control , management , and to check , and managed , and to check , and to control , and managed , and to control , and to control , and to control , and run , and to control , and we know , Tom , and we were talking about the most of this , and you know , T
But then I invecked , he would hot , and one day he was driving on a L.A. , he changed everything for him .
It was going to be fast and all of a sat this little framment of melody , coming in in his head as inspired , elusive and the halling , and the desive , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the desive , but it &apos;s not knows how to take it .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a mark .
So he starts to hear this sort of old anxiety , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to go and I &apos;m going to go and reaching this song even even .
I &apos;m not enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to the panic , he stopped .
And I &apos;ll put the whole mental process and made something completely new .
He just looked at the sky and he said , &quot; I &apos;m going to see that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Do you think that can write a song now ?
If you really want to live , it &apos;s coming back to a more hurt , when I can take care of you .
Altrain , you go to the importance , you &apos;re going to be able to do today .
You can disturbing Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his work process changed after this .
Not the work , the work was still dark as always .
But the process , and the fish that was the fish that was refined when the genius , the genius that came out of him , the genius that came out of him back where it came from , and freezing it back to where it came , and it was reminded .
It &apos;s really , but it &apos;s not Tom , wonderful , a conversation between Tom and this thing straight between Tom and this thing that &apos;s not Tom .
So , how that I was going to change a little bit as a way I worked and already saved me once .
This idea , he saved me when I was writing , &quot; Mangia , Prega , &quot; and fall in a of those cave of dispersation in the dispersation that we all , and you start thinking about something and we can &apos;t start thinking about it , and it starts to think that it &apos;s a disastro , which is the worst book .
Not just the worst book , just wrote the worst book .
And I began to think of throw this project .
But then I remember Tom he talked to the air and tried .
So I got up my face on the manecritical and I was reached my comments to a vacuum corner of the room .
And I said to high voices , &quot; Serero-, what we know that if this book is not going to be brilliant , it &apos;s not going to be a good time , no ?
Because I &apos;m seeing here , I &apos;m putting all I have , I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to talk and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what I don &apos;t do anything .
I &apos;ll go to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to be recorded that I was presented to do my part &quot; because -- finally , it &apos;s so , OK -- , centuries does in the deserts of the North of the North of the people were dancing and the lawn that went on for hours and to the dance .
And they were always magnifies , because the dancers were professional and were fantastic .
But every one of these , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became actually transcendent .
And I know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know you &apos;ve all seen , at a point , a performance like this .
It was like the time to stopped , and the dallerine walked through a sort of a portal and was not doing anything else , the 1,000 of the first , but it was all going to be able to be in the same .
And all of a sudden , you know , it &apos;s just like a human .
But he came from the divinity and below the fire .
And when this happened , he was going to happen , people knew what he was , called him called him .
They were Congiant their hands and started to sing , &quot; Allah , Allah , God , &quot; God , &quot; God , &quot; God , &quot; God , &quot; God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curious notes -- when the invest the More of the Spagna , I preserve this abitude with them and the ready to them and the ready to do in the centuries from Allah , Allah , &quot; which you can still hear in the corride or famenus .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , hole , Allah , magnific , &quot; , &quot; unable , &quot; unable , &quot; unable , &quot; unable , &quot; unable , &quot; he &apos;s got a foot of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes the day after , for the dance itself , when you wake up and found that are the 11 in the morning and the 11 in the morning , the 11 of God is no longer .
It &apos;s just a lot of hurt to the knees , and maybe it will never be more to each of that altitude .
And maybe no one will sing the name of God still as a gira , and what &apos;s going to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most painting re-like re-reshousing .
But maybe it &apos;s not to be so corosciant if you can &apos;t believe , advanced , advanced aspects of your being being from yourself .
But just believes that are being data in the early part of your life that &apos;s a kind of a unimaginable source of this team of your life that you have to go to someone else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think about this this way it changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s certainly like I thought about it for several months during the working of the book that I &apos;ll Please I &apos;ll soon soon , the dangerous , and the dangerous , and attespy , and the very successful .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel electrized from this is , I don &apos;t have fear .
Not floating . It &apos;s just just your work .
It &apos;s going to talk about your part , any one can be .
If your work is dance , you &apos;ve got to dance , you know .
If the divine , absurd genius , you &apos;ve got to leave some of wonderful , for one moment through your effort , for one moment through your efforts , then , &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Otherwise , you do the same dance .
And Ole ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to you the same .
I think , and I think you should teach it .
&quot; Ole ! &quot; to you the same , even only for having had human love and testables that you can show you continuously introduced .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I &apos;ve talked about some of these these projects on the human genome , what it can mean and discovery of new set of genes .
Now we &apos;re starting a new path : We started digitize biology and now starting from that digital code , we &apos;re coming in a new phase of biology , designing and synthesizing life .
We &apos;ve always tried to ask big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists , I think they have tried to understand how many many levels .
We tried different approaches , reducing it to the minimi terms .
We &apos;re digitizing by almost 20 years ever .
When we sequenced the human genome treated from the analogical world of biology in the digital world of the digital world .
Now , we ask , how can we regenerate life , or create new from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome that can self-genome in the lab .
And we tried to reduce that the genome to create a little more smaller .
We can eliminate a hundred genes of the genes of the about 500 that are here .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our .
Credemic me , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it &apos;s very improbable that this can bring to a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to design was synthesize this chromosome that was to change the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of &quot; We can synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Can the chemistry consenent these big molecules that we never had to create before ?
And in case , we can make a chromosome work ?
A chromosome is just a piece of inert chemical material .
The speed with which we can digitize life is growing at exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , designs , rather slowly , but it &apos;s better .
And our most recent results the bring on a exponential curve .
We &apos;ve started more than 15 years ago .
The process has requested many passes , beginning with a bioethical review before we started the first experiments .
But we found that synthesize DNA is very hard .
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that produce little segments , the length of 30 to 50 letters to 50 letters , and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the most errors are .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these fragments and correct the errors .
And this was our first attempt , starting by digital information from the Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the framments , we &apos;ve designed the fragments of errors and get a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material inert and we put it in bacteria , and we put it into the bacteria , they started reading this this genetic code and produce viral particles .
The viral particles were then removed from cells , are come back and they destroyed the E.
I talked about recently with the members of the oil industry saying they have certainly understood this model .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build his same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the largest things larger .
We wanted to build the entire chromosome of the bacteria .
They &apos;re more than 580 thousand letters of genetic code .
So we thought we &apos;ve thought to build it in the cassette of the virus , so that we can change the cassette to understand what the components are the living components of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard was of a mistakes for every 10 mies .
We found it , resequenced it , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence would never be able to work .
A part of the process is designing segments 50 letters that are overwhelming with all the other segments of the other segments of 50 letters to build smaller underounded , small workers that work together .
We try to do a unic elements here .
You &apos;ve probably probably read that we put the lamest .
Think of it this : We have a genetic code based on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters together code about 20 amminoacids , and there &apos;s a specific order to letters for every amamateur .
So we can use the genetic code to write , frass , thoughts .
What we did in the beginning was self-done .
Some have been dolphused by the fact that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
We designed these segments to be able to just join with enzyme .
There are some of them repair and put them together .
And we started to assembling parts , beginning with the sets from five to seven mile letters , together so that we have a segments of 24 mies the letters of 24 mila letters to them .
So , we spend every step , we made these segments in abundance so that we could sequencing them because we &apos;re trying to create a very very robustooking -- like you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re looking for automatize the process .
So , this looks like the tables of a basket player .
When we get these very long segments , more than 100 mies , more than 100 mies , they &apos;re not going to grow directly in the E.
You get the modern limit of the modern molecular biology .
So we &apos;ve looked at other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called the homologist called homologa , which in biology has to repair the DNA that can join the segments .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism called Deinoccurred Deinoccurred , can absorb three million rad rad .
You can see in the upper riquitous riot as his chromosome is destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours it &apos;s reassembled exactly as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be completely dry .
They can live under empty .
They &apos;re absolutely sure that life exist in space , and you have to find new environments that are rechers of water .
Actually , NASA showed that this is happening .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built using these processes , just using the lieven-appropriate with design appropriate .
The hell them automatically .
This picture was not taken with a electronic microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It &apos;s a so big molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the publishing that we did a little time ago .
It &apos;s more than 580,000 letters .
It &apos;s the largest molecule of a structure that ever created by man .
It &apos;s got a 300 million to 300 million .
If we pass it with a 10 without spaces , we need 142 page only to transform this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ? How can we activer it ?
Of course , by a virus is a boy .
It &apos;s a little more complicated when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s easier even as well when it &apos;s eucarium , you can just get the nuclear nuclear , and put another , which is basically the process of clonation .
In the archaea chromosome is integrated in the cell , but we recently demonstrated that we &apos;re able to do a complete trapot of a chromosome from one cell to another and actively vast it .
We clean a chromosome parent from a microbial species .
The two are different as the men from mice .
We added some genes in a way that we decide what to choose for this chromosome .
And then he skied it with the enzymes so that it has been smom .
And when we put it in the cell is been raped -- and you open our so-like , and you &apos;ll open up our syclaimic graphic graph , the chromosome is went into the cell .
And we were beginning that we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried it anyway .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that tantisy species have added a second or a third chromosome somewhere , add in a second thousands of new traits to that species .
So who thinks about evolution as a only gene at the time , it &apos;s actually no longer understanding of biology .
There are some enzyme called the restrial of restrtion that to make digital DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell not possible one .
The phone phone phone -- the chromosome we put it on the chromosome that we put it on .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other chromosome as a extraneous chromosome , and we found with only the cell and the new chromosome .
It became blue because of the genes that we put .
And in a short of time , all the characteristics of a species , you &apos;ve got lost , and it turned around the new software that we put in a new species , based on the new software that we put the cell .
All the proteins have changed , and members have changed , and when we read the genetic code exactly what we &apos;ve moved to it .
Now , this may seem to be genetic alchemy , but allowing the DNA software we can change things in a very substantial way .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that this is not about genesis -- but progress from three million years and a half years of evolution , and I &apos;ve already told that maybe we are to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion in which is going to be new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s very obvious , when we think about our necessity .
We &apos;re going to go from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to give you an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now , there are three people on the planet for each one in 1946 , 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medical medical and well-half billion people .
It &apos;s going to be even more to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion coal coal , over 30 billion fuel barrels .
That means 100 million barrelates a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replace them , it will be a huge challenge .
And we have to keep the all of the CO2 emission from these materials that end up in the atmosphere .
And today , because of the scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I love to think that are the designers for the future .
The electronic industry is only only one dozen about components , and think about how many different things came out .
Our limits here are data here is principle data and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , thank you to these synthesization methods , able to create what we call this genomics combinatory .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think about processing these 20 million genes or to try to optimize processes to produce dock or drugs , new vaccines , we can change , but but to a little team , and create more molecular biology now that in the last 20 years .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival possibility , chemical vaccines , or chemical vaccines .
This is an instantaneal of some software programmed that we &apos;re working to be able to seat and design species at the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t necessarily know how they &apos;re going to be .
We know exactly how their genetic code .
Now , we &apos;re focusing on the fourth generation of the fourth generation .
You also saw that hetanol from the grain was a finished experiment .
We have second and therefore , we &apos;re going to use more high , which is going to be on the sugar to the highest value of the ophs or different butanol .
But the only way biology can have a big impact without increasing the cost of food and limited the cost of food and limited the available available , and we &apos;re working to design cells that they &apos;re working on to design cells that can reach this purpose , and we think we can have the first fourth generation in about 18 months .
The solar combined light with CO2 is a metodo--- but in our discoveries all over the world , we found different methods .
This is a organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , about 2,500 feet deep deeps on the water temperature .
It creates meters from CO2 using molecular hydrogen using molecular hydrogen .
We &apos;re trying to understand whether we can incanaling CO2 , which can easily be brought through your bones , converting that CO2 in coal , to drive this process .
So , we think we might be able to increase what the basic question of what the question is what life is . &quot; We , versus the whole cheap of replacing the entire oil industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can you do it ?
It would be a main source of energy .
Also , we &apos;re working on the same methods to create instantanem vaccines .
You saw this year with flu , we &apos;re always back of a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s about finding the right vaccine .
I think what you can change building combinable vaccines in anticius .
So , this is how the future might start to look at , now , the tree of evolution , accelling evolution with synthetic bacteria , arches , and finally cells .
We &apos;re so so much to make people better .
Our purpose is to make it a long enough to try to make it . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the faster , some fundamental work , the new technology that led to Microsoft in the following a almost a year ago exactly . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s a environment where you can interact is local local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data .
Here we are seeing a lot of digital photograph with a kind of digital photograph with a kind of a wear and continuous , for a fast panic , display images like we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much the amount of information that we see , how big these are these collapsed data or images .
Most of them are common digital photographs , but this for example is a scan from the Library of Congress , and reentra 300 megamma .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that &apos;s limits the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixels like this is the number of plays on your screen at any moment .
This is a whole , example of the data is not about images .
This is the Dickens &apos;s desolate of Dickens . Every column represents a chapter .
To demonstrate that it &apos;s just about heads and not about images , we can do something like that , to see really it &apos;s a real representation of the text , not of a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a little artificial book .
I don &apos;t advice it .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s about a number of The Guardian .
Every big picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading the real caraceum version of a magazine or a daily spapapplor of a half of a half .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of The Guardian .
We created a high-resolution advertistising -- much higher than what you use in a normal publishing , and we put you in the content of the extra .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the space limits of space on the screen .
I hope that this means to put the people in the end of people and other similar ports , not to be necessary .
Of course , the maps is one of the poorest applications for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say that we have contributed to give you this field .
These are all the streets in the United States of the Soveters above a NASA .
So , we go to something else .
This is actually alive on the Web ; you can go to the Web .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , who fighters two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting computer that Noah Snavely , a student of Washington , with the University of Washington , with the help of Steve Seadron and Rick Seadround Seadround of Microsoft Rick Szeliss of Microsoft Rick Seadron .
And it &apos;s from the websan , I was managed by Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from one image to the other and have this kind of experience to be multiple experience .
But spacectively , the spacectively meaning .
The algorithms of visualization have recorded these images together , so that correspond to the real places that you imagine all the time to the lagues of the lagues of the lagues of the Roccious Montagne -- they &apos;re taken . So you see the elements of a slight-de-stable or of a slightly , and these things are all connected to space .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot of them much more spaces .
I want to spend directly one of the Noah-original data set of Noah--- and this provided from a previous prototynth that we &apos;ve done work for the first time the summer -- to show you what I think is the key behind this technology , Photosynth , Photosynth technology , Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily evident as much as looking at the environments that we put in the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and forth .
This is a reconstruction of Nobody , Dame Cauctedral of Nobody , Dame Bauction Nobody , three Damn in Flickr and you get images of these campus and and then on . Oach one of these pieces and away . So one of these are arange , represents a picture that &apos;s discovery to this model .
So they &apos;re all pictures from Flickr and they were all connected to this way .
And it &apos;s possible to be able in this very simple way .
You know , I would never think of end to work for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratificating to receiving this kind of want to be here .
I think you can see that this is a lot of different types of phones of phones : from those cell phone professional SLR , a significant , that number of them in this environment .
And if I can try and try and try to try those more strange .
Many any blocks , etc .
Somewhere you have a series of photographs -- there &apos;s a series of photographs --
This is a Nobody of three Dame recorded correctly .
We can go from the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is taking data from a susuit -- from the entire collective memory of how the land , from visual point of view -- and connecting all that data together .
All those pictures become connected together , the greater than the parts .
You have a model of the whole land that emerges .
Think about this as the prolungation of Stephen Lawler &apos;s work on virtual Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complex as as people use it , and whose advantages for who are useful .
Their pictures are marched with meadapted meadapted by other people .
If someone is comes to the idea of contrast all these sets say the name , my picture of Nobody &apos;s cattedral of Nobody , three Dimprovisisely armed of all that data , and I can use it as a proof of , and I can use it to dive me in that space , in that metaphor with anyone else , and having a social experience of anyone , and have a social experience of the other cross-user and .
Of course , a consequence of all that are very extremely processed by every interesting part of the land , collective , collective , you don &apos;t just see planes and satellite images and similar , but from the collective memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What &apos;s your software is going to be able to do is that at some point in the next few years , all the photographs that we have all the world will be done with anyone in the entire world will be done ?
BAA : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is practice is doing is actually find out .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the basis of the content of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of seant information that many of these images .
As you do a research of images on the Web , it &apos;s a sentence and the heads on the web is a lot of information about pictures .
Now , what happens if that picture is connecting all your pictures ?
So the amount of seant connection and the amount of wealth that comes out of it is really huge . It &apos;s a classic network of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible . Compliments .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure of the orgeous pleasure of the ethnogical research is the way to live between who have no people forged the ancient of the people in the wind , the past in the wind , the hits the waves , it &apos;s a guilt , it &apos;s in the waving leaves .
Basti Jaguit &apos;s still coming from the Via Lattea , or that the Himalaya , or that the Inuit still , the substantians are still the significant breath of the Dharm , and the distinct budes , and the idea that the central importance of anthropology , and the idea that the world we live , and the idea that the world in which we live ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stirpful stires that we did , well or bad , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of essential traits .
We all hide . We all procreate .
We are expensive to the initiation .
We have to deal with the death of , so we don &apos;t surrounding and whales --
We all have an art .
What &apos;s the particular rhythm , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that they think are the Borneo &apos;s forests , or the following Voodoo &apos;s Borneo , or the Surge Kaitheist Kaids , Kenya in the Curanderrier , or a camp in the Ande , or a camp in the Sahara .
He was my journey company in the desert a month ago , or a yak hallelder in the Keek , on Mastern values on Mastern Masts , Mastern mother .
All these populations teachers are teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And if you rethink of a moment , it &apos;s a concept that it can give you hope .
Insibles , the miriades of cultures in the world create a spiritual and cultural that happens the planet and it &apos;s important for the planet , and it &apos;s important for the planet as biosties .
And you can think about this cultural spill a kind of ethnosphere and you can definitely definitely definitely the total of all the concepts , dreams , mit , ideas , inspired , intuition , inspired , intuition , by the human imagination of consciousness .
etnosphere is the great pathium of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and of what we can be as as inquisitive species .
And because biosphere was very very , as a very , as a success that &apos;s happened to the ethnic sphere and a lot faster .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all the species is the orge of the clothes simply because it &apos;s filled , because it &apos;s the most apocalyphenic diversity -- and you don &apos;t get closed to the most optitic diversity -- and you don &apos;t even get closer to the most optill the most optional diversity .
The whole thing is , of course , the language loss .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just composted by a vocabulary or a series of rules .
A language is the spraking of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the half the way that the soul of every culture comes in the material world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a kitchen , a thought , a spiritual of spiritual possibly .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re sitting here in Monterey , at least half is not suspended in the ears of the children .
They &apos;re not teaching children , which is , unless than not cames something that they &apos;ve already died .
What is more sad than the wiser of being flew , the last last few speaking a language , the way to talk about a language , the way to transmit the wisdom of children ?
This is a few people in the world was one in some of the world every two weeks : every two weeks , a old mud , and door with them in the tom-up sillo-language .
And I know someone who will say , &quot; Is it better ?
The world would not be a better place if we let all leave the same language ? &quot; We &apos;re all yoruba .
We talk about kogi .
You &apos;ll find a straight thing that &apos;s not going to talk to their language .
I &apos;d like to do a journey through the etnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a bit of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I say &quot; different ways of existing ways of existing exist .
We take for example , this Barasana bimmmbo in Amazon Sentrional SP , the people of the anaconda , which creds in the mist of the West in the southern of the west pends .
It &apos;s a people who can &apos;t distinguished the blue blue blue from green because the time celests , and they identified in the forest , which depends on the people .
They have a strange language and a rule , called &quot; exogram language , &quot; exogamia language , &quot; exogue , you have to marry a person talking about a different person talking about a different person talking about language .
And all of that has roots in the mitological past , though the particularly , is that in these households that are six or seven languages because of the marriages of mists to no one language .
They &apos;re limited to listening and then start talking about .
We take one of the most interesting tribe with whom I lived , the Waorani of Ecuador , a incredible populations that had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionary have been trying to a fatal contact .
They &apos;ve been shown down on the top photographs that retraded them in the room that they would react that this people who would have never seen anything about bi-dimensional forest .
They collected the earth , they &apos;ve been around the search of a form or a figure and , not out , they have concluse that had the diavian , and they killed the five missionary missionary with the lance .
But the Waorani didn &apos;t kill only the foreign &apos;t just killed the foreign &apos;t killed the foreign &apos;t just killed the foreign &apos;t killed the foreign of the Waorani didn &apos;t kill the foreign &apos;t killed the foreign &apos;t killed the foreign of the Waorani don &apos;t kill the foreign .
They killed between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by them .
We were saved at eight generations , and we found two natural death , and when we &apos;ve been stopped to know , they put one of them to them was invecked , and then killed it the same .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine 40 steps and recognize it species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned a really interesting job when my Harvard professor to Haiti , and I wanted to go to Haiti in the basic secret of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes , and I put my waste , and I impossessing my poison to make the zombie .
To make sense of the miraculous , I should understand Voodoo culture and the Voodoo is not magic .
It &apos;s quite a complex metaphical vision of the world .
Very interesting .
If I asked you to ask me about the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianity , Islam , Ebraism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no faith of religious religious . And instead , and the Voodoo is not another one that the distillustrated of these religious concepts that are very profound of slavor .
What &apos;s interesting is the intense voodoo is the intense report between life and death .
So , the vives are going to hide the bees .
The spiriters can be invested by the Great Act , they respond to the dance of the dance and replace time time to live in such a way that for a brief moment , the following one brief the folth becomes the goat .
So , this is the woodooists , say , &quot; You &apos;re white you go to church to talk about God .
We give them to the temple and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re going to be , is the spirit that drives you , how can you get you wrong ?
So you see these incredible events : following the voodoo in state of trance that touches are standing in the state of the body , when it &apos;s catalyzed , a pretty strong demonstration of power in the body when it &apos;s catalyzed in a state of extremely excitement .
I &apos;m going to give all the people with whom I &apos;ve lived the most extraordinary Kogi Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta , Colombia in the Colombia secentrional Santa Marta , Colombia security .
They give us the ancient civilization that once lived on the top of the Colombia on the charge of Colombia , waiting for the conquician , the people would be retreated on the volcanic massive that you would get on on the volcanic massive plan that you can see on the volcanic plant .
In a blood clothed continent , this people had never been conquered by the spage-and---shaped continent .
But I &apos;ve been governments from a clever , but their formation is so extraordinary .
The young people are taken away from the families to three or four , and live secret in a good world and a good world of good and shadows in the basket of the fairs for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years , of the nine months of the gestation that they go into the mom of the mother , now are now methathically in the Great Mother .
For all of this time , they &apos;re acculturate to their society , values that are prefers of their values and just their prayers to keep the cosmic balance -- or to say the cosmic balance -- or to say the ecological balance .
And so , by the term of this incredible initiation , they suddenly get a time to them , at the age of 18 , they see a dawn . And that in that moment of awareness , when the sun kets the beautiful landscape , everything that has learned in a lot of the beautiful landscape , everything that has learned in the whole theory . The pret it is a step back and says , &quot;
&quot; Good ? Proprice as I said .
It &apos;s amazing . It &apos;s now now now to protect it . &quot;
They call them larger brothers and say that we , are the colpful of the destruction of the world .
This is extremely important .
When we think about the indigenous populations and the aging environment , we call Rousseau and the old history of selling selecdom , which is a race of his simplicity , or maybe invoding Thoreau and say that these people are closer to the Earth .
The indigenous people are not severe sentimental sentimental sentimental people .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the Asman of Asmat Asmat or in the Tibet , but because of the time and the rhythththththrows , and created a mystical of the Earth is not about a very much , but on a very much more , intuition , the notion that the Earth can live only because it &apos;s infected by human knowledge .
What does that mean ?
It means that a Ande boy who is a young Ande who &apos;s the mountain is a spirit of the Apu that will lead his destiny is going to be a deeply different , and it &apos;s going to have a very different rocket with the mountain or that place that &apos;s growing up creating a mountain , or that place is making a rock of rocks is a masse of rock of rocks are going to be scaved .
which is the dimatorship or a mineral or is irrelevant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that report the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in Columbia forests that they were going to get cutting forests .
And that &apos;s got me a different different from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that forests are the dimora of Hukukukukukukukukukukukukuk and the downn-initiation that live in the Hamatsa .
If you start to think that these cultures can actually create different reality , you can start understanding some them out of them feeling , you can start understanding some them ,
I took this picture to open in the nin-Western Amazon the ninch Amazon the ninch Amazon the ninch Amazon Amazon the nin-the-for-or-theony .
Maybe some of you heard about the ayahuasks , the most powerful psychoactive psychoactive , the most powerful psychoactive psychopian repertoy .
What makes the fascinating of the ayahuasks is not the drug of the substance , but the processing processing . It &apos;s about two elements .
On one side , this lian liana legning , which contains a series of Tia-coal , harmoline and harmoline , slightly .
And by trying to the only plant , it has a blueprint that alter a little bit of the cocience , but it mixed with the leaves of a family of the coffee ,
This plant plant is powerful powerful triptamine , very similar to the serotonin , dithyptamine , dithyptamine .
If you ever see Yanomami me pull up for the nose of the nose of the substance that make from a different set of species , it contains methyptamine .
Tiring that dust on the nose is a little bit like being shown from a shoot of painting , and land on a seat of electricity . &#91; Risen &#93; Not a distortion of reality . It &apos;s actually a distortion of reality .
I often have to my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who had been dated the psichedelic was , with his fungi discovery of hallucinogens in the &apos; 30s in Mexico .
I think my thesis not a classification , you can &apos;t get these triptamine as although you did not tell anybody to be hallucinated .
It &apos;s as possible to be ababove the right if abunits with other chemicals that will denied MAO .
Now it &apos;s the beautiful : the fuel Ti-coal , that are injors of MAO , the same kind of necessary to potential to potential the triptamine . The question is the smile , in a fairly 80,000 species , like these people do these people are doing these people to find two defologically not similar , but that if you combined in this way , create a biochemistry that is that you &apos;re going to be in parts ?
We use the great eufemism of evidence and error , which can be infruted by infruted .
But if we ask Indians , they say , &quot; The plants talk about it . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribes , Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuasks , who will tell nicely in the forest , and that we would reentries in the same species .
If we ask them how they stoping their tassonomy will say , &quot; I thought , &quot; I thought that it &apos;s the rest of the rest of them don &apos;t know all ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take 17 variety in a dinner night , and each night , and each other will sing a different tone .
So , this is not graduate at Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than count the stami .
Now , &#91; applausers &#93; the problem is that even those of us who have to heart people who have in the world , and they find them in the margins of the history of our real world , and it went beyond .
In fact , the 20th century , in 300 years , it &apos;s not going to remember his own or technological innovations , but rather like the one was where we stopped and we used to embrace and we used to have embrace , and cultural destroying the mass mass of biological diversity and cultural planet . Now the planet . Now the problem is not change .
All the culcultures have been involved in a dance for new possibility of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux didn &apos;t stop being Sioux when they put it from arm and frecent as Americans have no stop being Americans when they put them on the horse and heaven .
It &apos;s not change or technology , which threats the technology that threats the integrity of the etnosphere . It &apos;s the power .
The hard hard to domination .
And if you give a look at the world , I &apos;ll find that these are not destined to disappear .
They &apos;re living creatures and spined out of the existence from the forces that go beyond their adaptive capacity to them .
Which is a disbing of the Penan of the Penan
a non-Sarawak people in Sarawak , in the Asian East Werasian people who lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to a generation , and now reduck to the rivers of the rivers , where you can see the river inquitous Bornewest or the waste that looks like Bornee , where you can see the wave the horizon , and wave ,
It &apos;s ready to fill the wooden wooden with the forest .
Or in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that have come with the discovery of gold .
If we stay on the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the hard hard hard to see , you &apos;ll see the whole hard hard to see the political domination .
As you know the genocide , the aesthin physics , is convicted to universal level , but the ethical destroying , the destroyred of the lifestyle of a people , not just contatains an unched , but even celebrated in some environments , because it &apos;s part of the development .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of Tibet until the beginning of the beginning .
I &apos;ve path the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in the Western China through Western Tibet , coming to Lhasa young connection , but only came to Lhasn out what &apos;s behind the statistics that we felt about .
6,000 of them sacred reduced in the powder and centers .
1.2 million people killed by the military during the Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascritzed in the Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed to be killed in the Chinese aging .
Human uncle , in Sainity , during the diaspora that led led to Nepal .
His mother was jail and her hit was rich .
It was led to hide in careers at the age of two hidden years old , because he couldn &apos;t live without him .
The sister , who did the same , was put in reeducational field .
One day he revertitled a cheap of Mao and , for this transgression , was put in the seven-sued for seven years .
The Tibet can be insable , but the spirit of the people is from tener to the people is tener .
And then finally , it &apos;s all reduces to a choice .
We want to live in the world &apos;s monocromatic or , or we want to get the world policromatic diversity ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he died said that his greatest spacecraft was that in our world , not just going to see the entire gamm of the world , not just going to see the entire gamm of thinking , but one day we &apos;ll wake up a sleeping of thinking , but one day we &apos;ll see it a forgasing way that there are other possibilities .
And it &apos;s equipment to remember that our species is 600,000 years old .
The Neolitica Revolution , which has given us agriculture , which has given us us to socking the seed of the seed of the smom of the smom of the smom of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has 300 years old .
That shark story not suggests me that we don &apos;t suggests me that we have to deal with in the millenses that we will have to deal with the millennia to come .
When these miriades of the world is asked what it means to be human , respond to 10,000 different different voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all refers to the possibility of being what we are : a awful species , that has to make all the gardens and all the gardens can trigger . And there are big moments .
I took this picture on the north of Baffin the north of Baffin , when I went to dag with Inuit , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olayer , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olayers , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man , and this man , Olaya , and
The canadapt government has been always been gentile with the Inuit and the 1950s to stabilize our supremizing them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refused to go .
The family , tempting all of his life , he took all the weapons , and all of his equipment .
You have to know that the Inuit don &apos;t feel the cold , they do it .
The skin origin origin were made of fish that had made of a fish flying box .
The grandfather of this man didn &apos;t put in the artica or the dawn of the artica or the dathlist of this man didn &apos;t put in it .
It &apos;s fleaked away , he &apos;s been hot the pantales in the skin in and defecated in their hand . When I did the path . When I did the frozen , he &apos;s working a mobile moon .
It &apos;s spraying salive on the punta of this clock , and when it became solid , he killed a dog .
He &apos;s got a dogue and created a dogs , with the toilet , has got stunned a slums , he &apos;s got a sat on the banks , and it &apos;s disappear to the bankisa , the ca bank , and the ca bank , and he &apos;s got a dogs .
We want to talk about horrible with anything ? &#91; Risk &#93; And that , in different ways , &#91; Applausers &#93; is the resilience of the people of the Inuit and of all the world .
In the aprile 1999 , the Canadian government reduced to Inuit , the total of a larger area of California and Texmes them together .
It &apos;s their new pathria . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s an independent land . They &apos;re all the minerary resources .
One of the plendid example of how a natione-state can re-concied with his people .
And finally , I think it &apos;s quite obvious to the end of us , I think it &apos;s been in these remote zones of the planet , I realize they &apos;re not at all .
For someone is home .
They represent the seections of human imagination that reach out of time . And for us all of these kids , dreams of these kids , like dreams of these kids , become part of the geography of the geography of hope .
To end , we of National Geographic we are convinced that politicians will never come to anything .
We believe that polemics --
&#91; Applausers &#93; don &apos;t have lost lost suasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best institution to tell stories about the world &apos;s stories . Every month our website has 35 million visits .
156 countries transmit , our television canal .
Our magazines are lets from millions .
Our work is traveling in the etnosphere to bring our public in places in a places of cultural wonderful cultural , which will go away from how they saw and , hopes , abbracing , and hopes , abbraces , and we need to find a lifestyle in a world , and we need to find a life in a world and we need to find a lifestyle and multiculticulticultural world , and we need to find a life in a life in a world and , and we have to find a life in a life in a life in a life in a life in a life in
where the wisdom of all the people can contributed to our collective well-being .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope to call them other other other people you &apos;ve heard and try to evidence some connections , in case you didn &apos;t notice .
I &apos;d like to start with what I call &quot; the official dogma official dogma .
The dogma official what ?
The dogma official offical society . The dogma official Dogma official officer , &quot; If we want to massive the well-being of our citizens . &quot; The way to do it is massive the individual freedom . &quot;
The reason is , on one side , in fact that liberty is itself itself a value , is precious , is precious , for human beings .
On the other one that if we are free , each one of us can act to do what the massive is that we have a well-being , no one that decide in our well-being , no one that decide in our own .
The way to massive freedom is massive choice .
The more choices of people , the more are libere , and the greater freedom , is their greater freedom , is their well-being .
This , I think , it &apos;s so deeply radicated in society that no one would dream to put it in doubt .
And it &apos;s also deeply rown in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress is possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m going to allow me a simple note about condition .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditioning 10 variety of oil olids , and the 12 hauns of oil , and the 12 hauns that you can buy a huge number of conditions in the circles that no 175 .
That &apos;s what the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic store to buy one stereeeep , letter CD , radio , rain , light , the light bully-bull .
And in this single electronic store , there &apos;s a great audio number of audio components .
We can make six and a half million different combinations using the components that are there in a only store .
You have to put it that there is a lot of choice .
Some of the world of communications .
One time , when I was a child , they could get all the telephone services , at the stage that were provides from mom Bell .
He was noleged the phone , didn &apos;t buy it .
One of that , in the one , was that the phone never break .
These times are gone .
We have now a nearly limited variety of telephone , especially between cell phones .
Here &apos;s cell phones .
My favorite is in the middle , laws of my favorite is cutting , and forcing for the kidnose , and forcing for the kruption .
If you didn &apos;t have yet seen it in the store under the home store , you &apos;re very much certain that I &apos;ll get .
And what the end happens is that people come into the store and do this question . And what &apos;s answer is ? The answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
You can &apos;t buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t make too much .
So , in other ways of life that are much more important than the aquicians , the same explosion of choices .
Assistence : Assistence is not happening in the United States that you go from doctor and the doctor , and the doctor what you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do A or B , &quot; A , we could do it , and these risks and these risks and these risks . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Dr. , what should I do I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A has these benefits , and B has these benefits , and B has these benefits . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebat , &quot; Did if she was me , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result we call it autonomy autonomy , &quot; expression that makes it a beautiful thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not that a shift and the responsibility of making decisions that someone knows something , which is the doctor , to someone else else else else -- and it &apos;s certainly no one that nothing -- and almost certainly not in the ideal condition -- and it &apos;s not in the ideal condition to make the real patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing of products , direct to people like me and you , who , if you think about it doesn &apos;t make sense , because you can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , because they advericize them ?
The answer is that they want to ask ask him to ask them to ask them to ask them .
What about that , as fundamental identity is our orgeon is a matter of choice , how we see in this vivignant , &quot; We don &apos;t want to forget kids . They &apos;re going to forget their sex at at the right moment , we don &apos;t have to invent it .
And we can reinventing how many times it will be .
Which means that every morning , at the wake , you have to decide what kind of person want to be .
I put the family and the marriage , a time time the common perspective , almost for anyone , was that was that we stood the most soon as possible , and it started to make kids the most soon possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not when , and not what to do after .
I said , all this is really to play .
I teach a very smart students , and I &apos;m going to go to the 20 percent in less of work than a time .
And not because they &apos;re very brilliant , not because they &apos;re not because they &apos;re not because they &apos;re less diligent .
but why are they imposes , I mean to ask , &quot; I should marry it or not ? I should do it now ? I should do it now ? &quot;
&quot; Do I should get to marry later ? I have to think before children or career ? &quot;
They &apos;re logoring .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this implement not complete the tasks that I teach and not get a nice voice to my exam .
And they really have to do it . They &apos;re important questions .
Now , the work : We &apos;re lucky , like Carl underneath , because the technology allows us to work every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from the Hotel Randolph .
And so , in the parentesesesescape , and I won &apos;t tell anybody what , where WiFi works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use me .
What does this incredible freedom of choice we have about this work ? It &apos;s that we have to continuously decide , continuously , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing hot , with the mobile phone in a pocket , the Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , tily , the knees .
And even if they &apos;re all spending , every minute that we see our son reovating the game , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; I have to answer this call ?
&quot; I have to say this email ? I have to email this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , it makes the experience of your son very different than the game game with your son very different than what it would have been in other conditions .
So , any of the look at , small things and big , things and the life is a choice of choices .
And one time the world was this : That &apos;s true , there were some possibilities , but it wasn &apos;t a choice about choice .
The world of today is what the world is , &quot; Is it a positive thing , or negative ?
The answer is a lot of it .
We &apos;ve all all the positive layers , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative .
All this choice is going to take two negative effects of people .
The first , paradoxically , it &apos;s produced paralysis that produced paralysis that it makes paralysis that produced paradoxically , it &apos;s that it produced paradoxically , it &apos;s that produced paradoxygen .
With many options that choose , becomes very hard to do it .
I give you a significance of example : a study of the volunteers of volunteers .
A connection to the Vanguard data of the Vanguard data , the giant a pension of pension , with about a million clients in 2,000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in the more , the percentage of adhhhouses of two percent .
With 50 sourds , there &apos;s 10 percent in less than adhesions when they &apos;re only available ?
Because with 50 sources of whom choose , it &apos;s sick deciding , and choice is removed to intomorrow .
And tomorrow , and tomorrow , tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course tomorrow .
You know , it doesn &apos;t just mean that these old workers will keep food for dog because they don &apos;t have enough money , even say that decision is so that the decision is so that it lense the funding of the datory of work .
Not participating , they &apos;re losing to five thousand dollars per year from the work dator , which would be well disposed to versaries .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think that makes the world that .
&quot; And to end , for the eternity : ketchup , or maionese send ? &quot;
You &apos;d like to love the right decision , if it &apos;s for the eternity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong bottom , and yet the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can avoid the paralysis and doing a choice , at the end , we &apos;re less sationally , we would be able to choose .
And that &apos;s about a different reasons .
One of these is that with many of many of them who choose , if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would have been better . And what &apos;s the alternative imagined us will be better . And what &apos;s happening is that we have to be done by the decision , and the replacement decrew the decrease , reaving the decrease , reaching the decreation ,
even when it was a good decision .
The more choices there are , the easier to be displeased to any detail that is insatisfaction of option .
Also , there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has cleared very well , how we think about things depends on what we council with .
For the rest , when there are many options , it &apos;s easy to represent the actual features of the option of the option that has been choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m sorry with all the ones that are not New York .
But that &apos;s what you would probably think .
There &apos;s this couple of Hamptons .
A llow place of llow .
Sweeping splendida . Otttttle day . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not going to go . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , malition , it &apos;s Agust . &quot;
&quot; Everybody my neighborhood in Manhattan is away . &quot;
&quot; I could park right in front of the home . &quot;
And it goes to two weeks from the idea that &apos;s losing -- every day -- the possibility of park where it wants .
The costo-opportunity demining the soddisfation for what we have , even when choice was excellent .
And the more are the options that we have to think , the most actual acities will be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be considered ,
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
It &apos;s about living the moment , and maybe of living slowly .
But the most important point is that whatever you choose , you choose to not do the other .
The things that we don &apos;t choose many attractive attractive , what we do .
Third point : the growing spiral of expectations .
I tried to my skin bought a new jeans .
I &apos;m almost always jeans .
And one time jeans were just just like , bought them and window and wasting them were discomcomfortable , just after getting them a life and washed a lot of times , they started going to go well .
So I went to buy a couple of a couple new when those old who were gone , and I said , &quot; I need to have a couple of jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
The committed me , &quot; Li wants to be slim , put axed , fit , relaxed fits ? &quot;
You want to be at the cernier or with the bottons ? &quot; Stonewashed , &quot; or &quot; acidwashed ?
&quot; Li Was you want to be struggle ? &quot;
&quot; You know , eight wants them or stretched ? Bla bla ... &quot; Continupright them .
I was sent , and after a little bit I was able to say , &quot; I want the guy that was the only guy , &quot; he had no idea what it was , so for a time , I tried all of the people who were sick , and then I came out of the jeans , and the best couple of jeans that ever had .
It was the very very much . With all I had the best one .
But I was worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse is that with all of my choice , the jeans had to be perfect .
I had to minimum expectations . I didn &apos;t expectations when there was just a kind of living , when there was a few different stedents , at least a kind of a perfect guy to be perfect .
What I had to buy was good , but not perfectly .
After I was talking to the chosen with what I was actually meant to deal with the expectations .
The adds of options in the life of people don &apos;t do that to increase the expectations that have respect to excellence the same .
And this will produce less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
No one in the world of the marketing if it &apos;s made it .
Because if they knew it , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth looks like this .
&quot; It was better when it was worse , &quot; The reason why he was better when it was worse is that when you were worse was even possible to meet pleasant surprises .
In the world we live in the world in which we live -- opulents , industrialized citizens with the expectancy -- the most we can hope is that things are at the expectations .
You never surprised to pleasant because your expectations , my expectations , have ingiant expectations , they &apos;ve been ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Besearlier for you . &quot; Yes , you want . &quot;
I mean , little authographic moment -- which I &apos;m really married and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t have done it .
But it &apos;s not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of a bought a couple of jeans when there is only that kind of jeans is that when you &apos;re not satisfacfacts , and ask you , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot; The answer is clear .
The world is the responsible . What would I do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a ununsatisfaction , and you ask you who is the responsible , it &apos;s the responsible , it &apos;s just clear that the responsible you are .
You could have done better .
With hundreds of varieties , we don &apos;t have excuses to get insuccessful .
So when people make decisions , even though the result is valid , they feel insatisfacfaced and give the cold to them to the same .
In the last years , depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this wave of depression is just that people have deludent experiences because the standard are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation thinking that the hit is .
So the final result is that we &apos;re better , actually , but we feel worst .
I &apos;ll remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all get good and it &apos;s completely fake . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little choice is better than having any any time , but from this didn &apos;t go and it would not be a lot better .
There &apos;s a critical , magical value . I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve been supergiven from a piece of the level where the choices are going to make our life .
Now , from politician point -- I &apos;ve got almost finished -- from the political point of view , the nocy is the following .
What allows all this to the industrial choice in industrial society is the wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know about it , where the problem is not that have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too pooke .
So the thing I &apos;m talking about is a bad event of modern , reaquatic society , reasional societies .
And what it does depressing and angry is this : Steve Levitt has talked to you about how much those expensive and comfortable seat for bimmes are useful . It &apos;s a money .
I mean , these choices , complicated and dependious , is not that they are just useful .
I &apos;m deleterie .
They make us worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows choice to be reversed in those where people have too much possibly possibly , it &apos;s not just their life to improvement but our .
This is what economists call a labor improvement .
A redistribution of income redistribution , it &apos;s not only to poor people -- because of this choice in this excess that it &apos;s remarkable to us .
To conclude , &quot; You can become everything you want &quot; --
You , people of culture , you think , &quot; What does that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t do anything in a shocrow . &quot;
&quot; A castrade imagination , a limited view of the world --
I &apos;m interpreted to this this one , I was going to start .
But then , thinking about it , instead , I realized that that that fish the long knows .
Because the reality is that if you manda in frantumes the bocce , so that all you can &apos;t get freedom . It &apos;s got freedom . It comes the paralysis .
If you break the bocce in the way that all of the divents can decrease the satisfaction .
You get the paralysis , and you reduce the weld .
They all need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too strange , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of some sphere is a recipe for inhappiness and , I &apos;m going to be inhappiness and ,
Thank you very much .
