Last year I showed these slides to demonstrate that the artica of the artica , which for almost three million years had the size of 48 United States continental size , it &apos;s retrofed the 40 percent .
But that &apos;s this subjectively gravity of the problem because it &apos;s not a spaces of the ice .
The artica of the artica is , in a sense , the heart of global climate system .
It expanded on the winter and you &apos;re retreating .
The next slide is going to be a carrying revenue of the last 25 years .
The glaces are signed in red .
As you see , they go up to the blue blue dark .
That &apos;s the invern ice , which is a summer ice .
You can see that the ice cosiddle , five years or more , is like a blood , which is like a blood , which here was in the body .
In 25 years , it was so so ,
This is a problem because the warming warming of the glacious land around the artic ocean where there are huge amount of fueled fueled that , skiing , they &apos;re transformed into the metane .
I &apos;m going to the totaling of the atmospheric atmospheric , that amount could doubling , that could doubling , super-point point point of not around .
In some very very profound lakes in Alaska metan , the metan is already rebuling from the water .
The professored Katey Walter University of Alaska University of Alaska team , very low snear the last winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You &apos;re good . The question is if we &apos;re going to be it .
And that &apos;s a reason that this thermal surries the Groenland from the north .
This is a river at regime glacial .
And the brought it never to the levels like that .
This is the Kangerlussuaimal Rederlastest , in the south-West .
If you want to know how it &apos;s the sea level to the skiest , you know how the sea flows up here is where it reaches the sea .
These currents are increasing rapidly .
On the other side of the planet : Antarctica , the largest block of ice on the planet .
The last month , the scientists have been depped the balance of ice is in negative , and the Western Antarctica , which is particularly hicks , is particularly quick in the sun to the skiest .
It &apos;s about six feet feet of the sea level of the foot , like Groenland .
Sulla Himalaya , the third largest block block , you see new lakes , which a few years ago were glaciers .
40 percent of the world population was getting half of the water water from that smooth .
Sulle Ande : this glacier &apos;s the source of water than this city .
The ported is increased .
But when it demines , the same falls to water .
In California , the snow on Sierra Nevada is 40 percent .
The hyries are in the crisis .
predictions , as you &apos;ve read , they &apos;re grave .
The growing safe of the safetary increasing incencisent in the world ,
The disaster environmental disasers are increasing a rhyththththial and unprecedented .
Four times over the last 30 years I was respect to 75 .
This is a pollution of the unsustainable .
If you look at it in the historical context , you can see the consequences .
We &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the world of the Pacific East Pacific , the Americans , to the Americans , and on both the parts of the Indian subcontinent , where there &apos;s a root root of of the ocean oxygen in the oceans .
The greatest cause of global warming , with the foression , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossil fuel-fur use .
oil is a problem , and the coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two of the most emissions , together to China .
And he was proponated to build a lot of other central central .
But we &apos;re seeing a shift of direction .
These are the annullated projects in the last years and some of the verge of alternative .
Every much way , there &apos;s a political fight in our country .
The industrial coal and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the pulit , which is a bone .
That image would remember me --
Verso Natal , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a loss of 3.8 billion litri waste .
Maybe you have seen it on the news .
This is the second largest flow of America .
It happened around Natal .
The advertitities of one of the coal industrial advertities .
Video : Surt the carbon is a kind of allegro and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it makes our economy .
It &apos;s a carbon dioxuel is more clean .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and the workable to keep the designers .
Al Gore : From here is a great part of the West Virginia .
The largest society threat the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I &apos;m going to be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelososy , Harry Really -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima Protection of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is a one of them , a part .
Video : So , we &apos;re going to be the same climate change as a weather , threat our business .
For this priorities is to invest a large amount of money in a publish publishing , and it &apos;s a public truth to make it and confused the coal truth .
Actually , coal is not sports .
We think it &apos;s pulit -- it &apos;s also a good profumo .
So you don &apos;t preption climate change .
Let me do .
Video : Cathor you heard about it .
So let &apos;s do a turn in a roll structure to avanguard as it &apos;s about pulit coal .
Straordinarily ! Os are a little noise , but this is the sound of the pulit technology .
The coal consumption is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology that you see changes all the time .
You take a look , this is the pulit technology .
Al Gore : The end , the positive alternative alternative of positive connects to economic issue .
Video : Complplan : America is in the crisis , national security , climate crisis .
The willion that connects all : our dependence from fossil fuels , like the spork and oil imported oil and oil imported .
Now , though , there &apos;s a new , audacace solution for using us .
Repower : 100 percent clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to reach America to make us more safe , and to stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that drink to solve our problems .
Repower America . Scoprite more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It &apos;s about reating energy to America .
One of the faster ways of getting to the dependence from the fuel that killing our planet .
Comparsa : The future is here . Very , I feel , a new energy network .
Compace number two : New investiment for jobs well-repair jobs .
Complplease America . It &apos;s time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old African African , he says , &quot; If you want to go to the speed , go from the faster .
If you want to go away , you go together . &quot;
We have to go far far , fast .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED I did a LHC :
And promised to return to you on how the car works .
So I &apos;m going to be . And for the other time , the LHC is the largest experiment that we &apos;ve ever been standing -- 27 kilometers of circumstance .
His task is to rear the conditions that were less than a billion-dollar , since the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
That &apos;s just ambitious .
This is the car under Ginevra .
We &apos;re going to go in these mini-Big Bang in the magazines .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- it &apos;s largely 44 meters and it has a diameter of 22 meters .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLATLAS in construction so you can notice the proportions .
10 , the last year we have pushed the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLATLAS .
It was cause of immense fescue in control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first fascivil of particles that had done all the LHC , and he &apos;s going into collision , deliberately , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles inside the respect .
In other words , when we saw that 10 secember 10 secember , we realized that the machine worked , which is a great vacuum .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to be able to do that , when somebody went on Google and saw that the initial page was this .
That means we &apos;ve had a cultural impact beyond the scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the car , had just to these filters here -- these walls .
These files bring 13,000 ampampating the car when the car works at the very very very much .
Now , the technical technical of you will look at the files and they &apos;re not true . &quot;
And instead , they can do it because when they &apos;re very cold , they become the subjector .
So , at least 271 degrees , at a lower temperature to the space between the stars , these files can bring that current temperature to the current .
In one of the giuntures between the most new magnetic magnees in the LHC , there was a defect of factoration .
So the walls are climbed bed bed up , and the 13,000 amp, suddenly met a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think that these magnees are weightons , and that they moved about 30 centimeters .
They &apos;re damaged about 50 magnetic magnetic .
We had to take them , what we did .
We reinated them and wearing them .
They &apos;re now going back to all their underground .
I &apos;m going to the LHC LHC will be again ,
We will accept it , and we expect to get some data to the jecting data or dry , and continue so our adventure to find out what the universe is going to be .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents are accounts of science and the engineering of the frontier and the engineering of frontier .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s the value of things like LHC .
I want to conclude with the words of a Inglected Inglese , Humphrey Davy , which , I guess , in the defense of the feasight of the pupillo , the pupillo was Michael Faray , said , &quot; No is so dangerous for the progress of the human mind as the mind as the return of the human mind is defines , that our trivial is all of our trionaim , and that we don &apos;t have a new monstrate . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start asking asking about rethink about when you , you , you play with kids , you play with the morning .
As you could get them and grab them and grab them , and you learn them , and you learn them , and you learn them to think and solve problems and to be able to solve problems .
The spacectively is connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , from the useful inspired by the useful useful of our interaction with physical objects , with my Pact , and the collaborator Jeevan Kalithi , I started asking , I started asking , &quot; And if , when we use a computer , instead of having the only songer of the mouse cursor of the mouse cursor of the mouse , we could have to have a desktop , we could have to have a desktop , we could have to defit on a desktop , we have a desktop ,
and I &apos;m going to fix it ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building Sifmonetary .
In a few words , a Sifmonk is a big interactive computer as a biscanning .
In a few words , a Sifmonk is a big interactive computer as a biscanning .
You can move with it , you can see , &quot; they can see &quot; their movement and they have a screen and they have a wireless radio .
But mostly , they &apos;re physical objects , like the morning morning , you can just move them to just roll them .
The Sifmonks to an example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physical , awars of the movement , and as they become more physical , and as they become more physical , the motion , of the movement , of the other movement , as we can explore new and fun styles of interaction .
I &apos;m going to try to start with some simple example .
This Sifmonk is configured to show video : if you cline it in a direction , the video will rotate so , if you &apos;re going to take this back .
These interactive portraits of other other people .
If you can put them , you &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re around .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can act a bit .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can act a bit .
They also had their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was that we could use common gesption on data , for example , &quot; a color like if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftired configured out of painting and I can use them to the poured color in that central , where they missing .
and I can use them to use it to the central color in that , where they &apos;re missing .
We can put it too , we can put a bit of it .
And you also have a good chance of learning , like languages , the languages , the math and games of logic where people can try things , and see the results of the things immediately .
I &apos;m going to --
This is a Redbonacks that I do with a equations program .
Here we have a words of words that &apos;s in the middle of Scarabeet and Boggle .
Basically , at every turnail , you have a letter in Sifmonks , Pratically , at every Turn one of the Sifmong , and while you &apos;re looking for him for him to a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds remate , and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
And here is the kids coming in in the Media Lab , I did so that I tried them and I went out a video .
They were very pleased .
And one of the interesting things of this application is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
And I just say , &quot; Compons of words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s other people who try it .
This is our Tibeta younger tester , right there on the right .
It actually wanted to be impllaries .
They were only were the morning , for him .
Now , this is a application of a interactive cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool for the languages . He &apos;s Felix . He &apos;s Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , searching the Sifmonks .
It can put new characters in the scene , searching the Sifmonks .
So it &apos;s doing out of the sun .
Video : The sun is surprising .
David Merrill : Now he led a treatment in the scene .
Video : The aranancium treatment .
Bucel work ! You !
So , you shake the Sifmonks and put them close them ,
Video : Bau !
and by by by by inventing your story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a very opened story with the open open , and it can decide him how it gets .
DM : It &apos;s a very opened story with the open open , and it can decide him how it gets .
Video : Spet , cat .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , and I realized that for a recent and to do music .
It &apos;s a tool that we &apos;ve been doing a recent , to sampioning music .
The Sifmonks here are trouble as the basic , low and battery .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose which to use .
You can also put these sounds on a sequence of your pleasure to your pleasure .
And just by doing it by doing a sound and a sequence . &quot;
These are actually you can control from alive , like the revers and the filter .
And you acks to a particular particular sound and then incline to way it .
And then there are general effects of time and volume , which is applied to the entire sequence .
Let &apos;s look like it works .
Video : We &apos;re going to put a base in two Sifties &quot; sequence , &quot; We &apos;re sequence , we put them in a series , we &apos;re going to add a series , we add another base .
Now I &apos;m going to put a low line .
Video : Now I adding some percussions --
Video : And I &apos;m going to put the battery to the battery , so I can control the effect of the living .
Video : DM : I can quick the entire sequence of the time , and then on one side or the other .
Video : And now I &apos;m going to add the bottom of the bottom to give more expression .
Video : I can get the sequence of the flying sequence of the flying flight .
So I didn &apos;t have to plan it before , but I can suddenly , making it longer or more court .
And now , finally , I can smoking the entire sequence of the left Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new human human interfaces , more resements how they work work our brain work .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this path , and some possibilities that we &apos;re trying to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that &apos;s coming this new generation of objects that we &apos;re going to bring out of the digital media , which will bring information in our world .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;m not going to talk to all of you .
I &apos;m a writer .
I &apos;m going to be a profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the fascinating of my life .
And I &apos;m not what it can change .
But , that , something particular happened , it was recently in my life and my career , which he brought me to report the entire relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called &quot; Mangia , &quot; Prega , &quot; which , differently from my previous books , for some reason came out in the world and became a great feeling , a sationally , a s-sensational , wild , the seller international .
And the result is that everywhere you go now , people treating me as if I was convicted .
It &apos;s true -- convicted , convicted !
They &apos;re all going to me now everybody worried and say , &quot; You don &apos;t fear to do that ?
You don &apos;t fear to write all the life without being able to be able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can importance to somebody ? &quot;
what can you care about somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s reassuring , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember that over 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a writer .
I &apos;d go to the same reaction that was based on fear .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you have succeed ?
You don &apos;t fear that the ulilililifted you killed ?
You don &apos;t fear to do this mesh for all life without anything that you ever come out and to die on a cumb cule with the mouth of failure ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer all these questions is , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
Yeah , I &apos;m afraid of all that .
I always had fear .
And I also have fear of many other things that people can &apos;t ininate .
Like the algae and other things .
But , as I write what I thought and I ask me about , and I ask me , is why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logic that anyone should expect to be frightened by a work that you feel that they were born to do .
But what &apos;s there so particular in creative companies to make us nervous about the mental health health health as as a way that other careers don &apos;t they ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I &apos;m not one time in its 40 years of activity where he was asked if he had to be engineer capita ?
It never had been -- that &apos;s that block of John , how does it go ?
It didn &apos;t work so , you know ?
Onestly , the chemical engineers like a group have not certainly , in the centuries , gain , gained the reputation of being alcolized alcolized depressive .
We have a writers , we have enough this reputation , and not only creative writers but creatives but creatives , we have this reputation of being enormous instabove .
And it &apos;s not about looking at the tristes of the magnifies of creative minds that , only in the 21st century , they died young and often their hand .
And the ones that don &apos;t have suicidated seemed to be really disfacts from their dons .
Norman Mailer , before to die , in the last interview said , &quot; Every book has been killed me a little more &quot; A wonderful fashion about their work of life .
But we don &apos;t throw when we feel it because we &apos;ve heard these things so long that we &apos;ve been heard of these things so we &apos;ve been completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and the suffering are in some ways of the bone way of the coroscccrising .
And the question I want to ask all of this idea ?
It &apos;s all right for this thing -- because it &apos;s also looking at it from a centimeter to me not that &apos;s good for anything that supposing .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous and I don &apos;t want to see the perpeated in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better encourage our great creative minds to live .
And certainly I know that , in my case -- in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to begin to be a lot of supposing , overeating circumstances that I &apos;m in my career .
That &apos;s true -- you look at , I &apos;m pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I &apos;ve got about four work workplace in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything that I &apos;m going to write about the world as the work that came out after the world as the work that was after my last book .
I &apos;m going to be slaved , because we &apos;re all more or less friends here -- is likely that my greatest success is in my back .
Oh , Gesus , that thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to blow in the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would keep going to go to do this work that we love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it seems to me , after a lot of reflective , that the way to work to go and write is to create a protective psychological construct , OK ?
I have to find a few safety distance between me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxiety of which is going to be able to get . And as I was looking for all the past year , looking through time , trying to find other societies to see if they could have better ideas and more sane sane and more sane and to see if they could have better ideas and more sane and more sane safety distance between me , and I &apos;m going to find some more more more and more
how to help people manage to manage the emotions of creativity .
And that research me to the ancient Great and ancient Rome .
I &apos;m going to go to circle and then it goes back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
And it thought that creativity was this spirit looks like , and that they came to men from a few distant and unknown for the human distant and unknown for the distant and unknown .
The Great us were these beews of the demons of creativity &quot; demons . &quot;
Socrrationally , believed that they had a demon wisdom .
Romans were the same idea , but they called the idea of the spirit without a genius .
which is great , because the Romans didn &apos;t think a genius were really a genius of them were a very smart .
They believed that a genius was this sort of divin that he lived in literally walls in the walls of a artist , a little bit like the elevent of the artist of the artist of the artist of the artist of the artist of the artist , and to model the outcome of that work .
Here &apos;s eyeah -- that &apos;s the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological construct that you protect from your work .
And everybody knew it was so that it worked , right ?
So the antic artists were protected by certain things , as the too narcism , right ?
If your work was so exceptional work , you could not take all the time , everybody knew that you had been helped by this genius .
If you fail work , it wasn &apos;t all your fail , right ?
Everyone knew that was your genius to be a unable .
And so people have conceived creativity in Western time .
Then the Rinissance came and everything , and it changes , and it &apos;s all about the other things , and the mysteries of the universe over all the mysteries and without more to leave space .
This was the rational principle and people started to think that creativity came out of the idivided .
And for the first time in the story , you start to this or that artist , as a rather than a genius that artist to a rather than a person with the genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think it allows somebody , a simple person to believe that you &apos;re like a recient , the essence and the source of all the mysteries and the source of all the divins , unknown and ethernal and eternal -- is a very big responsibility for human pocket to give the pair .
It &apos;s how to ask someone to enjoying the sun .
Deform and detadistores and it &apos;s really , and it makes all these expectations on the performance .
And I think it was this pressure to destroyed the artists in the mixed 500 years .
And if that &apos;s true , and I think that &apos;s , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do it differently ?
Maybe we go back to a more ancient understanding of human relationship between humans and mystery .
or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t take 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And probably people in the audience who would be tipets on scientific suspects on the notion of the notion of , they do they follow people to fit on their projects .
It probably probably won &apos;t convince you all about this .
But the question I want to ask is -- why not ?
Why don &apos;t you think about this ?
Because it has more sense of anything that ever ever ever heard to explain the exasperating exasperating the imprevedibility of the creative process .
And so , as anyone who ever tried to do something -- so , basically , all here -- you know , you don &apos;t understand rationally .
And in fact , it can look completely paranormate .
I &apos;ve been this very recently recently , I &apos;ve been doing this very very very poem Stone , which has been a poem for all life and said that during the rural rural rural Virginia , working in the rural Virginia , working in the camps , and it felt it , in if when a poetry came from landscape .
He said he was like a fair train train .
And that was roling to come up from the landscape .
It felt it , because he was tremendous to do the land under its feet .
He knew that point to have one thing to do at that point and was , &quot; to go like a matta . &quot;
And so he was going to house and it was followed by this poetry , and it wouldn &apos;t have to make another piece of paper and a matita fairly fairly , and it would be done in the page .
Open , sometimes he couldn &apos;t be fast , so correct and correct without to be able to get into home and poetry and get the pair through the landscape and she would continue to rolling through the landscape , looking , and she would continue to rotate through the landscape , and she said , &quot; another poet . &quot;
Then there were those times -- this piece of stuff that &apos;s never going to be -- there were moments that the one was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was looking for paper and poetry and card the poetry and he was going to go and he said , which was like he was going , and he said , which was like you hallungasn up with the other hand and the office .
And it was the poetry and put it into his body and he was put it into his body and transmitted on the page .
And in these cases , poetry would be presented on the perfect page , but at the contrary , from the last word to the first word .
So when I felt it -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly the same as a creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conducucucucucucture .
I &apos;m a mud , and my way to work is ; wake up at the same orar every day and to work and go and go over and to the drop .
But even I &apos;m even in my summit , I &apos;ve got strike up against that thing , sometimes .
And I guess a lot of you &apos;re the han did .
You know , even though the work and ideas came to me from a certain source of you could not honestly be able to be honestly .
And what is this ?
And how can we relate to it so that we can &apos;t get us to lose your head , but rather , that it &apos;s going to us us us healthy ?
As I think it &apos;s about , the best example of the same time I have is the Tom Waits , which I interviewed several years ago for a journal .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life was the incard of the artist of the same artist , to control , management , to be able to be totally interiorized .
But then he invecked , he hot , and a day , and he was driving on a Los Angeles , he changed everything for him .
He was going to be faster and all this little little bit of a melodia , which comes in his head as inspiration , and it &apos;s a very inspiration , and it wants , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the desidant , but it doesn &apos;t know how to take it .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a matita record .
So he starts to hear this kind of old anxiety to grow in him , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to go up with this song even even even even hemovers .
I &apos;m not enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to go into panic , he stopped .
And he was just the entire mental process and made something completely new .
He just looked at the sky and said , &quot; Sorry , I don &apos;t see I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Do you think that can write a song now ?
If you really want to exist , it &apos;s a more hurt when I can take care of you .
Altrain , you go to importantly someone else today .
You disturbing Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And the working process changed after this .
Not the work , the work was still dark as always as always .
But the process , and the fish that was reduced it was left when the genius , the genius that came out of him , the genius that came out of him . And it was going to get it back to where it was , to realize that it didn &apos;t have to be a interorized thing that was interorized and so mented .
but it &apos;s so well-peculiar , wonderful bizarre conversation between Tom and this thing that straight and outside that but it wasn &apos;t Tom .
So , as I felt that story how to change a little bit , the way I worked and already , she saved me once .
This idea , I &apos;d save me when I was writing , &quot; Me , &quot; Ama , &quot; and fall in a cave of the dispppair that we &apos;re all working on something and we &apos;re not working on something and we can &apos;t have to think that &apos;s the worst book .
Not just bad , just the worst book .
And I started thinking about this project .
But then I remember Tom that he was talking to the air and tried us .
So I got my face on the manoscritical and I was going to get my comments to a vacuum angle of the room .
And I said to high voices , &quot; Seep , what we &apos;re going to be not going to be a brilliant , not it &apos;s going to be a cold , right ?
Because I &apos;m looking at me , I &apos;m putting all of this all I have , I &apos;m not more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what I don &apos;t do it .
I &apos;ll go to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to be recorded that I was presented to me to do my part &quot; Because the end is so , OK -- -- the end is so , OK -- centuries does in the desert the clear dances of southern Africa &apos;s clear dance and just just on hours and up and until the dance of the dance of the dances of the seven-grass .
And they were always magnifigured , because the ballerons were professionals and were fantastic .
But every very much , a lot of , something happened , and one of these artists became actually transcendent .
And I know what I &apos;m talking about what I know , because I know you &apos;re all , to a certain point , a certain point , a performance .
It was like the time stopped , and the ballerin the sort of a portal and it was not doing anything different from the usual , like 1,000 noticed before , but it was all style .
And suddenly it doesn &apos;t just like a human .
But it &apos;s accurate from the divinity of divinity .
And when this happened , it was , people knew what was , people knew what was , they called him him by his name .
They were , they started to sing , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , God , &quot; God , &quot; God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Cuous note note note -- when the More invasing the Spna , preserved this habdents with them and the ready and the ready undamn changes from &quot; Allah , Allah , &quot; which you can still hear in the courride or famended in the famenthugly .
In Spaign , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , the sun , &quot; Allah , magnificfiction , &quot; unable , &quot; unable , &quot; uncomprehensive , &quot; Huncomprehencium , and it &apos;s a flip of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes up the day , for the ballerin the morning , when you wake up and find out that &apos;s the 11 in the morning of God is not there .
It &apos;s just a very bad to the ginocrates , and maybe it will never be more to each other to that height .
And maybe no one will sing the name of God still while it &apos;s a gira , and what do you do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most porous re-porous re-making life .
But maybe it &apos;s not to be so angoscivent if you can not believe , advanced , you know , the most extraordinary aspects of your being being .
But it just believed that you &apos;re in a remote of a unimaginable source of this team of your life that you have to go to somebody else when you finish it .
And , you know , if we think it &apos;s all about it changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s certainly as I thought it for several months during the working of the book that I &apos;m going to soon soon the work of the book that I &apos;ll soon soon soon soon as I was following my great success .
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel electrized when I feel electrized from this is , not to have fear .
Not floating . It &apos;s only the work .
It &apos;s going to talk to you for your side , any one can be .
If your work is dance , you can blow , you can blow ,
If the divine , aburd genius you decide to leave a few wonderful , for a wonderful time , for a only moment through your efforts , then &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Altrain , you do the same dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot;
I think it &apos;s got to teach it .
&quot; Ole ! &quot; to you the same , even for having the human love and testing testing , testing you &apos;re going to show you continuously introduced .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As I &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects on human genome , what it can mean and to make new set of genes .
Now we &apos;re starting a new path : we &apos;ve started digitize biology and now starting from that digital code , we &apos;re coming in a new phase of biology , design and synthesizing and synthesizing life .
We &apos;ve always been trying to ask big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists , I think they have been trying to understand a variety .
We tried several approaches , and we &apos;ve been reducing it to the minimi .
We &apos;re digitizing by almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treating by the analogical world of biology in the digital world .
Now , let &apos;s regenerating life , or create new life , or creating this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome that can authoreplicate in the lab .
And we tried to reduce that back the genome to create a little more small .
We &apos;re able to eliminate a hundred genes of 500 of the genes of 500 that are here .
But when we look at its map map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our .
I think I &apos;m a simple thing .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this can bring to a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to design was synthesize this crumes that we could change the components to get some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of &quot; We can synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Can you have the chemistry to produce these big molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create before ?
And , in case , we can actually make a crumbust ?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemical material inhert .
The speed that we &apos;re able to digitize life is growing at exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , rather slowly , design , but it &apos;s going to be improving .
And our most recent results the results of exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process required a lot of passes , starting with a bioethic review before we started the first experiments .
But we found that synthesize DNA is very hard .
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that produce small segments , the long length of 30 to 50 letters and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the most mistakes have been a degenerative process : the most mistakes there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these fragments and correct the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , to start by the digital genome of Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
We &apos;ve been designed the framments , we &apos;ve got the reption of the mistakes and I got a DNA molecule of a DNA molecule .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material inhert and we put it in bacteria , and we put it in the bacteria , they started reading this genetic code and to produce the viral particles .
The virals that have been left by cells , they &apos;re back and they &apos;re back and they &apos;re going back and they &apos;re going back and they &apos;re going back and they &apos;re going back and they &apos;re going back and they &apos;re going back and they &apos;re going back and they &apos;re going back and they &apos;re destroyed .
I talked about recently with the members of the oil industry , say they they &apos;re going to have been talking about this model .
They have more of you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build its same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things larger .
We wanted to build the entire bacteria chromosome of bacteria .
I &apos;m more than 580 mila letters of genetic code .
So we thought we were building it in casses of viruses , so that we could change the casses to understand what the components of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the fairly , it was a mistake for every 10 mies .
We found out , resequenced it , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence we never had been able to do this work .
A part of the process is designed segments that are required to the 50 letters to make 50 letters to build smaller submark that they work together .
We try unic elements here .
You probably read you &apos;d read that we put the fligrain .
So , think this is , we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters that had a little bit of aciacids , and there &apos;s a specific order of letters , and there &apos;s a specific order of letters for every amamateful acid .
So we can use the genetic code to write , frash , thoughts .
What we did at the beginning was authogate .
Some have been delused by the fact that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
We designed these segments to be able to just unbelieving with enzyme .
There are me that they repair them and put them together .
And we started to assembling parts , starting with the sent segments from five to seven mila letters , unendles so to formate segment of 24 mila letters to them to 72 mies .
And we took these segments that were so to sequence them that we could sequence them because we &apos;re trying to create a very very robust processing -- that we &apos;re trying to create a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatically the process .
So , this looks like the tabellon the baskin a gash .
When we get these very long segments , more than 100 meters , more than 100 basis , they &apos;re not going to grow more directly in E.
You get to the limit of the modern molecular biology .
So we &apos;ve been considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called the homological rewards , which is useful to repair the DNA that could be able to unt the DNA that could unquire the segment .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , it can absorb three million rad rad rad .
You can see in high flashhhhit &apos;s destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours it &apos;s just just like it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely completely .
They can live under empty .
I &apos;m absolutely sure life in space , and you have to find new environments of water .
Actually , NASA showed that this is happening .
This is a molecule image that we &apos;ve built using these processes , just using the lieventually with the design appropriate segment .
The hoth hit them automatically .
This image was not taken with a electronic microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It &apos;s a molecule that we can see with a little microscope .
These are pictures that they cover a time of six seconds .
This is the publishing that we &apos;ve done a little time ago .
I &apos;m more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the largest molecule that ever created by man .
It has a molecular weight weight at 300 million .
If we &apos;re going to be a 10 without spaces , you &apos;d like 142 pppage only this to transform this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ? How can we actually activer it ?
Of course , you take a virus is a game of kids .
It &apos;s a little more complicated when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s simpler even when it &apos;s about eucarial cells as our : you can just get the nuclear , and put another , which is basically the process of cloning .
In the archaea bacteria , but we &apos;ve been integrated in the cell , but we recently demonstrate that we &apos;re able to do a complete trapion a birthday of a cell trapot from one to another and to actively .
We clean a chromosome parent from a micbial species .
The two are different than men from mice .
We added some gene in a way that we decide that to decide what to choose for this crumes .
And then it smooth with the enzymes so that they kill all the protein .
And when we put it in the cell is been studipendo--- and you &apos;re appreciate our sophisticatothic graph -- the new chromosome is gone inside the cell .
And we were really thought we could not go beyond , but we tried it anymore , but we tried it anywhere .
This is one of the majorchanisms of evolution .
We found that tantisevere species have added a second or a third chromosome somewhere , add in a second thousands of new traits to that species .
So , who think about evolution as a only gene at the time that it has no longer understood part of biology .
There is a enzymes called the remarkition of remarkition that to say that &apos;s a DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell , you didn &apos;t have one .
The phone -- the chromosome that we put it on the --
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other chromosome as a material extraneous material , and we found us with only the cell and the new chromosome .
It became blue because of the genes that we put .
And in a short time , all the characteristics of a species , and it &apos;s transformed around the new software that we put into a new species , based on the new software that we put in the cell cell .
All the proteins have changed , members have changed , and when we read the genetic code at exactly what we &apos;ve moved you &apos;ve moved to .
Now , this may seem to be genetics , but by allowing the DNA , we can change things in a very fundamental way .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that you &apos;re not talking about genesis -- but progress from three million years and a half years of evolution , and I &apos;ve already said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of Cambriana explosion Cambriana that they will be new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s enough when we think about our needs .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion and a half billion people to nine in the next 40 years .
Right to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one existing in 1946 ; it &apos;s going to be four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find food , fresh water and fresh , medicine and wellin six billion and a half billion people .
It &apos;s going to be even more daily to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion coal-billions of oil barrels , more than 30 billion barrels .
That means 100 million barrels a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replace them , it will be a huge challenge .
And we have to understand all the CO2 emission from these materials that fines in the atmosphere .
And in today , because of the scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that they &apos;re the design design for the future .
The electronics industry has only only only a dozen about components , and think about how many different things came out .
Our limits here are data , principle , and we have some of our imagination .
Now we have techniques , because of these methods methods , able to create what we call a kind of combinatory .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think about processing these 20 million genes or to try to optimize the processes to produce optimize processes , new vaccines , we can change , because of a little team , and create more molecular biology now in the last 20 years .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , production chemistry or fuel , production production , vaccines .
This is an instantaneating some software that we &apos;re working to be able to be able to seat and design species on the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how they &apos;re going to be .
We know exactly how their genetic code .
Now we &apos;re focusing on the fourth generation of fourth generation .
You also saw you that extract etanol from the grain was a final experiment .
We have depending on the third generation and third generation that will be used enough to be on the sugar of the sugar of the opping or different butanol .
But the only way that biology can have a great impact without increasing the cost of food and limestone of the food and limits the available energy of the matter , so we &apos;re working to design cells that could achieve this purpose , and we think we could have the first first coal coal , and we think we can have the first first fourth generation of about 18 months .
Spanish with CO2 is a metodo--- but in our discoveries all over the world , we found several metods .
This is a organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , about 2,500 feet depths of water .
It creates metane by using molecular hydrogen using molecular as source of energy sources .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can incanaling CO2 , which can easily be transported by the tubes , convert that CO2 in fuel , to drive this process .
So , we think we could be able to increase what the basic question , &quot; What is life is &quot; We have , veraint -- we have the modest goal to repeat the entire chemistry industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do this from TED , where you can you do it ?
It would be a major source source source of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working to use the same methods to create vaccines .
You saw this year with the influence , we &apos;re always forth of a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s about find the vaccine .
I think that &apos;s going to change building combinable vaccines in anticius .
So , how the future could start to look at the time , the tree of evolution , accellerating evolution with synthetic bacteria , arches , and finally cells .
We &apos;re so so so to improve people .
Our purpose is to make a long enough to try to make it . Thank you very long .
I &apos;m going to show you , the faster possible , some fundamental work , some fundamental work , in the new technology that we took Microsoft in the following one year ago exactly . It &apos;s Seadragon .
It &apos;s a environment that you can interact is local local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data .
We &apos;re seeing this lots of digital photos with a kind of digital photos with a kind of a very large , very quickly , for a faster panoric , desize the images as we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how large the amount of information that we see , how big these data is ,
Most of them are common photographs , but this for example is a scanning trial of Congress , and it &apos;s a 30-megamma scanning , and it &apos;s coming into the gamma of 300 megapixels .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that limits the prestations of a system like this is the number of payer on your screen at any time . It &apos;s also very flexible architecture .
This is a book , all of the data .
This is the Casa desolate of Dickens . Every column is a chapter .
To demonstrate that it &apos;s just about text and not images , we can do something like that , to actually see that it &apos;s a real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a electronic book .
I don &apos;t recommend it .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s a number of The Guardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of a magazine version of a magazine or a daily , which is for nature a multiple kind of a half .
We also did something with the corner of this number of Guardian .
We &apos;ve created a high-resolution advertising advertising -- much higher than you use in a normal advertising -- and we put you in the content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the space on the screen .
And I hope that means to put people to the people and to bring other similar porcheries and other similar porcheries , not to be able .
Of course , the mapaps is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say that we have to give you in this field .
These are all the roads in the U.S. SSovrappost of the NASA .
So we go to something else .
This is actually from the Web , you can go to the Web ; you can go and see it .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which is a fighters two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting computer that Noah Seadragon , a student of Washington , with the University of Washington , with the help of Steve Seadrnow and Rick Szeliski and Rick Szeliski Rick Szelikle . It &apos;s great collaboration .
And it &apos;s from the websent , I &apos;ve been from Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from one image to the other and have this kind of experience to be multiple resolution .
But the spacectively images here has actually a meaning .
The algorithms of the computer computer have been recorded these pictures together , so that they correspond to the real places that they &apos;re imagining -- all the little bit of the Montagne Roccious Montagne Roccious dog -- they &apos;re shown . So you see the elements of a slip-stable , or by a little bit of a little bit of spacecraft .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot of space .
I want to go directly to one of the Noahnthaking data -- and this is a very much prototynthrowing . And so it &apos;s not necessarily evidence -- to show you what I think is really the key behind this technology , the Photosynth technology , Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily evidence at the environments that we put in the website .
We had to worry about legs and so forth .
This is a reconstruction of Nobody Dame Caucucucucuck . Bauction . Bauction Nobody Dame in Flickr and you get pictures of these kinds of weters and you &apos;re going to get some image that has been done to be a picture that &apos;s discovering to this model .
So they &apos;re all images from Flickr and they were all spacectively connected to this way .
And it &apos;s possible to be able to be in this very simple way .
You know , I would never think of finish working for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifying to get this kind of accounts here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s about a lot of different types of photocamers : from those cell phone professional SLR , a significant , a significant number , a significant number , put together in this environment .
And if I can try and try and look at those more strains .
Many stuck by faces , etc .
Somewhere you &apos;re a series of photographs -- and it &apos;s a series of photographs --
This is a Nobody poster Dame , recorded correct .
We can go from the poster of the poster of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is taking data from a whole time -- from the entire collective memory of how to appear the land , from the visual point of visual -- and connects all that data together .
All those pictures become connected , greater than the sum of the parts .
You have a model of the entire land that emerges .
Think about this as the prolungment of Stephen Lawler &apos;s work on virtual Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complex complex as people are using it , and the whose advantages to get the use of the use .
Their pictures are marked with meadapted by other people .
If you get someone is the idea of contrast all these sets to say the name , my picture of Nobody &apos;s cattedral of Nobody .
Of course , a consequence of all that are virtual models of all the interesting things that we have been doing , collective , and it &apos;s not just seen airplanes and satellite images and similar , but from the collective memory collective .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I &apos;ve been understood ? What your software is going to be doing is that at a certain point in the next few years , all the photographs of everybody in the world will be basically connected with anyone in the entire world will be basically connected together ?
BAA : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is basically is to discover .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , you , in pictures .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of the seant information that many of these images have .
As you do a picture of the web , you have a sentence and the text on the page of the web has a lot of information about the pictures of the pictures of the pictures .
Now , what if you put all your pictures ?
So the amount of seant connection and the amount of remarkable connection and the amount of remarkable to the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible . Compliments .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure when you travel and one of the etnografies , it &apos;s the one of the living of the people who have no antic traditions , who would have been on the wind , the past , the wind , the hatred in the wind , the leavigate ft-wishes .
I think that the skiamani Jaguar , they still travel over the Via Lattea , or that the old Inuit &apos;s still cold , or that in Himalayas , the distinct buds , the distinct , the distinct of the Dharm , to remember the central importance of anthropology , and that the idea that the world we live in which we have no only exists in a sense of reality , but it &apos;s just a reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stirpful stirpe has done , well or bad , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share essential strikes .
We all all the procream .
We &apos;re subjects to reach of initiation .
We have to deal with the death of , so we don &apos;t surprised us and we &apos;re looking at the way we &apos;re looking at the way .
We all have an art .
What it &apos;s the particular we were the particular rhythm of the song , the rhythm of culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that they &apos;re the Borneo &apos;s the forests of Borneo , or the following Voodoo guerriers of the Kaiththrowing in Kenya , the Curanderrial Curanderrial , or a cammas , or a cammas .
He was my journey company in the desert a month , or a hell of yak in the KKomolangma &apos;s valli , Everest , the mother of the world .
All these populations teach us that there are other ways of exist in the world .
And if you reflectim , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
Insibled , the miriades of the world are a spiritual poud and cultural , which is important for the well-being of the planet , and it &apos;s important for the planet as biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural race as a ethnosphere and you can define the etnosphere and you can define the total of all concepts , unmitted ideas , inspired , intuition , inspirations , intuition , by the human imagination of the human awareness .
The etnosphere is the great pathium of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we &apos;re and what we can be as as a kind of inquisitive .
And because biosphere was very very , very quickly , as it &apos;s happened to the ethnic , and so , too faster .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all the species is in the horric , because it &apos;s been fended , or -- in the most apocalyptic diversity -- and you don &apos;t even get closed to the most optic diversity -- and you don &apos;t even get a little bit of biological diversity -- and you don &apos;t even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even at the most optional hypothesis --
The surx of all that is , of course , the linguistic language .
When you &apos;re born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just composed by a vocabulary , or a series of rules of rules .
A language is the spraking of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle that that the soul of every culture comes in the world .
Every lingua is a forest of mind , a kick ecosystem , a thought of spiritual possibilities .
And of those 6,000 languages , while we &apos;re here sitting here in Monterey , at least half not being being in the ears of the children .
They &apos;re not taught to kids , which means , less to less camps something , which is already death .
What is more tristes of being wising from being the silence , of being the last talking a language , not having a way to transmit the wisdom of the saggeisdom of children ?
This is a bit of one in a few weeks : every world in a few weeks : every two weeks , a old mud and door with it in the toms of the last silly language .
And I know somebody who will say , &quot; Is it better ?
The world wouldn &apos;t it be a better place if we really leave all the same language ? &quot; Benither , we &apos;re all yoruba .
We talk about kogi .
You &apos;ll get a trap what it means you can &apos;t talk to your own language .
I &apos;d like to give you a journey through the etnosphere --
a little trip in the etnosphere to give you a bit of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I say &quot; several ways of existing ways of existing existing .
Let &apos;s take for example this Barasana bimmbo , in Amazon security , the people of anaconda , which believes in the mist of the West , who believes in the poured sets .
It &apos;s a people that &apos;s not able to distinguish color from green because the time it is identified color from green because the time it &apos;s identified in the forest , which it depends on the people .
They have a bunch language and a nauct rule , called &quot; exogram language , &quot; exogue language , &quot; You have to marriage a person talking about a different language .
And it all has roots in the mitological past , yet the particular one of them is that in these families that they &apos;re talking about six or seven languages because the matriries no none language .
They &apos;re limited to listen and then they start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribe that I lived , the Waorani of Ecuador Ecuador , an incredible populations that had the first contact in 1958 .
In 1957 five mimidating a pipped by 1957 , they were making a fatal mistake .
They did sandwils down the photographs that they were retract them in the plug , forest that this populations of the forest pluvial forest .
They collected the photograph from the land , they turned the search of a form or a figure and , not out of the diavished that it was the diavished , and they killed the five missionary missionary with the lance .
But Waorani didn &apos;t just kill foreign the foreign &apos;t only the foreign .
They killed each other .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We were saving eight generations and we found two natural death cases and we found two natural death cases and when we went to know , they admitted that one of them was invecting , and then they killed it .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine animal urine , and recognize the species .
I first first &apos; 80s , I was assigned a really interesting task when my professor of Harvard asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti in the secret of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes , and I impossessor of Tonton Macoutes , and I impossesser of the poison .
To make a sense of a miraculous , I should understand Vodoo culture and the Voodoo is not magic .
It &apos;s pretty much about a metaphorriots of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianth-four-----theism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no faith . And instead of the Voodoo is not another one that the distilled of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of the slavor that .
What &apos;s interesting makes the voodoo is the intense relationship between life and death .
So , the living you are being to be the spirites .
The spirits can be invocated by the Great Act , they respond to the rhythm and replacing time to the living as a short moment , the following soul of the following one short active active active active , the following one of the following one .
So , this is the voodooists to say , &quot; You &apos;re white you go to church to talk about God .
We give them in the temple and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re owned , is the spirit that you , how can you do that ?
So you see these incredible events : following voodoo in state of trance that touches impunishes that touches impunishment a pretty strong demonstration of the body when it &apos;s catalyzed a very exciting state .
And it &apos;s all the people that I have lived in the most extraordinary Kogi Santa Nevada de Santa Marta City , Colombia secentrional Colombia .
They had to be a remarkable civilization that once lived on the charge of Colombia in the Redwood of Colombia in the hurt , the people would be retreated on the volcanic masses that you could be on on the volcanic massure that you could get on the volcanic plant .
In a blood clothing , this people have never been conquered by the spage-paid .
But I &apos;m now government government by a clam , but their formation is so so so that they &apos;re deciallowed to be very very ,
The young people are brought away from families to three or four , and they live secret in a world , and they live secret in a world of good and shading the fair of the paylayers for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years , by the way to reproduce the nine months of gestation that they &apos;re going to go into the mother &apos;s uter , now in metaphor the Great Mother other other people .
For this time , they &apos;re accultured to the values of their society , values that they preview that their prayers and only their prayers to keep the cosmic balance -- or to say the most of the ecological balance .
And so the term of this incredible initiation , they &apos;re suddenly brought out and for the first time to life , at the age of 18 years , they see an alba . And that &apos;s the first bull , when the sun kiss the beautiful landscape , and it &apos;s what they &apos;ve learned in a confirmed , everything that has learned in a remote . The pret it &apos;s reaching a step back and says :
&quot; Vist ? Proprial as I said .
It &apos;s amazing . Now it &apos;s now to you protect it . &quot;
They &apos;re calls more more and say that we , the minors , are the colpful of the world destruction .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about Indigene and the environment we invoose Rousseau and the old history of the selecdom , which is a race of the severe , which is a race of the Earth , or maybe invohyth-the-the-the-the---the--the--and-the-the--the-the-and--the-weters , and we say these people are closer people to the Earth .
Momes are not nor feelings , no indebate , or indebate .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the Asmat the Asmat the frozes of the Tibet , but because of the time and the rhyththththanks , they created a mystical of the Earth is not about any notion , but on a very much more subtle , but it &apos;s a very much more subtle .
What does that mean ?
It means that a child from Ande that Ande who grows the mountain is a massive spirit of the mountain is a very different human being deeply different , and it will be a very different rationally different with the mountain or that place that you can have a lot of rock that &apos;s increased rock is a mountain of rock of rock that &apos;s a masse of rock of rocks are ready to be shown .
which is the dimmora of a spirit or a mineral cat is irrelevant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that define the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia British , believing that forests you were going to be cut .
And it made me a different human being from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the dimora of Hukukukukukukukukukukukuk-s-up initiation of the world , spirits that they live in the Hamatsa , and the cancers that we &apos;re going to the Hamatsa .
If you start to look at that these cultures can actually create different reality , you can start to understand some of them feeling .
I took this picture to open the picture of open in the norder Amazon nordocal Amazon norder .
Maybe some of you heard about the ayahuasks , the most powerful psychoactive , the most powerful psychoactive ,
What makes it fascinating the ayahuasks not the potential of the substance , but the processing processing . It &apos;s what it &apos;s been .
On one side , this lian liana legning , that &apos;s a series of Tiolin , harmoline and harmoline , lightly hallucinogene .
And by trying to take the only plant , it has a blueast that alter a little bit of the cocience , but it &apos;s mixed with the leaves of a caffee family &apos;s called Psychchectry is &quot; Psychchecktry to go .
This plant contains powerful powerful power , very similar to the seriotonin the serotonin , dithylyptamin .
If you ever see the Yanomami pulling up for the nose of the substance that they do from a different set of species , it contains methylyptamin .
Tirl that powder on the nose is a little bit like to be disappeared by a pinch of paints and land on a sea of electricity .
I often have to my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who wrote the &quot; Psychedelic was , with his discovery of the fungi hallucinogens in Mexico .
Second my thesis not to classroom , you can &apos;t get these triptamins , because if you &apos;re done not to tell any of being hallucinated . And you can &apos;t tell any orously be hallucined by a enzyme that &apos;s essentially , because they &apos;re denial by a enzyme that is , of course , the income , which is , of course , the monoonoonic demonoonoonoamins .
It &apos;s possible to be above the right right now if you abunits with other chemicals that they denied MAO .
Now it &apos;s the beautiful : the coal Tipan that you find in this liana injecubitors of MAO , the same kind of potential to potential triptamins . The question is a four-species of plants , like these people who are in this way , they do these people have to find two defliological defological version of plants , but that if you get into this way , you &apos;re going to be in the parts ?
We use the great eubone-proof of and mistake , which can be infruttifer .
But if we ask Indians , we say , &quot; The plants talk about us . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribes , Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuasks , which distinguished neply in the forest , and that &apos;s the eyes would come into the same species .
If we ask them how they stopped their tasonomy will tell us &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought about plants , the rest of the rest of the rest of them ? &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : You take 17 variety in a night of the moon , and each night , it will be a different tone .
So , we don &apos;t have graduate at Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting to count the stami .
Now , &#91; applausers &#93; the problem is that even the ones that have to be the heart people who have to be painted , but some way to reduce the seven-by-sample , and it passes beyond .
In fact , the 21st century , in 300 years , it will not remember its own technology , but rather like the one was that we stopped and pasmate , but rather as the one was that we stopped and passively paid of biological diversity and cultural destruction of mass diversity and cultural planet . Now the problem is not change .
All culculcultures have been involved in a dance for new possibilities of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux have no stop being Sioux when they put it from the arco and freceived as Americans have no stop to be American when they put on the horse and calcial .
It &apos;s not the change or the technology that threatened the integrity of ethnosphere . It &apos;s the power .
The hard hard to domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you &apos;ll find that these are not cultures to disappear .
They &apos;re living creatures and dynamic , spinted creatures that go beyond existence of the adaptment of them .
It &apos;s a disbone in the Penan --
a peak peak peak , the souast souast , a people who lived in the forest to a generation of a generation ago , and now reduced to a generation of the seven-blew , and the prostitution of the ribbbums that it looks at the River , and the prostitution of the sounds that seems to be a half a Bornewest or bear , where the naptied horizon , where you can see the waves are are woning horizero-, where you can see the ride of the wonds of the rillands of the wwwearlim &apos;s wwwwwwwest CCCCCE
It &apos;s ready to fill the wooden sads with the forest .
Or in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that have come with the discovery of the gold .
If we &apos;re going to put on the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the wall of political domination .
As you know the genocide , the extinction of a populations , it &apos;s convicted to the universal level , but the etest destruction of the style of a people , not only is constantly , but even celebrated in the circles , because it &apos;s part of development strategy .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of Tibet until you go from the beginning .
I &apos;ve been path the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Western China , through the Western China , coming in Lhasa with a young connection , but only came to Lhasa young connection , but only came to the statistics that we heard about .
6,000 monuments sacridgers in powder and centers .
1.2 million people killed by military during the Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was assigned at Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed to the time of Chinese invasion .
Suo uncle was fuck in Sainity during the diaspora that led led the people in Nepal .
His mother was imprisoned and his hilt hit was rich .
It was taken of hidden birth to the age of two birth , he hidden under his gonna because he couldn &apos;t live without him .
The sister , which did the same , it was put in education camp .
And one day he was injected a hot button , and , for this transgression , it was mitted to the forced jobs for seven years .
The Tibet can be insopposable , but the spirit of the people is from the present .
And it was all all the time , it &apos;s all the time to a choice .
We want to live in the world monocromatic world or we want to get the pollution world &apos;s pollution ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he died said that his largest fear was that , in our world , not only we &apos;re going to see the entire gamm of the world , not only we &apos;re going to see the entire gamma of the human imagination , but a day we &apos;ll see us from a sleeping way to go from the perspective of thinking , but a day we &apos;re going to be able to the lay us to be a sleeping to the way that there is other other other other people .
And it &apos;s equipment to remember that our species is exist for 600,000 years .
The Neolitica Revolution , which has given us agriculture , which has been done to us with the seed poetry of the seed poetry of the seitry of the skip , creating the hierarchy of specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has been 300 years .
That sharing history doesn &apos;t suggests me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we &apos;re going to have in the millennia to come .
When you do these miriades of the world is asked what to say to be human , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all refair possibilities of being what we &apos;re : a conscious species , that has to make all the gardens and all the gardens can train . And there are great moments of optimism .
I took this picture on the north of Baffin the island of Baffin , when I went to the whales with Inuit , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and he told me the wonderful story of his grandgranddaughter &apos;s extremity of the Baffin the end of the bounded of the bank of the grandgranddent of the bounded island of the Inuit , and this man , Olayers , and this man , Olaya , and this man , and this man , Olayer ,
The Chanadic government has been gentile with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to stabilize our spremate , we &apos;ve got them to hit .
The grandfather was going to refused to go .
The family , theme for his life , he brought them all the toons , and all of his equipment .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t get the cold , they do it .
The slitte pieces in origin were made of fish flying in the box of the boards .
The grandfather didn &apos;t put in this man didn &apos;t put in the night or the blilift , and it was suffished .
It &apos;s been tired out , it &apos;s hot the pantalones in the skin and defected in your hand . When I did it frozen , the work by creating a smom .
He &apos;s sproulder , it &apos;s salive on the points of this clock and when it solid , he became a dog .
He skip the dog and created a brid , with the toacy , and he created a slitta , he had a slitta , and it &apos;s disappeared to the bank , the clog of the bank , and it &apos;s been stuck in the bank , and it &apos;s been disappeared .
We want to talk about horses with anything ? &#91; Risate &#93; And this , in different ways , &#91; Applausers &#93; is the symbox of the people in the Inuit and of all the Indies of the world .
In the aprile , 1999 , the Chanadian government reduced to Inuit the total of California and Texas .
It &apos;s their new pathria . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s an independent land . They &apos;re all independent land resources .
One splendid example of how a natione-state can re-re-to the people .
And finally , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious to the people who are in these remote areas of the planet , to realize that they &apos;re not remote .
For somebody is home .
They open up sections of human imagination that they reach at the time . And for us all , the dreams of these kids , as the dreams of our kids , become part of the geography of the hope .
To end , we &apos;re in National Geographic we are convinced that politicians will never come to anything .
We believe that polements --
&#91; Applausers &#93; not persuasisides , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the best institution to tell stories about the world &apos;s stories . Every month our website 35 million visits .
156 country transmitted our television canal .
We &apos;re reviews are wireless millions of people .
Our work is traveling in the etnosphere to bring our public in places of wonderful and cultural and how they &apos;re going to go away from how they saw and , hopefully , abbracing time for the central revealing central revealing : the world of existing a life in a world , and we have to find a life in a world pluralist and turtar the last reveal , and we have to have a life in a world pluralist and reveal a world in a world .
where the wisdom of all the people can contribute to our collective wisdom .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope you &apos;re going to call some other other people you &apos;ve heard and try to test some link , in case you don &apos;t notice .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the official official &quot;
Dogma official official what ?
The official official official society Western industrial society . The dogma official official , &quot; If we want to massize the well-being of our citizens . &quot; The way to do it is massize the individual freedom . &quot;
The reason is , on one hand , in fact that the freedom is in itself , it &apos;s precious , essential , essential for humans .
On the other one is that if we are free , each one of us can act to do everything that we actually do all that that massized our well-being , without no one that decide in our well-being , without any one that decide in our own .
The way to massize freedom is massize choice .
The more choices choices , the more free people , and more is their freedom , the largest is their well-being .
This , I think , it &apos;s so deeply royed in society that no one would be going to be a doubt .
And it &apos;s also deeply rown in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress made it possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m going to allow me a simple note about the condition of injumping .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without contact the 10 variety of oil , and the 12 haunt whistic boats and 12 habble-by-boundaries that you can buy a huge number of stairs that no 175 already ready of your remarkable remarkable .
So , it &apos;s what the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic store to buy a stereo : cast , the lector , radio , plastra , light bullicer .
And in this single electronic store , there &apos;s a big number of audio components .
We can make six million different combinations using the components that there are in a only store .
You have to admit that &apos;s a lot of choice .
Other fields : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all the phone services , at the pat that they were provides from Mma Bell .
He was noleged the phone , it didn &apos;t bought it .
A consequence of that , one was that the phone never made .
These days , they went .
We have now a nearly limited variety of phones , especially between cell phones .
So , you have the phones of the future .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , cuts , cut the snose , and forced to the kill crone .
If you haven &apos;t seen it still seen in the store under the house store , you &apos;re very much for you .
And what happens is that people come into the store and it makes this question . And what &apos;s the answer ? The answer ? The answer is &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t make too much .
So , in other ways of life that are much more important than the aquicians , it &apos;s the same explosion choices .
Assistence : It doesn &apos;t happen in the United States that you go from doctor and the doctor you know what you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor you say , &quot; OK , we could do A , or B &quot; has these benefits and these risks . &quot; And this benefits and these risks . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Dr. , what would I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; You have these benefits and these risks , and B has these benefits and the risks . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebat , &quot; Dr. if you were me , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
We call it &quot; &quot; autonomy of the malattains , expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But it &apos;s not that it &apos;s that a shift and the responsibility of making decisions of someone who knows something , which is the doctor , to someone else that knows anything -- and almost certainly is sick -- and it &apos;s not in the ideal condition -- and so it doesn &apos;t have any ideal condition to make decisions that you have the patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing of products of drugs , direct to people like me and you , if you think you don &apos;t have any sense , because we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why we advertitiles them ?
The answer is that they want to ask him to ask him to ask them to change the recipe .
Something that is so fundamental as our identity is a matter of choice , as you see in this vignet . &quot; We don &apos;t want to forget the kids . It &apos;s not going to forget the right moment . &quot; We don &apos;t get it to invent .
And we can reinventing how many times we get to get us .
which means that every morning , at the riskin , you have to decide that kind of person want to be .
And I &apos;m going to the family and the matriririmonium , a time , it was that it was that we had to be the most early possible possible possible possible , and it started to be the most soon possible possible possible .
The only real choice was a check , not when , and not what to do after .
I &apos;m really , it &apos;s really going to play .
I teach students very smart students , and I &apos;m going to go to a time .
And not because they &apos;re less bright , not because they &apos;re less diligent .
but why are they imthoughts , you ask , &quot; I should be going to be going to be going to be going to be doing this now ? &quot;
&quot; I should be getting back ? I have to think before kids or the career ? &quot;
I &apos;m interrogative interrogative .
And they &apos;re trying to answer these questions , even though this implica not to complete the homework and not to get a beautiful voice to my exam .
And they really have to do that . They &apos;re important questions .
Now , the work : We &apos;re lucky , as Carl underneath , because the technology allows us to work every day , every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from the Hotel Randolph .
And so , it &apos;s a coroline , and I &apos;m not going to say to any where , where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use me .
What does this mean , this incredible freedom of choice that we have about the work ? It &apos;s that we have to continue , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing hot , with the cell phone in a pocket , the Blackberry in other , and the notebooks .
And even though they &apos;re all spending , every minute that we see our son to reach the game , we &apos;re also asking us , &quot; I need to answer this ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? I have to email this ? I have to email this ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , you know , it makes the experience of your son very different son than that it would be in other conditions .
So , any of the look at , small things and large and large , things and the materials and lifestyle , life is a matter of choices .
And once the world was this : That &apos;s true , there were some possibilities , but it wasn &apos;t a matter of choice .
The world today is a world today is , the dilemma is , &quot; Is it a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Smit is .
We &apos;re all all the positive things we all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative .
All this choice is a choice that it &apos;s two negative effects of people .
The first , paradoxally , is that it makes paralysis that it &apos;s going .
With a lot of options that choices , becomes very hard to do that .
I give you a significant example : one study of the volunteer plans .
A colleague has been access to Vanguard data , the giant society &apos;s roughly a pension , with about a million clients , with about a million clients .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of adhesion two percent .
With 50 pounds offer , there &apos;s 10 percent in less than one of the adhesions that when they &apos;re only five . Why ?
Because with 50 sources that choose , is sick decided , and the choice is a hard decide , and the choice is replaced to intomorrow .
And tomorrow , and yet tomorrow , tomorrow , domans , and of course domans , and of course never coming .
You know that it doesn &apos;t only mean that these old workers are going to be able to get money , it &apos;s not going to say that the decision is so datically that they lose a good decision is so dator that they &apos;re also going to be a dator of the work dator dator .
Not participating , they &apos;re losing to five thousand dollars per year from the jobs , which would be well-being .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think it makes the world .
&quot; And to end , for the eternity : ketchup , &quot; or &quot; maionese , &quot; or maionese ? &quot;
You want to just take the right decision , if it &apos;s for the eternity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and yet yet the condition .
So this is the first effect . The second one is that although we can avoid avoid the paralyssatisfacfacts of how we would be with less options that you would have been with less options that you choose .
And that &apos;s for a different reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions that choices , if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine you could have a different choice that would be better . And what &apos;s the alternative imagined alternative to us branch us to pack the branch of choice , and the repair refused to the decision , and the repair decredit . And it &apos;s a reaching reaching by the decision ,
even when it was a very good decision .
The more choices there are , more , it &apos;s easier to be unsatisfaction of any detail .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has clearly very good stamp , how the value that we &apos;re going to things depends on .
From the rest , when there are many oppostions , it &apos;s easy to represent the traits of alternative shot and less sationfts of the option that you have to be a choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m sorry with all the ones that are not New York .
But that &apos;s what you &apos;re probably going to think .
There &apos;s this couple of Hamptons .
A llow place .
Spipelendida . Ottma day . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not missing anything . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , maledit , it &apos;s Agust . &quot;
&quot; All my neighborhood in Manhattan are away . &quot;
&quot; I could park right right in front of the home . &quot;
And it goes to two weeks from the idea that &apos;s lost -- every day -- the ability to park where it wants .
The costo-opportunity demining the satisfaction for what we have , even when the choice was excellent .
And the more are the options that we have to look , the most attractive features will be return us against how costo-opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
It &apos;s about living the moment , and maybe of the living slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you choose , you choose to not do the other .
The things that we don &apos;t choose to attract that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : the growing spiral of the expectations .
I tried it on my skin bought a new pair of jeans .
I &apos;m almost always jeans .
Once jeans were just a guy , bought them and vestivate , they were scomodisdisdisappeared , just after they took them a life and they were all all going to go .
So , I went to bought a couple of the old , when the old people were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
And he said , &quot; You want to be a fit , you &apos;re relaxed , and fit ? &quot;
You want them to be with the cernic bbuttons ? &quot; Stonewashed &quot; or &quot; acidsy &quot; and &quot; ?
&quot; You want them strappapped ? &quot;
&quot; See , you want them to strike them , &quot; Continupright , &quot; Continupright .
I was swealth , and after a little bit I could say , &quot; I want the kind of -- that was the only guy , &quot; I want to all the sick of the one , I tried all sick , and I went out of the jeans , and then out of the jeans , and I had ever been out of the store , I had ever been .
It was the very very very much . With all that choice I had the best one .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse is that with all the choice of my expectations were altissue , jeans had to be perfects .
I had been minimum for me . I didn &apos;t expect anything that was when there was a kind of , but when I saw 100 different , steps , at least a kind of a perfect one .
What I had been bought was good , but not perfect .
After I was compared to the chosen with what I was trying to be insatisfacted to the expectations .
The adds of options in the life of people don &apos;t do that increasing the expectations that these have respect to the excellence of the options of the options of the options of the options of the other people don &apos;t do that to increase the expectations of the options of the other people who don &apos;t do that to increase the exp
And that will produce less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
No one in the marketing world , if it &apos;s made it .
Because if they knew it , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more to that .
&quot; It was better when you were worse , &quot; The reason you was better when you were worse is that when you were worse was still able to meet the surprise of pleasant .
In the world that we live -- the world that we live -- unbelieved , citizens with the expectancy -- the most we can hope is that things are at the height of the expectations .
You never surprised pleasant because your expectations , my expectations , and they &apos;re ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Beslights expectations . &quot;
I mean , I &apos;m a little authographic moment -- which I &apos;m really married and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t have me .
But it doesn &apos;t always be a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of the bought a couple of jeans when you have a little bit of jeans is that when you &apos;re not satisfacfacts , and you ask you , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who &apos;s responsible ? &quot; The answer is clear .
The world is the responsible . What could I do you do ?
When you have hundreds of kinds of jeans , and you buy a unsodisfacing , and you wonder who is the responsible , it &apos;s just just clear that the responsible .
You could have done better .
With hundreds of variety available , there are no excuse for the insuccess .
So when people make decisions , even though the result is valid , you &apos;re feeling insatisfacfacts and give the cold .
For the last years , the depression is exploded in industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only , but important -- of this depression is just that people have been so high .
And when they have to explain this this situation think the blame is their blamework .
So the final result is that we &apos;re better better , but we &apos;re feeling worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all get good and it &apos;s completely fended . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little choice of choice is better than having any of it is better than a bit .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic value . I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve been overed by a piece of the level where the choices are going to improve our life .
Now , from political point of view -- I &apos;ve been nearly finished -- from political point of view , the nocy is the following .
What it allows all this to industrial society is the wealth of the industrial society .
There are many places in the world , and you know about it , where the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too poke .
So the faciiial that I &apos;m talking about is a mallefing of modern , reatheoral society .
And what it makes you get out of how to angry is this : Steve Levitt spoke about how those expensive and comodbes for a bimmmes are . It &apos;s a money path . It &apos;s a money path . It &apos;s a money path . It &apos;s a money of money .
I mean , these choices , complicated and dispendiose , it &apos;s not that they &apos;re just inutilize them .
I &apos;m also deleterie .
They &apos;re worse .
If a little bit of what we do in our society allows choice to be revered in those where people have too much chance , not only their life to improve but our .
This is what economists call a lot of eagreement .
A redistribution of income redistribution , not only to poor people -- because of this choice in this excess that it &apos;s reaching us .
To conclude , &quot; You can become everything you want &quot; --
You , people of culture , you think , &quot; But what does that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious you can &apos;t do anything in a glass bock . &quot;
&quot; A gotten imagination , a limited vision of the world -- &quot;
and I &apos;m interpreted it so , at the beginning .
But then , I realized that that fish knows the long knows that that the fish knows the long knows .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you &apos;re missing the boccia , so that you can &apos;t get freedom . You can &apos;t get freedom . You can &apos;t get freedom .
If you break the boccia in a way that all you can diminize the satisfaction .
You get the paralysis , and you reducing the well-being .
Everyone is needed a sphere .
This is almost certainly too strike , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of a symbolic sphere is a recipe for inhappiness and , I &apos;m theme for the rovine .
Thank you .
