Last year I showed these slides to demonstrate that the artic ice ice ice ice , which is about three million years had the size of 48 , the United States of 48 , the continent , has been retrofit of 40 percent .
However this underlying gravity of the problem because it &apos;s not the ice of the ice of ice .
The glacial ice ice is , in a certain sense , the clean heart of global climate system .
It expanded up and reverse retreat .
The next few slides will be a carrelated , which is going to be a carrelated carried in the last 25 years .
The glaces are reported in red .
As you can see , they &apos;re going to the blue blue .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter , which is summer ice .
You can see that the soft called the Sololder , is like the blood , which is like blood , which here was from the body .
In 25 years , it was so ,
This is a problem because the interests that , the glasses the land around the arctic ocean where there are huge amount of fuel coaled that , the skiage-frozen , they turned into metane .
I &apos;m going to the totalalities of the atmospheric pollution , that amount could be double , super-up this point point of not return .
In some deeper lagues in Alaska methane of the water .
The professor Katey Walter at the University of Alaska has been pushed with a team , a low-lake .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You &apos;re good . The question is if we &apos;re also going to be .
And that &apos;s a reason is that this exchange termal of the Groenland from the north .
This is a river regime .
The ported never had the same .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the southest of the Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level to the shelter to the glaciers on land , it &apos;s where the sea .
These currents are increasing .
On the other hand of the planet : Antarctica , the biggest block of the planet .
The last month , scientists have declared that the ice is in negative , and the West Antarctica , which is sent on some submarine islands , is particularly hanging on some submarine islands , is particularly hastern in the shoulder .
It &apos;s got to the 16-feet of the water , like in the Groenland .
Sulla Himalayas , the third biggest block of ice , you see new lakes , which a few years ago .
40 percent of the world population was getting half of water from the slavery .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the water of this city .
The ported is increased .
But when it decrew , the same falls into water .
In California , the snow on the Sierra Nevada has been 40 percent .
The hyriries are in crisis .
Sprevisions , as you read , they &apos;re grasses .
The growing physics in the world leads to a remarkable increasing inceness .
The environmental disasters are increasing out of the normal and unprecedenting .
Four times more numerous than the last 30 years I was in the last 30 years .
This is an unsustainable andering .
If you look at it in the historical context , you can see the consequences .
In the last five years we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day .
Look at the world of the East Pacific , the Americans , to the Americans , to the west , and both of the parts of the Indian subcontinent , where there is a radical oxygen in the oceans .
The greater causes , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two of the world with China .
And it was going to build a lot of other central central center-to-coal-coal .
But we &apos;re seeing a change of direction .
These are the annullated projects in the last few years and some alternative ways .
So , there &apos;s a politics cave in our country .
The coal and oil industrial and oil has spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote to clean coal , which is a hosymes .
That picture would remember me to something --
Verse , in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a loss of 3.8 billion liers of coalers .
Maybe you have seen it on the news .
This is the second larger fllow in America .
It &apos;s happened around the Christmas .
Number Chrise of one of the industrial industrial .
Video : Spet &apos;s a lot of allegro and a happy ,
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it makes our economy .
Frosty carbon diel is always flied .
It &apos;s good , adorable and the workable work to keep the workplace .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest mineral society in the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I &apos;ll be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelososy , Harry Reid -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore . So the Alliance for the Clima Protection of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is one , a part .
Video : Say with the ALergy : At the next thing we see the climate change as a weather .
For our priority is to invest a lot of money in a public effort to make public and confused to make public and confused the coal truth .
Actually , coal isn &apos;t sports .
We think it &apos;s pulit -- it also has a good profumo .
So , don &apos;t prefer of climate change .
Let me do .
Video : Attore : Cone pulit -- you &apos;ve heard about it .
So let &apos;s do a turn into a look at the sweet , as a clean coal-looking ,
Straordinarily ! The machines are a little noise , but this is the sound of the pulit technology .
The coal consumption is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology of pulit that you see changes .
You look at this : this is the hated hated hated fuel technology .
Al Gore : So , the alternative , the positive alternative is to economic question and the national security .
Video : Comition : America is in crisis , national security , climate crisis .
The wilk that the links of the fossil fuels , like coal and oil oil .
Now , there &apos;s a new , audace solution to get out .
Repower : 100 percent clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to reach America to work , make us more safe , and help to stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that I threw to solve our problems .
Repower America . You find more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It &apos;s about reating energy to America .
One of the fastest ways of getting to dependence from the fuel that killing our planet .
Comparsa : The future is here . Vent , sun , a new energy network .
Comparsa : New expressed by well-job jobs .
Comment : Repower . It &apos;s time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old African proverbio , they say , &quot; If you want to go to , go to the faster , go to the faster .
If you want to go far , you go together . &quot;
We have to go far , fast .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED I did an introduction to the LHC .
And you promised to reach to go back to how the machine works .
So here I am here . And for the other time , the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever attempt ever attempt -- 27 miles of circumconference .
His task is to reach the conditions that were less than a billion of the second of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
This is just ambitious .
This is the machine under Ginevra .
We photographs these mini-Big Bang in the relevers .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLAS -- is a half feet .
This is an ATLATLATLAS in construction so you can see the proportions .
The 10 September of the last year we push the machine for the first time .
And this was taken by ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLS .
It was caused to immense in control room .
It &apos;s a picture of particles that had done all the around the LHC , and he walked into the LHC , deliberately , with a part of the LHC , and spread particle inside the relevator .
In other words , when we see that 10 September , we realized that the machine worked , which is a great vicuation .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to make us more or this , when somebody went to Google and saw that the initial page was this .
That means we &apos;ve had a cultural impact beyond that scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , just about these wili files here -- these dorati files .
These files took 13,000 ampes when the machine works at the most of the power .
Now , the technicians between you look at the files and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . They &apos;re too throws . &quot;
And instead , they can do it because when they &apos;re very cold , they &apos;re called the throws of .
So , at least 271 degrees , at a lower temperature of the space between the stars , these files can bring that current .
In one of the giguntures between the most of the magnets in the LHC , there was a defect of factoration .
So the wire files get up , and the 13,000 amparily dent bults suddenly met an electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think about these magnets are weighing over 20 tons , and that they moved about 30 inches .
They &apos;re damaged about 50 magnets .
We had to take it , what we did .
We re-fer them and wearing it .
They &apos;re now coming back to them to them .
I got the brand the LHC CC is going to be integrintegrate or .
We &apos;re going to go to , and we expect to get data or July , and we continue so our adventure to find out what the morning is going to find out what the morning is the universe .
Now , of course , in some ways , these accidents reach the debate about the value of science and the frontier of science and the frontier engineering .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact of going to go beyond the limits , I think this is the value of things like LHC .
I &apos;d like to end with the words of an Inglese scientist , Humphrey Davy , who , I guess , in defense of inexist , his pupillo was Michael Faraday , he said , &quot; Nothing is so dangerous for the progress of human mind as the human mind as the reritenenenherous .
Thank you .
I want to start asking about rethinking when you , you play with children , you play with the morning .
And as you know , you know , you know , take them and get them and move them , and you learn in order to think and by doing space relationships .
The space argument is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , by the useful information of our interaction with physical objects , together to my bounding Pacacacts , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking , &quot; And if , when we use a computer , instead of having a computer , instead of having the mouse , like we have the only mouse cursor or a mouse curses that it &apos;s moving on a desktop , we could have a certain information with both of ,
and fix it to our pleasure ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big interactive computer like a biscope .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big interactive computer like a biscope .
You can move them with your hand , can see them , &quot; you can see them , &quot; they have a screen and a wireless radio .
But mostly , they &apos;re physicists , like the morning , you can move it to simply get grabbed .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulating digital information .
And as they become more physicists , conwardly to the movement , and as they become more physicists , and as they become more physicists , and as they &apos;re moving them , as we can explore and fun styles of interaction .
I &apos;m going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show video : if you &apos;ll incline it in a direction , the video will rotate as it as a way , if you start on the other side back .
These actively interactive portraits .
If I &apos;m relief them , they &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re around .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can be a little bit .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can be a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
And then we realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was that we can use common in data , for example , &quot; to put a color in a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configured as a real frame of paint and I can use it to pack of the color color in the central , where they &apos;re missing .
and I can use it to the color in that central , where they &apos;re missing .
If we &apos;re too much , we can put a little bit .
There are also a good chance of learning , like languages , the mathematand the mathematmathematand logic where people can try to try things , and see the results that are very quickly .
Now I &apos;m --
This is a Fibonacks us to do with a equations program .
Here we have a game of words that is in the middle of Scarabeo and Boggle .
Basically , at every Turn n &apos;t get a letter on every Siftable , you &apos;re basically , at every turnation of a case in any turnal case , and you know , and you know , he &apos;s looking for him to the words , I &apos;m looking for it .
Then , after about 30 seconds remissing , and you have a new set of letters and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the children came up to the Media Lab , I did so that I came up and I went to a video .
They were very much pleased .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot .
You just have to say , &quot; Compounds of words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s other people who are proved .
This is our beta younger younger , there on the right .
It actually wanted to be impilars .
They were only the cini morning for him .
Now , this is an appliance of an interactive carton .
We wanted to build a tool for learning . He &apos;s Felix . He &apos;s Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , lift the Sifmonks them .
It can put new characters in the scene , lift the Sifmonks them .
So , it &apos;s going to go out .
Video : The sun is surgender .
David Merrill : Now he took a treer in the scene .
Video : The arange treatment .
Bobs ! Yes !
So , you shake out the Siftable and putting them close them can interact with characters --
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing their history .
Video : Hello !
DM : It &apos;s a very open story , and it can decide him as it .
DM : It &apos;s a very open story , and it can decide him as it .
Video : Girl , cat .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , I realized for a recent , to sample and performing music .
It &apos;s a tool , I realized of recently , to sample and performing music .
The Siftable here are from sounds like the bottom , and the battery .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose to use .
You can also also put these sounds in a sequence to your pleasure .
And it simply by making a sound and a sequence .
These are actually you can control from alive , as the reversus , like the reverse and the filter .
And then you acks to a particular sound and then incline for the begging .
And then there are general effects as time and volume , that you &apos;re appappliances to the whole sequence .
Let &apos;s look at how it works .
Video : We &apos;re going to put a base in two Siftable .
Now , I &apos;m going to put a line .
Video : Now I &apos;m adding some percussions --
Video : And now I &apos;m going to put the filter to the battery , so I can control the effect from the vivation .
Video : I can &apos;t invent the whole sequence , including the whole sequence to the whole sequence , and then .
Video : And now I &apos;m going to add the bottom of the bottom to give more expression .
Video : I can reombinary the sequence &quot; to the sequence &quot; to the flying . &quot;
So I didn &apos;t have to plan this first , but I can improvise , making it longer longer or more correct .
And now , I can finally smoking the whole sequence of the left the Siftable to the left Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new human human interfaces more and more more like how our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this path , and some possibility that we &apos;re trying to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to transmit is that it &apos;s going to be coming this new generation of objects that will bring out of digital objects in our world that we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time to talk to all of you .
I &apos;m a writer .
I &apos;m going to talk about books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that .
It &apos;s also love and the fascinating of my life .
And I don &apos;t expect to change .
But , I said , something that particular has happened in my life and the career , which led me to reeal-up my whole relationship to this job .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called the Mangia , Prega , Ama , &quot; which , diversously , from my previous books , for some reason came out in the world and became a great , senational , wildlife , interational interactual .
And the result is that everywhere now , people treat me as if I was convicted .
Really -- conducted , conducted !
They &apos;re all been worried about me and say , &quot; You don &apos;t fear to do that ?
You don &apos;t fear to go and write for all life without being able to create a book that can matter ? &quot;
what can you care about somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s reassuring , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a teenager -- I wanted to be a writer .
I would go to the same reaction based on the fear .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you feed to get successful ?
You don &apos;t fear that the humiliation of killed you ?
You have no fear to do this mesh for all of life without nothing out and to die on a cumle of dream with the bocks of wherever with the mouth of failure ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I &apos;m afraid of all those things .
I always had fear .
And I also have a lot of other things that people can &apos;t even initiate .
As the algae and other things very frightening .
But , as I &apos;m going to write what I thought and ask me about , is why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logical that anyone should expect to be frightened by a job that you feel that I was born to do .
But what is so special in the creative business and so nervous about mental health as altrui in a way that other careers don &apos;t do ?
As my father , for example , he was an engineer and I don &apos;t remember one time in his 40 years of activity in his 40 years of activity in which he was asked if he was fear to be understood ?
There was never -- that block of the engineer John , how does it go ?
It didn &apos;t work that , you understand ?
Even though , chemicals as chemicals don &apos;t have , in centuries , the reputation of being alcooled .
We have enough this reputation , we have enough this reputation , and not just a writer , but creative , we have this reputation of being enormous instable .
And it &apos;s not even looking at the sad of the sad of the magnifts of creative magnifies that , only in the 21st century , died and often by their young and often .
And even the ones that are not suicked to be really disdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisted .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , &quot; Each , I was killed a little bit more . &quot; A fashion to work .
But we don &apos;t throw it when we feel it because we heard these things so long that we &apos;ve heard about the things so far that we &apos;ve got creativity and the suffering are in some way , and the suffering are in some ways that art and the suffering are in some way of the angosion , and then then it will always be to angosk .
And the question I want to ask everybody here today is : are you agree with this idea ?
It &apos;s really good for this -- because it also looking at it from a centimeter of distance to me not well for this support .
I think it &apos;s hated .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous and I don &apos;t want to see it in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our great creative minds to live .
And certainly I know that , in my case -- in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start to that I was objuring to that I was in my career .
That -- I mean , look at it , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m about 40 years .
I still have about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that whatever I &apos;m writing about now in the world as the work that came out after the world as the work that came out after the very , very , very , very , very , very , very , I think , in fact ,
I &apos;m going to be a little bit of friends here -- is likely that my greatest success is in my shoulder .
Oh , Gesu , what thought !
You know this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start drink in the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would keep doing this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so I think , after a lot of reflective , that the way to work to continue writing is to create a protective psychological construct , right ?
I have to find a security distance between me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxiety between me , which reaction to be going to get . And as I was trying to look through time , trying to find other societies , and I was looking for other societies and more sane ideas and more sweet ideas and more sane ideas and more sweet ideas and more sane ideas .
about how to help people management risks .
And that research has brought me to the ancient and ancient Rome .
I &apos;m just going to come up and then comes back .
In the ancient Greece and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity selling creativity from men , OK ?
They thought creativity was this spirit looks at divine and that came to men from a few distant and unknown for men from some distant smile and unknown .
The Greeks called these spirits of the demons of creativity .
Socrate , wonderful , believed , he believed to have a very far from a long way .
Romans were the same idea , but they called the the kind of spirit without a genius .
And that &apos;s great , because the Romans didn &apos;t think a genius were a kind of intelligent .
They believed that a genius was this kind of divine that was created in the walls of an artist , a little bit like the elsewhere , a little bit like the elsewhere , and to be able to be able to be a tough , and to model the outcome of that work .
Here &apos;s a big deal -- here , that &apos;s the distance of which I &apos;m talking about -- that &apos;s psychological construction that you &apos;re going to work .
And everybody knew it was how it worked , right ?
So , the ancient artists were protected by certain things , like the narcism , not ?
If your job was really , you couldn &apos;t take it all the merge , everybody knew that you were helped by this genius .
If your failure job , it wasn &apos;t your whole , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be an inable inable .
And so people have been even even conceived creativity in the West for a long time .
And then the Renaissance came and everything , and it changed this great idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe over all of the and the mystery and no longer let space to the mitic creatures , they wrote from divinity .
This was the principle of rational humanity and people started to think that creativity came out of the idivided .
And for the first time in history , you start to get this or that artist , as a genius of a genius that one person with the genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big error .
I think it allow somebody , a simple person to believe that they &apos;re like a recipient , and unknown as a source , the essence and the source of all the mystery , creative , unknown and unknown and unknown and a liability to give to the path of human pagile .
It &apos;s like to ask somebody to enjoy the sun .
Deform and distorce and creates all these expectations on performance .
And I think it was the pressure to destroy artists in passed .
And if this is true , and I think that it &apos;s , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do it diversously ?
Maybe I would go back to a more advantical understanding of human relationship between humans and mystery .
Or not .
Maybe we can &apos;t take 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience who would be tied to be relief of scientific replacement on the notion of , you do that follows people to do with their own projects .
I &apos;m probably not sure I &apos;m not going to convince you all about this .
But the question I &apos;d like to ask is is -- why not ?
Why wouldn &apos;t you think about this way ?
because it has more sense of anything that ever heard to explain the exasperating impredictable imprevedibility of the creative process .
And a process that , as anyone who ever tried to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- you know , you don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t rationally .
And , in fact , it can be completely paranormal .
I did this meeting with the extraordinary poeRuth Stone , who has now 90 years , but that was a poem for all life and said to me that during the rural Virginia , he was working in the rural Virginia , and he felt it , and I felt it , when a poem came from the landscape .
He said he was like a train of air .
And that was going to roling to her landscape .
It felt it , because he could make the land under his feet .
He knew he knew to have one thing to do at that point and was , words , &quot; to run as a matta . &quot;
And he was going to the house and he was going to be going to be going to take a piece of paper and a match , and a match enough , and he would not have to get it , and he would be able to pick it up and grab it on the page .
Other time he couldn &apos;t be fast enough , so correct and the correct he would be able to come to the house and the wheel the wheel and he would continue to rolling through the landscape , looking for , as she said , &quot; another poet . &quot;
Then there were those times -- this is not going to forget -- there were moments when there were some of the moments when it was almost losing , right ?
So , he was running home and he was trying to the paper and the poem passed through , and he was going to go through , and he said , he was like he was going , and then he said , he was like to put up and the hand and the career .
And he was the poem from the tail and he would put it in his body and transmitted it to the page .
And in these cases , poem would be presented on the perfect page , but the contrary , from the last word to the first word .
So when I was thinking -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly the same as a full same thing to my creative process .
I don &apos;t all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conduction !
I &apos;m a muil , and my way to work is ; I wake up to the same orary every day and work and go over and go over and go over and work and passing and enjoy and work and passing up and enjoy .
But even I , in my testgin , I strisciated meeting that , sometimes .
And I guess a lot of you the han done .
You know , even if the job and ideas came to me from a certain source of a source I could not be honestly aware .
And what is this ?
And how can we relate to it so we don &apos;t have to lose your head , but rather , rather , that we do stay healthy ?
As I think , the best example of the best contemporary I have is the Tom Waits , which I have a different years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the most of the life of life was the incarnation of the art of the tormented the artist of the roughly interorized .
But then I was invecked , he hot , and one day he was driving on a highway in Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
It was going to be very fast and all this little framment of this little piece of apelody , which comes in in his head as inspiation , elusiva and the desider , and the desider , and the desider , but it doesn &apos;t know how to take it .
It doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a pencil .
So I started to feel this kind of old anxiety in the anxiety , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to go up with this even even even .
I &apos;m not enough , and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to the panic , he stopped .
And I &apos;ll mate the whole mental process and made something completely new .
He just looked at the sky and said , &quot; Sam , don &apos;t you see what I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Do you seem to write a song now ?
If you really want to exist , it comes back to a more hurt when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , you go to importance somebody else today .
You &apos;re going to disturbing Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his work work was changed after this .
Not the job , the job was still dark as always .
But the process , and the fish that was reduced to the genius was released when the genius , the genius out of him , the genius out of the problems and liberated it back to where it was , realized that it didn &apos;t have to be an interorized and the stream .
but it &apos;s got this peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration with a conversation between Tom and this strange and the outside that it was not Tom .
So , how I felt that story started to change a little bit of how I was working on and already saved me once .
This idea , I &apos;d save me when I was writing , &quot; Prega , Prega , &quot; and fell in one of those despair of the dispation where we all work on and we &apos;re not working on something and we don &apos;t have a disaster , which is the worst book .
Not just a bad book , just the worst book .
And I started thinking about this project .
But then I remember Tom who talked about air and I was talking to us .
So I got up my face on the manoscritical and diress my comments to a vacuum angle .
And I said to high voices , &quot; Seen , what we know if this book will not be brilliant will not be a blame .
Because as I &apos;m seeing in here I &apos;m putting everything I have , I &apos;m not more than this .
So if you want it to be better , you have to introduce you and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know , I don &apos;t know anything .
I &apos;m going to talk to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to please that was recorded that I was today to do my part . &quot; Because it &apos;s like , OK -- centuries does in the deserts of North Africa , people were rown for dances , dances and the dances of the clear dances , dances and the alba .
And they were always magnificent because the dancers were professionals and they were wonderful .
But every time , he was a long time , and one of these artists became actually transmitted .
And I know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know that I know that you &apos;ve all seen , at some point , a performance like this .
It was like the time to stopped , and the dancing would walk through a kind of portal and not being anything else from the usually , like 1,000 noticed , but it was all align .
And suddenly , not just as a human .
But he accurate from divinity into the fire of divinity .
And when this happened , they were , people knew what was , they called it .
They were to sing my hands and started to sing , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , God , God , God , &quot; . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Cuous notes -- when the More south of the Spagen , I took this habits with them and the ready and the ready to change in the centuries , Allah , Allah , Allah , &quot; Allah , &quot; Ole , the hole , you can still feel in the corrids or flamenc .
In Spain , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , the leap , Allah , the magnificent , brace -- a fallen of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes up the day after , for the dancer itself , when you wake up and you see it , and you find out that it &apos;s 11 in the morning , the last of God is no longer there .
It &apos;s simply a dead to the ginocrates , and perhaps it will never be able to each other to that height .
And maybe nobody will sing the name of God still as a gier God still gier , and what &apos;s going to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most painous reciliations to do in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so corosciating if you can &apos;t believe , well , that the most extraordinary aspects of your being being .
But it just believes you &apos;re in soon data from a unimaginable source of this team of your life that team of your life that you have to go to somebody else when you &apos;re finished .
And , you know , if we think about this way .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s certainly as I thought it for several months in the working book that I &apos;m going to soon in the book that I &apos;m going to soon , the dangerous , attescalating , I &apos;m going to do this great success .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel electrized from this is , not to be afraid .
Don &apos;t shorter . It just your job .
It &apos;s going to talk to you for your part , any can be .
If your job is dance , you know , you know ,
If the divine , absurd genius , I &apos;m going to let me go to some kind of wonder , for a only time through your efforts , then &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Otherwise , you do the same dance .
And &quot; Oh ! &quot; to you . &quot;
I think , and I think we should teach it .
&quot; Oh ! &quot; to you , &quot; to yourself , even for having the love human and testablish tal testing to make you still talk .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Oh !
As you know , I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can mean and discovery of new genes .
We &apos;re starting a new path : we started digital to digital code and now starting from that digital code we are coming in a new phase of biology , designing and synthesize .
We &apos;ve always tried to ask big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; is something that many biologists , I think they &apos;ve been trying to understand how many levels .
We tried different approaches , reducing it to the minimi .
We &apos;re digitize for about 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treating to go from the analogy world &apos;s the digital world of computers .
Now , we can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome genome genome that can be in lab .
And we tried to reduce addition to the genome to create a smaller even smaller .
We can be able to eliminate a hundred genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the way I &apos;m here .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our .
I think , that &apos;s simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it &apos;s very improbable that this can bring to a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to design was synthesize this chromosome in a way that we could change the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of &quot; Can we synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Can the chemistry consentence to produce these big molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create before ?
And in case , can we make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is simply a piece of chemist material inert .
The speed with which we can digitize life is growing at the exponential life is growing at the exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , rather , the progress rather slowly , but it &apos;s getting better .
And our most recent results the results of an exponential curve .
We started more than about 15 years ago .
The process has required a lot of passages , starting with a bioethic review before we first experiments .
But we found that we &apos;re synthesize DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that producing little DNA segment , the long gaps of 30 to 50 letters , and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the most errors are long , the most errors are .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments and the errors .
And this was our first attempt , starting with digital information from the genome of Phi 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills .
We designed the fragments , effectively , we &apos;ve got the mistakes and got a molecule of DNA about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemicals and we put it in bacteria , and we put it into bacteria , they started reading this genetic code and produce the viral particles .
The viral particles were then left by cells , come back and they have destroyed .
I talked about recently with members of the oil industry and say , they certainly , including this model .
They have been reso far more of you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the bigger things .
We wanted to build the whole chromosome of the bacteria .
They &apos;re more than 580 thousand gene gene code .
So we thought we &apos;re going to build it in the cassette of the virus , so that we can change the cassette of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , in 1995 , the basis of a mid-basis .
We found out , resequencing it , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence never be able to do it .
One part of the process is to design segments 50 letters that you get overwhelming all the other segments of 50 to make smaller than that work together .
We &apos;re trying to take unic elements here .
You probably read that we &apos;ve probably read that we put in the train .
Think of this : we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters together .
So we can use the gene code to write , sentences , a thoughts .
What we did at the beginning was self-roughly .
Some of them were delused to be by the fact that it wasn &apos;t poem .
We designed these segments to be able to simply join them with enzyme .
There are enzyme that they repair them and put them together .
And we started to assemble parts , starting with the parts of five to seven mix to seven mix letters , join them , so that we have to form segments to them to come to 72 thththirds .
So , every step we made these segments in abundance , so we can sequencing it because we &apos;re trying to create a very good process -- as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems like the tabellon a basket globe .
When we get these very long segments , more than 100 basis , more than 100 basis , they &apos;re not going to grow more directly in the E.
You get to the modern molecular biology .
So we &apos;ve looked at other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called called the homologist reomologist , which in biology is useful to repair the DNA that can join the segment .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinocococcus radiodurans , can absorbed three million rad of radiation .
You can see in the top reach like his chromosome is destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s just as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do this .
These organisms can be completely dry .
They can live under vacuum .
They &apos;re absolutely sure that life exists in space , and you can find new environments .
Actually , NASA showed that this is happening .
This is a molecule picture we built using these processes , simply using the lievity of design appropriate segment to put .
The hildlife assemble .
This picture was not taken with an electronic microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It &apos;s a molecule so big that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that they cover a time of about six seconds .
This is the publication we did a little time ago .
They &apos;re more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the greatest molecule that we &apos;ve ever created by man .
It has a 300 million molecular weight .
If we &apos;re going to be a carat 10 without spaceship , we &apos;d only like 142 pages to only move this gene code .
Now , how do we work ? How can we activer it ?
Of course , you take a virus is a game .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s more simple as even when it comes from eucarily cells as our : you can simply extract nuclear and put another one , which is basically the process of clonation .
In the archaea , the chromosome is instead integrated inside the cell , but we &apos;ve recently demonstrated that we &apos;re able to do a complete trapian of a crumbye from a cell to another and to activer it .
We clean a chromosome parent from a microbial species .
The two are different than the tops .
We &apos;ve added some gene more in way we decide to choose what to choose for this chromosome .
And then it &apos;s melt with enzymes enzymes so that they kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was beautiful -- and you &apos;ll open our soft graphics , the new chromosome is -- the new chromosome is gone inside the cell .
And we were actually thought we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried anyway beyond .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that that they take a second or a third chromosome from some part , and I &apos;m going to give a second of thousands of new traits to that species .
So those people think about evolution as a gene once you change didn &apos;t understand much of biology .
There are some enzyme called the &apos; enzyme &apos; enzyme .
The chromosome that was in the cell , you can &apos;t do one .
The chromosome that we have put it in a mid-hurt cell phone .
It has expressed , and recognized the other chromosome as a expereo material , and we found it with only the cell and the new chromosome .
It became blue because of the genes we have put .
And in a short short amount of time , all the characteristics of a species , and it turned around the new species , which is transformed into a new species , based on the software that we put in the cell .
All the proteins have changed , memane changed , and when we read the gene code of genetic code exactly what we &apos;ve moved to .
Now , this may seem to be genetic alchemy , but by the DNA alchemy can change things in a very substantial way .
Now , I &apos;ve talked about genesis -- but progress from three million years and a half years of evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the Cambriana explosion Cambrian explosyion Cambrian explosion that digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty obvious when we think about our need .
We &apos;re going to go from six and a half billion people to 9 billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one in 1946 ; 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medical and gas for six and a half billion people .
It &apos;s going to be even more hard to nine it .
We use more than five billion coal-billions of oil barrels , more than 30 billion barrels .
That means a hundred million barrels a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replace them , it will be a huge challenge .
And in the most we have to understand the CO2 emission from these materials that end up in the atmosphere .
In today , because of scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the design components for the future .
The electronic industry has only a dozen about components , and think about how many different things came out .
Our limits here are data , principle data and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , because of these methods of synthesization , able to create what we call a combinatory genomics .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think about how to use these 20 million genes or to try to optimize processes to produce optimize processes , new vaccines , we can change , because of a little team , and create more molecular biology than in the last 20 years .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemical production or fuel production or fuel vaccines .
This is an instantaneous agem of some software programmed about that we &apos;re working on to be able to seat and design a computer species .
Well , we don &apos;t know how they &apos;re going to be .
We know exactly what their gene code .
We &apos;re focusing on the fourth generation .
You also saw you that extract ethanol from the grain was an experiment .
We have depending on the third generation and third generation that will use enough to be done more than they &apos;re going to be in more than the fuel or different butanol .
But the only way biology can have a big impact without increasing the cost of food and limestone that would be transformative of CO2 into the matter , so we &apos;re working to design cells that can achieve this purpose , and we can have the first fuel , and we think we can have the first fuel than about 18 months .
Solar combined CO2 is a metodo--- but in our discoveries around the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism that we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , about 2,500 feet deep to the ebollion the water temperature .
It creates metane by CO2 using molecular hydrogen as a source of energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can incanaling CO2 , which can easily be taken through tubes , convert that CO2 in fuel , to lead this process .
So , we can think we could be able to increase what the question of &quot; what life is life is . &quot; We have the furniture of the oil industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do this from TED , where can you do ?
It would be a major source source of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working to use the same methods to create instantanezing vaccines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with influence , we &apos;re always back a dollar in less when it &apos;s about a single one year in less when it &apos;s about the right .
I think what you can change is that you can change together in anticius .
So this is how the future could start to start to be changing , now , the tree of evolution , accellate evolution with synthetic bacteria , arches , and finally eucariote .
We &apos;re so much better from people .
Our purpose is to make it a long enough to try to make it . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the faster possible , some fundamental work , the new technology that we brought to the Microsoft in the purchase , almost a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s a environment where you can interact is at local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data .
We &apos;re seeing here , many gigabyte digital photography with a kind of a continuous zoning and continue , for a fast fast panoramic , we have unseen images as we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much the amount of information that we see , how big these are collected of data or images .
Most of them are common photographs , but this for example is a scanning from the Library of Congress , and reentrance in the 300 megamma , and it comes into the 300 megapixel .
It doesn &apos;t make a difference because the only thing that limit the prestations of a system like this is the number of plenty on your screen at any time . It also is a very flessible architecture .
This is a whole book , not data , not about images .
This is the Dickens of Dickens . Every column is a chapter .
So to show you that this is just about text and not of images , we can do something like this , to really see that it &apos;s a real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a electronic book .
I don &apos;t advisly .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s a number of The Guardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the good experience of reading the real version of a magazine or a everyday , which is for nature a multi-medium .
We also have something with the corner of this number in particular number of The Guardian .
We created an fashion advertising -- much higher than what you use in a normal public-one that you use in a normal public-one content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
And so , I hope that means to put people up and other porcheries to other similar , not to be able to be necessary .
Of course , the maps is one of the poorest applications for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say we have a contribution to give you in this field .
These are all streets streets around the United States , above a geospace image of NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually from the wellow . You can go to see it .
This is a project called Photosynthus , who are fighting two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research at the very interesting computer that Noah Snavely , a student at Steve Seader &apos;s &apos;s aid of the UW and Rick Seitz of Microsoft Rick Szeliski Rick . It &apos;s great collaboration .
And it &apos;s from the webs , I was in the webs .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from one image to the other and have this kind of experience to multiple resolution .
But the space space space space spacectively has a meaning .
The algorithms of computer visualization has these images together , so that corresponding to the real places where the imagination -- all over to the same as a little bit -- all the next to the lakes in the Roccial Montagne -- they were taken . Here you see the elements of a slides or a lander , or a a a slides of a slightly stable or a panoric imaging , and these things have all of space space level .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more space space space .
I want to go directly to one of the original set of Noah-data set from a previous prototynthrown of Noah-Listen that we did work for the first time , to show you what I think is really the key behind this technology , Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily obviously much obviously by looking at the environments that we &apos;ve got in the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so forth .
This is a reconstruction of Nothree-Dame Cacauction &apos;s images by Flickr . Baucucucuch Nobody three Din Flickr , and you get images of these things in shirt , and you get some of these arananange bor represents a picture that was found to this model .
So they &apos;re all pictures taken from Flickr and they were all connected to space level in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this very simple way .
You know , I never thought to end up working for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifying to get this kind of accurate here .
I think you can see that this is a lot of different kinds of photocamers : from those cell cell phones to SLR professional , a significant number , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to try and look at those more strange .
Many blocks from faces , etc .
You know , you know , you &apos;re a series of photographs -- here .
This is a poster of Nothree Dame recorded correctly .
We can go from the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking from the tutties -- from the whole memory of how it looks like the land , from visual standpoint -- and connections all of that data together .
All those pictures become connected together , more than the sum of the parts .
You have a whole land model .
Think about this as a prolungation of Stephen Lawler &apos;s work .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as people are using it , and the people who use it , and the advantages of the use .
Their pictures are marched with meadow by other people .
If somebody comes to the idea of contrast all these sets say , my picture of Nothing , my photograph of Nobody capable of three Demail Demond suddenly enroughly , and I can use it as ingress for diving in that space , in that metaphor , using the photos of the other , and having an experience of all of this data and to have a social experience of cross-cross-cross-user and cross-user .
Of course , a consequence of all of this is very very much processed virtual patterns of every interesting part of the land , that we can &apos;t just take away from airplane and satellite images and similar , but from the collective memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized what your software will be done is that at some point in the next few years , all the photographs of all the pictures that we have to do is , all the photographs are basically connected ?
BAA : Yes . What is doing is basically is to find out .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it at the content of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of semanas a lot of these images have .
As you do a research of the web , you get a sentence and the headquarters on the web payer is a lot of information to the pictures .
Now , what happens if that picture you connect to all your pictures ?
So the amount of semaned interconnection and the amount of wealth that comes out of it is really enormous . It &apos;s a classic effect .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really amazing .
BAA : thank you very much .
One of the main pleasant pleasant pleasant plug is the way to live between who has no forgotten the ancient traditions , between the people who would have forgotten the rain , the stone of the past in the wind , the guesses , the leaving in the plants .
I think that the shamane Jaguar traveler over the Via Lattea , or that the elderly of the old Inuit are still collue , or that the Himalayas , the budgets even the breath of the Dharma , to remember the central of the Dharm , to remember the central of anthropology , and the idea that the idea that the world we live in which we &apos;re not in a solute solved sense , but it &apos;s just a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of adapt , our stirply has done , well or bad , generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of essential trails .
We all procreates .
We are subjects .
We have to face the inexorability of death , so we &apos;re not surprising us and we &apos;re hunt and we &apos;re hungry and we &apos;re not going to go and we &apos;re not going to go and we &apos;re not going to go and we &apos;re not going to go to the death of the inexorability . So we don &apos;t surprise to the inesorability of death , so we don &apos;t have to go to the inexorability of death , so we don &apos;t have to go to the inexorability of death , so we &apos;re in the ines
We all have an art .
What it hits is the particular rhythm of song , the dance of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that they &apos;re the forests of Borneo &apos;s &apos;s the forest , or the following of the Voodoo &apos;s warrior of the Sea warrior of the Sahara Curander , or a camp in the heart of the Sahara &apos;s heart in the Sahara &apos;s heart in the Sahara .
And he was my journey , he was a journey in the desert a month ago , or a yak hallevator in the Qomolangma , on Mr. Mr. Ms , Mr. &apos;s mother &apos;s .
All of these populations are teaching us that there are other ways of moving in the world .
And , if you think a moment , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
And with , the miriades of the world are a spiritual . They create a spiritual life and cultural that flying the planet , and it &apos;s important for the planet , as biosties .
And you can think about this cultural spider as a ethnososphere and you can define the etc , the total of all concepts , subject , inspirations , intuitions , led , inspired , intuitions , taken out from being from the human imagination of the alba awn of the awn awn of the awn awn of consciousness .
etnosphere is the great patrimony of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be as inquisitiitive .
And because biosphere was very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very quickly .
No biologist , for example , would say that 50 percent of all species is or is about the horrior is about the east of the aesintion simply because it &apos;s filled , in the most apocalyptic field -- in the field of biological diversity -- and you don &apos;t even get closer to the most optional hypothest -- that of cultural diversity .
The whole thing is , of course , the language loss language .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just a vocabulary or a series of rules or a series of rules .
One language is the spraking of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle of every culture comes in in the material world .
Every language is a forest , a bacin mind , a thought , an ecosystem of a spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re sitting here in Monterey , at least half not being sussurrounded in the ears of the children .
They &apos;re not teaching to children , the one that means , unless than a truck , which is already death .
What is more sad than being in the silence , the last to talk about being the last to talk of a language , the last to talk about a language , the way to be the wisdom of the good or anticipating the promise of children ?
This is a little bit of somebody in the world in some of the world every two weeks : every two weeks . every old dies and brings with them in the tom-up , lighting a moon language .
And I know somebody who will say , &quot; Is it better like this ?
The world wouldn &apos;t be a better place if we were all talking about the same language ? &quot; Watch , then we all talk yoruba .
We talk about kogi .
You &apos;ll find a sudden what it means you can &apos;t talk about their language .
I &apos;d like to do a journey through the ethnosphere --
a little journey in the ethnosphere to give you a assage of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I say &quot; different ways of exist . &quot; I mean , very different ways of existing ways .
Let &apos;s take this for example Barasana bimas in the Amazon SS , the people of the anaconda , which creds in the west of the latest in the west panish panish &apos;s sacred ,
It &apos;s a people that can &apos;t be able to distinguish the color from the green because the time the celests of the forest , where the celests of the forest , where people are .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rule , called &quot; exogamia language : You have to marry a person talking about a different language .
This has roots in the mitological past , though the particularity is that in these families in the extent , where you &apos;re talking to six or seven languages because of midating a language .
They listen to listen and then they start talking to it .
We take one of the most interesting tribe with whom I lived , the Waorans of the Ecuador , a incredible people who had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionary have been trying to do a fatal error .
They took out of the top photographs that they retrails them into a lot of people who were adichevolved , forest that this people in the forest that this people in the forest .
They collected the earth , they turned it to the research of a form or a shape or a figure , not out , they found nothing , they concluse that it was the diaviil , and killed the five missionaries with the moars .
But the Waorans didn &apos;t kill just the foreign &apos;t killer .
They killed between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We were saved to eight generations , and we found two natural death , and when we went to know , they admitted that one of them was invecked , and then killed it . And then they killed it .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine from 40 steps and recognize species .
I was in the early &apos; 80s , I was an really interesting job when my Harvard professor , I was asked if I wanted to go to Haiti in the early &apos; 80s , I was a very secret to the power of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes , and Tonton Macoutes , and impossessor to do zombies .
To give sense of the miraculous , I would have to understand Vodoo culture and the Voodoo is not magic .
It &apos;s pretty a complex metaphor physics .
Most interesting .
If I ask you to tell me about the world &apos;s great religions , what would you say ?
Christianity , Islam , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no religious faith . And instead , and the Voodoo is not the distilled by these religious concepts .
What makes interesting makes the interesting voodoo is the intense relationship between life and death .
So the beds are going to be the spirites .
Age can be invocated by the Great Actually Actually , they respond to the dance of dance and replace temporary to the dance of the living way so that for a short active active active , it turns out the god .
So , for this voodooists like , &quot; You go to the white , you go to talk to God .
We give them to the temple and become God . &quot;
And from the moment that you &apos;re sitting , is the spirit that drives you , how can you get bad ?
So you &apos;re seeing these incredible events : following the voodoo state in state of trance that touch infusion that are un-powered demonstration of the body mind when it &apos;s catalyzed in a state of extremitation .
I have a living people with whom I have lived the most extraordinary is Kogi Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta , Colombia in the Santa Marta Colombia .
They give the ancient civilization that once had lived on the load of the quality of the conquiter plan of the conquician , the people would retreat the volcanic masses that you could go on the charge ,
In a macaries of this people have never conquered spage-bads , this people had never conquered by the spage-to-sheer continent .
But in fact , they &apos;re government government by a cler but their formation is really extraordinary .
The young people are being taken from the families to three or four years , and they live secret in a dark world in a dark world , and shadow frozen stone of the frozen frozen for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years choose about reproduce the nine months of gestation that spend in the uter of mother , now , they &apos;re metaphor , I &apos;m metaphor Mother .
For all of this time , they are acculturated to their society , values that are predicting that their prayers and only their prayers and just their prayers to keep cosmic balance -- or to say the balance .
And so , as this incredible initiation , suddenly they &apos;re taken out and for the first time to their life , at 18 years , see an alard . And that was that activity of the first bank , when the sun fits its in a lot of reach , everything that they &apos;ve learned in a theory of a beautiful landscape , everything that they &apos;ve learned in a theory . The pret it does a step step back and says ,
&quot; Visto how I said .
It &apos;s wonderful . Now it &apos;s now to you protect it . &quot;
They call a greater brothers and say that we , brothers , are the rings of the world &apos;s destruction .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the Indigene and invows and the environment we call Rousseau and the old selvage of selvice , which is a razy concept of its or perhaps invoin Thoreau and say that these people are closer to the Earth .
Indies are not nor feelings are not feelings from nostaly .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the malarial Asmat or the vents of Tibet , but because of time and the rhythic , but because of time and ritis , they created a mystical mystical of the Earth is not about a good intuition of the world . But on a well-range of the human awareness .
What does that mean ?
It means that a little bit of the Ande that the Ande credying the mountain is a spirit of the Apu spirit that will be a deeply different human , and it will have a very different relationship with the mountain or that place , or that place to a Montana who grows crew that a mountain of rocks is a rocks of rocks .
which is the dimora of a spirit or a mineral cure is irrelevant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that &apos;s called the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia British , believe that the forests were being cut .
And that I have a different human being from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the dimora of Hukukukukukukukye and the cannies of heaven and the cannies that live in the world , and the cannibals that live in the world , and the facing , the Hamf of the world , and the cannial .
If you start to look at these cultures can create different reality , you can start understanding some of them senational discoveries . We make this plant .
I took this picture to open in the nordc Amazon the nordc Amazon .
Maybe some of you &apos;ve heard about the ayahuasca , the most powerful psychophical actively of the shamanic repertory .
What makes the waste is not the pharmacological potential of the substance , but its processing . It &apos;s a very much .
On one hand , this legning lian lian , harmoline and harmoline , harmoline and harmoline , little hallucinogene .
And by by taking the plant , you have a smoke that alter a little bit of consciousness , but it &apos;s mixed with the leaves of a cafficonic ards , and they &apos;re called viridis called Poptry .
This plant contains powerful , very similar to the serotonin , dimethyptamine , dimethyptamine .
If you ever see the Yanomami throomami throws up for the nose of the substance that are doing from a different set of species , they &apos;re methyllyptamine .
Tiring that dust is a little bit like being shot of a little bit of a painted bear with a bear of the bear and land on a sea of electricity .
I often have to my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who had taken the psychedelivered , with his discovery of the hallucinogens in Mexico .
And so , I &apos;m not going to be halling these tripppptamine as as hallucinogens because if you can &apos;t tell anybody to be hallucinated .
It &apos;s possible to the orgeous time , just if they above with other chemicals that would be MAO .
Now it &apos;s the nice , the beta-coalin this lian is MAO injury , they injury of MAO , the same kind of need to potential to potential threat . The question of spontaneous , the question of , like these people can find two defologically not that , but that if you combine in this way , they do these people find a chemical version of the parts of the parts ?
We use the great euploader of the evidence , which can be infruttifer .
But if we ask Indians , they &apos;ll tell us , &quot; The plants talk about . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribes , Copan , has 17 variety of ayahuasca , which distinguished in the forest , and that at our eyes would come into the same species .
If we ask them how to stbipitch their own taxonomy will say , &quot; I thought , &quot; I thought , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take 17 variety in a night night of moon the finner and each other will .
So , you don &apos;t have graduate at Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than to contact the stami .
Now , in applausers , the problem is that also the ones of us that have to heart people who have in their heart painted in the world &apos;s margin some way of our real world , and it &apos;s going to beyond .
In fact , the 20th century , in the 20th century , it will not remember her about her own or its technological innovations , but rather like the one was where we stopped and we used actively or passive and we used actively accepted , and we used actively , the problem of the planet . Now the problem is not change .
All the cultures through smaller cultures have been involved in a dance for new possibility .
And the problem is not technology .
Indians Sioux have no smitted when they put it on the arco part of the Americans have no stop being American when they put on a horse and warm .
It &apos;s not the change or the technology that threatening integrity of ethnoshere . It &apos;s power .
The durgy face .
And if you give a look at the world , I &apos;ll find that these are not destined to disappear .
They &apos;re living creatures and spinout of forces from forces , from forces of forces that go beyond their adaptation ability to .
It &apos;s a disboscampaign in the Penan --
a people who have been in Sarawak , in the southeast East , a people who lived in the forest to a generation , and now reduced to a generation , and now reduced to the servitery and the next thing about the rights of the lim that seems to be taken away from the lim that seems to be a half Borneo to Merional Canthesis , where the Nigeria , where the Nigeria were nable .
You get the wooden wnaked the wooden sat to the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are disease that have come with the discovery of the gold .
If we move on to the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the hard daughter of politics .
As you know the genocide , the extinction physics of a people , is convicted to universal level , but the ethnic , destruction of the style of a people , not just addicted , but even celebrated in certain environments , because it &apos;s a part of the development strategy of development .
And you can &apos;t understand the Tibet until you go from the beginning .
I &apos;ve been path the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in the West China , through the West Tibet , coming to Lhasa with a young link , but only came to Lhasn , I realized what &apos;s behind the statistics we feel about .
6,000 sacred monuments in dust and centering .
1.2 million people killed from the military in the Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascriteria at the Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed to the time of Chinese invasion .
His uncle with Sua Santiity during the diaspora that has brought people in Nepal .
His mother was imprisoned and his blame was rich .
It was brought to hide in carch at the age of two hidden was born under his gonna because he couldn &apos;t live without him .
The sister , who did the same , was put in education in field .
One day has a hot inavily hot a band Mao and , for this transgression , was put to to the forced for seven years .
The Tibet can be insopporate , but the spirit of the people is tener .
And it turns out to a choice .
We want to live in the world monocromatic monootony or we want to take the world of diversity ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before we died said that his greatest fear was that , in our way to this amory view of the world , we &apos;re not going to see the whole gamma of human imagination , but one day we &apos;ll see us from a forecast of thought , but one day we &apos;ll see us from a foragement of thought , but one day we &apos;re seeing us from a sleep forgamoring even that there .
And it &apos;s equipment to remember our species is existed for 600,000 years .
The Neolitica Revolution , who gave us farming us , who gave us the farming of the seed , by by replace the poetry of the smom of the smom of specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has been 300 years .
That shark story doesn &apos;t suggests me that we have the answers to all of the challenges we &apos;re going to have to deal in the millennia .
When you have these miriades of the world is asked what they want to be human , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all refer the chance of being what we are : a conscious species , which has to make all the people and the gardens can fix . And there are great moments of optimism .
I took this picture on the north of Baffin the island of Baffin , when I went to hunch with Inuit , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and the wonderful story of his grandgrandfather .
The Canadian government has not always been gentile with the Inuit and the &apos; 50s to stake our supremate , we have them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refused to go .
His , I was tempt for his life , he took him away all the weapons .
You know , you have to know that Inuit doesn &apos;t feel the cold .
The slits skin origin were made of fish flying in origin skin spin skin spin skin .
The grandfather of this man didn &apos;t intimate at night or the artica or the bard that was suffering .
It &apos;s been disgacked , he hurred the pantalones in the focus and defecated in their hands . When I did it frozen , they worked a moon .
He sprouts up the dog of this clock , and when solid solid solid , he killed a dog .
He shake the dog and created a shell , with the toracy clothing has created a slope , he enliked another dog and he has uncomfortable .
We want to talk about horse with nothing ? &#91; Risate &#93; And this , in different ways , you know , Applan , the symbol of the Inuit &apos;s the symbol of the Inuit and of all the Indies in the world .
In the open 1999 , the Canadian government reduced to Inuit control area of a greater land area of California and Texas a whole greater than California and Texas .
It &apos;s their new patha . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s an independent land . They &apos;re all mineral resources .
One is beautiful example of how a nation-state can reconciliate with his people .
And , to finish , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious at least to the people who have been in these remote zones of the planet , I realize that they &apos;re not remote at all .
For somebody is home .
They represent the human imagination that go to the dawn of the time . And for us all , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of these children , like the dreams of of the geography .
And as we are National Geographic , we are convinced that politicians will never come to anything .
We believe that polements --
&#91; Applausers &#93; not are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and perhaps we are the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month our site has to 35 million visits .
156 countries transmit our television channel .
Our magazines are leaving from millions .
Our work is traveling in the ethnosh to bring our public in places in places of cultural wonders from which will go away from how much of cultural reveal as they saw and , hopefully , abbracing for time to the central revealing for the central reveal of the world in a life of a life in a world of a life in a world pluralist and multicultural world in a world of a life in a world , and we have to find a life in a life in a life in a life in a life in a life in a life in a life in a life in a
where the wisdom of all people can contribute to our collective wisdom .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some of the things I wrote in this book that I hope is called other than you &apos;ve heard and I &apos;m going to try to highlight some links , in the case you don &apos;t notice them .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the official dogma . &quot;
The dogma official what ?
The dogma official society of all societies . The dogma official society . The dogma official , &quot; If we want to male the well-being of our citizens . &quot;
The reason is , on one hand , in fact that liberty is itself a value , is precious , useful , essential for human beings .
On the other hand , in fact that if we are free , each of us can act to do everything that massized our well-being , no one that &apos;s going to our well-being , no one of deciding in our name .
The way to massively freedom is massized choice .
More choices , more choices are more free , and the more is their freedom , the higher of their well-being .
This , I think , is so deeply roadicated in society that nobody would be going to put it in a doubt .
And it &apos;s also rowed in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m going to allow me a simple note about the conditions to go .
In my supermarket is 1775 conditions , without contacting the 10 variety of olive olive oil and 12 acres that you can buy for a huge amount of conditions in the circumstance of the concrements in the circles that one of the 175 of your degree .
Here &apos;s what the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic store to buy a stereo -- cases , CD reader , radio , plasks , lifer , light bull .
And in this single store , there &apos;s a great number of audio components .
We can do six and a half million combinations using the components that there are in a store .
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice .
Other fields : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all the telephones that were desire to be able to be mad that were proved by mom Bell .
They were noleggiant the phone , you didn &apos;t buy it .
One of this , between the other , was that the phone was not going to break .
These times they went .
We now have a almost illimited phones of the phone , especially between cell phones .
Here &apos;s cell phones .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 cuts , cuts them in the nose , and forth for the kitchis , and forth for the kropelt .
If you don &apos;t even have it seen in the store under home , you &apos;re very soon to get .
And what &apos;s the end of the end is that people come into the store and they do this question , you know what the answer ? The answer is &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t make any way .
So , in other ways of life that are much more important aquatic aquician , you can see the same explosion choice .
Without there : no healthcare : not the world in the United States that you go from the doctor and doctor you &apos;re saying what you have to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; Okay , we could do A , or B &quot; Okay , we could do A , and these risks &quot; What do you do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Doctor , what should I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A has these benefits , and B has these benefits , and B has these benefits . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebat , &quot; Doctor if she was me , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result we call it autonomy of the malated , &quot; expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But , it &apos;s not that you can move the weight and responsibility for making a decisions of somebody knows something , which is the doctor , to somebody else who knows -- and almost certainly not -- and almost , eventually , and so it doesn &apos;t know -- and it &apos;s not the ide-making decisions of the patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing of products , direct to people like me and you , who , if you think about it doesn &apos;t make any sense , because we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy it , why do we advertising them ?
The answer is that they want to ask them to ask them to ask them to ask them to change the recipe .
And what &apos;s like this is our identity is about choice , as we &apos;re seeing in this vignet . We don &apos;t want to force kids . And they &apos;re not going to forze children . I &apos;m going to forze children . I don &apos;t want to get it to invent .
And we can reinventing how many times it would be .
which means that every morning , at the riskin , you have to decide what kind of person want to be .
I &apos;m going to the family and the matririmony , a time time the common perspective , almost for anyone , was that there was that there was a lot of time , and it started to get the most soon possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and even what to do after .
So , it &apos;s really to play .
I teach students very smart students , and I &apos;m 20 percent in less of work than a time .
And not because they &apos;re not bright , because they &apos;re not cheaper , they &apos;re not so much .
but why am I imthouse , you mean to ask , &quot; should I get married or not ? ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ I should do it now ? &quot;
&quot; Should I get away later ? I have to think before children or the career ? &quot;
They &apos;re logoring .
And they &apos;re trying to answer these questions , even though this implement not complete the exchange that I teach and not get a great voice to my exam .
And they have to really do it . They &apos;re important questions .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , as Carl underer , because the technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from the Randph Randph .
And in the parententesthesis , and I &apos;m not going to say to anybody , where the WiFi Fi works .
I don &apos;t say that , because I want to use it .
What does this incredible liberal choice of we have about work ? Is it that we have to continually decide , continually at every time , if we have to work or not .
We can go to our son playing hot , with the cell phone in a pocket , Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , typically , on the knees .
And even though they &apos;re all spending , every minute we see our son to reovate the game , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; I have to answer this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? I have to email this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is no , all this makes the experience of your son very different partner than what would be in other conditions .
So , anywhere we look at , small things , and big things , life is a question of choice .
Once the world was this : White , there were some possibility , but it wasn &apos;t all about choice .
The world today looks like this : The dilemma is , &quot; Is it a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is .
So the positive positive we all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative .
All this choice comment two effects of people .
The first , paradoxically , is that produced paradoxysis that it &apos;s paradoxysis that it makes paradoxygen .
And so many options between which choose , becomes very hard to do it .
I give you a significant example : a study of the voluntary depensive plans .
A colleague had access to Vanguard data , the gigantic company , the gigantic society , with about a million clients .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offering in more , the percentage of adhesion two percent .
With 50 sources offer , there &apos;s 10 percent less of adhesions than when they &apos;re available ?
Because with 50 sources of which choose , is sick to decide , and choice is replaced to indomans .
And tomorrow , and tomorrow , tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course tomorrow .
You know , you know , it doesn &apos;t mean only that these old workers will eat for the dog , because they &apos;re not going to have enough money , they also want to say that the decision is so unexpected to work .
They &apos;re not participating , they &apos;re losing to five dollars from work dator dator , which would be so disposed to be .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think that makes the world like this .
&quot; And to end , for ethernity : ketchup , or maionese send ? &quot;
Would you like to make the right decision , if it &apos;s for ethernity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong bottom , and yet the condition of the wrong thing .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even though we can avoid the parallel and do choice , at the end , we &apos;re less satisfacts of how we would have been with less options .
And that for several reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions that they choose , if you buy one and not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could do a different choice that would be better . And what &apos;s the alternative . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us to be better . And what &apos;s the alternative is that the imagined by the decision , and the reaching reavated by the decision , and the reaching ,
even when it was a very good decision .
More choice choice , there are more , the easier of any detail that it &apos;s insatisfaction .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert : very well stamp as the value of things that we give things depends on what we &apos;re council .
And the rest of the option , when there are many options , it &apos;s easy to represent the characteristics of download and be less sationally , you know , the option of the option that you have to have a choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m sorry with everybody who are not New York .
But that &apos;s what you probably think .
There &apos;s this couple of the Hamptons .
A place of luxury .
It &apos;s all for them . Otma day . It &apos;s all for them .
It doesn &apos;t miss anything . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , eventually , it &apos;s August . &quot;
&quot; All my neighbors in Manhattan are away . &quot;
&quot; I could parked right in front of the house . &quot;
And it goes to two weeks assild from the idea that &apos;s losing -- every day -- the ability to parking of where it wants .
The costo-an opportunity decrew the soddisfation for what we have , even when choice was excellent .
And the more of the options we have to look at , the more actual acities that will be constitute to be costo-opportunities .
Here &apos;s another example .
This vignet tells us a lot .
It &apos;s about living the moment , and perhaps slowly .
But the most important point is that whatever you choose , you can &apos;t do the other .
The things that we don &apos;t choose to attract that can make less attractive what we do .
Thiral point : the growing spiral of expectations .
I tried to my skin bought a new jeans .
I &apos;m always about always jeans .
Once the jeans were just like , bought them and they were bought and clothing , they were displayed , just after they took them a life and they were all good times , they started to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple of new when the old people were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
The committed me , &quot; You want to slim fit , relaxed fit ? &quot;
You want them to do it or with the buttons ? &quot; Stonewashed &quot; or &quot; acidane &quot;
&quot; You want to weird ? &quot;
&quot; You know , you want to bat them ? Bla bla , &quot; Continupright them .
I was salkin , and after a while I could say , &quot; I want the guy that was the only guy . &quot; It didn &apos;t know what it was , so for an hour , I went out from all the sick , jeans , and then out of the jeans , and I came out of the jeans , and I came out of the jeans who ever had .
It was the most . I had the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse about is that with all of my choice , and my expectations were altissue , jeans had to be perfect .
I had a little expectations . I didn &apos;t expect anything that was when there was a kind of a great , but when I saw 100 different , accidents , at least a kind of a perfect way .
What I had been bought , but not perfect .
After I was compared to what I was trying to do was I was really insatisfacted to expectations .
The addition of options in people &apos;s life don &apos;t make the expectations that have respect to excellence of the options themselves .
And this will produce less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
No one in the world of marketing if it makes it .
Because if they knew , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more like this .
&quot; It was better when you were worse when you were worse was worse when you were worse was even even even even even even even even even even even even meet .
So , in the world where we live in -- opulents , industrialized citizens with the expectancy -- the most of the expectancy of perfeature -- the most of the expectations .
You never surprised to pleasant because your expectations , my expectations , they have been ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Baxative &quot; Yes , you want it . &quot;
I mean -- I &apos;m a little authographical moment -- which I &apos;m really married and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t have a content .
But , you know , it &apos;s not a bad thing .
And finally , a result of the jeans to buy a couple of jeans when there is just that you have that kind of jeans is that when you &apos;re not satisfied , and you ask , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot; , the answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What would I do ?
When you have hundreds of jeans , and you buy a insoddisfacing , and ask you who is the responsible , it &apos;s just as well as the responsible for you .
You could have done better .
With hundreds of available varieties , there are no excuse for success .
So when people make decisions , even though the result is valid , you feel insation and give the cold to them and give the cold to them .
In the last few years , depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this wave of depression is just that people have deludent experiences because standards are too much .
And when they have to explain this situation they think the blame is them .
So the result is that we &apos;re better , we &apos;re better , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the dogma , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely fake . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit of choice , but it &apos;s not a lot of choice , but from this didn &apos;t go to a lot better choice .
There &apos;s a critical value , I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve overcome from a piece of the level where the choices are improving our life .
Now , from a political standpoint -- I have almost finished -- from the political view of the peanch is the following .
What it allows all this to the industrial society is wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know about it , where the problem is not that they have choice .
The problem is that they have too bad .
So the thing I &apos;m talking about is a sick of modern , reathetic society , reathetic society .
And what it does , and angry and angry is this : Steve Levitt talked to you yesterday about how the expensive and comfortable seats are not useful . It &apos;s a money .
I mean these choices , complicated and dispensive , it &apos;s not that they &apos;re just ineless .
I &apos;m a deleterie .
They &apos;re doing a worse .
If a little bit of what we do is that in our society allows a lot of choice , not would be able to make it better , but also our our life .
This is what economists call a lot of improvement .
A redistribution of income redistribution of all -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in the most of this choice .
So to conclude , you can be everything you want . &quot;
You , people of culture , you &apos;ll think , &quot; But what does that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t get anything in a glass . &quot;
&quot; A rantrade imagination , a limited view of the world --
and I &apos;m really really interpret it .
But then , I realized , I &apos;m sure that that fish knows the long long .
Because the reality is that if you &apos;re missing in frantumes , so that you can &apos;t have the freedom , you can &apos;t get the freedom . You get the parallel .
If you break the mouth so that everything you can decrease soddisfation .
You get the paralysis , and you reduce the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too strange , perhaps for us for fish , and certainly certainly certainly for us .
But the absence of a few sphere , is a recipe for inhappiness and I &apos;m thin for the rovine .
Thank you very much .
