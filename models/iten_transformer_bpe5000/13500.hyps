Last year I showed these slides to demonstruggle that glacial calm , which for almost three million years had the size of the 48 , the size of the 48 United States continental , it &apos;s reflected for 40 percent .
But , you have this underlying the gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t exhibition of ice .
The artica glacial artica is , in a sense , the heart of global climate system .
It &apos;s expanded up and you have a testing .
The next few weeks will be a remarkable remarkable , the next 25 years .
The glaciers are signed in red .
As you see , you &apos;re going to go up to the blue ,
That &apos;s the ice in inverse , which retreating of summer .
You can see that the ice costs , five years or more , is like the blood , which here forified of the body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been from so ,
This is a problem because the rewarming of interests , the glaciers around the ocean , where there are enormous amount of fuels that , smooth , where there are , they turned into meters .
I &apos;m going to get to the total of atmospheric ination to global warming , that can doubling , that point of not return .
In some lagues in Alaska metan is already rebuling from water .
The professored Katey Walter &apos;s University of Alaska team , and it &apos;s a very low team .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You &apos;re good . The question is if we &apos;re also going to be it .
A reason is that this exist termal exchange the Groenland from northermal .
This is a river at regimes .
The one had never reached levels .
This is the Kangerlussuaimed in the southern West .
If you want to know how it is the level of sea for the flight on land , it &apos;s where the sea .
These currents are increasing .
On the other side of the planet : Antarcttica , the largest ice of ice ice on the planet .
The last month , scientists have been dilightle that the ice of ice is in negative , and that the Western Antarctttle , is particularly in some of the sub-sun , is particularly in the sun .
It &apos;s about six meters at the level of the planet , like in Groenland .
Sulle Himalaya , the third largest block-ice ice , you see new lagues , which a few years ago , they were glaciers .
40 percent of the world was the half of the world &apos;s water from the sevent .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of water .
The ported is increased .
But when he demines , the same happens to water .
In California , the snow on the Sierra Nevada is demined of 40 percent .
The hydrothern stands in crisis .
The previous previous previous .
The growing sure in the world is leads to a remarkable increase in the world .
The environmental disaster are increasing out of the normal and without the previous .
Four times more than in the last 30 years I was in the last 30s .
This is a place of all insustainable .
If you look at the historical context , you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we had added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the time , the Pacific area , the Americans , from the Americans , to the west continent , where there &apos;s a radical radical radical stretched in the ocean .
The greatest causes of global warming , together to the forestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossils .
The oil is a problem , and the fuel is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with more emissions , together to China .
And it was to build a lot of other central central central .
But we &apos;re seeing a change of direction .
These are the annullayers in the last years and some alternative of the real alternative .
At any way , there &apos;s a political length in our country .
The industrial industrial and oil have speses 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the fuels , which is a very doult .
And that was reminded me something --
Veras Natal , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a loss of 3.8 billion liers of the fuel of coal fourth .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the second big flusband of the big flow of the world in America .
It &apos;s happened around Natal .
The advertising of one of the industrial industrial industrial .
Video : See , the carbon . It &apos;s a kind of allegror .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and grow our economy .
It &apos;s always more clean . It &apos;s more clean .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and the work work .
Al Gore : From this is a lot of the West Virginia .
The larger society is Massey , the largest society is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : I &apos;m going to be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosis , Harry Reid , don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alance for the Clima Prottion of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is a part .
Video : Attore : The ALergy : We see the climate change as a serious weird .
For this priorities is to invest a huge amount of money in a very high , and confused to make advertary and confused the truth on the fuel .
In fact , the fuel is not sports .
We think it &apos;s clean -- it &apos;s also a good profumo .
So , not preocuption of climate change .
Let me go .
Video : Attore : The Clone . You &apos;ve heard about it .
So let &apos;s do a lot of a lot of structure at the avanating structure for how fuel fuel is .
Stricicks ! The machines are a little rumorous , but this is the sound of the fuel technology of the fuel technology .
The fuel consumer is between the major causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology that you see changed everything .
You have a look at : this is the odiern technology .
Al Gore : Inally , the positive alternative is connects to economic issue and the national security .
Video : The America is in crisis in crisis ; the national security crisis .
The filter that the link is : our dependence from fossils , as the fuels of fossils , like the sports and oil imported .
Now , there &apos;s a new , audgmented solution for using it .
Really , 100 percent clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to reach America to work , make us more safe , and help stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that basts to solve our problems .
Really , America . You &apos;re more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It &apos;s about reducing energy to America .
One of the faster ways of reach to get to dependence from the fuels that killing our planet .
Comparsa : The future is here . I feel , a new energy .
Even 2 : 2 : Nggers investing for well-retribes .
Complant : Really , America . It &apos;s time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old old proverbio African says , &quot; If you want to go fast , go from solers .
If you want to go away , you go together . &quot;
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
LHC : LHC : LHC :
And promises to return to back to you to how the car works .
So , what the other time was there . And for those other time , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever tried -- 27 kilometers of circles .
His task is to rear the conditions that were at least least a billion ardest of the first first of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
Everything is just ambious .
This is the car under Ginevra .
We did , we have these mini-Big Bang in the relevers .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- is a candand-meters and it has a diameter diameter diameter .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions .
The 10 secember of last year , we have acceso the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken from ATLATLAS .
It was because of immense festhate in in control .
It &apos;s a picture of particles that had done all around the LHC , entring in the HC , entring in collision , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles in the relever .
In other words , when we see that the 10 secember , we realized that the machine worked , which is a great vitty .
I don &apos;t know if it was going to do more optips or this , when somebody went on Google and saw that the front page was this .
That means we have a cultural impact beyond that scientific impact .
It &apos;s about a week later , there was a problem with the car , had just to these films here -- these films .
These films take 13,000 ampes when the car works at the very very well .
Now , the technicians between you will look at the films and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . They &apos;re not true . They &apos;re too good . &quot;
And instead can do it because when they &apos;re very cold to become the costs of the superconducucucuctations .
So , at least 271 degrees , at a nurse temperature in the stars , these films can bring that current .
In one of the giunture between the most novemyle in the LHC , there was a defof factoration .
So , the films will be slightly , and the 13,000 ampampes suddenly met a electrical resistance .
This was the outcome .
Now , this is still more impressive if you think that these magnetic magnees more than 20 tons , and that they have been moving about 30 centimeters .
They go to 50 magnetic magnetic .
We had to take them , what we did .
We have repristinted and wells .
They &apos;re going back to all their place underground .
LHC will be new integror .
We &apos;re going to accounts , and we expect to get the data , and continuing so our adventure to see what are the morning that we &apos;re going to find out what the universe is .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents reach accidents , and engineering of the science and engineering frontier . It &apos;s easy to refuture .
I think that &apos;s so difficult , the fact to go beyond the limits , I think it &apos;s the value of things like LHC .
I &apos;d like to end with the words of a scientist Ingloriphddancy , which , I guess , in the defense of inutionary inutiutionary in his fense , his own own own own own own . It &apos;s just dangerous for the progress of human mind as the human mind as the human mind as the refairly , which is not there are no way of the human mind . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start asking to rethink about when you , you play , you play with the morning .
And as you get them and make them , and you get them , and move them , and move , you learn to think and respect them , and reflying spatial spatial relations .
The spatial reasoning is connected to the way we understand much part of the world around us .
So , from the useful information that is the useful of our interaction with physical objects , together to my consultant , and in my collaborator , and at my collaborator Jeevan Kalii , I started asking , &quot; And if when we use a computer , instead of having the only treor of the mouse as a digit , which is to be require to a digit , we can have to get up with both hands with both hands with both hands , with both hands of your hands hands ,
and fix it ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable , is a great computer computer as a bisceight .
In a few words , a Siftable , is a great computer computer as a bisceight .
You can move with the hand , they can see them with your hand , you can see them , and they have a screen and a wireless radio wireless .
But overwhelmed , like the morning morning , like the morning morning , you can move them .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem , instruments to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physicists , aware of the movement , and as as they become more physicists , and as they become more physicists , aware of the movement , of how we can move , we can explore new and how we can explore new and interaction .
I &apos;m going to try to do with some simple example .
This Siftable is configuring to show video : if you incline it in a direction , the video will rophs so , if you &apos;re going to go back .
These interactive react you are aware of the other .
If you affize them , you &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re around .
If they &apos;re surrounce , they notice and they can act a little bit .
If they &apos;re surrounce , they notice and they can act a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We realized that one of the interesting interesting implications was the way to use of the interaction was able to use common gescape on data , for example , &quot; a color like if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configuring out how you &apos;re going to use them to use them to use it to use it to be a color in the central , where you get missing .
and I can use them to use them to put color in that central , where you get .
If we &apos;re too , we can put a little bit of place .
And you also have beautiful possibility of learning , like the languages , like the languages , the mathematics and games where people can try and see the immediately results .
Now , I &apos;m --
This is a Fibonacks that I do with a equation program .
Here we have a words that is in half between Scarabeers and Boggle .
Of course , at every turning a letter to every Siftable on every Siftable , at every turning a letter in the case on every Siftable , and while you &apos;re trying to understand he &apos;s going to do it .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you know , and you have a new set of trying to try and new possibility .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the kids came up to the Media Lab , I did it in a way that I tried to try and turned a video .
They liked very much .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
You just say , &quot; You know , &quot; How words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s other people who try it .
This is our Tibeta tester , there &apos;s the younger , there &apos;s the right .
It was actually wanted to be impllaries .
They were only morning , for him .
Now , this is a very interactive .
We wanted to build a tool for learning . He &apos;s Felix . He &apos;s Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , solving the Siftable .
It can put new characters in the scene , solving the Siftable .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : The Sun is sister .
David Merrill : Now , he took a treatment in the scene .
Video : The arange treatment .
Bel work !
So , you shake the Sifttle and put them close to interact the characters .
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing their story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide he as you go .
DM : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide he as you go .
Video : Vola away , gat .
DM : The last example I have the time to show is a tool , and to try and execting music .
It &apos;s a tool , and to get music .
The Siftable here are sounds like basic , and the battery .
Each one of these four different variations , and you can choose which use .
You can also put these sounds on a sequence to comcompose your pleases .
And it just just by doing touch a sound , &quot; and a sequence . &quot;
These are actually you can control from alive , like the revers and the filter .
The acks to a particular sound and then incline for the wider .
And then there are general effects as time and volume , which are appliances to the whole sequence .
Let &apos;s look like .
DM : DM : We &apos;re going to try and put a base base in two basic sequence , &quot; sequence , &quot; we put it in a series , we add , we add to a series , we adding other basic basic .
Now , I put a bottom line .
Video : Now I &apos;m going to add percussions --
DM : And now I &apos;m going to put the filter on the battery , so I can control the effect of the vivious .
DM : DM : I can reach the whole sequence , inclining the whole sequence of time .
Video : And now I &apos;m going to add the bottom to the bottom to give up the bottom to the bottom of the bottom to give more expression .
Video : DM : I can remelt the sequence of the volo . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to plan it before , but I can suddenly , make it more , make it more , and it &apos;s more corport .
And now , I can smoke the whole sequence of inclining on the left Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to make new interfaces as as they work as the brain work and more as they work as our brain .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this lack , and also some possibility that we try to get out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmate is that we &apos;re going to take this new generation of things that we want to interact with the digital media , which will be information in our world .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the hour of talking to all of you .
I &apos;m a scritual .
I &apos;m going to write a profession , but it &apos;s more of this , obviously .
It &apos;s also love and the love of my life .
And I don &apos;t look like it .
But , he said , something particular happened in my life and my career in my life and my career , which brought me to report the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I &apos;ve been wrote this book , this book called &quot; Mangia , Prega , &quot; which , &quot; which , in fact , for some reason , and I became a great sensational sensational , for some reason came out in the world and became a great sensors , well-smos .
And the result is that everywhere , people are now , people treat me as if I was conducted .
It &apos;s true -- conducted , conducted !
They were going to be now , and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t have fear to do that ?
You don &apos;t have fear to write all life without being able to be able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can importt someone ? &quot;
Would you care about someone ? &quot;
It &apos;s roughly , you know .
But it could go worse , in part of that I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a scritation .
I would go up to the same reaction .
And people say , &quot; Don &apos;t you feel that I couldn &apos;t have succeed ?
You don &apos;t have feed that the loser of refts you ?
You don &apos;t have fear to do this to be all the life without anything that &apos;s ever out and die on a cumil , and they die on a cumle with the mouth of failure .
So , you know .
The first answer is -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
Yeah , I feed all those things .
I always had a landscape .
And I also have a lot of other things that people can &apos;t ininary .
And as the algae and other things .
But , as I thought , and I thought I thought , and I would ask me , why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logical that anybody who would have to wait from a work that you &apos;re sent for a job that you feel sent to do .
But what &apos;s there so particular in the creative implant imming , as a mental health care in a way that other career , so that other carring don &apos;t they ?
As my dad , for example , he was a chemicals and I don &apos;t remember one time in his 40 years of activity , what he was asked if it landscape , he was asked if it landscape ?
She never had to -- that block of the John John , how would it go ?
So , it wasn &apos;t it worked that , you know ?
Only , the chemicals like a group don &apos;t have , in the centuries , in the centuries , the reputation of being alcolized depressed .
We have a writers , we have enough enough , and not just creativity and not only creatives , but creatives of all kinds of that , we have this reputation of being enormously .
And it &apos;s not going to look at the trad of the triste of the magnifies that , only in the 20th century , they die and often .
And also those who are not sicidated seem to be really disappeared by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before I die , in the last interview said , &quot; Every book has killed me a little bit more , &quot; A amazing air of the work of their life .
But we don &apos;t give you when we feel it because we heard these things so much , and we heard of these things , so we &apos;re completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and the suffering are in a very link and that art , at the end , will always be at the angososccles .
And the question I want to ask all of the question , is , you agree with this idea ?
It &apos;s good for this thing -- because it &apos;s also looking at it for a little distance to me not well for anything that support .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous , and I don &apos;t want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better encourage our great creative creative , living .
And I think , in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start to fire to start to fire , overhimself , especially , you give the circumstances in my career .
That &apos;s true -- you look , they &apos;re pretty young , I &apos;m pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I still have about four work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely to write about now , and then it &apos;s going to be judicted by the world as the work that came out after the world , as the last book .
I &apos;m going to be slaved , because we &apos;re all more or less friends here -- is the most successful .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know , this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start dying in morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would keep going to do this work that we love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so , I think , after a lot of reflective reflective , which is to work to be able to write is that to create a psychological protective , OK ?
I have to find a way of find a distance of security between me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural natural natural advanced , and I &apos;d try and , and , as I &apos;d try to look through the time , trying to find other societies to see if they could have have better ideas and more seemed ideas and more seemed ideas and more seemed ideas and more seemed ideas . And I &apos;m trying to find more and more searing ideas .
how to help people have to manage the unerents risks of creativity .
And that research me brought to the ancient Great and ancient Rome .
I do do that , because I &apos;m a gira and then go back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity sell creativity sell creativity sell creativity sell creativity .
And it thought the creativity was this spirit looks like , and that they came out to men from a few surprising and unknown .
The Greeks called these spirits .
His , wonderful , wonderful , believed to have a demon that elargive .
The Romans were in the same idea , but they call that the spirit species without a genius .
The great , because the Romans were not really thought that a genius was a particularly intelligent .
They believe that a genius was this kind of divine entity that was literally in the walls of a neighborhood , a little bit like an artist , a little bit of how the elevent is , and to model the work of the artist and model the outcome of that work .
Here , eonal -- here , that &apos;s the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological construct that you protect from your work .
And everybody knew it was so that it worked , right ?
So , the artists were protected by certain things , like the too narcism , not ?
If your work was exciting , you couldn &apos;t take it all the deserve , all of the deserve , everybody knew that he was helped by this genius .
If your own failed work , it was not all your body , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a incapable .
And so people han concept of creativity in the Western for a long time .
And then the Rensed , and everything changed , and we go to , and we put the human being at the center of the universe over all of the universe over all of the world and so so we let the detail , and more to let the creatures of the divinity .
This is the principle of humanity and people started thinking about creativity came out of the idividduo .
And for the first time in history , you start to reference this artist , or that artist as a genius that artist as a person with the genius .
And I have to tell you , I think that was a big mistake .
I think that I hope to allow someone , a simple person to believe that I think it &apos;s a recipe , the essence and the sisters of all the divines , unknown and the sisters of the divines , and etheless , and etheless , a very very big thing to give to the fragile pliant that human .
It &apos;s how to ask someone to ingoate the sun .
It &apos;s detains completely completely the ego and create all of these ingestible .
And I think it was the pressed artists in passed .
And , if that &apos;s true , and I think it &apos;s , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do it diversously ?
We &apos;re going to go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t get 500 years of thought in a 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience who would be legitimed to be connected to the notion of , insusum , you do , they follow people are going to do it .
So , it &apos;s probably not going to convince you all about this thing .
But the question I &apos;d like to ask is -- why not ?
Why don &apos;t you think about this way ?
Because it has more sense of anything else that ever heard to explain the exasperating imprevehability of the creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever tried to do something -- so , so , basically , all here , you don &apos;t know .
And , in fact , it can look completely paranorsics .
I did this against recent , with extraordinary poetse Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but that was a poetry for all life and said that during his childhood in the Virginia , and he felt it , in the camps , and he felt it , in the camps , and he felt it , in the front of the landscape .
He said , it was like a fagorous train .
And he came up to her from the landscape .
And it felt it , because he did it could be the land under his feet .
He knew that point to do at that point and he was , words , &quot; to go like a match . &quot;
And so , so , then , then , and it was followed by this poetry , and not had to take a piece of paper and a math , and a math , and a fairly fairly , and he &apos;s got it up and mistake it on the page .
And sometimes , I couldn &apos;t be fast enough , so correcrecent and correcrecing without to be able to go home and poetry and go and poetry and go and he lost it through the landscape , and she would continued to roll through the landscape , trying to , how she said , &quot; another poetry , and reflightle through the landscape , and she said , &quot; another poetry . &quot;
And then there were the time -- this is not the size I &apos;m going to be -- there were moments in which was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was going to be running and the poetry and the poetry and the poetry through , and he said , he was like the one of the time he was going , and then he said , he was like the housing .
And he was the poetry from the tail and reach it in his body and transced on the page .
And in these cases , poetry would be presented on the perfect page , and intact , but at the last word at the first word .
So when I felt -- it &apos;s pazes , it &apos;s exactly the same as a creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conducucucucucucture .
I &apos;m a mud mud , and my way to work is ; I wake up to the same orar every day and go up up up .
But even I &apos;m landing , in my testles , I strike up against that thing , sometimes .
And I guess also a lot of you , the han made .
You know , even though the work and ideas came to me from a certain source of the source , I could not honestly know .
And what is this ?
And how can we relate to it in a way to do not get us to lose the head , but , rather , that &apos;s going to be stay ?
And as I think about , the best example I have is the best , I have the Tom Waits , which I interviewed that I &apos;ve interviewed that I &apos;m in a journal .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life was the incarnation of the same time , trying to control , to control , management these species of impulse creativity .
But then I said , he was hot , and he was driving on a day , he was driving on a highway in Los Angeles , he changed everything for him .
It was going to be fast and everything was a little bit of a melodia , which comes in his head as inspiration , and the wire , and the willing , and the desiddle , and the desiddle , and the desider , but it doesn &apos;t know how to take it .
It doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , not have a math , it doesn &apos;t have a recorder .
So he started to feel this kind of old anxiety of growing in him , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to go up with this song even even even ements .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to go into the panic , you stop .
It &apos;s going to put the whole mental process and made something completely new .
He just looked at the sky and said , &quot; Sweet , don &apos;t you see that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Would it look at a song now ?
If you really want to exist , you go back to a more time when I can take care of you .
Altrain , you &apos;re going to care about someone else today .
You have to disturbing Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And the work process started changed after this .
Not the work , the work was still hoscure as always as .
But the process , and the fish , the anxiety was reduced when the genius , the genius who came up with the genius that came out of the grandmother else that problems and freed it back to the other problems and go back , where it was , and he was doing it , and hurged .
but it &apos;s well-lack , wonderful bizarre , wonderful bizarre , collaboration between Tom and this strian thing that strian and that strig that was not Tom .
So , how I felt that story about to change a little bit of changing the way I was working and she saved me once .
This idea , I &apos;d save when I was writing , &quot; Prega , &quot; Am , &quot; and fall in a one of those disperation that we &apos;re all working on something and we &apos;re going to think that &apos;s going to be a disaster , and you start thinking that will be a worst book .
Not just good , right the worst book wrote .
And I started thinking about glue this project .
But then I remember Tom I talked to the air , and I tried to get us .
So , I get my face on the manoscritical and I would say to my comments to a vacuum corner .
And I said to high voices , &quot; Somebody , what if this book is not going to be so much not going to be a little bit of my , no ?
Because I &apos;m going to see , I &apos;m going to do that .
So if you want to be better , you have to have to show you and do your part .
Okay . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , I don &apos;t do it .
I &apos;ll just go to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I would like to please that I was recorded for me to do my part , &quot; Because , at the end is so , OK -- centuries ago in the deserts of the North Africa of the people were dance , dances and music that went on for hours and and and sacred music that went on for hours .
And they were always magnifts , because the ballerers were professional and they were fantastic .
But every one , I sweet , something happened , and one of these artists became actually transcendent .
And I know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know that you have seen all , at a certain point , a performance .
It was like the time , you &apos;re standing in the middle of a porter and it was not doing anything else else else , it was not doing anything else else else else , but everything was going to be done .
And suddenly , it &apos;s just like a human .
But it accounts from the divinity in the fire of divinity .
And when this happened , the time , people knew what was , they called it .
They were going to fly , &quot; Allah , &quot; Allah , &quot; Allah , Allah , God , &quot; God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Spages , when the Mors invasing the Spagna , I was the Spagna , preserved this ables with them and the ready to go from the damage , Allah , Allah , Allah , &quot; and the way , &quot; which you can still feel in the corries or in the flamenco .
In Said , when a artist did something impossible and magical , &quot; Allah , I do magical , &quot; Allah , I &apos;m going to do , &quot; uncomcomcomcompreable , &quot; uncomcomfortable , &quot; uncomcomcomcomable , &quot; unable , &quot; unable , &quot; Allah , &quot; Agna , &quot; Alah , &quot; Oh , I mean , &quot; Allah ,
And it &apos;s great because we need .
But , the problem comes the day , for the dancy , when you see , when you see daughter and find that are the 11 in the morning of Martedday and the last God is there .
It &apos;s just a very bad bad to the ginocres , and maybe it &apos;s not going to be more to each other to that althetic .
And maybe no one will dg the name of God still while a gira , and what &apos;s going to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most porose to do in a creative life .
But maybe not have to be so corresponse to be so if you can &apos;t believe , advanced , which the most extraordinary aspects of your being being from yourself .
But just believe that you have been given to a unimaginable source of this team from a unimaginable inimaginable to your life that team is , you have to get something else when you &apos;re finished .
And , you know , if we think about this way .
And so I started thinking about , and it &apos;s certainly as as I thought about about the different months in the working of the book that I &apos;m going to work on the book that I &apos;m going to think , the danger of my great success .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel electrized by this is , not having fear .
Not at you . It &apos;s just your work .
His , I &apos;m going to show you for your part , any can be .
If your work is dancing , you &apos;re dancing ,
If the divine , it &apos;s aburd to you decide to leave some wonderful wonderful , for a few of wonderful wonderful , for a only time through your forced , then , &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Otherwise , you do the same dance .
And &quot; &quot; I mean , &quot; at you .
I think it &apos;s about it .
&quot; Oh , &quot; I mean , even only for having a human love and testles to have a testation and testals to you &apos;re continuously .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects on the human genome , what can mean and the discovery of new set .
Now we &apos;re starting a new new path : we started digitize biology and now start to digitize the digitional code , we &apos;re going into a new fase of biology , designing and synthzing .
We always tried to ask big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists , I think they have tried to understand various levels .
We tried different approaches , reducing it to the minimes .
We &apos;re digitizing by nearly 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the analogical world of the computer world .
Now , we ask : can we regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome that can authoreplication in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome for creart a little bit of them .
We can get to eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 that are here .
But when we &apos;re looking at his metabolic map , is relatively simple than our own .
It &apos;s just a simple .
But when we look at all genes that we can eliminate , one at time , it &apos;s very unlikely to do that this can bring a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to design was synthesizing this chromosome in a way to get to change the components to take some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of &quot; Can we synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Can you have the chemistry conform these great molecules that we never did before ?
And , in case , we can make a chromosome ?
A cromosome is just a piece of chemical material .
The speed that we &apos;re able to digitize life is growing .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , they &apos;re going to be able , but it &apos;s better .
And our most recent results the results of a curve .
We started more about 15 years ago .
The process has required , by starting with a bioethical review before we start the first experiments .
But we found that we synthze in DNA is very difficult .
There are thousands of cars in the world that produce small segment of DNA , the long long fighth , and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the most errors are .
So we had to develop a new way to assembling these fragments and ret the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , to start by digital information genome of Phi 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that killers .
We designed the framments , actually , in the mistakes and get a molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material , and we put it into bacteria , and we put it into bacteria in the bacteria , they started reading this genetic code and produce the viral particles .
The viral particles were reduced by cells , they &apos;re back back and they &apos;re destroyed .
I talked about recent with members of the oil industry industry industry , they have certainly understood this model .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build his same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in big .
We wanted to build the whole cromosome .
They &apos;re more than 580 middability .
So we thought we &apos;re building it in casses of the size of the viruses of viruses , so that we can change the components of a living .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the first time in 1995 , the same same thing .
We found , resequenced , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence we had never been able to do it .
A part of the process is design for long as 50 letters that you can overcome with all the other segments of 50 letter to build more small substantiity to do more small , working together .
We &apos;re going to do unicians here .
You probably have read that we put in the flightle .
So , think that : We have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , Gs and T.
Three of those letters together , with codify about 20 amminoacids , and there &apos;s a specific specific specific order to letter for every amminoacids .
So we can use the genetic code for words , frass , thoughts .
What we did at the beginning was authograised .
Some have been delusers from the fact that it was not poetry .
We designed these segments to do just unning with the enzyme .
There are much of them reparate and put them together .
And we started assembling parts , by by by five to seven mix , to seven mix , unendles in a way to form segers in a way to form segers , and we &apos;re going to get to 72 .
So , we have made these segments in abundance , so that we can sequencing them , because we &apos;re trying to create a very robust -- like you &apos;re going to see in a minute .
We &apos;re looking for the process .
So , this looks like the tabellon a basket player .
When we get these segments very long , more than 100 mixes , more than 100 mixes , they won &apos;t grow directly in the Every .
You get to the limits of the modern molecular biology .
So we looked at other mechanisms .
We knew another mechanologist called reomologist romologist , which is useful to repair the DNA to repair the DNA to unt the DNA to unquire the DNA segers .
Here &apos;s a example .
This organism , called Deinoccurred , can be a three million rad rad .
You can see in the high school as the same as his destroyed ssnets like his destroyed .
In 12 , hours , it &apos;s reassembled exactly as it was before .
There &apos;s thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be completely completely .
They can live under vacuum .
They &apos;re absolutely certain life in space , and you have to find new remarkable environments .
At fact , NASA showed that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built using these processes , just using the lieventually design with the segment of the segments to put .
The automatically assemble them .
This image was not taken with a electronic microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It &apos;s a very big molecule that we can see the with a microscope .
These are pictures that they cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the publipublish that we did a little time ago .
They &apos;re more than 580,000 letters .
It &apos;s the largest molecule , which is a definitely created by man .
It &apos;s got a high weight molecular .
If you &apos;re going to be a 10 without spaces , you would like 142 pppage only to transform this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ? How can we do that ?
Of course , you take a virus is a game .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s also the simple thing when it &apos;s about eucarily cells like our : you can just get the nuclear nuclear , and put another , which is basically the process of clonation .
In the bacterium , the chromosome is instead of integrated inside the cell , but we recently demonstrate that we &apos;re able to do a complete trapiating trapiating of a cell to another and active .
We can refed a cromosome from a microbial species .
The two are different as the men from tops .
We add some gene in more way that we could decide what to decide for this chromosome .
And then , it &apos;s skip with the filled to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was studipendo-and appreciate our graph , the new graph is sophisticatoome is in the cell .
And we were thought that we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to get more , but we tried to get more in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms .
We found that tantissim species have added a second or a third chromosome from some part , adding in a second thousands of new traits to that species .
So , who thinks about evolution as a only gene at the time , it has no idea of biology .
There &apos;s been a lot of restrials called &quot; remarkable to make DNA .
The cromosome was in the cell , not one .
The cell phone : The phones that we have put it .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other cromes like , the other seared as material , the masticked , and we found out with only the cell and the new chromosome .
It became blue because of the genes that we put .
And in a short time , all the characteristics of a species are going to be lost , and it turned out of the new species , based on the new software that we put in the new software .
All protects are changed , the members are changed , and when we read the genetic code .
Now , this could seem like genetics , but although , it &apos;s allowing the software we can change things in a very substantial way .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that here is not about genesis -- but progress of the progress of the size of the size of the size of the Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion that will be new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty obvious , when we think we need to do .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion and a half billion people at nillion in the next 40 years .
Right for an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each planet for every existing existing in 1946 , there will be four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find food , and fresh , and fresh , inals and wealth for six billion and a half billion people .
It &apos;s going to be more dying to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion fuels , more than 30 billion barliers , more than 30 billion barliers .
That means percent million barlier a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process of repair , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to realize all the whole carbon emission from these materials that ended materials that end up in the atmosphere .
At the day , because of the science discoveries of science , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the components of the future .
The electronics industry has only a dozen about components , and think about how many different things are solved out .
Our limits here is data data , and our imagination .
Now , we have techniques , because of these synthesization , able to create what we call a combinatory combinatory .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think about processing these 20 million different genes or to try to optimize the processes to produce optimize , new vaccines , we can change , because of a little team , and create more biology molecular biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemical production or fuels , production of ethc vaccines .
This is a few software tool that we &apos;re working to be able to sex and design species at the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t necessarily know how it will be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
Now , we &apos;re focusing on the fourth generation .
You also have seen that extreme from the grain was a hurt experiment .
We have a second , and third generation , which will use enough to be in the zuccher , as the ophers , like the ophers , like the different kinds of butanle .
But the only way that biology can have a great impact without increase the cost of food and limlimestables that would be transform the CO2 in matter , before , so we &apos;re working to design cells that can reach this purpose , and we think we can have the first first coal fuel of the fourth generation in about 18 months .
The solar light combined with CO2 is a metodo--- but in our discoveries in the world , we found different metods .
This is a organism that we described in 1996 .
It &apos;s going to be in the ocean , at about 2,500 meters of the water .
It makes a metan by using hydrogen molecular as a source of energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can ing CO2 , which can easily be transported by your bbees , convert that CO2 in fuel , to drive this process .
So we might think we could be able to increase what the question of &quot; is what the question of &quot; is , &quot; We , versus , versus the whole chcheck is to reflect the whole oil industry .
So , that . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can ?
It would be a major source of energy .
And we &apos;re working on the same metods to create instantly instantly vaccines .
You saw this year with influence , we &apos;re always forget back to a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s about the vaccine .
I think what you can change build combinable vaccines in the anticipe .
Here &apos;s how the future could start seem changing , now , the tree of evolution , accellyating evolution with synthc bacteria , and inend , and ininherherheres , and finally , and ininherheres .
We &apos;re so much like that we have to make people .
Our purpose is to do enough to live enough long to try and make it . Thank you very much .
So , before I &apos;ll just show you , the faster , some fundamental work , some fundamental work , we brought to the Microsoft in follow at a year ago . This is Seadron .
This is a place that you can interact is local at the local level that remoon with a huge amount of visual data .
We &apos;re seeing a lot of digital , with a digital picture with a kind of digital photos with a kind of costears and continue , for a very quickly , we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big is the amount of information that we see , how big they are these collapses of data , or images .
Most of them are common digital photographs , but this for example is a provenient scanning from the Biary of Congress , and reentry in the gamma of the Congress .
It &apos;s not doing any difference because the only thing that limit , the only thing that &apos;s the number of pixels on your screen at any time . It &apos;s also a very flessible architecture .
This is a whole book , it &apos;s not about images .
This is the Casa desolate of Dickens . Every column . Every column .
So , to demonstrate that is , and not of images , we can do something like that , to see that it &apos;s about a real representation of the textbook , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a electronical book .
I don &apos;t recommend it .
This is a more realistic example . This is a number of The Guardian .
Every big image is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you a pleasure and the beautiful experience of read the real carracy , or a daightle , which is a lot of a half a kind of a half a kind of a half a kind of a half .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of The Guardian .
We have a very high resolution , we have a very high high high than that that you use in a normal publish . And we put in the content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even specifictional techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate space on the screen .
We hope that this means to put people in the people , and to get other porcheries , not have to be the most to be need .
Of course , the maps is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say we have to give you in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States , overcome up on a geospatial image of NASA .
So , we &apos;re going to go to something else .
This is actually actually from the websent . You can see it .
This is a project called Photosynth , which is fighting two different technologies .
A is Seadron and the other is a visual research at the same computer . It &apos;s a very interesting computer . A student in Washington , with the help of Steve Seitz , and the help of Steve Szeliski Research . It &apos;s a very , collaboration .
And it &apos;s alive on the web , I &apos;m going to be in Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from a picture to the other and have this kind of experience of the multipil .
But the spatial spatial , the images here has actually a meaning .
The computer algorithms of visualization , they recorded these images together , so that you &apos;re going to reach the reach of the world that you imagine all the next to the Rocciose dog Britass on Montagne Rocciose dog -- you see the elements of a slightly shown of a stable shown of the re-stable .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more spatial spatial .
I want to go directly to one of the original data set of Noah-year-old set out of the previous prototosynth that we did work for the first time the summer time the first time the summer summed the first summer of this technology , the technology , the Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily evidence that we have put in in the website . And it &apos;s not necessarily evident by looking at the environments .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of Nobody Dame More images from Flickr . Badigit . Badigit in Flickr and you get images of these kinds of maglit and then you get images of these things in the maglit and so on . So one of these constitute , which is discovering to be able to keep this model .
So , they &apos;re all images from Flickr and they were all connected to the spatial level in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate in this very simple way .
You know , I &apos;d never thought of end up to work for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratificent to receiver this kind of accounts here .
I think you can see that this is a lot of different kinds of phones of phones , from those phones who are in the professional . It &apos;s a significant number , to the professional .
And if I can , I try and try and look at the most strange .
Many of them are blocked by faces , etc .
So , somewhere there &apos;s a series of photographs -- eccole .
This is a Nobody poster Dame . It &apos;s recorded .
We can go from the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is taking data from the whole memory . This is taking data from the whole memory of the whole memory of visual . And connecting all those data together .
All of those pictures become connected together , more than the sum of the parts .
You have a model of the whole of the earth .
Think about this as a prolungation of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as as people use it , and the people use it , and the vantages to get it with use .
Their pictures are married with metaped with other people .
If someone is the idea of contrast all these sub-Day , my name , my name , my picture of the Nobody cattattattitude , and I can use it as a sudden , and I can use it as ingress , and I can use it as ingress for for for immersed in the space , using the picture of the ross-user social experience . And that metaphor .
Of course , a consequence of all of that are very extremely elaborate . And so , collective , and satellite images , and satellite images , but by satellite images , but by the memory collective .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What your software will be be able to do is that at a certain point , in the next years , all the photographs , all the photographs , and sharks if anybody in the whole world will be connected with ?
BAA : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is basically about it .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the remarkable information is that that many of these images have possible .
As you do a research research for images , you know , you have a sentence and the page on the web has a lot of information about images .
Now , what happens if that picture is connecting all your picture ?
So , the amount of interconnection , and the amount of remarkable , and the amount of remarkable . It &apos;s a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really amazing . It &apos;s really amazing .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the main pleases when you travels and one of the etnogical research is the way to live between who have no forgotten the living between who have seen the old old in the wind , the farmers , the houses , the hoods , the houses , the falls in the wind , and you can get the falls in the ground .
Well , you know , Jaguar , Jaguar traveler over the Via Lattea , or the old Inuit &apos;s still colful in Himalaya , the distinct budget , and the distinces of Dharma , to remind the importance of Dharma , to remind the importance of the Dharm , and that the world that the world we live in a sense , but it &apos;s just a lot of reality ,
The one of a particular set of choices that our stirpe is done , good or bad , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential straightons .
We all all all . We all all all .
We &apos;re subjects to reach .
We have to deal with the inesorability of death , so we don &apos;t smile if we &apos;re not surprising .
We all have an art .
What &apos;s the particular is the particular rhythm of the particular song , the ritual-dance .
It doesn &apos;t care that they &apos;re the Borneo , or the follow of the Voodoo doo of Haiti , or the desert guerries in Kenya , the Curandero , or a cammelt in Kenya , or a cammelliers in the heart of the Sahara .
And he was my company company in desert a month ago , or a month ago , or a month ago , or a hallelter in Qomolangma , on Man . Everest , the dea mother of the world .
All of these populations are teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And , if you reflect a second , is a concept that can give you hope .
Insides , the miriades of cultures are creating a spiritual lands and cultural life that has to have a spiritual life , which is important for the wealth of the planet so as the rich biological roughly notes .
And you can think about this cultural roughly as a ethnosphere and you can define the total , and you can call the total , of all the concepts , , inspired , , intuitions , inspired to be from the human imagination .
The ethosphere is the great painting of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and that we can be as as a kind of inquisitive species .
And because the biosphere was very , as well , as it was really , etly , and too much more quickly .
No biologist , for example , would say that 50 percent of all species is , or is about the orlo , because it &apos;s been on the orlo because it &apos;s fused , or -- in the most apocalylothic diversity -- and you don &apos;t even get a little bit of biological diversity .
The whole thing is , obviously , the loss language .
When you &apos;re born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not compost for a vocabulary or from a series of free rules .
A language is the springing of human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle of which the soul of every culture comes in the world .
Every language is a forest , a thought , a thought , a thought , a thought , a thought , a very spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re sitting in Monterey , at least half the middle is not more subsurrated in the ears of the kids .
They don &apos;t get more teachers , which means , not , at least not sample that I don &apos;t have any campaign .
What is more trister and the being had to be in silence , of being the last last to talk a language , not having to transmate the promises of the promises of the promises of the promises of the promises of the promises of the promises of the promises of the promises of the promises ?
This orring was a state of someone in some part of the world every two weeks , every two weeks , a old language , and he brings with the last last few weeks .
And I know somebody who will say , &quot; Is it better ?
The world would not be a better place if we &apos;re going to talk about the same language ? &quot; Beniish , then we &apos;re all yoruba . We &apos;re going to talk about targeted .
We talk about kogi .
You &apos;re going to have a trailer , you can &apos;t talk to their language .
I &apos;d like to do a journey through the ethnosphere --
a little journey in the ethnosphere to give you a very abay of what we &apos;re losing .
A lot of us forget that when I say , &quot; different ways of existing ways of existing .
Let &apos;s take for example , Barasana , in Amazon , Amazon , the people in the anaconda , which creates the midst of the milk of the milk of the milk of the pocket in the floulder ,
It &apos;s a people who can &apos;t have able to distinguish the color blue from the green green green because the time birth is identified in the time , which depends .
They have a language and a kind of a language and a matriage , called &quot; exogram language , &quot; exogram , &quot; you have to go a different person who is talking a different language .
Everything has been in the mitological past , but the particularly , but the particularly , in these families , extinct that you &apos;re about six or seven languages because of the matriries of mists .
They limlimestate and then they start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribe with which I lived , Waorans of Ecuador , a incredible people who have been the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionary missioned a made of a printing mistake .
They made it down from the top photographs that retraits in order to think that this people who were return , forget that this people in the forest forest that this people who had never seen anything of bi-dimensional forest .
They &apos;ve been crossed the picture , they have been made to the research of a form or a form , and not find nothing , they have been in the diavoid , and they killed the five missionary missionary missionary .
But Waorans don &apos;t kill the strange .
They were killed between them .
54 percent of mortality was caused by their own .
We &apos;re eight generations of eight generations and we found two natural death and when we have insisted to know , they admitted that one of them was invecting , and then they killed it . And then they killed it . And then they killed it . And so , they had a incredible knowledge of the forest .
The caughters were able to recognize the animal from 40 pass and recognize the species .
In the first &apos; 80s , I was assigned a really interesting task when my professor of Harvard , I wanted to go to Haiti in the basic secret of the basic , the power of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes , and the Tonton Macoutes , and sessing me for the guns .
For a sense of the miraculous , I had to understand the Vodoun culture and the Voodoo is not magic .
It &apos;s quite a complete view of the world .
So , very interesting .
If I ask you to ask me great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianity , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Sharian Africa has no religious faith . And instead , and the Voodoo is not else that the illed of these religious religious religious .
What makes the interesting woodoo is the intense of report between life and death .
So , the vivid are going to live the spirites .
The spirites can be invested from the Grande Actually , they respond to the rhythm of dance and replace to the soul of the living in a very short , and you replace the follow becomes the god .
So , for this voodooists like to say , &quot; Vs white who go to talk about God .
We dancy in the temple , and we become God . &quot;
And the moment that you &apos;re poses , is the spirit that you can , how do you can do it bad ?
So , you see these amazing events : following voodoo voodoo in the state of trance that toughtes are so strong , you &apos;re going to see the houses of the body when it &apos;s catalyzed in a state of extremely exciting exciting .
And in all the people who have been in the most extraordinary people who have been Kogi Santa Marta , in the Colombia in in the Colombia .
And you have to have a very , the fact that once lived on the aid careers , which once lived on the aid plant of the Colombia in the conquician , the people were retreated on the volcanic masses that you &apos;re going on on on the volcanic carban .
In a blood continent continent continent continent that people have never been conquered by the spagers .
But today , they &apos;re government government government from a click , but their formation is so extraordinary .
The young people follow up from the families to three or four years , and they live secret in a bug world , and admitted in the bases of the frozen for 18 years .
Two years ago , they chose about nine years , they have to reproduce the nine months of gestation that transfer in the mom , now they &apos;re metaphor in the user of the Grande Mather .
For all of this time , they &apos;re accultured to the values , which are predicting that their prayers and only their prayers and only their prayers and only their prayers .
And the term of this incredible initiation , they &apos;re suddenly taken out and for the first time in life , at 18 years , see a high school . And that activity in the first time , they see a fancy . And that is the first klllands , when the sun kidney , everything that have learned from the remotor . The pret does . And it &apos;s predicting .
&quot; Vist ? Proprice as I said .
It &apos;s amazing . Now it &apos;s about to you . &quot;
They call it very much more and say that we , brothers and say that we are the destruction of the world .
This is extremely important .
When we think about Indigene and the environment we invoid Rousseau and the old story of the selselling snoble , which is a concept in its simplicity , or maybe invoid Thoreau and maybe invoid these people are more close to the Earth of us .
The Indies are not nor sentimental sentimental sentimental people .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the Asmat Asmat Asmat , or in the Tibet , but because of the time and rites , they created a mystic mystic of the Earth is not about the idea of the planet , but on a very very well , the concept that the Earth can be done because it &apos;s infused by by the human knowledge .
What does that mean ?
It means that a little bit of Ande who are growing up creating the mountain is a very different spirit , and it &apos;s a deeply different , and it &apos;s going to have a deeply different , and it &apos;s going to have a very different , and it will be a very different way with a box that mountain is a massive samp of rocks .
which is the dimora of a spirit or a mineral , is irrillying .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that define the relationship between individuals and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Humbia Britannics believe that forests were going to be cut .
And that has been different from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the dimora of Hukukuk and the bar of the heaven and the berites of the world , which we live in the world , spirites that live in the world , spirites that we have to the world , spirites that we &apos;re going to the world , spirites .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create different , you can start to understand some of them , you can start to understand some of them feeling . We have this plant .
I took this picture to open up in the Amazon the Amazon Sthern Amazon .
Maybe some of you have heard about the ayahuask , the most powerful psychoapapapaphor .
What makes the same thing makes the ayahuasks is not the pharmacological potential , but its elaboration . It &apos;s what &apos;s made . It &apos;s called two elements .
On one side , this lighting lighting that contains a series of Tioline , hardddogene and hardddogene .
And then , by taking the only plant is a smoke that alter a little bit of the coscience , but it &apos;s mixed with the leaving of a cafficer &apos;s family said ,
This plant is contains powerful , very similar to seriotonin , very similar dimethypptamine , five , methyptamine ,
If you &apos;re going to see the Yanoms , you have to pull up for the substance of species , it &apos;s a different set of species , it &apos;s a different set of species , it &apos;s a methyptamine .
You can see that dust on the nose is a little bit like being disappear from a little bit of a bunch of dipinks and land on a sea sea sea sea sea sea sea sea .
I need to use with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who wrote the man who wrote the hair was , with his financial financial finds in the &apos; 30s .
And I mean , I &apos;m going to be a classifiction of these triptamine as as alucinogens , because if you &apos;re actually , you can &apos;t tell no one of being hallucined . But if you &apos;re not going to be abunte because they &apos;re dency because they &apos;re dency in the intestine , because they &apos;re obviously obvious in the intestabys-dash .
It &apos;s possible to assume if you &apos;re just abunte with other chemicals that denian MAO .
Now , it &apos;s the beautiful : the Tibeta-fuel that are ininjors of MAO , the same kind of need to be able to be able to be able to be able to get the triptamine . The question is spontaneous . The exhible-like , in fact , but that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be in this way , but that if you combined in this way , create a biochemical .
We use the great eufemism of evidence and error , which can revealing .
But if we ask Indians , they &apos;ll tell us &quot; The plants are going to tell us . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribes , Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuasks , which distinguished in the forest , and that we would come into the same species .
If you ask them how much stake did their tasses say , &quot; I thought , &quot; I thought , &quot; I said , &quot; I said , &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take the 17 variety in a night of the lands of a four-sun .
So , you don &apos;t have graduate at Harvard to , but it &apos;s much more interesting to count the stami .
Now , &#91; applausers &#93; the problem is that also the people who have to the Indies have no aces to find them in the margins of the story of our sea sea sees in a way of the story of our real world , and it &apos;s going to go .
In fact , the 20th century , in 300 years , it &apos;s not going to remind for his technology , but rather like the technology was that we stop and we used actively abbraced and we used acked actively , or passionate about the mass mass of mass mass and cultural diversity and cultural planet . Now , the problem is not the problem .
All the cultures have been involved in a dance for new possibility .
And the problem is not technology .
Indians Sioux , they have no being Sioux when they put it from the arco , and they frecovered as Americans have no stop being American when they put it from the horse and calf .
It &apos;s not change or technology that mines the technology that mines of ethical etnosphere . It &apos;s the power .
The hard to do .
And if you give a look at the world , you find that these are not destined to disappear .
They &apos;re living creatures and spines out of the existence from existence from the existence of the adaptation .
And it &apos;s disbosygggent in the Penan .
a nomads of Sarawak , in the southern of the wastest , a people who lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduction on the back of the refts of the refts of the represerrates , where you can see the river &apos;s filled to the doulder , where the willing to the Bornees , where the naplands , where the illuminate soulder , where the horizon ,
You &apos;re ready to repiers with the forest .
Or , in the Yanomami , are the diseases that have come with the discovery of gold .
If we &apos;re going to have on the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the wall of the political domination .
As you know , the genocide , the extinction of a people , is constantly in universal level , but the unless , the destruction of a people , not only is constyle , not only is constyle , but I &apos;ll tell you , because it &apos;s part of the strategy .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of Tibet until the beginning .
I spent the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in China , Western Tibet , coming to Lhasa with a young connecting , but only came to Lhasa with a young connecting , but only came to Lhasa with a young connecting , but only came out of the statistics that we &apos;re going to hear .
6,000 monuments sacred reduces in dust and centers .
1.2 million people killed the military during the Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascritted to the Panchen Lama .
The Chinese means that it was killed to the time of the Chinese invasion .
Her , it was a From Santity during the diaspora people in Nepal .
His mother was imprisoned and his cold was replaced .
It was brought to hide in carefully at the age of two years , she was born under his gonna because he couldn &apos;t have to live without him .
The sister , who did the same , was mitted in education .
A day , he invertonight a fashion , and , for this transgression , was a fession , was put on on the forced for seven years .
The Tibet can be insopportable , but I &apos;m unopposable , but I &apos;m the spirit of the people is from tener .
And finally , it &apos;s all reduces to a choice .
We want to live in the world world monotonia , or we want to get the world policy ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he died , he died , he said that his larger view was that , in our way , we &apos;re going to see the whole whole gamma of human imagination . We &apos;re going to see the whole gamma of the human imagination , but a day we &apos;re going to see it from a sleeping way to be so that there were other possibility .
And it &apos;s a loser to remember that our species is existed for 600,000 years .
The Neolitica Revolution , which has been agriculture , which has made us to socking on the seed , replace to replace the poetry of the shaming of the smom of the melt of the melt of the Curchecky , and we &apos;re talking about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has to be 300 years .
And that we have no suggests me that we have to have answers to all the challenges that we &apos;re going to have to deal in the millennia to come .
When to these myriades of cultures the world is asked to say , human , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all refer the possibility of being what we are : a unbelievable species , that has to make all the people and the gizes can fill . And there are great moments of optimism . And there are great moments of optimism .
I took this picture on the northern island of Baffin , when I went to clock whales with Inuit , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man , the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The dog government was not always gentile with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to stabilize our spremix , we have to them in colonies .
The grandfather was refused to go .
The family , theme for his life , and he took all my toils , and all of his attreices .
You have to know that the Inuit &apos;s not the cold , they do it .
The Flers in origins were made of fish were made of weight in the caribes .
The grandmother was not a man did not intimidded by the night of the night , or the bard that suffered .
It &apos;s sweet , you &apos;re hot the pantalons in the focus and defected in their own hand . When you did it , you go into the hand . When you did it &apos;s frozen , and they &apos;re confrorown , and they &apos;re standing .
It &apos;s got salive on the doud of this colcold , and when it became solid , he killed a dog .
He shake the dog and created a briddddaughter , and he created a slict , has a samp , and it &apos;s sought to the banking , and it &apos;s sat on the banking , and it &apos;s sought on .
We want to talk about horse with nothing ? &#91; Risch &#93; And this , in different ways , &#91; Applausers &#93; is the symbol of the resilience of the people in the world .
In fact , 1999 , the government reduction , the total of the Canananese total of the larger California and Texas . And Texas a larger of California and Texas a lot of the big .
It &apos;s their new paintent . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a independent therefore . They have to all the mineral resources .
One of the splendid , as a none-state could re-re-re-re-concilist .
And , finally , I think it &apos;s quite obvious to be at least at least at least at least at least at the planet , and you realize that they &apos;re not remote .
For somebody &apos;s house .
They open the seeds of human imagination that they go to the alba . And for us all , the dreams of these kids , as the dreams of these kids become part of the nuda .
We &apos;re going to end , we have to do that political political political will never be .
We believe that polemics --
&#91; Applausers &#93; are not persuasisides , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month our website .
156 countries transmed our television channels .
Our magazines are lets from millions of people .
Our work is traveling in the ethnosphere to bring our public to the public places that they will go away from what they will go away from what they &apos;re going to go away from how they saw and , in hope , for the central revealist in the world , and we have to find a life of life , and we have to find a life of life in a pluralist and we have to find a life of life in a pluralist and multicultural and multicultural ,
where we have all the people can contribute to our well-being collective .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some of the things I wrote in this book that book that I hope you &apos;ve heard about and try to test some links , in the case , you don &apos;t notice .
I &apos;d like to start with what I call &quot; the official official . &quot;
The official dogma official ?
The official dogma of all the industrial society society . The Western official dogma , &quot; If we want to massize the well-being of our citizens . &quot;
The reason is , from one side , in fact that freedom is in itself a value , is , useful , essential for human beings .
On the other one of us is , if we are free , each of us can act to do everything that that massive massive our well-being , without no one that decide in our well-being , no one of us decide , and so , we have to do everything that we have to do .
The way we have to massize freedom is massize the choice .
The more choices have , more , they &apos;re libing , and the greater is their freedom , is the most of them .
This is so deeply , it &apos;s so deeply , in the society that nobody would have dream to put it in doubt .
And it &apos;s also deeply rown in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you a lot of examples of what progress has been possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly great .
I hope I hope to put it a simple note in the injump .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without contare , without contar of the extreme of oldestrust , and the 12 acets that you can buy a huge number of conditions in the incincrescious circumstances that nobody of 175 already ready .
Here &apos;s what the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronics store : you &apos;re cast , lawers , CD , radio , rain , radio , piastra , light , light , the piastra .
And in this single store , there &apos;s a big big number of audio components .
We can make a half million different combinations using the components that there are in a only store .
You have to put that there is a very much choice .
Other camps : the world of communications .
And once I was a child , you could get all the phone services for , to the phone services that they were provide by mom Bell .
They were born the phone , you didn &apos;t buy it .
A consequence of that , between the other , was that the phone never puppppiced .
These times they go .
Now , we have a very limited variety of telephone , especially between cell cell phones .
Here &apos;s the cell phone .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , MP3 , cut , he detail of the nose , and forgotten forced for the bruleline .
If you haven &apos;t seen it in the store in the house store in the house , you &apos;re very much for .
And what &apos;s the end is that people get in the negotives and do this question . And what is the answer ? The answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the acquiring itself itself explosion of choices .
His there is no longer in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor you &apos;re going to go from the doctor and say what you have to do .
But , instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor you say , &quot; Okay , we could do it , or B , &quot; A has these benefits and these risks , &quot; B has these benefits and these risks . What do you want to do ? &quot;
Her Dr. Dr. , &quot; Dr. , what would I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; At the benefit , and these risks , and the risks . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebacs , &quot; Dr. if she was me , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
We call it &quot; autonomy of the malmalate , &quot; expression that makes it seem a beautiful thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not that one to move the weight and responsibility to make decisions from someone who knows something , hoses the doctor , to someone else else else -- and almost certainly certainly , and almost certainly , it &apos;s certainly sictly , and so not in the ideal condition , and it &apos;s true .
There &apos;s a huge marketing of products drugs , direct to people like me and you , if you think , you don &apos;t have any sense , because we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why do we advert them ?
The answer is that they want to ask the doctor to ask the receiver to change it .
So , what &apos;s like this is our identity is ever a question of choice , as you see in this vignet . We don &apos;t want to forget the kids . They &apos;re not going to go more identity . We don &apos;t want to get the time . We have to invent .
And we can reinvented us as much as much as we &apos;re going to do .
The morning means that every morning , at the rising , you have to decide that kind of person .
I &apos;m going to be able to be a long time , a common time , the perspective , it almost for anybody , was that you had the most pressured possible , and you started to do the most presents .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not when , and even what to do after .
So , it &apos;s really to play .
I teach students very smart students , and I &apos;m going to do their 20 percent in less than a time .
And not because they &apos;re not very brilliant , because they &apos;re not diligent .
But why are I &apos;m imbilities , I mean , &quot; Do I would ask me , &quot; Do I would say , &quot; I &apos;m going to do that now ? &quot;
&quot; Do I should be worried about the late ? I thought before children or the career ? &quot;
They &apos;re logical interrogative .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this implica not complete the companies that assigns and not get a beautiful voice to my exame .
And they have to do it . They &apos;re important .
Now , the work : We &apos;re lucky , as Carl underlying , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , every day , every day , every day , every day , transfer from Hotel Randolph .
And I &apos;m going to talk , there &apos;s a corner , and I won &apos;t tell no one where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t tell you , why I want to use it .
What means , this incredible freedom of choice , we have to work ? It &apos;s going to be so much , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our child playing calculate , with cell cell cell cell in a pocket , the Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the notice .
And even though they &apos;re all spending , every minute we see that we see our son , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; I need to answer this call ? &quot;
&quot; Do I need to answer this email ? I need to use this letter ? &quot;
And also when the answer is &quot; no , &quot; No , &quot; that makes the experience of your own own son &apos;s experience .
So , any of the look at things , small and great , things , materials and lifestyle , life is a question of choices .
And one time the world was this : That &apos;s true , there were some possibility , but it was not a question of choice .
The world today looks like this : The dilemma is , &quot; Is it a good thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Sunning .
We &apos;re all good at all , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative of the negative .
All this is a two of the fact two negative effects in people .
The first , paradoxically , it &apos;s that produced instead of liberation .
So , you know , it &apos;s very difficult to do it .
I give you a significant example : a significant study of volunteers .
A link in the Vanguard data at Vanguard , the giant society of pension , with about a million clients in 2,000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offers in more , the percentage of adhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
With 50 offers , there &apos;s 10 percent in less than adhesions when they &apos;re available to when they &apos;re available to the only five . Why ?
Because with 50 sources that choices , it &apos;s sick difficult to decide , and choice is reremoved to the intomorrow .
And in domans , and I still ask domans , tomorrow , and of course , tomories , and of course , tomorrow , and of tomorrow .
You know , it doesn &apos;t just mean that these working working working on the old dogs because they &apos;re not going to have enough money , even say that the decision is so dator that they also lose complements .
They &apos;re not going to be able to be able to be in five dollars for the dator of work , which would be well disappear to be .
So , the paralysis a consequence of having too much .
And I think it &apos;s like that .
&quot; And to end , for the ethernity : ketchup , or maionese ? &quot;
Would you like to take the right decision , if it &apos;s it for etheless , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong wrong , and yet the wrong condition .
So that &apos;s the first effect . The second is that even if we can avoid the paralysis and to do a choice , at the end of how we were less options in fact , that we were used to be with less options .
And that &apos;s about about a different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of conducting between which choices , if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you would have been better . And what &apos;s going on is that the alternative imagined us in the hot of the reduction of the decreates the soulder , and the dimination of the decision ,
And also when it was a very good decision .
The most choices there are , easier is to unlike any detail that is insssweather .
And so , there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has been very well , how the value that we &apos;re going to do things depends on what we &apos;re going to do .
On the rest , when there are many options possible , it &apos;s easy to represent the characteristics of alternative shot and be less satisssssdramatically , in fact , the option that you have choice .
Here &apos;s a example . I &apos;m going to use with all those who are not New York .
But that &apos;s what you probably think .
There &apos;s this couple of Hamptons .
A place .
It &apos;s all for them . It &apos;s all for them . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not going to be , but what he thinks is , &quot; Well , it &apos;s Aggust . &quot;
&quot; Everybody my neighborhood in Manhattan are on . &quot;
&quot; I could parking right in front of home . &quot;
And it &apos;s going to go from the idea that &apos;s perdying -- every day -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The costo-impties the satisfaction for what we have , even when the choice was excellent .
And more are the options that we have to look at , more the characteristics of attractive , you will be going to be able to be constantly to it ,
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
It &apos;s about living the time , and maybe of living slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you choices to , you choose to not do the other .
The things that we don &apos;t choices that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : Redge is growing for expectations .
I tried to my skin in bought a new new jeans .
I &apos;m almost always jeans .
And you know , jeans were just a guy , buy them and vast them , they were scommodity , just after they were sed , just after they were sweet , just after they were going to go .
So , I went to buy a couple of new time when those old were gone , and I said , &quot; I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
I said , &quot; You &apos;re going to do a fit , you know , fit , relaxed , fit ? &quot;
Will you . &quot; Who wants to do with the clothing ? &quot; Stonewashed , &quot; or &quot; acidhhed ? &quot;
&quot; Would you like the struggle ? &quot;
&quot; Who takes them lars or stretched ? Bla &quot; &quot; &quot; Continule .
I was salkllers , and after a little bit of saying , &quot; I want the guy , which was the only guy , &quot; he had no idea what it was , so for a time , and I went out to all the time , and I went out of the giant store , and then the best couple of jeans who ever had .
It was the very much . With all that choice .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse , is that with all of my choice . They were altising , jeans had to be perfect .
And I had to have been expected . I was not expected to be so much of this , when there was a kind of a kind of time , but when you live 100 different , accidents , at least a kind of thing .
What I had been bought , but not perfect .
After I started to talk about the chosen with what I was inssatisssssed to waiting .
The adds of options in life of people don &apos;t do that increase the eccellence of the options of the same options .
And this will produce less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
No one in the world of marketing is if it &apos;s made .
Because if they knew it , you would not know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is like this .
&quot; Well , it was better when it was worse , &quot; The reason it was better when it was worse , when you were worse , you know , when you were still , you can meet the sister .
So , in the world that we live -- opulent , industrialized , industrialized addiction , the most of the lengtion of perfetion -- the most we can hope is that things are at the altezen .
You &apos;re not going to have been pleased because your waiting for , my waiting , you &apos;re ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Baswaiting . &quot;
I mean , I &apos;m really really , I &apos;m really really sposed and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t have to do , I &apos;m not going to be able .
But it &apos;s not always a good thing .
And finally , a result of the buy a couple of jeans , when there &apos;s only that kind of jeans is that when you &apos;re not swedad , and you ask , why ? &quot;
Who &apos;s responsible ? &quot;
The world is the responsible . What could I do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a insssweather , and you ask you who is the responsible , is the unless , you &apos;re going to be .
You could have to do better .
With hundreds of varieties , there are not scans for the insuccess .
So when people make decisions , even though the outcome is , you feel insssweather , you feel insed and damage the cold of their own .
In the last years , depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only important , but important -- of this wave of depression is just that people have been too high .
And when they have to explain this situation , they think the cold is .
So the final outcome is that in general , we &apos;re better than , but we feel worse .
Let me remind you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely unknown . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than having it &apos;s better than having it all of this is not going to be a little bit more more than a bit .
There &apos;s a critical value . I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s .
But I &apos;m sure we have been quite sure we have to have to be able to do our life .
Now , from the political point -- I have almost finished -- I have almost finished , the hurt is the follow .
What allows all this to be in industrial society is the wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too much .
So , the cencenters that I &apos;m talking about is a slusional being modern society , reathe-society .
And what does depressing and angry is this : Steve Levitt has been talking about yesterday , how they &apos;re actually used to be inutilightly . It &apos;s a split of money .
I mean , these choices , complicated and dispendiose , it &apos;s not that they are just inutilize .
I &apos;m going to tell you .
They do do worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows a lot of choice was reverse in those where people have too much possibility , not only their life to improve , but also our own life .
This is what economists call a better better better .
A redistribution of income , it &apos;s good for all of the poor -- because of this choice in exciting .
To end , &quot; Well , you can become everything you want to be --
You have , people who are , you think , &quot; But what &apos;s believed that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t do anything in a glass of glass . &quot;
&quot; A sense of a very limited view of the world -- &quot;
and I &apos;m interested in this , I interpretation .
But then , think , instead , I realized , instead , I realized that the long fish knows .
Because the reality is that if you &apos;re manda in frankon , so that , &quot; everything is possible . &quot; It &apos;s not good freedom . You don &apos;t get freedom . You &apos;re the paralysis .
If you take the bock in a way that everything is possible dimines to be dimining .
You get the paralysis , and you reduce the wellell-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too strange , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the abunclog of a substantial , is a recipe for inhappiness and , I &apos;m going to do it .
Thank you very much .
