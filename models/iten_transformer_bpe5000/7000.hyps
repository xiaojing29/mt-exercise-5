And last year I showed these slide to show that the calculate that the calculating of the 48 million years of the size of the 48 continental , it &apos;s a 40 percent of the continental , it &apos;s a 40 percent .
But that &apos;s the gravity of the problem , because it doesn &apos;t show the the end of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show it .
The artal glacial , is , in a sense , the heart of the global system .
It &apos;s got to inverse and you get the summer .
The next slide to be a reduced reduced the last 25 years .
The loss of the stayers are signed in red .
As you see , you &apos;re going to go to the blue .
That &apos;s the ice in inverse , which you &apos;re ritira .
You can see that the costs , five years , or five years , it &apos;s like the blood , which is like the blood , that &apos;s the sea , which is the horithon from the body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been from so so .
This is a problem because the rewarming is the wild of the ground , where there are enormous amount of coal , where there are enormous amount of coal coal , they &apos;re transformed in the microbes .
I &apos;m going to be the totalalaling of the inquination of global warming , the amount of the amount of being being , super-up , super-up this point of not around .
In some lagement in Alaska metan .
The professored Katey Walter of Alaska University of Alaska a team of a sat the last last inverse .
Video : Wow ! Gore : Lore &apos;s good . The question is if we &apos;re going to be .
And this is that this exextra extremely survival .
This is a bunch of the regime .
The took never had to reach free .
This is the Kangerlussuap , in the southern obvious of the Groenland .
If you want to know how the level of the sea for the shellow .
These are going to be quickly quickly quickly .
On the other part of the planet : Antartide , the greater of the planet .
The last month , the last month , the bill of the ice is in the negative , and the Antarcccy , which pushed on some iellow sun , it &apos;s particularly relief in the soult .
Equival six feet of the actual actual , like in Groenland .
Sulla Himalaya , the third largest block , you see new laghi , which was a few years ago , which was a few years ago .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population of the world &apos;s the fell of the fresults .
Sulle Ande Ande : this is the source of the water of this city .
The took is increased .
But when it &apos;s when you deeping , it &apos;s the same acception .
In California , the neve the Sierra Nevada is 40 percent .
The bunch are in the crisis .
The previsions , like you know , I &apos;m grash .
The growing growing in the world door to a remarkable extremely the inceness .
The disash environmental are increasing out of the normal and without the previous .
Four times more than the last 30 years of the last 30 years .
This is a remarkable to all insustainable .
If you look at the the same in the substore , you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we add 70 million tons of the last five hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every 24 hours .
Look at the end of the Pacific area , from the Americics , to the obvious , and on both both the parts of the subcontinent , where there &apos;s a rooms , where there &apos;s a lick of oxygen in the oceans .
The greater of the global warming , together to the deforestation , which is the 20 percent , is use of combustible combustible .
The oil is a problem , and the coal is even worse .
The United States are one of the two with more emissions , together to China .
And it was proponed to build a lot of other central central .
But we &apos;re seeing a direction of the direction .
These are the annullayin the last years and some of the alternative of the alternative .
And every way , there &apos;s a political in our country .
The industrial industrial and the coal 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the last year for promote the coal , which is a symptomorrow .
And that was going to remember something --
I know Natal Natal , where I saw , where there &apos;s been a 3.8 billion lilights of the casts of the coal four-fairs .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the most big flu of the reflu in America .
It &apos;s happened around Natal .
The public advertising of the industrial industrial of the coal industrial .
Video : The Frosty is a kind of a allegry and happy .
It &apos;s abunon here in America , and it &apos;s growing our economy .
It &apos;s the most pulit , it &apos;s more pulit .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and the work work ,
Al Gore : The right here is most of the West Virginia .
The most big society , the most big society is Massey Coal . This is her .
Video : The Sunkenship : I &apos;m going to be clear -- Al Gore , Harry Reid , Harry , Harry Reid -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Prottion of the Clim has been launched two .
This is a part .
Video : The ALergy : The ALergy we see the climate change as a serious mines our business .
And for this priority is invest a big amount of money in a forget to a public and confused to make public and confused the truth on the oil .
In fact , the coal is not spork .
We think it &apos;s a good profound -- it &apos;s a good profound .
So , not preprese of climate change .
Let me do .
Video : The Canthone : The C. You &apos;ve heard a lot of me .
So , you &apos;re going to do a around a whole of the well-looking for the coal .
Strtrtrtrouble ! The machines are a little rumorous , but this is the sound of the oil of the coal technology .
The consumption is between the major dealing of the warming of the global warming , but the remarkable technology of the coal coal , which you see everything .
You look at the same : this is the technology of the coal technology .
Al Gore : Indealing , the positive alternative .
Video : The America is in the crices ; the economy , the economics , the climate crisis .
The philillion , the dependence of our dependence , and the oil consumed , like the coal and oil imported .
Now , but , there &apos;s a new , and it &apos;s a new , and it &apos;s a new ,
Rey America : 100 percent of energy energy , in a 10 years .
A plan to reduce America , to America , and to help us to stop the global warming .
And finally , a solution that basts to solve our problems .
It &apos;s more . Scoprint of the more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : The question is about the energy of America .
One of the faster of the faster than the dependence from the comfortable that killing our planet .
Comparsa : The future is here . I feel , a new energy .
Even two : Nggggs investimate for places of work well well ,
And it &apos;s time to be realististers . It &apos;s time .
Al Gore : A old old Have African says , &quot; If you want to go to the speed , you go to .
If you want to go , you go back , you go together . &quot;
We need to go back , quickly .
Thank you very much .
LHC : The last year at TED I did a DHC .
And you promise to go back to the back to the way to go to how the car works .
So , I comi here . And for those other time , there were no , the LHC is the most scientific experiment ever attitude -- 27 kilometers of circle .
His , his task is to reach the conditions that were presents less than a billion ardest of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
All that &apos;s just environmental .
This is the machine under Ginevra .
And I got these mini-Big Bang inside the reducers .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- it &apos;s about 44 feet and has a diameter of 22 feet .
This is a picture of ATLAAS in building so you can notice the proportions .
The 10 / 11 of the last year we have accacceso the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAAS .
It was because of immention of immention ,
It &apos;s a first fascinating image of particles that had all around the LHC , in the HC , by the HC , and spread particles in the HC , and spread particles in the report .
In other words , when we see that image the 10 , the ceptember , that &apos;s a big vitty .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to make us more optively , and you saw that , when someone went on Google and vivide that the page was this .
That means that we had a cultural impact beyond the scientific .
It &apos;s a week later , there was a problem with the machine , to just these films here -- these phililes .
These phililillion , 13,000 ampampampate when the car works works at the last of the potence .
Now , the technical of you look at the philes and they &apos;re going to say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . &quot;
And instead can do that because when they &apos;re very cold to become the consciouses .
So , at least 271 degree , to a nurity temperature to the space between stars , these philes can bring that the current .
In one of the giant between the most of the SSC , there was a magnetic of the LHC , there was a difest of the Septation .
So the films are going to be a slightly , and 13,000 ampampampty .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think these magnees more than 20 tons , and that they &apos;re moved about about 30 centimeters , and that they &apos;re moving about 30 centimeters .
It &apos;s a lot of 50 magneat about 50 magnetic .
We had to task them , what we did .
We have reprined and refed .
They &apos;re going to go back to the slow .
I was the end of the LHC will be new integrated .
We &apos;re going to be , and we expect to get the data or the light-foot , and continue so our adventure to find what they &apos;re the morning that costs the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents reduced the value of science and engineering of the engineering and engineering of the engineering of the engineering of the engineering .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s so hard to go , I think it &apos;s this value of like LHC .
I want to conclude with the words of a scientist , Humphrey , which , I want to conclude , in the difense of his pupille , his publict was Michael Farch , he said , &quot; No , Nike is so dangerous for the progress , he said , &quot; No , &quot; No .
Thank you .
I want to start asking to rethink about when you , from children , you play your morning .
As you understand how to reach and dedemonstrate them , and they learn them , and they learn it , to think and to be able to think and policing and manipulating problems .
The activity is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , by the inspiration of our interaction with physicists , together to my physicists , together to my Penter , and the collaborator Jeevan Kalanii , I started to ask me , &quot; And if we use a computer , but if we use a computer , but if we use a computer , we use the same race of the TTTTTTTTTake a computer , which is going to be a bunch of the hands ,
and I try to do this ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Sifat the words , a big computer as a biscan .
In a few words , a Sifat the words , a big computer as a biscan .
You can move with the hand , can see the hand , can see the way , you feel the right and they have a screen and a radio screen .
But most of course , they &apos;re physicists , like the morning , you can move by the sweet , they can just move .
The Sifty is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And the hand that become more physicists , configures , the other , and the hand , and the hand that become more physicists , conconfishing , the other of the movement , we can explore new and fun of interaction .
I &apos;m going to give some simple example .
This Sifty is configured to show the video : if it &apos;s the video : if it &apos;s the video , it will be so , if it &apos;s going to be so , if it &apos;s going back .
These are conconfigures are conconfigures of the other .
If they affiank , they &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re around .
If they &apos;re circles , they notice and can agitate a little .
If they &apos;re circles , they notice and can agitate a little .
They also have their movement and inclination .
And then we realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was that we could use the common common on data , to example , &quot; a color as if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Sifairs as a bunch of green and I can use them to use to move into the color in the central , where they &apos;re going to be able .
and I can use them to go to the color in the central , where you &apos;re going .
If you &apos;re too , we can get a little bit .
I &apos;m also going to be a kind of appropriately , like the lingue , the mathematics and games where people can try to try to make things quickly , and see the results .
I &apos;m --
This is a Fibonacks that I do with a a program .
Here we have a game of words that is at half between Scarabeo and Boggle .
It &apos;s a letter , you know , a letter in the case on every Sifty , Princatatically , to every Sifty , and while you &apos;re trying to do it on a ditionary , and how to try to do it on a dione-based on a dione-based on a dione-based on the case .
And then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new set of the new and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the children came in the Media Lab , I did it in a way that I tried and I took a video .
They were very much .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot .
You just say , &quot; You &apos;re &quot; Compons of words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s other people who try it .
This is our newest , the most young , there .
It was actually wanted to be a pieces .
They were only morning , for him .
Now , this is an interactive of a interactive interactive .
We wanted to build a device for the appreneeur , he &apos;s Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , solving the Sifairly .
It can put new characters in the scene , solving the Sifairly .
Here &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : The sun sun .
David Merrill : Now , he took a treat the scene .
Video : The treat the aral .
Bel work ! Yeah !
So , he &apos;s the Sifairs and put them into characters --
Video : Bau !
-- inventing your story .
Video : Have !
DM : It &apos;s a final story with open , and it can decide him as a sell .
DM : It &apos;s a final story with open , and it can decide him as a sell .
Video : Vola , gentine .
DM : The last example that I have the time to show you a tool , and I realized that it &apos;s a tool .
It &apos;s a tool , I did , for the campin and and to make music .
The Sifairly represent here , and the bacteria .
And you have four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also get these sounds in a sequence of a compose of your pleasure .
And it just doing it just touch a &quot; sound and a sequence . &quot;
These are actually that you can control from the viviously , like the revers and the philer .
The attacks to a particular sound , and then incline for the reflying .
And then there are the general general as time and volume , which is the whole sequence .
We &apos;re going to look like .
Video : We &apos;re going to try to put a base in two Siftable , &quot; We &apos;re going to make a series , we add into a series , we add another base .
I &apos;m going to put a bottom .
Video : Now , I &apos;m going to add the percusussions --
Video : And now I put the glass on the battery , so I can control the effect of the effect of the wild .
Video : I can &apos;t know the entire sequence of the entire sequence of the entire sequence of the time .
Video : And now I &apos;m going to add the bottom to the bottom to give more expression .
Video : I can reach the sequence of the sequence . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to be planning before , but I can suddenly make more or more , or more cord .
And now , I can be smoke the entire sequence of the entire sequence to the Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new interfaces , and it &apos;s a lot more like the brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of this perperpermission , and also some chance that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transform is that &apos;s going to be able to be able to interact with digital media , which is going to be information in our world that we want .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;m not going to talk to you with all .
I &apos;m a scape .
I &apos;m going to be my profession , but it &apos;s more than that .
It &apos;s also the love and the fascinating of my life .
And I didn &apos;t think that it can change .
But , he said , something that &apos;s happened in my life and my life , and my career , which has taken me to report the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I got this book , this book called &quot; Many , Prega , Am , Am , Am &quot; The diversously , for some reason , for some reason , and became a big , feeling , and he was a big , feeling , and he was a big , unlike , &quot; I &apos;m going to have a big , &quot; --
And the result is that obviously , people me treat how if I was a bunch of the way .
It &apos;s true -- I was going to be .
They &apos;re all worried about me now , and say , &quot; You don &apos;t have the most of it .
You don &apos;t have a little bit of them to write for all life without that we could be able to create a book that can importantly someone ? &quot;
that can be able to someone ? &quot;
It &apos;s race , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember the most of 20 years ago , when I started to say , I was a a clower -- I was a scritice .
I was going to be based on the same reaction .
And people said , &quot; Not the temple of that could be successful ?
You don &apos;t have the painting of the reflying ?
You don &apos;t have this painting for all life without anything that nothing .
You know , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
You know , I was the landscape of all .
I got a painting .
And I also have a lot of other things that people could not be able .
As the alf and other things .
But , as I thought , and I thought , and I ask me , and I ask me , why ?
It &apos;s rational ?
It &apos;s logic that anyone should expect to be spaved by a job that you have been been done .
But what &apos;s that particular in the implant implant to make us nervous about the mental health , or other carry they &apos;re not ?
As my father , for example , he was a chemical engineering and not remember a chemisphere and I didn &apos;t remember that if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was a check ?
There was never -- that block of the engineer , like ?
It &apos;s not going to work so , you know ?
Onestly , the engineers like a group didn &apos;t have any of course , in the the insector , the reputation of being alcold .
We have enough this reputation , and not only not only writers , but creativity of all this , we have this reputation of being enormous instant .
And it &apos;s not going to look at the tristes of the magnifiction , and it &apos;s just in the 21st century , they were young and often often for them .
And the ones that they &apos;re not sopicated as well as they &apos;re really disappeared by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before I was going to die , in the last interview , he said , &quot; Each a little bit more , &quot; A extraordinary deeply about the job of the life .
But we don &apos;t take it , when we feel that because we heard these things , because we &apos;ve heard these things that we &apos;re completely interized and accepted the notion that the notion and accepted is in some legal way , and the art , and then it &apos;s going to be a few legal way , and then it will be a few of the art .
And the question I want to take all here today is : You &apos;re agree with this idea ?
It &apos;s going to give you this thing -- because it &apos;s also looking at me , not good for me .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s dangerous and I don &apos;t want to see the next century .
I think it &apos;s better encouraging our great creative creative .
And I think , in my situation in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to me to the clearly clearly , the most of the cumstances , especially , the cumstances , but I &apos;m in my carer .
I &apos;m true -- look at , I &apos;m quite young , I have about 40 years .
I have a lot of a job in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything I write in the world , and then it &apos;s going to be right from the world as the job that he was after the last book .
I &apos;m going to be a bit , because we &apos;re all more or less here -- it &apos;s likely that my great success is my great success is to my great .
Oh , Geso , that thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that &apos;s a person to start to get to the nine in the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would continue to do this .
So , the question is , how ?
And so I think it &apos;s going to be , after a lot of work to be to write what to be to be to create a psychological , right ?
I was in some way to find a distance of the security of me , and my natural natural thing that I &apos;m writing what I &apos;m going to get to be able to be , and I was trying to look at the last year , trying to look at the time , trying to see if they could have some more ideas and more and more and sane ideas and more and sane ideas and more and more and more and sane and more and more and sane .
on how to help people creative inherent inherent the emotional revenues .
And that research has taken me to the ancient Great and the Rome .
I do do that , and then I go back .
Nelil Get , and the Rome -- people don &apos;t seem to believe that creativity came out of the men , OK ?
It was thinking that the creativity was this spirit look at the wine and that they were the people from a few surprising and swide , for reasons and unknown .
The grew of these divine divan looking at the Scian &quot; dealth .
Socppputs , he was a demand that elargiant a dealth of the distant .
The Roman was the same idea , but called the the kind of spirit without a genium .
The thing is , because Roman didn &apos;t think that a genium was not really thinking that a geniy was somebody .
They were created a genium was this kind of divine that he was living in the study of a neighbors , a little bit like the elf of a bunch of a bunch of the way , and that &apos;s going to be able to be able to be able to be able and the result of that work .
Here &apos;s the distance of the party , which is the distance of which is the distance of your job .
And all they knew that was so that it was so that it was so ?
So the artists were protected by certain things , like for example , like the too narcism , no ?
If your job was except , you couldn &apos;t get tened and all the sell , all the time , all they were helped by this genium .
If your own failed , it was not all your right ?
Everybody knew that was your genium to be a incapable .
And so people han conception of the credit for a long time .
And then the Rinhhell and all all all , and nacy this big idea ; we get the human human in the universe and the mysters and the mysters and without more left space to the creatures that they write from the divinity .
This was the principle of humanity and people started thinking that creativity came to think that creativity came out of the iduo .
And for the first time , you know , you know , and that artist , and that artist as a genium of a rather than a genium .
And I have to say , I think it was a big error .
I think I lose someone , a simple person to believe that that we should be as a reciplplease , the essence and the people of all the mysteries , creativity , creativity , unknown and etern , creativity , unknown and etern , creative , unknown and etern .
It &apos;s like to ask someone of insun .
It &apos;s completely completely the ego and creates all these ingresh expectations on the performance .
And I think it &apos;s been this pressure to destroy artists in the 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think that &apos;s the question , and I think it &apos;s question , and now ?
We can do it diversously ?
And the most advantage of a more ange of the relationship between human and mystery .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can &apos;t use 500 years of thinking about 500 years of the 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably the people between the public that would be paid on the scientific notion of the scientific , insuit , you do that people are slowed to be on their own projects .
It &apos;s not going to convince you all .
But the question I &apos;d like to take is -- why ?
Why don &apos;t I think about this way ?
Because it &apos;s more sense of each other thing that has ever heard to explain the explanation of the creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever tried to do something -- so , it &apos;s basically , all here -- it &apos;s not comfortable .
And , in fact , it can sometimes seem completely paranorous .
I did this instrument with extraordinary extraordinary Ruth Stone , which has been 90 years , but it was a few years , but it was a few years , and he said that during the Samples , and he was working in the camps , and he felt it , in the camps , and it was going into the front , and it was a poem came out of the Kesis .
He said that it was like a train .
And that &apos;s going to go to her from the landscape .
It felt it , because he could be tremendous land under her feet .
He knew that I had a only thing to do that point and was of , his words , &quot; His to be a math . &quot;
And so , so it &apos;s going to go back and it was inlow , and it didn &apos;t have to make a piece of paper and a math , and a pretty quickly , and it would collecting it and sell it on the page .
Also three times I couldn &apos;t be enough , so corries and corries and corries without able to get back home and the poetry and the poetry and her lost and she would continued to continued to continued to be continued to be a few , and he said , &quot; one &apos;s a few few other poem . &quot;
And then there were those times -- this is not the size of the moments that was almost lost , right ?
So , he was going to be looking at the house and the poetry and the poetry through , and he was a math in the while that was going to be , and then he said , which was like if you hallunged with the other hand and the office .
It was the poem from the code and the hot hot and the transcated the page .
And in those cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect and intintact , but at the last word at the first word at the first .
So when I felt -- I thought , I thought -- it &apos;s the great .
Not all my creatures -- I &apos;m not a conductor !
I &apos;m a sweak , and my way to work is ; I wake up to the same orarian every day and sell all and sell it .
But even I was in my testestard , I got strange against that what , sometimes .
And I think , many of you the han done .
You know , even though the work and ideas I got to give me a certain source of it would not be a certain of it .
And what &apos;s this thing ?
And how can we have to be able to be able to be able to allow us to lose my head , but rather , rather , that &apos;s the reminds ?
And as I &apos;m about , the best example , I have the musician that I have the musician , which I interviewed a different day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the most of the life is the insecurity of the artist of the neighborhood , trying to control , and to try to control , and I &apos;m going to do this kind of deeply interinterized .
But then I &apos;m going to go , and a day was driving on a Los Angeles , he was driving up to Los Angeles , he changed all for him .
He was going to go down and all the way to a tract of the melodia , which comes into her head as inspiration , which comes into his head , and it wants , and the wants , and the wants , and the wants , and the desider , but it &apos;s not like .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a math , no one .
So , I started to feel this kind of an extremely growing in him , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to be going to be able to empt on this song .
I &apos;m not enough , I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to go into the panic , you &apos;re going to stop .
I &apos;m going to put the whole process and made something completely new .
I &apos;m just just the sky and said , &quot; Sweet , not see that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Ti seems that that could write a song ?
If you really want to be , you know , you know , I can get care of you .
Altrain , you &apos;re going to importantly something else today .
I went to disturbing Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his process actually changed after this .
Not the work , the job was still hoscope as always .
But the process , and the fish , and the fish was that attored when the genium , the genium that &apos;s genium that was a genium of him , and it &apos;s freed it back to where they were , to be able to be a thing that I had to be a thing that I had to be a thing that they didn &apos;t have a interized thing .
but it &apos;s not this peculit , wonderful bizzarra collaboration . And this stretch and that &apos;s not not Tom .
So how the story that I felt that story to change a little bit of the way I was working and already save a time .
This idea , I was going to be writing , &quot; Many , Prega , Am , and I foot in a of the disperation of the disperation that we &apos;re working on something and we can &apos;t have and so so much and we can start thinking that it &apos;s going to think that &apos;s a disaster , which is going to be the worst .
Not just the worst , right , just the worst book .
And I started thinking about this project .
But then I remember to Tom that I talked to the air and try .
So I got my face on the manosecritical and diress my comments to a vast of the room .
And I said to high , &quot; Sents , what , both of course , that &apos;s not going to be interpretally .
Because I &apos;m seeing it &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do , I didn &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want to be better , you have to have to be able and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , I don &apos;t know what it .
I &apos;m going to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to be recorded that I was presented to do my part , &quot; Because it &apos;s so , OK -- it &apos;s so , OK -- the course , it &apos;s so OK -- the fact , it &apos;s so so , OK , I &apos;d like to the dance of a dance , and the sacred and the laun-up and the lab and and and the sacred .
And they were always magniflies that , because the ballerers were and fantastic .
But every one , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became actually transcending .
And I know what you know about what I know , because I know that you have all , to a certain point , a performance .
It was like the time , you stop , and the ballerin the middle of the head and she was not doing anything different from the usual , like 1,000 noticed , but all of the 1,000 notice before , but everything was in the 1,000 noticed .
And the sudden den it &apos;s not like a human human .
But it &apos;s accounts from the divinity of the divinity of the divinity .
And when this was going to happen , the people knew what was , &quot; they called her with her name .
And the hands and started the hands and started to bought , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
It &apos;s a historical notice -- when the MMMMors , I was the sent of the Spages , I was this abdent with their and ready to change in the lah , Allah , Allah , Allah , &quot; I &apos;m , &quot; which you can still feel in the Sick , and I &apos;m still feel in the flamenk .
In Sain , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , the Allah , the magnic , &quot; Have , &quot; unable , &quot; unable , &quot; His , a fourth of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need .
But , the problem comes back the day , for the ballerin the same , when you see it , and I see that 11 , and I find out of God , there &apos;s no longer .
It &apos;s just a moral , with a lot of the ginocy , and maybe it &apos;s never going to be more to each altex .
And maybe nobody will be the name of God still as a gira , and so what &apos;s to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most payer to do in a creative life .
But maybe it &apos;s not to be so much to be so if you can &apos;t believe , the most extraordinary , which the most extraordinary , the most extraordinary , which is the most extraordinary .
But it &apos;s just that you &apos;re in the prestired of the requires of this team of your life that you have to move to something else , and then you have to make something else when you finish .
And , you know , if we think about this way .
And so I started to think , and it &apos;s sure , and it &apos;s so so I thought for different months in the work of the book that I &apos;m going to get , the dangerous , the dangerous , and it &apos;s obvious , the text of my great great .
And what I have to say , I feel that when I I feel an electrized .
Not the reach . It &apos;s only your job .
You &apos;re going to presenting for your part , any , it can be .
If your work is balling , you .
If the divine , you get genium to you have a decide to leave some wonderful kind of a wonderful , for a little bit of the time , for a only time , then &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Altreme , you do the same dance .
&quot; And Ole ! &quot;
I think , and I think it &apos;s going to teach it .
&quot; Ole ! &quot; at you know the same , even only for the human love and testestard , and testestal aggine to make a continually .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I talked about some of these projects on the human genome , about what it can significant and the discovery of genome .
Now , we &apos;re beginning to digalize biology and we started to digalize biology and now to start to the digital code , we &apos;re going to start into a new fase of biology , design and synthththththththththththththththrow .
We always tried to take big questions .
&quot; What &apos;s life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biology , I think they have to figure out of the blood .
We &apos;ve tried different different , reduced us to the minimes .
We &apos;re going to be digalizing by 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treat the analogical world of the biology of the biology in the digital world .
Now , we ask , we can regenerate life , or create new life of this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasm , which is the genome , which is the species from the genome of the genome that can be in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome for credit a little more .
We &apos;re able to get a hundred genetic genetic genes of about 500 that I &apos;m here .
But when we look at her map , it &apos;s very simple to the map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our .
It &apos;s simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can get to , one time , it &apos;s very impossible that this can bring a living cell cell .
So , we decided that the only to design was synthetic chchromosome , this chromosome in a way to change the components to take some of these questions .
And so we started the avure of the &quot; can we synthththeme a chchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchromosome ?
Can you have the chemical chemical dedeals that we never could do before ?
And , in case , we can make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of the inerte of inerte .
The speed that we can be able to digalize life is growing to be growing to the exponential .
Our ability to write the gene code , instead , design , rather lently , but it &apos;s impossible .
And our more recent results the take on a curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process has required many of the passes , and we started with a bioethic review before .
But we discovered that synththeme DNA is very difficult .
There &apos;s a decade of thousands of cars in the world that producing little segment of DNA , of the long , and it &apos;s a degeneral process , the more than the segment is , more errors .
So we had to develop a new new method for assembling these frammers and correct the errors .
And this is our first attempt , to start from the genome of the genome of the GGO 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills .
We designed the frammers , effectively , effectively , and I got a molecule of about 5,000 loses .
The interesting part of the interesting is when we took this piece of chemical material and we put it in the bacteria , the bacteria have started to read this gene gene and make the particles .
The virals were then reduced by cells , they &apos;re back and they destroy .
I talked about the recent , with members of the oil industry that they have to be able to compost this model .
They have more than you .
We believe this is a situation where the software can really build her same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the greatest things .
We wanted to build the whole cromosome .
I &apos;m more than 580 mix .
So we thought we did it in casses of the size of the virus , so that we can change the casses of a living components of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we started this genome for the first time in 1995 , the first time in 1995 , it was a migry for every 10 migrade .
We discovered , we &apos;ve discovered , 30 errors . If we had the original sequence .
A part of the process is designed to design segers that you get to 50 lands that you have to all other seged seged for a little more than the time that worked together .
We &apos;re going to take the unseen here .
You know , you know , you know , we put in the fighting .
Think of that : We have a gene code on four , C , C , C , Good , Good , Good and T.
Those of those lls , they put up about 20 amminoacids , and there &apos;s a specific specific to the every amminds .
So we can use the gene code for words , frasash , the thoughts .
What we did we have been authograin .
Some people have been delused by fact that it wasn &apos;t a poetry .
We designed these segments for poteries just just unable with the extra .
There &apos;s a fairs and put them together .
And we started to assembling of the parts , start with five to seven to seven mix , unendles in a way to form to forming seged by 24 mila , and we took them to 70,000 luned to get 70,000 lands .
And every step , we &apos;ve got these segments in the samounts so that we &apos;re trying to try to create a very very very much , by a very very much -- like you see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this looks like the tabellon a basket .
When we get to these very much much much much , more than 100 myceli , it &apos;s not going to be more in E.
It comes to the limits of the biology of the molecular biology .
So we &apos;ve got to think of other mechanisms .
We knew another mechanism called the omologist called the omologa , which in biology , which in biology , to reparate DNA to rebuild the DNA .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinocate radiation , it can be a three million rad of radiation .
You can see in the top of the top as his chromosome came .
In 12 hours , 24 hours comes back exactly like was before .
There &apos;s thousands of organisms that I &apos;m able to do .
These organisms can be completely completely .
They can live under the vast .
I &apos;m absolutely absolutely absolutely that life in space , and you &apos;re sounds to find new environments .
In fact , NASA showed that that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built using these proceed , just using the lieventually , by the seged segments to get .
The lift of the assemble .
This image was not taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a great molecule that we can see the myth with a myroscope .
These are the photos that coat a time of six seconds .
This is the published that we did a little time ago .
I &apos;m more than 580,000 lls of code .
It &apos;s the largest molecule of a definitely created by the man .
It &apos;s a three-e-e-million .
If you &apos;re going to be a career 10 without spaces , we want 142 pages only for transcation to transcated this gene gene .
Now , how can we work work ? How can we do it ?
Of course , I mean , a virus is a game from the guys .
It &apos;s a little more complicated when they use bacteria .
It &apos;s the simple , as it &apos;s of the cells , you can just get nuclear and a can just extrary and put another , which is basically basically the process of clonation .
In the bacteria , the Gomosome is instead of integrated inside the cell , but we &apos;ve got a little bit of a trapk of a trapiant , a complete of a chromosome from a cell cell to another and a cell of a cell of a cell cell .
We have a cromosome a parent of a microbial species .
The two are different as the men from the mouth .
We add some gene in a more way to decide that I decided to decide to be able to be able to be able to be able to decide .
And then the way to kill all protected to the way to kill all protected .
And when we put in the cell , the new is , and apprecise , and you &apos;re going to have our graphics -- the new cromes , it &apos;s a new chchromosome .
And we were thinking that we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to get more in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We discovered that the antisime , they have a second or a third cromosome from some part , and a third of a new trouble of the new stretch of that species .
So , who think of evolution as a only gene to the time that it doesn &apos;t understand much part of the biology .
And they &apos;re called the &quot; Galf of the Girt , which is that that adopt digit .
The cromosome that was in the cell , it didn &apos;t have a .
The phones that we have a mit that we have to put it .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other cromosome as material , the masticated , and we got it , and we found out with only the cell and the new chromosome .
It &apos;s got blue blue because of the genes that we have to put .
And in a short short time , all the characteristics of a species , and it &apos;s transformed in a new species , based on the new species , based on the new species , based on the new species , which we put in the cell .
All the protection are changed , and memane are changed , and memane are changed , and when we look at the gene code exactly what we &apos;ve transfed .
Now , this could seem to be a genetic alchemy , but it &apos;s DNA can change the DNA , we can change the stuff in a very well .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that there &apos;s not genesis -- but progress of the genesis , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the explosian version of the explosian of the Cambrian that that we &apos;re going to be a based on this digital .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s enough when we think it &apos;s about our need .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion people to 9 billion people to 9 billion people in the next 40 years .
Right for an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each exist in 1946 ; in 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re going to be problems now to find food , water , and the pollue , and the south for six billion people .
It &apos;s going to be more than billions .
We &apos;re going to use more than five billion barrier than 30 billion bars .
That means 100 million barret a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process for repushing them , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
And the more we have to realize of the CO2 emission of these materials that you &apos;re going to get into the atmosphere .
At the time , thank you scientific discovery in the whole world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the components for the future .
The electronic industry has only a dozen about components , and think about some different things are .
Our limits here are data here , the biological , and the imagination .
Now , we have technique , because of these methods of synththththththids , that we call genomic genomic combinatory .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can produce a million cromosomes a million crosses a day .
Think of the processing these 20 million different different different different or to try to make a lot of vaccines , new vaccines , new vaccines , we can change , we can change , and create more biology . We can change , and create more biology .
And it &apos;s just a bunch .
We can choose for survival , production chemical or of the fuel , production of vaccines .
This is an an an an anea of a few software programmed that we &apos;re working to be able to be able to design .
Well , we don &apos;t know how it will be .
We know exactly what the gene is their gene code .
Now , we &apos;re focusing on the fourth of the fourth generation .
You also saw you that extract from the grain was an experiment .
We have coal of second and third generation , which is used to be a clock of the clock of the clock of the highest different kinds of butanle , or different kinds of butanle .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increasingly the cost of food and limlimited the food and limlimits CO2 in the matter , which we &apos;re working for the cells that we &apos;re working to design cells that can reach this goal , and we think we could have the first oil oil .
The solar solar combined with CO2 is a metodownnine -- but in our discoveries in all the world , we &apos;ve found different different metods .
This is a organism that we &apos;ve got to described in 1996 .
It &apos;s going to be in the ocean , about 2500 feet of the well-a-half of the water .
They create a molecular CO2 using the CO2 using using the molecular energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can indog CO2 , which can easily be transported , converted that CO2 in the coal , converted that CO2 in the coal , to drive this process .
So , we think we could be able to be able to increase what the question of the question of , &quot; which is the human , &quot; is , we have the moon of the entire industry .
Right . If you don &apos;t do that at TED , where you can &apos;t that TED ?
It would be a major source of energy .
And the way , we &apos;re working to use the same methox .
You saw this year with influence , we &apos;re always back to a year and with a dollar in the least , and it &apos;s going to find the right vaccine .
I think what you can change build vaccines in anticip .
Here &apos;s how the future could start seem to be changing , now , the tree of evolution , accellating evolution with the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the argues , and inend cells .
We &apos;re so so much of the way to make people .
Our goal is to do a lot of a long way to try to make it . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the most quickly possible , a few work , the new technology that we took the Microsoft in the following a year . This is Seadrich . This is Seadring .
It &apos;s a local environment that you can interact is at the local level that , which reflat with a huge amount of data .
Here we &apos;re seeing a lot of digital picture with a digital kind of digital photos with a kind of costs and continue , for a faster , and we have the images like we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big is the amount of information that we see , how much are these data or the images .
Most of the digital , and digital , but this for example is a scanning , and this for example is a sent of Congress , and reentral in the gamma of 300 megaps .
It doesn &apos;t make a difference because the only thing that &apos;s the only thing that &apos;s the number of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any moment . It &apos;s also a very flessible architecture .
This is a whole book , not images .
This is the Casa desolate of Dickens . Every colonna represents a caple .
And to demonstring that is right , and not of images , we can do something like that , to really see that it &apos;s about a real representation , not a picture .
It could be a little bit of artificial to read a electronic book .
I don &apos;t have a bit .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s a number of the Guardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a seat .
And it really give you a lot of the great experience of read the real version of a real , or a everyday , or a everyday , which is to nature , which is for nature .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the Guardian .
We created a public fascinating . We &apos;ve created a high high than that that you use in a normal normal normal . And we put it in a normal normal .
If you want to see the characteristic of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even specificfiction .
And this really shows some of these ideas to get the limits of space on the screen .
And we lose that this means that this means that it &apos;s going to be able to be able .
Of course , the map is a more obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this field , I don &apos;t want to say that we have to say that we have to give you this field .
These are all the the United States in the U.S. soved a picture of NASA .
So now , we &apos;re going to do something else .
This is actually from the web , the wild ; you can go to see .
It &apos;s a called Photosynth , which fighting two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research at the computer very interesting .
And it &apos;s from the Web , to the Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , which we can move from another image and have this kind of experience of the multiple .
But the space of the images here has actually a meaning .
The algorititems of the computer , have recorded these images together , in the way that the reduced to the places that the imagined -- all the scatting -- all the scatter , and you see the Roccient Roccient Roccient Roccient : I &apos;m a bunch of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the SSSee .
I don &apos;t know if I have to show you some other other environment .
There &apos;s a lot of the largest .
I want to go directly to one of the original data of Noah-ahs -- and this is that it &apos;s really the first time to work for the first time , to work for the first time the summer , and I want to show you what I &apos;m going to show you what I &apos;m going to show you what I &apos;m going to show you what I &apos;m going to do is the rich .
We had to worry about the legal aspects and saying .
This is a reconstruction of the cattattitude of Nothree Dame images from Flickr . Baf &apos;s about the Baquid . It &apos;s got some kinds of kinds of shes in magazine , and so on . Oach , and saying . Oach one of these constitute , which is discovered it &apos;s a picture that it &apos;s discovered .
So , they &apos;re all images from Flickr and they &apos;re all connected to the space .
And it &apos;s possible to be able to be able to be able to be able .
You know , I &apos;d never thought of end to work for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifiction recreceiving this kind of accounts here .
I think that &apos;s about it &apos;s a lot of different kinds of kinds of fotocaming : from those , the mobile phone in the professional SLR , a number of meaningful , and it together in this environment .
And if you can try to try to look at those more strike .
Many of the bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbblock .
And somewhere there &apos;s a series of photographs -- and it &apos;s tears .
This is a poster of Nobody , three Dame recorded .
We can go from the physics of this environment .
The essential is that we can do the social things with the environment . This is to take data from the entire memory , of the entire memory of how to do it , from the visual point of visual view -- and the all those data together .
All of those pictures become connected together , more than the parts .
You have a model of the entire that emerge .
Think about this as the prolungation of Stephen Lawler on the Earth .
It &apos;s something that grow into complex , as the people use , and the people use , and the vantages for the useful race to get .
They &apos;re mark with metads with them .
If someone comes out of the contrast of all these sweak all these sweak , my picture of the name , my picture of Nobody , you suddenly reminded of all those data , and I can use how to use it for immerely ingrade in that space , using the picture of anybody else , and I have a kind of a little bit of a lot of the guy , and have a little bit of the cross-up .
In course , a consequence of all the kind of virtual , the extremely elaborate of every interesting part of the earth , they &apos;re not just by the wellitary and satellite images and similar , but from memory .
Mille .
Chris Anderson : I realized that that your software is that your software will be able to do is that at some point , in the next years , all the photographs , all the photographs , all the photographs together ?
BAA : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is actually find .
It &apos;s creating the hyperlink , if you want , you to get , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the images .
The thing is very interesting if you think about the remarkable information searching that many of these images .
As you do a research research on the Web , you know , it &apos;s a lot of the phase of the Web has a lot about the pictures .
Now , what happens if that picture is going to be in your picture ?
So the amount of interconnection , and the amount of remarkable , which is really enormous . It &apos;s a classic . It &apos;s a classic .
CA : Well , it &apos;s really amazing . It &apos;s really amazing .
BAA : You will give you very much .
One of the main pleasure when you go and one of the delician of the research is that we could live in the fact , the fact , the most of the antic , between who has no deeping antic , and the houses the past , the houses , the figured in the wind , the bottom , the butter of the plants .
Well , the thinking that the sell Jaguar Jaguar , or the Lattea , or that the &quot; Lattea , or that the Inuit &apos;s still cold , or that in Himalaya , or the distant , or the distant , to remember the Dharm , to remember the Sharm , and the idea of the world that we don &apos;t have a sense of the world , but only one of the idea , but it &apos;s actually , it &apos;s actually a sense of the way , but it &apos;s actually , it &apos;s actually , it &apos;s actually , but it &apos;s actually ,
The consequence of a particular set of the adaptation that our stires did , well or no , many generations .
And of course , we all share of the exextra extremely .
We all have . All of this .
We &apos;re sat the beginning of the beginning .
We have to have to be the inesorability of death , so we don &apos;t surprising if we &apos;re not surprising if we &apos;re going to do .
We all have a art art .
What the colcolcolcolcolcold is the particular of the song , the dance of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that the Penan of the Borneo , or the follow of the Voodoo of the Saiti , or the guerriers of the desert Kaiggn , the Curandander , the Curandander , or a cammas , or a Teast , or a heart in the heart of the Sahara .
He &apos;s been my journey of the journey in the desert a month , or a evator of the His , the Last of the Rolanger , the mother , the mother , the mother of the world .
All of these popular popular popular , there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of the world .
And , if you think a moment , it &apos;s a concepts that can give you hope .
Insil , the miriades of the world creates a race of the world , and cultural life that &apos;s kind of important for the planet and it &apos;s important for the well-based biological life as a biological race .
And you can think about this cultural race as a cultural , and it can definitely define the whole whole concepts of all concepts , and inspire , ideas , inspired , and inspire , inspired , and inspired , and inspired , and inspire , inspired , and inspire , and inspire , and inspired ,
The etnosphere is the great check of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbox of what we are and what we can be in how unquisitive .
And the way , the biosphere was the same same as a really happened to be a very quickly , and too much more quickly .
Nobody biological , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all the species is , or the crisis , or the fit , or -- in the most of the way , or -- in the most apocalitty -- and not not not to get a little bit of biological diversity -- and not not not not even even even a little bit of the biological diversity .
The one of all that is , of course , the perspectrum .
When you &apos;re born 6,000 lingue on this planet .
A language is not compost only from a a series of grammatication or a series of rules .
A language is the Sech of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle of which is the animation of every culture comes in the world .
Each language is a forest , a bunch of mind , a bunch of the mind , a spiritual of the spiritual possibility .
And those 6,000 linges , while we &apos;re sitting in the Monterey , at least half the half of the children .
They &apos;re not going to teach children , the fact , the less than not the camps , which is already death .
What &apos;s the most of the way of the silence , of the silence , of being the last to talk about a language , of the last to not having to transform the wisdom of the anticipate of the children ?
This orring is the state of someone in a few of the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks : every day , the Septempts of a language .
And I know what someone &apos;s going to say , &quot; Is it better that ?
The world would not be a better place if we look at all the same language ? &quot;
We &apos;re going to talk about the koges .
You &apos;re going to be able to say , &quot; I don &apos;t want to tell her her language .
I &apos;d like to do a journey through the etnosphere --
a little journey in the etnososphere to give you a bit of what we &apos;re lost .
Many of us dedealing that when I say , &quot; How many ways of exist .
We take for example this bimbo Barasana , in Amazon , the people &apos;s ange , the people who create the middying , which creates the midance of the Last in the end of the Last in the end of the Last of the grade of the Last in the bread .
It &apos;s a people that &apos;s not able to distinguish the color from the blue , because the time is identified in the time , from the forest , from the time , from the people .
They have a strike in and a matrimonial , dedeaf , &quot; Ramia , &quot; You have to sat a different person that talks about a different language .
All of that has been in the past mitological , but the particularly the particularly , it &apos;s that in these families , the summer , and the course that they &apos;re talking about six or seven .
They &apos;re going to hear and then they start to talk .
We take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived , the Waoran of the Ecuador , a incredible people that had the first contact of the first contact that has had the first contact in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionared , a little bit of a sat a kind of a kind of thing .
They did , they get up from the top of the top of the top of the waste that they were required , dimented that this people in the forest that this people had never seen anything of bi-dimensional forest .
They collected the pictures from the earth , they were around the research of a shape or a shape , or a shape , they were not to be anything , they had to be deaving , and they killed the five missionary missionary .
But Waorani don &apos;t kill only houses .
They had killed between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by their same .
We &apos;re risaled at eight generations and we found two natural death and when we have insisted to know , they have a bunch of their invecting was invecting , and then they got it , and then they got it .
The crisks were able to recognize the animal from 40 pass and recognize the animal .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was a really interesting task when my professor , I wanted to go to Haiti , if I wanted to go to Haiti in the basis of the potence of Duver and Tonton the base of the potence of Duver and Tonton Macid , and it &apos;s been a lot of the hills to do for the sent .
For a sense of the miracolous , I had to understand the culture Vodoudoo is not magnine .
It &apos;s rather a complex view of the world .
Most interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the great religion of the world , what would you say ?
Cristian , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that Africa &apos;s sub-Saharan Africa . And instead , and Voodoo . And instead and Voodoo is not another one that the distilled of these genetic religious religious .
What makes the interesting is the intense is the intense of life and death .
So , the bees are going to be the bear .
The spirites can be invocated by the Grands Actually , they say the race of the dance and they reduced to the soul of the way that for a short moment , which is the follow becomes the following .
And so that &apos;s the voodooists like &quot; V.
We love in the temple and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment that you &apos;re sitting , is the spirit that you can get to you , how you can do that ?
So you see these incredible events : I follow the voodoo in the state of the trance that touch implant that touch imum a rather than the body in the body when it &apos;s catalized in the body when it &apos;s catalized in a very exciting of the body .
And the people with the most extraordinary that I lived the most extraordinary are the Kogi of Sierra Nevada , the Colombia , in Colombia .
I think of the ancient of the the advancer that once they live on the planning of the Colombia in the Pounce of the Colombia , the people get the conquick , the people get the vast of the volcanic that you get on the plant plant plant .
In a continent of blood , this people who has never been conquisted by the spagnles .
And yet , I have been government by a clever , but they were a very extraordinary .
The young follow came up by families , and three or four , and they live secret in a good world and oman instruck in the fourth of the stone of the stone of the fying of the stone for 18 years .
Two years of nine years , of the way to make nine months of gestation that transform in the mother , now , now , they &apos;re now metaphor the Kian Maaforth of the Grands Maaththththththaththththaththththththththththththththaths of the Grands of the Grande Mafort .
For all this time , they &apos;re acculturning values , which are accepts that they &apos;re going to see that their pregnity and only their pregnity and only their pregnity -- or to say , &quot; or to say the balance .
And the term of this incredible , they &apos;re suddenly reported and for the first time in life , at the age of 18 years , see a alba . And in that moment of the first button , when the sun , when the sun the sun , so that we learned in the beautiful beautiful , and it &apos;s going to be a conference in the conference .
&quot; Vison ? Proprium as I said .
It &apos;s amazing . Now , it &apos;s a protect . &quot;
They call the most and say that we , fratles , the minors , we are the cold of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think of Indigene and the environment invoe Rousseau and the old story of the wisdom of the well-selling history , which is a conception , or maybe invite those who are more than these people are more than we are more close to the Earth .
The Indian initional , are not not the nostalks from the nostalks .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the CEast , or in the south of the Asman , but because of the time and I took a mytheme of the earth , and they created a mythic of the Earth not on the conception of the Have , but on a very much more than the Earth is just a real conception .
What does that mean ?
It &apos;s saying that a girls in the Ande that &apos;s a little bit of the the mountain is a Apu that will give her dest to be a human human being being a deeply and it &apos;s going to be a different and it &apos;s going to be a different way with the mountain or that a lot of the mountain of the Montana that &apos;s a bunch of rock .
And that &apos;s the dimer of a mineral or a mineral is irrise .
What is interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia , created that the forests would be crised to be crisis .
And I got a different human being from my friends Kwakiutl that they believe that the forests are the forests are the Hukuk and the bber is the bluk and the dog and the dog , and the cannibal cannibal , which are the initiation in the world , the spirites that they &apos;re going on on the beginning , the becoming in in the world , the bear , and the dog &apos;s buty of the human human human ,
If you start to think these cultures can create different , you can start to understand some of them , you can start to understand some of them . We have this please .
I got this picture to the aprile in Amazon .
Maybe some of you have heard about the ayaahead , the most powerful psychology of the repertory of the repertory .
What makes it &apos;s a fascinating , but its elaboration is not the potential for the basically , but its elaboration . It &apos;s &apos;s compost . It &apos;s compost . It &apos;s compost by two elements .
On a side , this list lessly that contains a series of a coal of the coal , and harver , read a lot of the unlike .
And I &apos;m going to be a bunch of the caffic , but it &apos;s a little bit of the consciousness , but it &apos;s mix with the faight-faight-skin of the caffecting of the caffection of the caffic ,
This planning , this planning , very similar to the seriotonin the seriotonin , dimethypppypamine .
If you &apos;re going to see the Yanoms to the birthyllands that they do from a different species , anchy , it &apos;s a methylyllypamine .
You know that polar on the birth is a little bit like being shown from a four-fight , and to land and land and land on a sea sea .
I got to be a lot of my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has been sent the pink of the funny , with her discovery of the funny , with his discovery in the 1930 in Mexico .
I &apos;m my tis not not a classificate these tripamine as as a allucinent because if you &apos;re not going to tell any of being allowed to be a a lot of being used .
It &apos;s possible to be able to assuit , only if you get the chemicals that denian MAO .
Now , it &apos;s the beautiful : The birth of the Sinince , and the same kind of MAO , the same kind of need to potential to potential the tripamine . The question is the extrouble . The question is that &apos;s the extremely , of the same kind of a lot of a lot of a lot of a chemisphere , but that if you &apos;re going to be a chemical version of the size of the size ?
We use the great eufemism of the error , which can reveal the error ,
But if we ask the Indians , we say , &quot; The plants are going to tell us . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , Cofan , 17 variety of the text , and that distinguished in the forest , and that we would get our eyes in the same species .
If we ask how they &apos;re going to be able to tell us , &quot; I thought , &quot; I thought , &quot; I was the capised of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of them ?
The solution is : They take 17 variety in a night of a letting , and each other , and each other .
With this is not a Harvard to Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting that you have .
Now , in the way , the problem is that also , the problem is that also the people who have the heart people who have the heart people who have a few ways to reduced to our real world , and it &apos;s over .
In fact , the 21st century , between 300 years , it &apos;s not going to be reminded for her , but rather like the was where we &apos;re fermed and we use it and have abbracking and we use it , and we use it , and cultural instrument of the planet . Now the problem is not change .
All the cultures , the income through the way of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indian Sioux , they didn &apos;t stop to be Sioux when they put it from the American , and they have made by Americans don &apos;t have to be American when they put on the hot and hot .
It &apos;s not change or technology that minds the technology that minds of the etnosphere . It &apos;s the power .
The wall wanted to the domination of the domination .
And if you give a look at the world , we see that these are not destined to be .
They &apos;re living living and dynamics and dynamics , from the exist from the exist of the exist .
Sia that you &apos;re disbosing in the check of the Penan --
a nomade of the Sunkkkkle , a subject , a people who lived lights in the forest to a generation , and now reduced to a generation , and now reducing on the way to see the river and the next thing that it looks like to see the river , where you can see the front of the light-up , and the next Borneo , where the SSSSSSince , where the SSSince , where you can see the SSunk , and the SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSample ,
You &apos;re ready to repair the bought to the forest .
Or , in the case of the Yanomami , are the disease that I got to the discovery .
If we go on the mountain of the Tibebet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you see the sent of the policy .
As you know the genocide , the exexpedition , it &apos;s the insection of a , but the hetnoon , but the destruction of a people , not only not only is a no one , but it &apos;s not only not just a a bunch of the style , because it &apos;s part of the development .
And you can &apos;t understand the check of the Tibebet until you &apos;re not part of the beginning .
I got the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in China , through the Western Tibebet , came through the Lhasa with a young bunch , but only came to Lhasa , but only came to Lhasn &apos;t .
6,000 monuments sacrice redust .
1.2 million people killed the military during the military .
The father of this guy was ascritical at the Panchen Lama .
The fact that &apos;s been killed to the time of the invasion .
And the guy &apos;s fat with Sua Santiton the diaspora that has taken the people in Nepal .
Sua mother &apos;s been imprinined and her her her huser was being replaced .
It &apos;s taken up to be a birth of two years , they were going to be living under his gonna because it couldn &apos;t live without him .
The sister , which has been med in field of reeducation .
A day has inverververtised a fashion a fashion , and it &apos;s been med to this transgrsion , it &apos;s been med to seven years .
The pain of Tibebet can be insoppost , but the spirit of the people is from the tener .
And finally , it &apos;s all reduced to a choice .
We want to live in the world the monotony of the monotony or we want to accept the policy of diversity ?
The great anthrologist Margaret Mead , before we had told her that his greater was that , in our own view of the world , not only we &apos;ll see the whole gamp of the world , not only we &apos;ll see the whole gamp of the human imagination .
And it &apos;s a billion years .
The Foundation Neolitic , which has given us us us , which has been done it , which has done it to be the poetry of the sevening of the sell of the south of the East , created the gery of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world industrialized world has to be 300 years .
And that &apos;s the story of the story , I didn &apos;t suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we &apos;re going to get in millenters .
When these myriap of the world is asked what you want to be human , they say , with 10,000 vices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all have to be what we &apos;re going to be what we are : a kind of a confile , which has to make the people and all the giant and all the gies can be . And there &apos;s great moments .
I got this picture on the north of the island of Baffin , when I went to the balance of the Inuit , and this man , and this man , and this man , and this man , and this man , and this man , and this man , and this man , and this man , and this man , and this man , and this man , and this man , and this man , and this man , and this man , and this , I went to me to tell me the wonderful story of the &quot;
The government is not always been gentile with the Inuit and in the 1950s for the &apos; 50s to depend our sevil , we have to give them in colonies .
The grandmother of this man , you get to go .
The family , I &apos;m going to get all the beat all , and all his attracting .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t have the cold ,
The pushing the sliter in origin , were fact of the fish , in the skin of the clock .
The grandmother of this man didn &apos;t have intimimix from the night or the boundation or from the byzed that was .
It &apos;s sweak , it &apos;s calculated the panting , and defecting the panting and defecated in your hand . When the fell , they &apos;re sun , and they work with a lama .
It &apos;s got a salive on the head of this tells of this crisis , he got killed a dog .
He &apos;s got a brighter , and created a brighter , with the clower clower , he has been been made a sliter , he &apos;s been been been on on the banking , the tells of the banking , and it &apos;s a bunch of crisis .
We want to talk about the horse with nothing ?
In the 1999 , the 1999 , the government has reduced to Inuit , the total control of a greater area of the Texas mesmate .
It &apos;s their new check . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a Indipendent territory . We &apos;re all all the mineral resources .
One splendit example of how a natione-state could reflying with her people .
And , to end , I think it &apos;s rather obvious at least at least at least at least at least at the planet , and it &apos;s not remote .
For someone &apos;s house .
They have been working on the human imagination that they get to the alba of the time . And for all of these children , as the sun of our children , as the swise of our children , become part of the hope .
And in the end , we have to be able to convince that politicians will never get to anything .
We believe that the polemics --
&#91; &#91; Applausers are not not lost , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and perhaps we &apos;re the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month . Every month . Every month . Every month .
156 countries transmit , we have our dog television .
Our reviews are lected by millions of people .
Our work is travel in the etnosynosphere to bring our public public in the way of the reveal and cultural , and you hope , and you hope , and you hope , and we hope , to be able to the central anthroughout of the anthroughout of the exist in diversity , and we need to find a style world , and we need to find a style in the world , and we need to find a lot of the way of the way to get out of the public in the public public public public public .
where the sample of all the people can be collective to our well-being collective .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope to be a other that you &apos;ve heard and print to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the dogram . &quot;
The dogram of what ?
The dogram of all the industrial society of the Western society , the Western official official , &quot; If we want the cold to be our citizen , &quot; The way to do is the individual . &quot;
The reason , from a side , in fact that the freedom is in the same , it &apos;s predictable , it &apos;s previous , of human beings .
On the other is in fact that if we are lifeed , each of us can be able to be able to do all that that massive our well-being , without any that decide in our well-being , without any that decide in our own .
The way to the freedom is the freedom is the choice .
The more choices , the people have , more , and more is their freedom , and the freedom , it &apos;s their well-being .
This , I think , it &apos;s so deeply deeply in the society that nobody nered dreams .
And it &apos;s also deeply deeply deeping in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what the progress has been possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not very big .
I lose a simple notice on the &quot; ments for insects .
In my supermarket , there &apos;s 175 conditions , without contact 10 various various , of the olf of the oled 12 acets of 12 acets that you can buy for a huge number of the number of the rings in the inccient circle that nobody &apos;s 175 ready is of your 175 .
Here &apos;s the supermarket .
And then you go to the electronic store : you go to a stereo : the letter , the CD , radio , the CD , the CD , the lifer .
And in this single store , the electronic of electronic components .
We can make six million different combinations using the components that there are in a only store .
You have to put that there &apos;s a very much choice .
Alaster : the world of the communications .
One time , when I was a child , they could get all the telephone services , to the cat that they were supposed to be Bell .
It &apos;s the telephone , you didn &apos;t buy it .
One of that , between the other , was that the telephone never .
These times are gone .
We have a very much of the telephone , specially between the phones .
Here &apos;s the phones of the future .
My favorite is in a middle , and MP3 , ccles of the birth , and forth for the chchchchchchk for the crosses .
If you don &apos;t have seen in the store , you &apos;re very much that I &apos;m going to be able to be .
And what &apos;s the end of the end is that people go into the store and what &apos;s the answer ? The answer is &quot; No . &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a phone that doesn &apos;t too much .
So , in other aspects of the life that are much more important than the trouble , you know , the same explosial of choices .
Assistence : It doesn &apos;t happen in the United States that you &apos;re going to be in the doctor and the doctor what you have to do .
Instead , you know , from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do a , or B , &quot; A , &quot; A has these benefits and these benefits and these benefits and these benefits and these benefits . What you want to do ? &quot;
I mean , &quot; Dr. &quot; Dr. : What would I do ?
And the doctor says , &quot; A has these benefits and those and those are the benefits and those benefits and those benefits . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you get to the &quot; Dr. if she was me , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result of the &quot; authonomy of the Man , &quot; Hespression that makes it seem a beautiful thing .
But it &apos;s not that one to move the fish and the responsibility of the understanding of the decisions of the decisions of someone knows something , and it &apos;s the doctor , to something that doesn &apos;t know -- and so much of the ideal , and so it doesn &apos;t tell it -- and so not in the ideal .
There &apos;s a huge marketing products of products , directly to people like me and you , and you think it &apos;s not a sense , because you think it &apos;s not a sense , which we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why they adadvers ?
The answer is that they want to ask the doctor to ask the doctor to ask the requick .
Something that &apos;s the kind of like is our identity is a question of the way , as you see in this vignant , &quot; We don &apos;t want to forget the children . They &apos;re going to be able to be a right now , &quot; We need to inventing .
And we can reinvented us .
The means that every morning , you have to be a decide , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I got to the family and the matrimonum , a time the common , a common , I was that there was that we had to be a more pression , and it started to be able , and it started to be able , and it started to be able .
The only real choice was with who , not when and even what to do after .
Each , all is really to play .
I &apos;m going to talk about the students very smart , and 20 percent in less than a time .
And not because they &apos;re not less , because they &apos;re not because they &apos;re less diligenes .
But why are I impenguing , I mean , I would ask you , &quot; I would have to be doing that ? &quot;
&quot; I would be going to be going to be about ? I think before ? I think before the children or to be ? &quot;
I &apos;m interrogen logorers .
And they try to answer to these questions , even if this implica not to be a beautiful voice and not to get a beautiful voice and not get a beautiful voice .
And they really have to do that .
Now , the job : We &apos;re lucky , as Carl Hotel Randoler , because technology allows us to work , every day , from every day , from every day , from the Hotel Randolph Randolph .
I &apos;m talking about , there &apos;s a angoline , and I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; nobody where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t tell that , because I want to use it .
What means , this incredible liberty of choice that we have about this ? It &apos;s that we have to be able to be , and it &apos;s going to work or not .
We can go to see our son &apos;s son , with the cell cell , with the cell , the Blackberry in other , and the notebook , and the notion , on the ginocy .
And even if I &apos;m all all all , we see our son , we see our son , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; I &apos;m also asking to this ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m going to answer this email ? I used this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is &quot; no , &quot; This makes the experience of your son , very different from your son .
So , from any time , we look at all , little things and the whole , life is a question of the life , life is a choose .
One time the world was this : The real , there were some chance , but it wasn &apos;t a question .
The world of today is what the world is , &quot; The dilemma is , &quot; It &apos;s a positive positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Seply .
The positive positive thing we know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative .
All of this comfortable to two , two negative ,
The first , paradadadly , it &apos;s that it &apos;s products .
With many options between which choose , it becomes very difficult .
I give you a significant example : a study of the foundation of the foundation .
A colleague has been accepted to the Vanderdered , the giant society of the founded of a million clients , with about a million clients .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offering in the more , the percentage of the two percent .
With 50 , 50 offerers , there &apos;s 10 percent in less than the rown of the time when they &apos;re available ?
Because with 50 source of the between which choose , it &apos;s no hard to decide , and the choice is reduced to the intimate .
And I &apos;m still , and still in the Sorea , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of
You know that it &apos;s not only that these old people who are going to be enough money for the song because they &apos;re not going to say that the decision is so much money , it &apos;s so so that they also lose the source of the dator .
Not particularly particularly , they &apos;re going to be able to five dollars from the dator , which would be well .
So the paralive is a consequence of the tropes .
And I think that &apos;s the world .
&quot; And for the end , for the eternity : ketchup , or the hetchon ? &quot;
Would you like to take the right decision , if it &apos;s for the eternity , true ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and neat the wrong .
So this is the first effect . The second is that if we can get to the parallit and make a choice , to be less than we could be less options from the result of how we could we have been less options of how we choose .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many of the people who choose , and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to be to imagine that you could make a different choice that would be better . And what &apos;s going to be able to be able to be able to the housness , and the remarkable to the choice , and the remarkable to the choice , and the repaid , and the saving , and the sent , and the refell ,
And then when it was a very good decision .
The more choices there are , more easy , it &apos;s easy to be undramatic that is inssweden of the option .
And the most , there &apos;s what economists call called conscious .
Dan Gilberbert has clearly really good stamp as the value that we &apos;re going to think about what we &apos;re going to do with .
And the rest , when there are many options , it &apos;s easy to represent the characteristic of the alternative alternative and being less less than the option of the option that it &apos;s choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I use with all of the ones that are not in New York .
But it &apos;s what you probably probably think .
There &apos;s this copy of Hamptons .
A place .
Spig . Ottttle . Ottttle . It &apos;s all all for them .
It &apos;s not not a . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , it &apos;s Agust . &quot;
&quot; Everybody in Manhattan . &quot;
&quot; I could parking up up in front of the house . &quot;
And it &apos;s two weeks later from the idea that &apos;s the perdying -- every day -- the chance of parking where it wants .
The costs of the opportunity to be minuum for that we have , even when the choice was , even when the choice was .
And the more are the options that we have to think , more the characteristics , the most of the costs of the costs of the cost of it .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
There &apos;s a living time , and perhaps of living in the way .
But the most important point is that anything you choose , you know , you know , you know , you know , the other .
The things that we don &apos;t choose many of the actual that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : I &apos;m going to be expectation .
I tried to my skin my skin a new new jeans .
I &apos;m almost always always always jeans .
One time , the jeans were just a kind of , and they bought and vast , they were sat , only after they had them to take a lot of times , only after they took them a lot of times , they started to go well .
And so , I went to buy a couple of new when the old who were went , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my caught . &quot;
The commit said , &quot; Li wants to be , &quot; You know , you know , it &apos;s a fit ? &quot;
Would you want to do with the certain bottons ? &quot;
&quot; Li wants to strained ? &quot;
&quot; Sam takes a stretch ? Bbil , &quot; Continuum -- &quot; Continuum .
I was sent , and after a little bit , and after a little bit , I want the kind of -- that was the only kind of , &quot; He didn &apos;t have any idea of what it was so for a moment I tried to all the &quot; &quot; I was going to get out of the store , and then the best of the guy , and then the next few of jeans that I had .
It was the last . With all the choice .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse that I was worse , the jeans had a altised , the jeans to be perfect .
I was expectation . I didn &apos;t expectent me . I didn &apos;t expectively , when it was just a kind of , but when you saw 100 different , at least a kind of a thing .
What I had the buried was good , but not perfectly .
After I started to the check that I was inssed in the waiting waiting to expectation .
The added of options in life , it doesn &apos;t increase the expectations that these have to be able to the options .
And this will be less sweeply , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the marketing , if you realize .
Because if they knew it , you don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more to this .
&quot; It was the best when you was worst , &quot; The reason that was the worst , it was the worst , it was still possible to meet .
Other , in the world that we live -- opultimate , industrialized , the most expectancy -- the last we can hope is that we can hope is that things are in the altheater of expectation .
You &apos;re not going to be surprised because your expectation , my waiting waiting , my waiting .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Well , &quot; Yeah , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , &quot;
I mean , I mean , I mean , I &apos;m really really really really been been been , and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t have to be able .
But it &apos;s not always always , it &apos;s a brutt .
And finally , a result of the buy a couple of jeans , and you say , &quot; Why is this kind of jeans is that when you &apos;re not ssat , and you ask , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who &apos;s responsible ? &quot;
The world is the responsible . What could I do I do ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of jeans , and you buy a inssweak , and you ask you who is the responsible , it &apos;s the obvious , it &apos;s the obvious , it &apos;s the responsible , is so so that the responsible you .
You could do better .
With hundreds of various various , there are no scene for the success .
So when people get decisions , even though the result is , you &apos;re valido , they feel insent and they &apos;re going to be a cold and they &apos;re going to be .
In the last years , depression is exploke in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only , but important -- of this is the depression of this depression is right that people have been too alty .
And when they have to explain this situation thinking that the cold is .
So the final result is that in general , but we feel worse .
Let me remember that .
This is the dogram , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely fairly . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no no double that a little bit of choice is the best that it &apos;s better that it &apos;s not a lot of choice is better than a little bit of it &apos;s a little .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic . I don &apos;t know what .
But I &apos;m sure we have been so much that we have to get our life .
Now , from the politician -- I almost finished -- the politician , the notion is the follow .
What it allows all this in the industrial society is the remarkable material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have no trophy .
The problem is that they have too much .
So the cencentered that I &apos;m talking about is a bad maling of modern modern , the Western society ,
And what it &apos;s depressing and arrator is this : Steve Levitt talked about how those expensive and sat the seat of how those expensive and uneful seat the robbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbber of money .
I mean , I mean , I mean , and dispenpend , it &apos;s not that they &apos;re just used to be inutionary .
I &apos;m saying , I &apos;m going to be deleteries .
They have worse .
If a little of what in our society is allows a lot of choice , it was removed into those where people has too too much much possibility , it &apos;s not only their life to make a lot of our .
This is what economists call a imparaling imimparaling .
A retion of the income of the income -- not only to the poverty -- because of this is a lot of the poverty ,
And to conclude , &quot; Full , you can get all that you want to --
You know , people , think , &quot; But what do you think , &quot; What do you think that fish ?
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t make anything in a glass . &quot;
&quot; A very imagination , a limited view of the world -- &quot;
and I got the interpretated so , at the beginning .
But then , I think about , instead , I realized that that that that fish knows that that the fish knows .
Because the fact , the fact , it &apos;s that if you &apos;re in the franx , the way that it &apos;s possible , &quot; You don &apos;t have the freedom . You know , it &apos;s the paralallight-.
If you take the bocl in the way that all of divents that all of the sweat .
You &apos;re going to be , and you get the well-being .
They all need a sphere .
This is almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost for the fish , and so so much for us .
But the assuit &apos;s a remote for inhappiness and , and I &apos;m , and I &apos;m , to the rovine .
Thank you .
