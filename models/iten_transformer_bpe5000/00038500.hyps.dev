Last year , I showed these slides to demonstrate that glacial calculus , which for almost three million years had the size of 48 , the United States has 48 size .
But this subtle the gravity of the problem because it shows the gravity of the problem because it shows the ice shouter of the ice .
The arctic calculus is , in some sense , the heart of global climate system .
It expanded in the winter and summer .
The next slide is going to be a carrying quick on the last 25 years .
The glaces have been signed in red .
As you see , they &apos;re expanding to the dark blue .
That &apos;s the winter ice , which is going to be summer .
You can see that the so-called ice lost , about five years or more , it &apos;s like the blood , that &apos;s like blood , which I was out of the body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s gone from this , so .
This is a problem because it &apos;s a heavy heat around the arctic ocean where there are enormous amount of frozen coaled that , the shoulder , they turn into metane from the microbes .
I &apos;m going to use to the total pollution of global warming , that amount could double , that amount could double , overwhelmed this is not back .
In some deeper lakes in Alaska methane is already rolling from the water .
professor Katey Walter at Alaska University of Alaska &apos;s team at the last winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : She &apos;s good . The question is if we &apos;re also going to be .
One reason is that this thermal exchange termal , Groenland from the north .
This is a river in the glacial regime .
He took him never achieved like that .
This is the Kangerlussuaw , in the southwest of Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level to be shrimp for the shells on land , it &apos;s where the sea level reaches on the sea level .
These currents are increasing rapidly .
On the other side of the planet : Antarctica , the largest block of ice on the planet .
Last month , scientists have declared that the ice balance of ice is in negative , and the Western Antarcttttica , which pogate on some submarine islands , it &apos;s particularly quiry .
Equival at six feet of the foot , like in Groenland .
Sulla Himalaya , the third largest block of ice , you see new lakes , that few years ago .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population received by the way .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the water than this city .
The ported is increased .
But when it decreases , the same happens to water .
In California , snow on the Sierra Nevada is declined for 40 percent .
The hyrolls are in the crisis .
The predictions , as you have bed , they &apos;re grave .
The increasing safe in the world leads to a remarkable increases .
The environmental disastern disastern disaster out of normal and unpreceded .
Four times as many times in the last 30 years I was before 75 .
This is an unsustainable training .
If you look at it in the historical context they can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 , every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day .
Look at the top of the Pacific Eastern Pacific , in the west , and on both parts of the Indian subcontinent , where there &apos;s an oxygen impacts of oxygen in the ocean .
The greatest cause of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossil fuel use .
oil is a problem , and coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the more emissions , together to China .
And it would propose to build a lot of other coal centers .
But we &apos;re seeing a change of direction .
These are annullated projects in the last few years and some green alternative vers .
Anyway , there &apos;s a policy in our country .
The coal industries have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote for clean coal , which is a bone .
That image would remind me something --
Verso Christmas , in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a loss of 3.8 billion loss of coal supply .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen it on news .
This is the second largest flow in America .
It &apos;s happened around Christmas .
Number Christmads of one of the coal industries was this .
Video : Well , yeah , yeah , it &apos;s a happy ,
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and we grow our economy .
Frosing the carbon is increasingly clean .
It &apos;s a good price , adorable and workable .
Al Gore : West Virginia .
The biggest companies in the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I &apos;m going to be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosy , Harry Reid -- don &apos;t know what they are talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alliance for the Clima Protection of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : ALergy : ALergy , we see climate change as a business threat to our business .
For that our priority is to invest a huge amount of money in a public effort to make public and confused the coal truth of coal .
In fact , coal is not sports .
We think it &apos;s clean -- it also has a good profumo .
So you don &apos;t press climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Attore : Carbon -- you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
So let &apos;s make a turn into a structure at the avanguard of it , as it &apos;s about pulit coal .
Straordinary ! I machines are a little noise , but this is the sound of the fuel technology .
The coal consumption is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology that you see changes everything .
You look at this : this is the clean odien technology .
Al Gore : Finally , the good alternative is connected to the economic issue and national security .
Video : America is in crisis ; America is the economy , national security , climate crisis .
The philos that links all : our employees from fossil fuels , as the coal and oil imported .
Now , though , there &apos;s a new , auduty solution to go .
Repower : 100 percent clean energy , in a 10 years .
A plan for America to make us more security , and help stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that drink to solve our problems .
Repower America . You find more .
Al Gore : That &apos;s the last .
Video : It &apos;s about it to America .
One of the fastest ways of bringing the addiction of fuel that killing our planet .
Comparsa : The future is here . Sun , a new energy network .
Comparse number two : New investimate for jobs .
Comment : Repower . It &apos;s time to be realistic .
Al Gore
If you want to go away , go together . &quot;
We have to go far , fast .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I made an introduction on LHC .
And promises to come back to you how the machine works .
So here they are . And for those that the other time , the LHC is the greatest scientific experiment ever tried -- 27 kilometers of circumconference .
Her task is to rear the conditions that were lower than a billionth of the universe -- until 600 million times per second .
That &apos;s just ambitious .
This is the machine under Ginevra .
And we would take this mini-Big Bang in in the rellevers .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLAS -- it &apos;s about 22 meters .
This is a spectacular image of ATLAS in construction so you can see the proportions .
The Ten September 10 years , we put the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLATLATLS .
It was because of immenses in the control room .
It &apos;s a picture of particles who did all the way around the LHC , in the collision , deliberately , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles inside the detector .
In other words , when we looked at that picture the 10 September , we realized that the machine worked , which was a great victory .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to get us more or this , when somebody went to Google and saw that the initial page was this .
That means that we had a cultural impact beyond the scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , we had to look at these files .
These files will take 13,000 ampbs when the machine works at the most of the power .
Now , the technicians between you will look at the files and will say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . They are too subtle . &quot;
And they can do it because when they &apos;re very cold of becoming the so-called files .
So , at least 271 degrees , at lower temperature to the space between the stars , these files can bring that current .
In one of the junture between the most of the magnetets in LHC , there was a defect of fabrication .
So , the files overheated slightly , and the 13,000 bulks suddenly met a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think of these magnets are weighs more than 20 tons , and they moved of about 30 inches .
They &apos;re damaged about 50 magnetes .
We had to take them , what we did .
We reflew them .
Now , they are now coming back all to them underground .
By the end of the LHC LHC will be new integrary .
We &apos;re going to accept that , and we expect to get the data or July , and we keep our adventure to find out what the universe is .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents get the debate about the value of science and science and frontier engineering . It &apos;s easy to be confutuent .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so difficult , the fact to go beyond the limits , I think is the value of things like LHC .
I &apos;d like to conclude with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey Davy Davy , which , I guess , in the defense of income experiments of his clean , his pupile was Michael Faday , he said , &quot; Not so dangerous for the progress of human mind as well as the ideas of science as being definitely as the idea of human mind as the mind as the ideas of science , and that there are complete , and that there &apos;s no new monds .
Thank you .
I want to start thinking about rethinking about when , as children , you play with your morning .
Whereas you could achieve it and grab them , take them and get them and get them , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , how to deal with space relations .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way that we understand most of the world around us .
So , by the useful information of our interaction with physical objects , together to my own Pattains , and to my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I began to wonder , &quot; And if , when we use a computer , instead of having a computer , instead of having only a computer , instead of having only a little bit of the mouse that &apos;s going on a desktop , we could say , &quot; House with both hands ,
and put it on our pleasure ?
And the question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big interactive computer like a cookie .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big interactive computer like a cookie .
And you can move with them , they can see them , &quot; they can see , &quot; and they have a screen and they have a screen and a wireless radio .
But mostly , they &apos;re physical objects , like the morning , you can just move out .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate digital information .
And as they get more physics , as they get more physics , of others , and as they become more physical , of the motion , the other , of the movement , of others , how we can explore and fun styles of interaction .
I &apos;m going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show video : if you include it in one direction , it &apos;s going to rotate on the other side .
These interactive portraits are aware of the other people .
If I relevant them , they &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re around .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can act a little bit .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can act a little bit .
They also have their motion and inclination .
And then I realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was to be able to use communal gestures on data , as if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Sifounded configured as versus like painting , and I can use them for the color in the central , where they mix .
and I can use them for the color in that central , where they get .
It &apos;s too , we can put a little bit of it .
There are also beautiful possibilities of learning , like languages , like languages , the mathematics and logic games where people can try to try things fast , and see the results right out .
Now I &apos;m --
This is a Fibonacks that I do with a equations program .
Here we have a words of words that &apos;s in the middle of Scarabeers and Boggle .
Basically , to every Siftable of a letter on every Sifton , basically , at every Turn , you would have a letter to every Siftable on every Siftable on Siftable , and while you &apos;re trying to compose words on a dictionary .
And then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new set of letters and new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the children came up to the Media Lab , I did so that I came up and went to the video .
They were very much pleased .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people many instructions .
You just say , &quot; Compons of words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
So here &apos;s other people who try it .
This is our beta textent here on the right .
In fact , it just wanted to stick them .
And they were only covers , for him .
Now , this is an interactive cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool for learning languages . He &apos;s Felix . He &apos;s Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , relevant to them .
It can put new characters in the scene , relevant to them .
So , it &apos;s going to go out the sun .
Video : The sun is sun .
David Merrill : Now he took a treor the scene .
Video : The orange trewer .
Well , good job ! Yeah .
So , you shake the Siftable , and you can get the characters --
Video : Bau !
... by inventing your story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s an open story with open , and it can decide him how to do it .
DM : It &apos;s an open story with open , and it can decide him how to do it .
Video : Vola , cat .
DM : The last example that I have the time to show you is a tool that I did to show you , to sample and performing music .
It &apos;s an instrument , to sample and performing music .
The Siftable here are from sounds like the bottom and the battery .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose .
You can also put these sounds on a sequence of your pleasure .
And you just put it just to touch a sound and a sequence .
These are actually that you can control the alive , like the reverse and the filter .
The attacks to a particular sounds and then cline to fix it .
And then there are general effects as time and volume , which is apply to the whole sequence .
Let &apos;s look at how it works .
Video : We &apos;re going to put one base in two Siftable , &quot; sequence , &quot; sequence , &quot; we put them in a series , we extended it in a series , we extended another base .
I &apos;m going to put a bottom line .
Video : Now I put some percussions --
Video : And now I &apos;m going to put the filter to the battery , so I can check the effect of alive .
Video : I know , I can revealing the entire sequencing time from one side or the other .
Video : I &apos;m going to add the bottom to the lowest filter .
Video : DM : I can get the sequence to the sequence .
So , I don &apos;t have to plan this first , but I can suddenly make it longer or fair .
And now , finally , I can smoking the entire sequence I can smoking the entire sequence on the left Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new interfacial interfaces that the brain and the body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to transmit is that &apos;s coming this new generation of objects to interact with digital media , which will bring information into our world that we want .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;m not going to talk to all of you .
I &apos;m a writer .
Sort books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the fascinating of my life .
And I don &apos;t expect that to change .
But , he said , something special has happened in my life and my career , and my career , which led me to report the whole relationship to this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called &quot; Mangia , Prega , Ama , &quot; which , differently from my previous books , for some reason came out in the world and became a great , sensational bestseller .
And the result is that everywhere now , people are treating as if I was convicted .
It &apos;s really -- convicted , conducted !
They come from me now , everybody worried and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t fear to be able to do better than that ?
You don &apos;t fear to keep writing for all of life without being able to create a book that could care for someone ? &quot;
what could matter to anybody ? &quot;
It &apos;s rassuring , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember more than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was an adolescent -- I wanted to be a writer .
I would go to the same reaction based on the fear .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t I think he couldn &apos;t succeed ?
You don &apos;t fear that the humiliation of your refigured ?
You don &apos;t fear to do this mesh for all life without anything that &apos;s ever out , and to die on a cumle of dreams with the mouth to love of wooks with the mouth of failure ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yeah , I &apos;m afraid of all those things .
I always had fear .
And I &apos;m also afraid of many other things that people can &apos;t have to ininate .
Like the algagae and other things .
But , as far as I wrote what I thought , and I would ask me is why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logical that anybody should expect to be frightened by a job that you feel like to do .
But what &apos;s about so particular in the creative companies to make us nervous about mental health mental health as a way that other careers do not do ?
As my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer , and I don &apos;t remember one time in his 40 years of activities that they were afraid to be engineer ?
There was never -- that block of the engineer John , how do you go ?
It didn &apos;t work that , you know ?
Onestly , chemicals like group have not certainly , in centuries , in centuries , earlier the reputation of being alcaught .
We writers , we have enough this reputation , and not only writers , but we have this reputation of being enormous mement .
And it &apos;s not supposed to look at the sad of the sad of the magnifies that , only in the 21st century , died young and often by hand .
And the ones who don &apos;t have suicked to be really disdisappeared by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview , he said , &quot; Every book book has killed me a little bit more . It &apos;s an amazing statement about his life &apos;s work .
But we don &apos;t beat when we hear it , because we &apos;ve heard these things so long that we &apos;ve completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and accepted the notion that creativity and the suffering are in some way that art and the suffering are in some way .
And the question I want to ask everyone here today is : Are you agree with this idea ?
It &apos;s good for you -- because it also looking at a centimeter to me , it &apos;s not good for me .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous , and I don &apos;t want to see it in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our big creative minds .
And certainly , I know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to begin to escape to the way of support of support , the circumstances that I &apos;m in my career .
That &apos;s -- I look at , I &apos;m pretty young , I was about 40 years old .
I still have about four jobs in me .
And it &apos;s very likely to write about what I &apos;m going to write about the world as the work as the work that came out after the world &apos;s success of my last book .
I &apos;m going to be suck , because we &apos;re all over here -- it &apos;s likely that my greatest success is in my shoulders .
Oh , Gesu , what thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that brings a person to start drink in the nine morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would like to keep on doing this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how do that ?
And so it seems to me , after many reflections , that the way to work to keep writing is to create a real psychological , right ?
I &apos;ve got to some way to find a security distance between me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxiety on which reach can get . And as I tried for all last year , trying to find others to see if they could have better ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthier
about how to help creative people to deal with creative risks .
And that research took me to the ancient and ancient Rome .
Secting me because I come up and then comes back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity was creativity solved by men , OK ?
It was thinking that creativity was this spirit guardivine , and that came to men somewhat distant and men somehow distant and unknown and unknown , for distant reasons .
The Greeks called these spirits divine divines of creativity .
Socrate , wonderful , wonderful , he believed he had to have an elargiva wisdom from far .
Romans were the same idea , but they called that kind of spirit without a body genius .
Which is great , because the Romans didn &apos;t really think a genius was a particularly intelligent .
They figured that a genius was this kind of divine that was created in the walls of an artist , a little bit like the electric of a little bit like the elected work of the artist , and it turns out the outcome of that work of the artist and shape the result of that work .
So , here &apos;s the distance of which I talk about -- that &apos;s the distance of which I &apos;m talking about -- that &apos;s psychological construction that comes from your work .
And everybody knew it was how it worked , right ?
So the antic artists were protected by certain things , like the too narcism , right ?
If your work was exceptional , you couldn &apos;t take all the goods , everyone knew that you &apos;d been helped from this genius .
If your failed work , it wasn &apos;t all your fail , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be an incapable .
And so people think about creativity in the West for a long time .
And then the Renaissance came and everything , and it changed , and it took this big idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe on top of all of the universe and the mysteries and no more to leave space at the detail of the divinity .
This was the principle of the rational principle and people started to think that creativity came out of the idivided .
And for the first time in history , it started to referring to this or that artist as a genius , rather than a person with the genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big error .
I think that allow someone , a simple person to believe to be as a recipient as the source , the essence , the essence and the source of all divine mystery , creative , unknown , unknown and unknown and a responsibility for too big to give to the fragyle for humanity .
It &apos;s like to ask someone to enjoy the sun .
Deform and distores completely ego and distors all of the expectations about performance .
And I think it &apos;s been this pressed for the artists in passed .
And if that &apos;s true , and I think it &apos;s , and I think , the question is now ?
Can we do do it differently ?
Maybe go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t take 500 years of rational thinking in an 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience that would be legitimate scientific suspects on the notion of , so you do that follow people are going on their projects .
I &apos;m not going to convince you all about this thing .
But the question I &apos;d like to ask is -- why not ?
Why wouldn &apos;t you be this way ?
Because it has more sense of anything that I &apos;ve ever heard to explain the exassive impredictable of the process .
A process that , as anybody who has ever tried to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- you know , you don &apos;t comports rationally .
And , in fact , it can sometimes look like paranormal .
I did this encounter recently recently with the extraordinary poem Ruth Stone , who has now been a poem for all life and he said to me that during the rural Virginia , working in the rural Virginia , working out in the fields , and he felt it , in if when a poetry came out .
He told me that it was like a train of air .
And that was rolling to come up with her landscape .
He felt it , because he could make the earth under his feet .
He knew he had one thing to do to do at that point and was , his words , &quot; run as a match . &quot;
And so he was going to the house , and he was actually followed by this poem , and it wouldn &apos;t have to take a piece of paper and a match enough , as the page .
Sometimes he couldn &apos;t be quick enough , so corrective and corrective and corrective without going to be able to come to the house , and she would continue to rolling through the landscape , and she &apos;d continued to rolling through the landscape , as she said , &quot; another poem . &quot;
And then there were these times -- this piece , I &apos;ll never forget -- there were moments when there were almost losing , right ?
So , he was running home and he was looking for the paper and the poem passed through , and he was passing a match in the while he was passing , and then he said , he was like to put up with the other hand and the office .
It was offered poetry from the tail , and he would put it in his body and moved to the page .
And in these cases , poetry would be presented on the perfect page , but the contrary , from the last word to the first word .
So when I heard it -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly equal to my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conduction !
I &apos;m a moving , and my way to work is , and my way to work is ; wake up to the same orary every day and work and go up and go above us .
But even me , in my summit , I struggled against that thing , sometimes .
And I guess many of you have the han done .
You know , even though the work and ideas came up to me from a certain source , I could not quite honestly know it .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it in a way that we can &apos;t lose your head , but rather , what do we have to be healthy ?
As I am about , the best contemporary example that I have is Tom Waits musician music that I interviewed several years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life was the incarnation of the artist tormented to control , trying to control , management these species of impulses creative impulses .
But then he invecked , he hot , and one day he was driving on a highway in Los Angeles , he changed everything for him .
He was going fast , and all of a sat this little piece of apples of melody , coming in his mind as inspiration , and the hair , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and it wants , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and it doesn &apos;t know how to take it .
It doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a match .
So it starts to hear this kind of old anxiety , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to go obsessed from this even even .
I &apos;m not quite good enough , and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going into the panic , he stopped .
And I &apos;m going to put the whole process and made something completely new .
He just looked at the sky and he said , &quot; I &apos;m not going to see what I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Does it look like to write a song now ?
If you really want to exist , you know , I can take care of you .
Otherwise , you &apos;re going to do something else today .
Go to disturbing Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his work process changed after this .
Not the job , the work was still hoscure as always .
But the process , and the anxiety , the anxiety was released when the genius , the genius out of him -- the genius out of the problems and liberated it back to where he was doing , he didn &apos;t have to be a interiorized thing that it was interized and mentally .
But yes , this peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration of a conversation between Tom and this strange and outside , but it was not Tom .
So how I felt that story started to change a little bit of changing the way that I was working on and already saved me once .
This idea , I &apos;ll save me when I was writing , &quot; Prega , &quot; Ama , &quot; and fall in one of those despair of the despair where we &apos;re all working on something and we can &apos;t get to be a disaster , which is going to be a disaster , which is going to be the worst book .
It &apos;s not just the worst book .
And I started to think of this project .
But then I remember Tom who was talking to the air and tried .
So I got up on my face on the task , and I took my comments to a vacuum of the room .
And I said , &quot; Well , what both of them know , if this book is not going to be brilliant , it &apos;s not going to be a blame , right ?
Because as you see I &apos;m putting everything I have , I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to introduce your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , I don &apos;t do anything .
And I &apos;m going to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to be recorded that I was going to do my part . &quot; Because it &apos;s like -- at the end is so , OK -- -- centuries ago in North Africa , the people would join the North Africa , people were roomed for the clear dance , and the music that was going on on for hours and until the dance .
And they were always wonderful , because the dancers were professionals and were fantastic .
But all of them , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became reality .
And I know what I &apos;m going to talk about , because I know that you &apos;re all , at a certain point , a performance like this .
It was as if the time stopped , and the dancer walks through a kind of portal , and it wasn &apos;t different from the usually , like 1,000 noticed before , but it was all standing up .
And suddenly it doesn &apos;t just look like a human .
But it turned out from the divinity and below the lightened in the fire of the divinity .
And when this was going on , in the days , people knew what was , they called him .
He had their hands and began to sing , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , God , &quot; God , &quot; God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Now , it &apos;s historic notes -- when the Mori invaser the southern of Spain , preserved this habits with them and the ready to change in centuries from Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , &quot; which you can still hear in the cords or in .
In Spain , when an artist has done something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , and sun , &quot; Allah , &quot; Alah , &quot; Oh , &quot; I &apos;m really , &quot; uncomprehensible , &quot; God .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes next day , for the dancer itself , when you wake up and discovers are the 11 in the morning of Martedesesday , God &apos;s no longer there .
It &apos;s just a great mortal to the knees , and maybe it &apos;s not going to be able to be able to the height .
And maybe no one is going to be the name of God as the name of God again as he has to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s difficult .
This is one of the best reconciliations to do in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so corporate if you can &apos;t believe , you know , the most extraordinary aspects of your being being from yourself .
But it just believed that you have come from a unimaginable source of this team &apos;s unimaginable source of this team of your life that you have to go to someone else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think about this way .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s certainly like I thought about it for several months during the working of the book that I &apos;m going to early on , the dangerous , I attempted out of my great success .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel elected from this is , I don &apos;t fear .
Don &apos;t flow you . Just do your job .
Continua to present you for your side , whatever .
If your work is dance , if your work is dance .
If the divine , aburd genius , I get to decide to leave some kinds of wonderful , for just time , just through your efforts , then &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Otherwise , you do the same dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot; to yourself .
I think , and I think we have to teach it .
&quot; Ole ! &quot; to you the same , even only for having human love and testabligine testabligine to make you present .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I &apos;ve already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can mean and the discovery of new set of genes .
Now , we &apos;re starting a new path : we started digital biology and now starting from that digital code , we &apos;re entering a new phase of biology , designing and synthizing life .
We &apos;ve always tried to ask big questions .
&quot; What &apos;s life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists , I think they attempted to understand various levels .
We tried different approaches , reducing it to the minimes .
We &apos;re digitized by about 20 years ever .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go to the analog of the biology in the digital world of computers .
Now , we can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome that can authoretic genome in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create one even smaller .
We &apos;re able to eliminate a hundred genes of genes that are here .
But when we look at its metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our way .
That &apos;s simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this can bring to a cell .
So we decided that the only way to design was synthesize this chromosome so that the chromosome that we could change the components to ask some of those fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of &quot; Can we synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Is it the chemicals to produce these big molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create before ?
And , in case , we can do it work a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemicals .
The speed with which we are able to digitize life is growing at exponential rhythm .
Our ability to write the gene code , rather slowly , and rather slowly , but it &apos;s getting better .
And our most recent results are carrying it on an exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process required many passages , starting with a biotic review before we started the first experiments .
But we found that we synthesize of DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that produce small segments of DNA , the length of 30 to 50 letters , and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the more mistakes there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments .
And this was our first attempt , starting with digital information from the digital genome of Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a small virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , we did the fragments of the mistakes and get a molecule of DNA about 5,000 letters .
And the interesting part is when we took this piece of chemicals , and we put it in the bacteria , the bacteria have started reading this genetic code and make viral particles .
The viral particles were released by cells , come back and they have destroyed .
I &apos;ve been talking about recent with members of the oil industry said that they certainly understand this model .
They &apos;ve got more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where software can actually build its same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things bigger .
We wanted to build the entire chromosome of bacteria .
I &apos;m more than 580 thousand genetic code .
So we thought to build it in the cassette of the size of the virus , so that we can change cassette to understand what the components of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard accuracy was a mistakes for every 10 mies .
We found out , resequencing it , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence wouldn &apos;t be able to be able to work .
One part of the process is to design segments that are overwhelming with all the other segments of 50 letters , to build smaller submit to build smaller sub-working together .
Let &apos;s take unique elements here .
You &apos;ve probably read that we have read that we put on the side .
Think of it . We have a gene code on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters together . Three about 20 amminoacids , and there &apos;s a specific order of letters for every amminoacids .
So we can use the gene code for writing , sentences .
So what we did at the beginning was autograin it .
Some people have been dolphin the fact that it was not poetry .
We designed these segments to be able to just one with enzyme .
There &apos;s me that they repair them and put together .
And we started to assembling of the parts , starting with five to seven thousand letter to seven thousand to seven thousand letters to make them together so that we can form segment of 24 mila letters to get to 72 thousand letter .
At each step , we &apos;ve made these databs in abundance so that we could sequence it because we &apos;re trying to create an extremely robbbust -- as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this looks like the tabellon of a basketball .
When we get these very long segments , more than 100 thousand basis , more than a hundred basis , they &apos;re not going to grow directly in E.
You get to the limit of modern molecular biology .
So we considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called homological romologist , which in biology is useful to repair the DNA able to put together the DNA to be able to put together segments .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , it can absorbed three million radiation of radiation .
You can see in high riquettes like his chromosome is destroyed .
In 12 , 24 hours , it &apos;s reassembled exactly as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely security .
They can live under empty .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life existing in space , and you have to find new rich of water .
Actually , NASA showed that this is happening .
This is an image of the molecule that we did , just use the lieven-en-appropriate design with appropriate design .
The yeast , yeah , the automatically .
This picture was not taken with an electric microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It &apos;s a very large molecule that we can see it with a light microscope .
These are pictures that they cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the publication that we did a long time ago .
It &apos;s over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the largest molecule of a defined structure that &apos;s ever created by man .
It &apos;s a 300 million molecular weight .
If we stampass it with a 10 without spaces , we would like 142 page only to transform this gene code .
Now , how do we work ?
Of course , through a virus is a boys .
It &apos;s a little more complicated when they use bacteria .
It &apos;s simpler even when it &apos;s eucarial cells as our : you just get the nuclear and put another one , which is basically the clonation process .
In battery , the chromosome is instead integrated inside the cell , but we &apos;ve been demonstrate that we are able to do a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another another and to accomplish it .
We clean a chromosome parent from a microbial species .
The two of them are different than the tops .
We &apos;ve added a few genes in a way to decide which to choose for this chromosome .
And then it skipped with the enzymes so to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell is raped -- and you &apos;re apprecisely our graph -- the new chromosome has gone into the cell .
And we started thinking that we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried anyway beyond .
This is one of the greater mechanisms of evolution .
We &apos;ve found out that many species have added a second or a third chromosome somewhere , I added in a second thousands of new traits to that species .
So those who thinks about evolution as a single gene at the time , it doesn &apos;t understand much of the biology .
There are some enzyme called &quot; restriction enzymes that even digital the DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell , there &apos;s no one .
The chromosome phone -- the chromosome we &apos;ve put it up .
It &apos;s expressed , and he received the other chromosome as extraneous , and we found with only the cell and the new chromosome .
It became blue because of the genes that we put in .
And in a short amount of time , all the characteristics of a species went lost , and it turned around the new software , based on the new software that we put in the cell .
All the proteins have changed , members have changed , and when we read the gene code , and when we read the gene code .
Now , this may seem to look like genetic alchemy , but by DNA we can change things in a pretty substantial way .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that we don &apos;t talk about the genesis -- but progress from three and a half years of evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion that they &apos;re going to create new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s quite obvious when we think about our need .
We &apos;re going to go from six and a half billion in the next 40 years .
Just to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now , there are three people on the planet for each other in 1946 ; in 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find food , fresh , fresh , fresh and wealthy for six billion and a half billion people .
It &apos;s going to be able to do for nine billion .
We use more than five billion coal-billions of coal-billions of olids .
That means 100 million barrels a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replace , it will be a huge challenge .
In the more we have to account of all the CO2 emission from these materials that end up in the atmosphere .
In the day , because of the scientific discoveries around the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the designed components for the future .
The electronic industry has only been a dozen about components , and think about how many different things have come out .
Our limits here is the biological data and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , because of these methods of synthesization , able to create what we call a combinatory genomics .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think of these 20 million genes of the 20s or to try to optimize the processes to produce or drugs , vaccine , we can change , because of a small team , and create more molecular biology that in the last 20 years .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , production chemicals or fuel production , etc vaccine production .
This is an instantaneous of some software programmed that we &apos;re working on to be able to sit down and design species in the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how they &apos;re going to be .
We know exactly how their gene code .
Now , we &apos;re focusing on the fourth generation .
You also see that you extract ethanol from the grain was an evil experiment .
We have coalds of second and third generation that will be used enough for the sugar to be higher than than the eighting or different butanol butanol .
But the only way biology to have a big impact without increasing the cost of food and limestone cost of it , it would be able to transform CO2 in the first , so we &apos;re working to design cells that can achieve it , and we think we can have the first fourth generation in about 18 months .
The solar light combined CO2 is a metodo--- but in our discoveries all over the world , we &apos;ve found different methods .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , at about 2,500 feet of the deep to the ebollitemperature .
It creates from CO2 using CO2 using molecular hydrogen as a source of energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand whether we can incanaling CO2 , which can easily be transported through tubes , converting that CO2 in fuel , to lead this process .
So short that we think we could be able to increase what the question of &quot; what life is &quot; is . &quot; We have versus &quot; what life is , versus -- we have the modest goal to reflect the entire chemical industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do it from TED ?
It would be a main source of energy .
Also , we &apos;re working to use the same methods to create instantly vaccine .
You &apos;ve seen this year with the flu , we are always back of one year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s the right thing to find the right vaccine .
I think it can change by making combinable vaccine in anticip .
This is how the future may start seeming , right now , the tree of evolution , accelling evolution with synthetic bacteria , arches , archathetic cells .
We are so much as we improve people .
Our purpose is to do so enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all , I &apos;m going to show you , the most rapidly possible , some fundamental work , the new technology that we took the Microsoft in the purchase of a year ago exactly . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s an environment in which you can interact with an enormous amount of visual data .
We &apos;re seeing here , many gigabyte of digital photos with a kind of zoom and continue , for a quick quick panoramic , desting images as we want to .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much it &apos;s the amount of information that we see , how big these crops of data or images .
Most of the digital photographs , but this for example is a scan from the Library Library of the Congress of Congress , and it walks into the gapiel of 300 megapiel .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that &apos;s the only thing that &apos;s limits a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen at any time . It &apos;s also very flexible architecture .
This is a book whole , example of not images .
This is the Casa desolate of Dickens . Every column is a chapter .
So to show you that it &apos;s just about text and not of images , we can do something like this , to really see that it &apos;s a real representation of the textbook , not of a photos .
It may be a little artificial way to read an electronic book .
I don &apos;t advice it .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s a number of The Guardian .
Each image is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the good experience to read the real caraceous version of a magazine or a everyday , which is for nature a multi-type of half .
We also did something with the corner of this number in particular number of The Guardian .
We made a high-resolution advertising -- much higher than what you use in a normal publicity -- and we have extra content .
If you want to see the characteristic of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even even the specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the space limits of space on the screen .
We hope that this means to put people up and other similar people , and other similar porcheries , I didn &apos;t have any longer to be necessary .
Of course , mapping is one of the poorest applications for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say that we have contributing to give you even in this field .
These are all roads in the United States overhead of a geospace image of NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually alive on the web ; you can go and see it .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which fight two different technologies .
One is Seadragon , and the other is a visual research at Steve Snavely , a student at the University of Washington , with the help of Steve Seitz of Microsoft Rick Szeliski of Microsoft Rick Szeliski of Microsoft Rick Szeliski Rick .
And it &apos;s alive on the Web , managed by Seads .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from one image to another and have this kind of experience to be multiple .
But spatial images here has actually a meaning .
So , the visualization of the computer algorithms have these images together , so that correspond to the real places where the imagination -- all sorts next to the Grasks on the Roccies -- they were shown . So here you can see the elements of a sli-show show , and these things are all connected to the level .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There &apos;s some much more spatial .
I want to go directly to one of the original data set in the website . And this came from a previous prototynth that we did work for the first time the summer -- to show you what I think is really the key behind this technology , Photosynth technology , Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily very evident by looking at the environments that we put in the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of Nothree Dame images taken from Flickr Flickr . Baucist Nothree Dame in Flickr , and you get images of types in shirlickr , and so on . You have one of these orange , and so on . You get one of these orange , and so on .
So it &apos;s all images from Flickr , and they were all connected to the spatial level in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this simple way .
You know , I would never be thinking of going to work for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifying to receive this guy here .
I think you can see that this is a lot of different types of photocaming : from those mobile phones in SLR , a significant number , put together in this environment .
And if I can do it , I try to try those more strange .
Many blocks from faces , etc .
Somewhere there &apos;s a series of photos -- right .
This is a poster of Nothree Dame recorded correctly .
We can go to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with the social environment . This now is taking from the susuit -- the collective memory of how it looks like the earth , from visual point of visual view -- and links all that data together .
All of those photos become connected together , more than the parts .
You have a model of the whole that emerge .
Think about this as a prolungment of Stephen Lawler &apos;s work on the virtual Earth .
It &apos;s something that increasing in complexity as people who use it , and the advantages of people are using it .
Their photos are marked with metaphed by other people .
If someone comes to the idea of contrast all of these wildlife , and I can use it as a photograph of Noise three Dimprovise suddenly enables of all that data , and I can use it as ingress to immersed in that space , in that metaphor , using the photos of other , and have a social experience of the kind of cross-mood and cross-user .
Of course , a consequence of that are virtual models of all interesting virtuals of every interesting part of the earth of the earth , because it &apos;s not just by airplanes and satellite images , but from the collective .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I know ? What your software is going to do is that at some point in the next few years , all the pictures are all shared by anyone in the entire world in the entire world will be practically connected together ?
BAA : Yeah . What &apos;s doing in practice is doing in practical .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And he &apos;s doing it on the bottom of the content of the images .
And the thing becomes very interesting if you think about the semantial information that many of these images have come .
Like when you make images on the Web , you have a sentence and the headline on the Web is a lot of information about the pictures of the photos .
Now , what happens if that picture is connects to all your photos ?
So the amount of semantic interconnection , and the amount of wealth that comes up is really huge . It &apos;s a classic network of it .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the pleasures when you travel and one of the etnographic research is the way to live between who has not forgotten the ancient traditions , between the green rooms in the wind , it touch it on the rain stones , and the stones in the leaves .
Basti Jaguar &apos;s Jaguar , they still travel over the Via Lattea , or that the old Himalaya , or that in the Himalayas , the budgets still breath , the distinctive of the Dharma , to remember the middle of anthropology , and the idea that the world that we live in which we live in the absensible sense of reality ,
the consequence of a specific set of choices that our stirpe has done , well , or many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of essentials .
Everybody is born . We all procreate .
We are subjects to start .
We have to face the inexorability of death , so it doesn &apos;t surprise , if we &apos;re leaving .
We all have an art .
What hits is the particular race of the song , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the Penan of Borneo , or the follow of the Voodoo Haiti , or the desert warriors of the Kaisut in Kenya , Curandery in Kenya , or a camp in Sahara .
He was my journey in the desert a month ago , or a month ago , or a yak haller in the Qomolangma , Everest dea mother of the world .
All of these populations teach us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And , if you reflect a moment , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
Together , the peoples of the world create a spiritual and cultural life that has the planet , and cultural life that has the planet , and it &apos;s important for the planet as biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural roughly spider as an etnosphere and you can call the etnosphere , the total of all of the concepts of all the concepts of all of the concepts of the awareness of awareness .
The etnosphere is the great patrimonium of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be as inquisitive species .
And because biosphere has been very , very much more quickly .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the aesthesis just because it &apos;s fake , or -- in the most apocalyptic diversity -- and you don &apos;t even get close to hypothesis -- the most optimistic diversity -- the cultural diversity of cultural diversity .
So , of all this is , of course , the language loss .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
It &apos;s not only a vocabulary or a vocabulary or a series of rules .
One language is the language of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle that the soul of every culture comes in in the material world .
Every language is a forest , a kiss , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re sitting in Monterey , at least half no longer is subsurred in the children .
It &apos;s no longer taught to children , which means , unless than to change something , which is already died .
What is more sad than the way of being waving from silence , of being the last to talk about a language , you don &apos;t have any way to transmit the wisdom of anticipating or anticipating the promise of children ?
This horrying is the state of somebody in some part of the world every two weeks -- every two weeks -- every two or two weeks -- every two weeks of an old language .
And I know some of you say , &quot; Don &apos;t it better ?
The world wouldn &apos;t it be a better place if we were talking all the same language ?
We talk about kogi .
You &apos;ll find a sudden what it means we can &apos;t talk to your language .
I would like to do you do a journey through the etnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a assumption of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , &quot; different ways to exist very different ways of existence .
So let &apos;s take for example , this Barasana child , in southern Amazon , the people of the anaconda &apos;s River &apos;s peanaconda &apos;s River &apos;s panish .
It &apos;s a people people who can &apos;t tell the blue color from the green , because the time cell is identified color from the green because the time is identified in the forest of the people .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rule , called &quot; exogamlinguistic : You have to marry a person who talks a different language .
This all has roots in the mythological past , though the particularity is that in these households in which you &apos;re talking about six or seven languages because of marriage .
They &apos;re just listening and then they start talking about .
We take one of the most interesting tribe with which I lived , the Waorani of Ecuador , an incredible people that had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionaries have tried to a fatal mistake .
They took off the top of the photographs that they would retrend them in their own , forest , forest people , forest that this rainforest people had never seen anything two-dimensional .
They collected photos from the earth , they turned out to the research of a shape or a figure and not out , they have the five missionary , and they killed the five missionaries with the lance .
But Waorani didn &apos;t kill only the foreigers .
They killed between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We were able to eight generations , and we found two natural death cases , and when we ended to know , they admitted that one of them had invecked , and then they killed it , and then killed it .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine for 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the early 1980s , I was assigned to me a really interesting task when my Harvard professor to asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti between the secret secret of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes , and I imposes of the poison of Duvalier , and I imposes of the poison .
To make sense of the miraculous , I would have to understand Voodoo culture , and the Voodoo is not magic .
It &apos;s kind of a complex metaphorrified view of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to tell me about the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christianity , Islam , Buddhism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has not religious faith . And instead , yes , and the Voodoo is nothing else that the distilled of these religious concepts of these religious concepts in slavery .
What &apos;s interesting is that voodoo is the intense relationship between life and death .
So , vivives make the spirits .
The spirits can be invocated by the Great Acqua , they respond to the race of the dance , and they replaced the time to live soul in a way that for a short brief , for a brief moment .
For this voodooists like , &quot; You know , you &apos;re going to church to talk about God .
We give up in the temple , and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment that you &apos;re posing , is the spirit that drives you , how can you hurt ?
So you &apos;re seeing these incredible events : They follow voodoo in state state of trance that touch on the surface , when it &apos;s a very strong demonstration of the body when it &apos;s catalyzed demonstration .
In all the people that I had the most extraordinary lived in the Kogi Sierra Kogi Santa Marta City , in the Santa Marta Colombia .
By the way , the ancient civilization that once had lived on the charge of the Colombia in waombia waiting for the conquest , the people would retreatment on the volcanic masses that would be done on the carrying plant plant .
In a continent of blood continent , this people has never been bounded by spagnoll .
But I &apos;m today , they &apos;ve been a clero , but their training formation is very remarkable .
The young households are taken by families to three or four years , and they live secregated in a world of good and shadows at the bottom of stones for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years , by the way , to produce the nine months of gestation that carrying in the mother , now they are metaphor , they are metaphors .
For all this time , they &apos;re accultured to the values of their societies , values that predict their prayers and just their prayers to keep the cosmic balance -- or to say the best ecological equilibrium .
And the term of this incredible initiation , they are suddenly taken out and for the first time to their life , at the age of 18 , they see a dawn . And that &apos;s first awareness , when the sun kiss , when the sun kiss the beautiful valuable valuable , when the sun fits back and says ,
&quot; Visto how I said I said .
It &apos;s amazing . Now it &apos;s now to you protect it . &quot;
They &apos;re called the greater brothers and say that we , brothers , are the cold of the destruction of the world &apos;s destruction .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the indigenous popular populations and aging Rousseau and the old story of the select , which is a race concept in its simplicity or maybe invoice Thoreau , and we say that these people are closer to the Earth of us .
indees are not sentimental nor feelings .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the malarial paluds of the Tibet or in the vents of Tibet , but because of time and rhythbet , but of the time , they created a mystic of the Earth based on the concept of being confident -- the concept that the Earth can actually live because it &apos;s infused from human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
It means that a boy of the Ande who &apos;s grows up believing that the mountain is a spirit of the Apu that will be a very different human , and it &apos;s going to have a very different relationship with the mountain or that place with Montana , which is increasingly different with the mountain or that place of the mountain is a rock of rocks that will be shown .
whether it &apos;s a spirit or a mineral caught is irrelevant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that calls the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia Britannica believed that forests were used to be cut .
That made me a different human being different from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that forests are the forests of Hukukuk and the bar of the heaven and the cannies that live in the extreme world , and the chandise of the world , that we &apos;ll face in the Hukukicked .
If you start to consider that these cultures can actually create different reality , you can start to understand some of them senational discoveries . We take this plant .
I took this picture to open up in the norders of Western Amazon .
Maybe some of you have heard about the ayahuasca , the most powerful psychoactive substtory .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuasks is not the potential of the substance , but its processing processing . It &apos;s made from two elements .
On the one hand , this lian legning of a beta-coal series , harme and harm and harm , slightly hallucinogen , slightly hallucinogene .
And by taking the only plant you have a smoo bluaster that alter a little bit of consciousness , but it &apos;s mixed with the leaves of a coffee family ,
This plant contains potential , very similar to the serotonin , dimethyptamine , dimethyptamin .
If you ever see the Yanomami thyptamine on the nose of the substance of species , it contains methydimethydimethyptamine .
Tiring that dust for the nose is a little bit like to be shooted by a loaded pin-eyes and land on a sea of electricity .
I used to often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who wrote the psychedelivered the psychedelic age , with her discovery of the hallucinogens in Mexico .
Second my thesis not going to class these tripamine as as hallucinogens , because if you actually can &apos;t tell anybody to be hallucinated . &#91; Risate The tripamine tripamine . They can &apos;t be abunte , because they &apos;re obviously in the intestine , demonstrate monthorane-oxygen .
It &apos;s just as possible to be heavily if you above with other chemicals that would be MAO .
Now it &apos;s the beauty : the beta-coal that are in this lian injors of MAO , the same guy needs to be able to be able to be able to power the tripamine . The question is spontaneous : in a 80,000 species of plants , how do these people have to find two defologically not similar , but if you combine in this way , we create a biochemical version of the parts ?
We use the great euployment of evidence and error , which can be infruttifer .
But if we ask the Indians , they will say , &quot; The plants talk about . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribe , the Cofan has 17 variety of ayhuasks , which distinguishal in the forest , and that at our eyes would come to the same species .
If we ask them how they stbiin their toonomy , they will say , &quot; I thought , &quot; I thought , &quot; Well , I said , &quot; No .
The solution is : you take the 17 variety in one night moon full night . It &apos;s going to be able .
With this is not graduate at Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than to count the stami .
Now , applausers , the problem is that even those of us who have in the heart of indigenous people are painting , but somewhere reduced to the margins of history than our real world , and it goes beyond .
In fact , the 20th century , in 300 years , it &apos;s not going to remember his technological wars or its technological innovations , but rather like the age that we &apos;ve stopped and actively accepted the mass destruction of biological diversity and cultural diversity destruction of the planet . Now the problem is not change .
All cultures across the cultures have been involved in a dance for new possibility of life .
And the problem is not technology .
And Indians Sioux , they stopped to be Sioux , when they put away from the horse and they did not stop being Americans when they put on the horse and hot .
It &apos;s not change or technology that threatening the integrity of etnosphere . It &apos;s the power .
The tough of domination .
And if you look at the world , you &apos;ll find that these are not destined to disappear .
They &apos;re living creatures and dynamics , and dynamic dynamics from forces that go beyond their adaptation capacity .
It &apos;s about the Penan --
a nomads of Sarawak , in the Southeast Asian , a people who lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to the most of the ridums , where you can see the River Rived Rived Rived Rived Rived Rived newest Chinese Meriest , where the Nar Merional Chinese , where where the black Merional evenlim , where the black man , where the Neishes are
It &apos;s ready to fill the fashion the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that come with the discovery of the gold .
If we marry on the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the hard hard of the domination .
As you know the genocide , the extinction of a popular level , is convicted to universal level , but the etnocium , the destruction of the style of a people , not only is constyle , but I also also also celebrated in certain environments .
And you can &apos;t understand the Tibet &apos;s suffering of Tibet until the beginning .
I spent the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in the Western China through the West Tibet , coming to Lhasa with a young connection , but only arrived in Lhasa with a young man , but only arrived in Lhasa with a young man who got to hear about .
6,000 sacred monuments in powder and centers .
1.2 million people killed the military during the Cultural Revolution .
And the father of this guy was assume to the Panchen Lama .
That means that it was killed to the time of Chinese invasion .
His uncle with Sua Santiity during the diaspora that brought the people in Nepal .
Her mother was imprisoned and her blame was rich .
It was brought to hidden at the age of two hidden birthday , because he couldn &apos;t live without him .
The sister , who did the same , was put in reeducational field .
And one day , he was called a cooled Mao and , for this transgression , has been put in forced to forced for seven years .
The Tibet can be insopportable , but the spirit of the people are from tener present .
Eventually , it &apos;s all reduces to a choice .
We want to live in the world world of monocromatic , or we want to take the world of diversity ?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he died said that his greatest fear was that , in our view of the world is , we &apos;re not just going to see the entire gamma of the human imagination is remarkable modality of thinking , but one day we &apos;re going to wake up with a sleep forgames until there were other possibilities .
And it &apos;s humiliant to remember our species is there for 600,000 years .
The Neolithic Revolution , who gave us agriculture , who gave us the agriculture of seed , to replace the poetry of the seed , by by by by making a poetry of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has to be 300 years .
And that history doesn &apos;t suggests me that we have no suggests that we have to all the challenges that we have to face in the millennia to come .
When these miriades of the world is asked what it wants to say to be human , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we &apos;re going to have the possibility of being the possibility of being what we are : a kind of a kind of way that all the people and gardens can beat . And there are great moments of optimism .
I took this picture on the north of Baffin the end of Baffin , when I went to the whales with the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya story of his grandfather .
The Canadian government was always gentile with the Inuit , and in the 1950s to set our supremise , we have them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refused to go .
The family , I tempting for his life , he took all the weapons , and all of his equipment .
You know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t feel the cold , they exploit .
And the slits in the origin , they were made of weighed fish in charge .
The grandfather of this man didn &apos;t intimidnight , or the lifetime from the night or bylilizer ,
It &apos;s shaked away , it &apos;s hot the pantageed in their own hand . When I did them are fucked in your hand . When I did them are frozen , and worked a lama .
He sprayed up on the end of this cholder , and when I became solid , he killed a dog .
He sheloied the dog and created a bright , with the toracy , and he stopped on the banking , and it &apos;s stunned on the banks , and it &apos;s disappeared .
We want to talk about horse with anything ? &#91; Risate &#93; And this , in different ways , &#91; Applausi &#93; is the symbol of the Inuit &apos;s the symbol of the world .
In aprile 1999 , 1999 , the Canadian government reduced to the total control of a larger area of California and Texas together .
It &apos;s their new patria . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s an independent territory . They &apos;re all mineral resources .
A beautiful example of how a natione-state can reconcile with his people .
And , to finish , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious to the one who was in these remote areas of the planet , realize that they &apos;re not remote at all .
For someone is home .
They represent a sections of the human imagination that go to the dawn of the time . And for us all of these children , are become part of the geography .
Finally , we of National Geographic , we are convinced that politicians will never come to anything .
We believe that polements --
&#91; Applusi &#93; is not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month our website has got 35 million visits .
156 countries transmitted our television channel .
Our magazines are figures from millions of people .
Our work is traveling in the etnosulticultural for our audience in places of cultural wondering from which will go away as well as they saw and , hopefully abbracing for time for the central revelation of the anthropology : the world of anthropology : the world deserves of diversity , and we have to find a life in a world pluralistic and multiculticulticulticulticular world , and we have to find a life in a life in a world in a world in a life in a life in a life in a life in a life in an and
in which wisdom of all the people can contribute to our collective wellness .
Thank you .
And I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope you &apos;ve already heard , and I &apos;m going to tell you some links , in the case you don &apos;t notice them .
I &apos;d like to start with what I call &quot; the official dogma . &quot;
Dogma official what ?
The dogma officer of all the Western industrial society . The dogma official dogma , &quot; If we want to maximmize the wealth of our citizens . &quot;
The reason is , on one side , in the fact that the freedom is itself a valuable , it &apos;s useful , essential for humans .
On the other hand is in the fact that if we are free , each of us can act to do everything that masses our well-being , no one that decide in our well-being , without no one that decide in our name .
The way to male freedom is massimize choice .
More choices , the more of people are libing , and the greater is their well-being .
This , I think , it &apos;s so deeply roomed in society that no one would dream to put it in doubt .
And it &apos;s also deeply roomed in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m going to allow me to be a simple notable conditions for the windows .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without counting the 10 variety of olive olive oil and 12 acres that you can buy to make you an enormous number of conditions in the circumstances that you can buy for your degree , which is that there &apos;s 175 already ready to be a degree of your degree .
This is the supermarket .
And then you go to the store of electronic , to buy a stereo . CDD , radio , flector .
And in this single piece of electronic store , there &apos;s a great audiences .
We can do six and a half million different combinations using the components that there are a only store .
You have to admit that there &apos;s a lot of choice .
Other fields : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all the telephone services , at all telephone services , at all the telephone services .
He was noleggiant the telephone , you didn &apos;t buy it .
One consequence of that , between the other , was that the phone would never break .
These days are gone .
Now , we have a nearly limited variety of phones , especially between phones .
Here &apos;s cell phone phones .
My favorite is in the middle , reader MP3 , cut them off of the nose , and rainy for chromantic chrolling for the Brits .
If you haven &apos;t seen it yet in the home store below , you &apos;re very soon that &apos;s going to come .
And what happens is that people come into the stores and ask that question . And what &apos;s the answer ? The answer is &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important aquicians , are the same explosion of choices .
Assistence : it doesn &apos;t happen in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor tell you what you have to do to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do it , we could do it , or B &quot; and these risks , &quot; Well , what do you want to do ? &quot;
Do you say , &quot; Doctor , what would I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A has these benefits , and the risks , and B has these benefits and risks . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebats , &quot; Dr. if she was me , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result , we call it autonomy of the malate , &quot; expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But in fact , it &apos;s not that you can move the weight and responsibility for someone who knows something , which is the doctor , to someone else who doesn &apos;t know -- and it &apos;s almost sick -- and it &apos;s certainly sick -- and therefore it doesn &apos;t know about the patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing of pharmaceuticals , direct to people like me and you , that if you think about it doesn &apos;t make sense , because we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why are there ?
The answer is , that they want to ask them to ask them to ask them to change the recipe .
Something that &apos;s so fundamental as our horrific identity is about choice , as you see in this purposing , &quot; We don &apos;t want to forced children . I &apos;m going to do their sex at the right moment . &quot; We have to invent .
And we can reinventing how many times you go .
That means that every morning , at the risking , you have to have to decide what kind of you want to be .
I &apos;m going to the family and the matrimonium , a time time , the common perspective for anybody , it was that there married you could , and she started to make children the most soon possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and even what to do after .
So , all it &apos;s really to play .
I teach students very smart students , and I &apos;m going to them 20 percent in less of work than a time .
And not because it &apos;s not because they &apos;re not not because they &apos;re less diligent .
But why do I mean , I mean , what do I mean , what would I say , &quot; Should I do that now ? &quot;
&quot; Should I marry up later ? I got to think before children or the career ? &quot;
It &apos;s logorders .
And they try to respond these questions , even though this is not complete the homework that check and not get a nice vote to my exam .
And they really have to do it . They &apos;re important .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , as Carl subjected , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from every day , from the Hotel Randolph .
In the parental , there &apos;s an angle , and I won &apos;t tell anybody which , where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t say that , because I want to use me .
What means , this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work ? It &apos;s that we have to continually decide , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing hot , with the mobile phones in a pocket , Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , and the notebook .
And even though they &apos;re all spending , every minute we see that we see our son rovine , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; I have to answer this call ? &quot;
&quot; Do I have to answer this email ? I have to email this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is &quot; no , that makes the experience of your son very different from what it would be in other conditions .
So , anywhere we look , small , things , small and large , things , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was , there were some possibilities , but it wasn &apos;t all about it .
The world of today looks like this : dilemma is , &quot; Is it positive , or negative ? &quot;
And the answer is .
So the good ones we know , we all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative .
So , all of this has two negative effects of people .
The first , paradoxally , is that it makes paralysis , instead of liberation .
With many options between which choose , becomes very difficult to do it .
I &apos;ll give you a significant example : a study of volunteer plans .
A colleagues had access to Vanguard data , the gigantic society , the gigantic society , with about a million cute customers in 2,000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offer in more , the percentage of adhhhhesian is two percent .
With 50 funds , there &apos;s 10 percent in less than adhesions when they are available . Why are they available ?
Because with 50 sources of which choices , it &apos;s sick hard to decide , and the choice comes back to intomorrow .
And tomorrow , and tomorrow , tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course tomorrow .
You know , it doesn &apos;t mean only that these old workers are going to have enough money , because they &apos;re not going to have enough money , you also want to say that the decision is so miss , even the complementary .
They &apos;re not participating , they &apos;re losing to five dollars for a year from the work dator , which would be well disposed to versarli .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think that makes the world .
&quot; And to finish , for the eternity : ketchup , maionesescape ? &quot;
Would you like to take the right decision , if it &apos;s for the eternity , isn &apos;t it ?
You don &apos;t want to pick the wrong , and even the condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even though we can avoid the parallel and make choice , at the end , we are fewer options that we would be with less options that choose .
And this for different reasons .
One of them is that with a lot of conditions between which choosing , if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you &apos;d have to do a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the alternative . It &apos;s going to be better . And what happens is that the alternative to the decision ,
even when it was a good decision .
More choices , there are , the easier of any details that &apos;s inssatisfaction of option .
Also , there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert clearly clearly , as the value that we give things to things depends on what we can compare .
From rest , when there are many options that are possible , it &apos;s easy to represent the characteristics of the option of the option that has choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m sorry with everyone who aren &apos;t in New York .
But that &apos;s what you would probably think .
There &apos;s this couple of the Hamptons .
A luxury .
It &apos;s splendiy . Otttima . It &apos;s all for them .
But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , what he thinks is , &quot; Well , it &apos;s Agust . &quot;
&quot; All my neighbor in Manhattan are away . &quot;
&quot; I could parked right in front of the house . &quot;
And it passes to two weeks on the idea that it &apos;s losing -- every day -- the possibility of parks where it wants .
costo-cost opportunity decrecrease satisfaction for what we have , even when choice was excellent .
And the more are the options that we have to consider , the more attractive characteristic features , they will be going to be costo-opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This cartoon tells us many things .
It &apos;s about living the time , and maybe to live slowly .
But the most important point is that whatever you choose , you can &apos;t do the other .
The things that we don &apos;t choose many attractive attractive that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : spiral of expectations .
I tried it on my skin buying a new couple of jeans .
I &apos;m almost always a jeans .
Once the jeans were just like , buried them and drinking out of drinks , they were uncomcomfortable , only after they brought them a life and washed a lot of times , they started going .
So , I went to buy a couple of new when the old ones were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
And the committer said to me , &quot; You want to slim fits , fit ? &quot;
You want them to have them with the buttons ? &quot; Stonewashed , &quot; or &quot;
&quot; Will you want them ? &quot;
&quot; Well , you want to put them on ? Bla bla , &quot; Continuclaimed them .
And I was stuck , and after a while I was able to say , &quot; I want the guy that was the only guy . &quot; He had no idea what it was , so for a time , I went out to the jeans , then I came out of the jeans that I had ever .
It was the maximum . With all that choice had the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse about is that with all of that choice , my own expectations had to be perfect .
At first , I had waiting expectations . I didn &apos;t expect anything exceptional when there was just like , but when I saw 100 different accidents , at least one had to be perfect .
What I got was good , but not perfect .
After I compared to the chose with what I was trying to do was inssatisfaction to the expectations .
The addition of options in the life of people don &apos;t do that to raise the expectations of the same options .
And that &apos;s going to produce less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
No one in the marketing world .
Because if they knew it , you would not know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more like this .
&quot; It was better when it was worse , &quot; The reason he was better when you were worse is that when you were worse was even possible to meet pleasant .
In fact , in the world that we live in -- opulent , industrialized citizens with the expectation of perfeition -- the most we can hope is that things are at the height of the expectations .
You &apos;re not going to have pleasant because your expectations , my expectations , I had the expectations .
The secret of happiness -- what you are here -- it &apos;s , &quot; Besearlier , &quot; Yes , you want . &quot;
I mean -- small authographical moment -- which I &apos;m really married and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I couldn &apos;t do that .
But it &apos;s not always a bad thing .
Finally , a consequence of buying a couple of jeans when there &apos;s just the kind of jeans is that when you &apos;re not satisfied , and you ask , &quot; Why ? &quot;
Who &apos;s responsible ? &quot; , the answer is clear .
The world is the responsible . What would I do ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of jeans , and you buy a inssatisfaction , and you ask , who is the responsible , it &apos;s also clear that responsible you are .
You could do better .
With hundreds of variety , there are no excuse for the insuccess .
So when people make decisions , even though the result is valid , they feel insatisfaction and give the blame .
In the last few years , depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only , but important -- of this wave of depression is just that people have deludent experience because standards are too high .
And when they have to be explaining this situation , they think the blame is them .
So the final result is that we &apos;re better better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remind you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely fake .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit of choice better than having any of it , but from this isn &apos;t a much better choice than a little bit .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic value . I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s .
But I &apos;m sure that we &apos;ve overcome from one piece of the level where the choices are improve our life .
Now , from a politician , I almost finished -- from the political point of view , the peanuts is the following .
What it allows all of this in industrial society is wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know , where the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too bad .
So the next thing that I &apos;m talking about is a sick of modern , rich Western society .
And what it does depressing and angry is this : Steve Levitt told you yesterday about how the expensive those expensive and the car seats are not useless . It &apos;s a money push .
I mean that these choices , complicated and dependion , it &apos;s not just to be useful .
I &apos;m even deleteries .
They &apos;re getting worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows so much choice to be reversed in those where people are too much possibilities , it &apos;s not just their life to improve , but even our .
This is what economists call park improvement .
A redistribution of income redistribution of income , not only to the poor -- because of this choice in excess ,
So to conclude , &quot; You can get what you want . &quot;
You know , people of culture , do you think , &quot; What does that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t do anything in a glass of glass . &quot;
&quot; Another imagination , a limited view of the world --
and I interpreted it so , at the beginning .
But then , thinking about it , instead , I realized that that that fish the long knows .
Because the reality is that if you manda in frantum , so you can &apos;t get freedom . You can &apos;t get freedom . You can &apos;t get freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you break the drinking out of the way that everything divents can decrease satisfaction .
You get the paralysis , and you reduce the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too strange , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of a few symbolic sphere is a recipe for inhappiness and I theme for rovine .
Thank you .
