Parecks years ago , at TED , Petere Skillman introduced a challenge of the design challenge called the marshmallow challenge .
And the idea is very simple .
The Gruppi of four people have to build the highest tower , which is the highest spaghetti sauce , by using 20 spaghetti sauce and a marshine tape and a marshine .
The marshmallow has to be pushed at the top of the tower .
And , even though it looks very simple , in fact , it &apos;s pretty difficult , because it costringe people to collaborate very rapidly .
So I thought it was an interesting idea , and I encourted it in a design lab .
And it was a huge success .
And since then , I &apos;ve been organized about 70 labs of this guy around the world with students , designers and architects , even designers and architects , even directors of Fortune 50 .
There &apos;s something in this exercise that reveals on the nature of collaboration , and I &apos;d like to share some of these lessons with you .
Normally , most of the people starts with horientation .
They talk about it , they think about it might have , compete for power , and then spend time planting , organizing .
They &apos;re making sketches and predicting the spaghetti sauce .
They go through most of the time , they take a spaghetti sauce in structure , and the end , just when the time is to get , just when the time is to get to get , some of the marshmallow , and they put it on the top , they do a back and Ta-da !
They put the job .
But what &apos;s really happening , most of the times , is that the &quot; Ta-oh , &quot; because it turns into a Uh-oh , &quot; because the marshmallow of marshmallow is folding and collapse the whole structure .
There &apos;s a number of people who have more moments , &quot; uh-oh of others , and the worst are the neuhaureated business school .
They &apos;re cheating , cheat , they destroact , and they make absolutely trables .
And there are , of course , groups that are more tails &quot; ta-da , &quot; and among the best schools , there are neodiplomal schools .
And it &apos;s incredible .
As Peter says , not only create the highest structures , but it &apos;s also the most interesting structures .
And your question is , how do that ? Why is it possible ?
And Pama to say , &quot; No one of the kids spend time trying to become the director of the SpA . &quot; Right . &quot;
They don &apos;t spend time competition for power .
But there &apos;s another reason .
And the reason is that the economy are formed to find the single best project .
And then I &apos;m going to do that .
And after , what happens is that when they put the marshmallow on top , they don &apos;t have any time , and what happens ?
The crisis .
It sounds familiar with you ?
What children do differently , is that they start from the marshmallow , and they build prototypes , one after the other , by the top of the marshmallow , they have different possibilities to fix prototypes along the way .
The designers recognize that this kind of collaboration is essence .
And with any version , children have an instantanem of what works and what doesn &apos;t work .
So the ability to work on prototypes is essential , but we see how they work different groups .
Most people are about 50 centers , for most people are about 50 centers , for the students of economy , about half , lawyer , a little bit better , but not much , children , better than many adults .
Who does better than everybody ?
Architects and engineers , because of the sky .
99 , it &apos;s the highest structure I &apos;ve ever seen .
And why ? Because they understand that triangles and the geometrical models are the key to build set .
And then we have the general directors , a little bit better than media .
But here &apos;s where it becomes interesting .
If you include a delegate administrator , the group can do much better .
It &apos;s incredible . It &apos;s a little bit around , you &apos;re looking at , &quot; You &apos;re going to have that group will win , &quot; You can understand in anticipe . And why ?
Because they have particular skills in agering work altrui .
They have the process , they understand it .
And all of the groups that are management and pay attention to the work improvements will improve the outcome of the team .
And the special and classes of ageration , and they take a safe success .
If you have 10 groups that usually work well , you &apos;ll have six that &apos;s that they &apos;re going to go .
And I tried an interesting experiment .
And I thought , alccles for once .
I put on the piat 10,000 dollars of prizes at the team .
What do you think about design students ?
What was the result ?
That &apos;s what happened .
No one of the team created a stable structure .
If one of them had built a 2.5 , he would bring home the prize .
It &apos;s not interesting that a post of it has an impact so strong ?
We tried to get the exercise with the same students .
What do you think about success ?
Now they got the value of a prototype .
The same team , from the worse has become the best .
They have created the highest structure in the minor time .
So I &apos;m important lessons about the nature of incentives and the success of the incentives , why someone should spend the time to write a marshmallow ?
And the reason is : help create digital tools and processes to help groups to build cars , visual video games and visual effects .
And what &apos;s a marshmallow challenge is to identify the assumptions .
Because , honestly , every project has its marshmallow , isn &apos;t that ?
The challenge provides a shared experience , a common language , a common position to build a prototype .
And so , this is the value of this simple exercise .
And those of you who were interested , can go to marshmallowers .
It &apos;s a blog where you can look at how to build marshmallow .
There are instructions for step .
There are examples of crazy around the world on how people are correct and fix the system .
There &apos;s also the world record .
And the most important lesson , I think , is that design is really a contact sports .
It requires the employment of all the senses , and the use of the most finished reasoning , the sensations and manage to manage the challenge that you have in hand .
And sometimes , a small prototype of this experience is everything that &apos;s necessary to turn a moment &quot; uh-oh , &quot; at a moment . &quot;
And that can actually make a difference .
Thank you very much .
We &apos;re going to do that we have a big machine , beautiful , in the TED style , it &apos;s a time machine .
Everybody in this room have to go .
You can go back , you can go on ; you can &apos;t stay where you are .
And I &apos;d be curious to know what you would choose , because I asked my friends in the last days , and everybody wants to go back .
I don &apos;t know .
I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m convinced that there &apos;s a kind of return to the nostaly .
I understand that .
But I &apos;m not part of that group , I have to admit .
I don &apos;t want to go back , and not because I &apos;m an adventurous , it &apos;s because the chance on this planet don &apos;t go back .
So I want to go to the machine and I want to go on .
This is the best time that there &apos;s been on this planet in every field that we can measure : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , calves of disease .
There &apos;s never been a time like this .
My great-grandparents died , everybody , before 60 years old .
My grandparents would push that number to 70 .
My parents are going to touch the 80 .
So it &apos;s better that there &apos;s a nine at the beginning of my death .
But it &apos;s not only about people like us , it &apos;s much bigger than this .
A child born in New Delhi today can expect to live as much as the richest man in the world of 100 years ago .
Think of it . It &apos;s an incredible fact .
How does it be true ?
Vaile . The smallpox has killed billions of people on this planet .
It changed the demographics of the globe as a war has ever done .
If it &apos;s gone . It &apos;s gone .
We flied it . It can be .
In the rich world , diseases that threatening millions of people only one generation does not exist .
Difter , red polio --
someone else knows what are they ?
Vaccins , modern medicine , our ability to feeding billions of people , these are tripals of the scientific method .
And to me , the scientific method , trying to do things , see if they work , it &apos;s one of the great humanity .
These were the good news .
Unfortunately , it was the good news uniquely because there are other problems , and they &apos;ve been quoted in many times , for example of one of them is that , although all we &apos;ve got , a billion people goes to read on this planet , every day .
This number is increasing , with incredible rapidity , and it &apos;s versus .
And not only , we did our creativity to fill up the planet .
It &apos;s able , rainforests , rainforests , rainforest , oil , natural gas : they are disappearing , and they are disappearing , and if we don &apos;t make our actions to pull out of this guuel , we &apos;re also going to do .
So the question is : we can we do that ? I think of yes .
I think it &apos;s clear that it &apos;s possible to produce billions of people without violating the land on which they live on .
I think it &apos;s possible to provide this world of energy without this destroy .
I really believe it , and no , it &apos;s not an illusion .
But this is the thing that keeps me up at night -- one of the things that tend me up the night .
We &apos;ve never had to have as scientific progress as we need science as we have now , and we &apos;ve never been in the position to use them as we could today .
We are a step from very incredible events , in many areas .
But despite this , I think we should go back , 300 years , before the Illuminism , to find a time time time we fight the progress , a time we fighting them more vigorosically , and on the more fronts , than we do now .
People get into what they believe , and they &apos;re doing it with a lot of force that we can &apos;t get them .
In fact , it can &apos;t liberate them .
You know , they all have the right to their opinion ; they have the right to their opinion on , but you know what do you don &apos;t have the right ?
You don &apos;t have your facts . I &apos;m sorry , you can &apos;t .
I put it a little bit to understand it .
A decina ago , I wrote a story about vaccines for &quot; The New Yorker , &quot; a short article . &quot;
And I was wonderful that someone was opposed to , which was contrary to what is , after all , after all , the public health measures of all human history .
I didn &apos;t know what to do , so I did as a usually , I wrote the story and I went to the other .
Not much later , I wrote a story about genetically modified food .
Same thing , just bigger .
People were imcrazy .
So I wrote a story about that , and I couldn &apos;t figure out why people consider the OGM as &quot; I &apos;m going to do it , &quot; because I thought I &apos;m going to get the molecules specific , rather than the case , it was invading the work of nature .
But , as always , I do my work . I wrote the story and I went on .
I mean , I &apos;m a journalist : we &apos;re missing , let &apos;s go to dinner , we end up there .
But these stories came up and I couldn &apos;t understand why , but then I did it .
The problem was that those fanatics that were doing me crazy were doing not fat all .
It was people of consciousness , people for good .
It was like people in this room .
And the thing was very disturbed --
But then I thought , you know , we have to be honest ; we &apos;re at a point , on this planet , where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress that there was once .
We talk about this ambiguous way .
We talk about it in ironic terms of ironic using : &quot; Progress &quot; OK , there are reasons to do it , and I think we know what they are .
We lost confidence in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science , and sometimes in science , and it &apos;s understandable .
Bauction only some names and people understand .
Chernobyl , Bhopal , the Challenger , Vioxx , Vioxide , mass destruction elections .
I mean , each one has his list .
We have questions and problems with people that we thought were always right .
So , skeptics .
So , you pretend .
You don &apos;t know anything for granted .
But here &apos;s the fundamental point : when the evidence comes to it , and we &apos;re not very good at this .
And I think the reason is that we find in an epidemic of fear I had never seen and I hope to see .
About 12 years ago , that was published a story , a horrible story , which thought there was a bond between an epidemic of autism and vaccines against die , parite and red and red .
Very frightening .
Hundreds of studies were made to see if it was true .
And they had to do hundreds of studies ; it &apos;s an important issue .
And they got the data .
They came to the United States , from the Sweweden , from Sweden , from the Canada , and everybody was equal , no correlation , no correlation , no correlation , nothing .
It didn &apos;t make it . It didn &apos;t make it , because we believe the anecdotes , what we see -- to what we think we see , what it makes us feel real .
We don &apos;t create a pile of documents from the government that show us numbers , and I understand it , and I understand it , I think we all understand it .
But you know what ?
The results have been devastating --
It &apos;s devastating because this is : the United States is one of the few countries in the world that the number of vaccines against the death is hot .
It &apos;s horrible , and we should be true of ourselves .
It &apos;s terrible .
What has happened to us to do something like that ?
Now , I really understand that .
Think of it , someone here has the death ?
Does anybody have ever seen a person died ?
It doesn &apos;t often happen .
This country doesn &apos;t happen in this country , but was 1600,000 times in the world last year .
I &apos;m a good time of dead for him , 20 every hour .
But because it didn &apos;t happen here , we can take it out of the head , and people like Jenny McCarthy McCarthy can go around to disappear and ignorance of Oprah , or Larry King Live .
And they can do it because they don &apos;t understand the difference between causality and correlation .
They don &apos;t understand that these two things seem to be equal , but I &apos;m never almost ever .
But it &apos;s something that we have to learn , and we have to learn it fast .
This man was a hero , Jonas Salk .
He liberated to humanity from one of his worst flags .
No fear , no fear , no suffering -- the polio , clean .
The man at the center , not as much .
It &apos;s called Paul Offit .
He just created a vaccine against the wheel together to other people .
He saved 400 , 500 thousand children every year in developing countries .
My bad , isn &apos;t it ?
It &apos;s good , if it wasn &apos;t that Paul goes around to talk about vaccine vaccine , he says how precious they are and that people just should stop frightening .
And he says in these terms .
So Paul is considered a terrorist .
When Paul talks in a public hudial can &apos;t testimony without an armed fit .
They call it at home because some like to remember that they know where his children go to school .
Why ? Because Paul created a vaccine .
I don &apos;t need to tell it , but vaccines are fundamental .
If we go to get them , the diseases will come back , terrible diseases , and it &apos;s going on .
We have again the dead in this country .
And it &apos;s going to be worse , and between not much children will start to die again , because it &apos;s just a question of the numbers .
And they &apos;re not just going to die .
The polio ?
One ex of my college has written me a couple of weeks ago , and he told me that he considered me a little excessively .
No one told me before .
She wouldn &apos;t have his son against the polio .
It &apos;s not going to die .
OK .
Why ? Because there &apos;s no polio from us . But you know what ?
We didn &apos;t have the polio in the United States .
Now , I don &apos;t know -- maybe it &apos;s a guy at Lagos Angeles , and it &apos;s coming to Lagos Angeles , now it &apos;s over the Ohio .
Maybe it &apos;s going to land between a couple of hours , nolegging a machine , it &apos;s going to come here in Long Beach up in Long Beach and tonight to one of these fantastic strings organized by TED .
He doesn &apos;t know it to be infected by a paralyzing disease , and we don &apos;t even know it because it &apos;s how the world works .
This is the planet that we live in . We don &apos;t do it as well .
We love to do it .
Anyamine stamage ?
Echinacea , a little bit of anti-oxygen oxygen .
I know you &apos;ve done it because half the Americans do it every day .
They take that stuff , as they affiddle at the alternative medicine , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we demonstrate that they are useless .
The data demonstrate it always .
They get the most dark urine . More than that they do not do .
But it &apos;s good , you want to spend 28 billion dollar urine , are with you !
Urina .
Why do we do that ? Why do we do that ?
I think I think , we hate the great pharmaceals .
Let &apos;s take the big government machine . We don &apos;t track us .
And we do good . Our health system is slavery .
It &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
It &apos;s absolutely , incredibly cold and demoralizing for those of us that can afford .
So , we just get away , and as the people refugee we ?
We put between the arms of the great placebo .
It &apos;s great . We love the great placebo .
You know , it &apos;s a problem because this stuff is a slavery , and we spend billions of dollars .
I have a whole series of examples here .
No one of these -- ginkgo -- a frode , echinea -- I don &apos;t know what it is but we spend billions of dollars , and it &apos;s a frode .
You know what ? When I say these things , people huring me versus , and they say , &quot; What do you &apos;re interested in ?
She &apos;s doing them . &quot;
You know , what ? Have you go wrong .
Because I &apos;m not interested in if it &apos;s the secret of the Department for Salute and Servies to say , &quot; Uhm , I don &apos;t want to listen to the evidence of experts on mammography , &quot; or if it says a few lunatic of cancer that wants to treat .
When we put the street that bringing science and evidence with magic and tradition , we end in a place where we wouldn &apos;t want to be .
We end as Thabo Mbeki in South Africa .
He killed 400 thousand of his concepts of his concepts of the fuckle , and it &apos;s about the anti-retroviral drugs had better better than the anti-retrovirals that we know can slow down the AIDS .
Hundreds of thousands of deaths in a country that was hit more than every other from this disease .
Please , don &apos;t come to tell me that there &apos;s no consequences for these actions .
There are . There &apos;s always .
Now , the stupid epidemic in which we are in the middle right now is the war between genetically supports of genetically modified and the biological food .
It &apos;s an idiot . It &apos;s got to end .
It &apos;s a words on the metaphors .
It &apos;s ideology , it &apos;s not science .
Every single thing that we eat , every chick of rice , every leaf of Bruxles , every Bruxle of Bruxles was modified by the man .
See , there were no orders in the backyard of Eden .
There were no mom .
There were no Christmas trees . We created them .
We &apos;ve done it in the last 11,000 years .
Something worked and something else didn &apos;t .
And we eliminated what didn &apos;t work .
Now , we can do that more precisely way .
And there are risks , of course , there are .
But we can put things like vitamin A in the rice in the rice , and it would help millions of people , prolunting their life .
And we don &apos;t want to do that ?
I have to tell you , I don &apos;t understand it .
We are contrary to the OGM .
Why ?
The things I feel always are : too many chemicals , weighs , weapons , weapons , we don &apos;t want enormous camps with the same thing , is wrong .
We don &apos;t want the companies to put on life on life .
We don &apos;t want them to be unique properties are seeds .
You know what my answer to this ?
It &apos;s yes . We do something . Let &apos;s do something .
It &apos;s true , we have a huge food problem , but it &apos;s not science .
It has nothing to do with science .
It &apos;s Law , morality , lines on patvettes .
You know , science is not a corporation .
It &apos;s not a country .
It &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
It &apos;s a process , sometimes makes good , sometimes it &apos;s not , but the idea that we should not afford to do science to do his work because we fear is really very tough , and it &apos;s businessing to millions of prosperate .
You know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to be forced to produce 70 percent more than we do now , 70 percent .
These are the investment in Africa in the last 30 years .
Vergy .
They need them , and we don &apos;t do it .
Why ? genetically modified .
We don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat slaves as as for example it .
A billion people eat it .
It looks a little bit like a potato .
But it &apos;s just calories .
It doesn &apos;t have nutrients , it has no proteins , but scientists are finding the way to put it right right now .
So many people could eat and run less the risk to be blind .
They wouldn &apos;t die of hunger , and you know what ?
It would be very good . It wouldn &apos;t be a luxury , but it would be very nice .
Can you ask me : why are we against ?
I mean , let &apos;s like , why are we obstacking this thing ?
Just why don &apos;t we want to move the genes here and there ?
It &apos;s about shifting genes . It &apos;s not chemicals .
It &apos;s not our obsession ridiculous , or our desire to have bigger food , better , simpler .
They don &apos;t have the Krispies .
It &apos;s about saving the life of people , and it would be now that we started to understand what it means .
Why -- do you want to know ? -- if we don &apos;t understand it , and we continue to beat what we &apos;re going to be colonight of something that we don &apos;t think we want to arrangement , technological colalism .
There &apos;s no way to describe what &apos;s going on .
It &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s horrible , it &apos;s in front of us , and we have to stop it .
So , after this enjoy conversation , you would ask me , &quot; You still want to go into this ridiculous time machine and go to the future ? &quot;
Of course , I want .
It &apos;s blocked on the present now , but we have an incredible opportunity .
We can put the time machine as we want .
We have a chance to go where we want , and we &apos;re really going to do .
We have to do these conversations , and we have to think , but when we go into the time machine and we &apos;re going to be happy to do it .
I know that we can and , as far as I think the world needs immediately .
Thank you .
Thank you .
And one day , the Los Angeles Times Steve Los Angeles Times Steve Los Angeles when she felt a beautiful music .
He was being from a man , an afro-American man , an afroads , with the husbage , without dimora , who played a violin who had just two cords .
I &apos;m telling a story that many of you know , because the Steve Lopeal articles , because the articles of a book , which was adapted to a book , which was adapted to the great screen , with Robert Dinterpret Jamie Feve Lopez , and Jamie Foxygen in part of the Nathony , and Jamie Foxygen ,
Nathaniel left the Juilliard , would have an awful nervous exhaurement , and 30 years later , she was living as a without roads in the middle of Los Angeles .
And all of you to read the Steve &apos;s book or look at the movie to figure out not only the beautiful bond that we created between these two men ,
I call Jane McGonigal . I &apos;m a video video games .
Agames for 10 years and my goal for the next 10 years , and my goal for the next 10 is to try to try to save the world in real life as online games .
To do it , I have a plan , and it &apos;s in convincing all of you , to go more time to play more beautiful games and interesting .
We &apos;re going to spend three billion hours a week playing online .
Some of you might think , &quot; It &apos;s a good time to play . &quot;
maybe too long , considering how many urgency problems we have to solve in the real world .
In fact , in my research , pricing the Istitute for the Future , actually is the contrary .
Three billion hours a week aren &apos;t minimally enough enough to solve the most urgent problems in the world .
In fact , I believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we have to increase that digital .
I calculated that the total we need is 21 billion hours of play every week .
Probably , it &apos;s probably an active idea , so the repet , so it reinforce the concept .
If we want to solve problems that hunger , poverty , climate change , global climate change , global , obesity conflicts , I think we have to have the ambition to play online , for least 21 billion hours of the seventh , for the next decade . No , I &apos;m really serious .
That &apos;s the reason . This image reassume because I think play is so important for the survival of human species . It &apos;s true .
This is a portrait of Phil Toldan , he wanted to catch the emotion of play .
So he photographed of the players as they played .
And this is a classic emotion .
If you &apos;re not used to be able to lose some of this picture .
You can probably notice the sense of urgency , a little bit of fear , but also an intense concentration , a very profound attention to face a very difficult problem .
If you &apos;re used to see some details , you &apos;ll notice some details , and around the mouth are a optimism .
And the inarcted eyelsewhere are being surprise .
This is an initial player at a step called an Eptic Victoria .
Ah , it &apos;s a term you &apos;ve heard . OK .
So we &apos;ve got used to the players between us .
A victory is an extraordinarily positive outcome that doesn &apos;t seem to be possible to when you don &apos;t get it .
It &apos;s almost beyond the imagination of the imagination , and when you get a shock find out what you are really capable . This is a vestock .
This player is to a step from a eptical vication .
And this is the expression that we need to see on the face of millions of problems in the world , as we face the next hundred years . It &apos;s not the expression of somebody , against all of the expectations , is at a step from a vitty .
Unfortunately , this is the expression that we see in the life of all the days as we face of address problems .
This is the expression that I call , &quot; No Brava . &quot; And I am in the Realty .
I &apos;m with the expression , &quot; I &apos;m not Brava in the Realty . &quot;
This is a grand in my old neighborhood of Berkeley , in California , where I did the PhD , because we &apos;re more good at play in real life .
And this is a lot of abitual players : We feel in fact that we &apos;re not good as good as in games .
And I don &apos;t mean , &quot; good , &quot; simply as &quot; successful , even though the success is part : we get more results in online worlds .
But I mean , &quot; good at the sense of motivates to do something important , inspired to collaborate and cooperate .
And when we are in an online world , I think most of us are the best versus themselves , the most capacity of helping without prediction , more able to focus on a problem for all the time , to get up after a failures and try and try .
And in real life , when we face a failure , when we face a failed obstacle , we often don &apos;t feel like this : we feel overwhelmed , maybe maybe depressed , frustrated or cinic .
We &apos;re never going to try these feelings as we play , simply don &apos;t exist in a game .
So this is what I wanted to study at university .
What is that in a game that we think we can &apos;t get any outcome ?
How can we transport those feelings from games and apply them to the real world ?
I studied so games like the World of Warcraft , which is really the ideal environment to solve collaborative problems .
And I started to notice some of the things that make vessories epic as possible in online worlds .
The first is that , when you appear in one of these games , especially in the World of Warcraft , there are lots of different characters that are going to trust a mission to save the world the way to save the world the way to save the world the world .
But not any mission -- any perfect mission : a perfect mission at your current level in play . Right ?
So you can complete it .
They &apos;re not going to ever give you a challenge .
But it &apos;s at the limit . So you have to try seriously .
But there &apos;s no deployed in the World of Warcraft , you don &apos;t have the time to turn off the pollic , there &apos;s always something very important to do .
And there are also many collaborators .
Whereas you go , hundreds of thousands of people , you get to put your eptical mission .
It &apos;s not a common thing in the real life , this feeling that we have so much collaborators .
And there &apos;s also this narrative , this narrative that sharing , because we are there , and what we &apos;re doing .
And then we receive all of this feedback --
You &apos;ve heard of increasing level , and one in intelligence .
We don &apos;t get that kind of feedback in real life .
When you leave this stage , I &apos;m not going to have one in speaking in front of an audience , and one in bizarre ideas .
I didn &apos;t get that kind of feedback in real life .
Now , the issue of the environments problem online as the World of Warcraft is that gives so much satisfaction to be a step from a vestyptic , all of the moments , that we decide to spend all of our time in these game worlds .
It &apos;s just better than reality .
That &apos;s why , so far , all the players of the World of Warcraft has spent 5,93 million years to solve Azeroth virtuals .
This is not necessarily a negative thing .
But you put it in perspective : 5.93 million years ago , the time one of our ancestors got up .
That was the first primate to walk .
OK , so when we talk about how long we &apos;re investing in playing , the only feeling that we &apos;re going to play , is to talk about the human evolution , which is to talk about human evolution , which for us is an extraordinary thing , but also useful , because we &apos;ve discovered that spend all this time to play , we &apos;re changing what we are capable to be human , we are evold to be humans , we &apos;re going to evolving more heart .
This is true , I think .
So , look at this interesting statistics .
It was published recently from a researcher at Carnagie Mellon .
The typical young man today in a country with a strong culture of abitual players , will have spent 10,000 hours playing online at age at the age of 21 years .
10,000 hours , it &apos;s a very interesting number of two reasons .
First of all , for children in the United States , 10.080 hours is the exact number of hours that fits to school from the fifth elementary to the maturity , if you have all the days .
So we &apos;ve got a whole parallel of parallel in which young people learn how to be like being good at school .
And some of you would have probably read the new book of Malcolm Gladwell , &quot; Fuoriclasse . &quot;
If you &apos;ve done it in his theory of success , the theory of 10,000 hours for success .
It &apos;s founded on a good research in the cognition , which says if we call 10,000 hours of frutuous study frutuous study to any thing at 21 years we &apos;re going to be the genes in that field .
We &apos;re going to be good at the best people in the world .
So , what we have right now is a whole generation of young generation , which is a whole generation of young genes .
So , the question is , &quot; Exactly , what they get good at these players ? &quot;
because if we could figure out what we would have to have an unprecedented amount of human resources .
This is the number of people in the world that go at least a day to play online online .
This is our genes of the game .
500 million people who are extraordinary -- in something .
And in the next decade , we &apos;ll have another billion of abitual players that are extraordinarily good at that something .
If you already don &apos;t know that , that &apos;s what &apos;s expectation : the video game industry is developing platforms that they consume for energy , and they work with the mobile phones that work with the mobile phones that work with all over the world , in particular India , China , Brasile , they can connect online .
The estimate is a billion player in the next decade .
This will bring us to 1.5 billion players .
So I started thinking about these games , they &apos;re changing in gene .
These are four aspects that I had individuals . The first is a optimism .
OK . Think it as a form of self-motivation .
An urgent urgent is the desire to act immediately to face a obstacle , with the belief of success of success .
The players always believe that a victory is possible , and it &apos;s always possible , and it &apos;s always worth trying to try , and try .
The players are not with their hands in hand .
The players are virtuous virtuoses in the toothrobust .
There are many interesting research that shows how we find better with other people after they played with them , even though they &apos;ve played with them , even though they &apos;re sleeping it .
And the reason is that it takes a lot of trust to play with somebody : we have confidence that will be the time with us , that will play with the same rules , and they will reach to the same rules , and that will stay up to the conclusion of the game .
So , playing together of fact , making the bust and cooperation and cooperation .
It turns out that we have really more roughly social relationships .
Produttivity . They gain .
You know , there &apos;s a reason that the World World of Warcraft play 22 hours a week , almost as a part-time work .
It &apos;s because we know , as we &apos;re playing , that we are playing , which we are actually happier , rather than it or losing time .
We know that we are optimized , as being human , to work hard to work on something .
And the players are disposed to work so-on , if he &apos;s assigned a task .
Finally , meaningful .
The players are actually used to be associated with wonderful measuring , human stories on the planetary scale .
For example , a small information to help create a context .
You know , all Wikipedia , the biggest wiki in the world .
The second wiki wiki in the world , with almost 80,000 articles is the wiki of Warcraft Cinque million people use it every month .
They have more information about the World of Warcraft on the Internet , which on any other wiki wiki wiki in the world .
They &apos;re building a skills .
They &apos;re building a source of information information about Warcraft .
OK , these are the four superpowers that together .
The abitual players are very optimism of super-powers .
These are people who believe they are individually able to change the world .
The only problem is that they believe to be able to change virtual worlds .
This is the problem I &apos;m trying to solve .
There &apos;s an economist named Edward Castronova .
His studies are brilliant . He &apos;s studying why people invest so much time , energy and money , in the online worlds .
And he says , &quot; We &apos;re looking at what nothing less than a mass exhibition to virtual worlds and online play . &quot;
And it &apos;s a rational , so it &apos;s rational , and he says , &quot; -- not as me , I &apos;m an exuberant ,
But he said , &quot; -- he says that this is a perfectly sensed , because the players players can get more in the online worlds that in real life .
They can have more social relationships in a game that not in real life .
They remember a better feedback , and they feel rilled in a game that not in real life .
So , he says , right now , it &apos;s perfectly reasonable for the players , to spend more time in virtual worlds that in the real world , I agree that this is reasonable , for now , but it &apos;s not , in any way , a situation , we have to start making the real world more similar than play .
So here &apos;s trages inspiration from something that happened 2,500 years ago .
These are antic dadi , facts of pecorgeous . First of having joysticks and cleaning wonderful we had bones of sheep . And these representing the first instruments of humanity .
If you know , if you know the writers of the old Greek , you may know this story .
It &apos;s the story of who invented games and why .
Eroddades that games , particularly the games of dadi , were invented in the Lidia of , during a loload of the Lidia , during a career time .
So , if you can cattle to be so sevening , that the Lidia decided to do something unthinkable .
People suffered , the population was in the roughly , it was an extreme situation .
So the second Erodadi , they invented games of and emanded a valid law for everything .
One day , everybody would eat .
The next day , everybody would play .
And they would dive so deeply in the games of the time that play is so involved , and we put it into a joyful state of productivity , which ignored the fact that they didn &apos;t have anything to eat .
And so one day played , and they ate day .
And the second Erodote , they went so 18 years , surviving a day and playing the next day .
I think this is exactly the way we use games at the day .
We use games to do the world &apos;s suffering .
We use games to go away from everything that doesn &apos;t work in our real environment , from all that we don &apos;t know about the real life , and we get what we need from games .
But we don &apos;t have to stop here .
That &apos;s very interesting : according to Erodote , after 18 years , the carrier didn &apos;t really want to make , so the decision that they would play a last game dadi .
They got the entire realm , they played a game dadi , and the winning winners , and the winners of that matters to an adventure .
And they gave the Lidia and went to try to look for a new land where to live , leaving the number enough people to survive with available resources , with the hope to bring their civilization from some other side , where they could perform .
It &apos;s a little bizarre , isn &apos;t it ?
Well , recently , DNA studies revealed that the Ethusks that would have then taken to the empire , they share the same DNA of ancient Lidia .
So , of course , scientists have suggested that the story of Erodot story is a real story .
And geologists have found evidence of a global cooled cooling about 20 years , and it could explaining the cestia .
So , this incredible story may be true : they could actually save their culture playing , refugee by playing , refugee for 18 years to be so inspired , and knowing how to come to be so inspired , and knowing as well as the whole civilization .
OK , we can also do that .
Warcraft in World of Warcraft from 1994 .
It was the first game in the real time of the World of Warcraft . This 16 years ago .
And they played for 18 years , we played Warcraft for 16 years .
I say , we &apos;re ready for our game .
They would be half of the population on the journey of a new world .
That &apos;s where I get the idea of 21 billion hours of play a week .
We do that half of us , they agree to go a day to play a day to play , until we solve the real world problems .
I guess what you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; How do we solve the real world problems ?
In our Palo &apos;s offices in Palo Alto , we have the idea of how we should relate with the future .
We don &apos;t want to try to predict the future .
What we want to do is -- the future .
We want to imagine the scenarios of the best results , and then we want to give people to a concrete ,
We want to figure out the epiphany to give people the instruments to do them .
I &apos;m going to show you very briefly three games that I did , and I &apos;m a trying to give people instruments to create the epic for their future .
This is &quot; Mondo Sence . &quot;
We did this game in 2007 .
It &apos;s a game online in which you &apos;re trying to survive a charter of oil .
It &apos;s not real , but we &apos;ve published online sufficient material , to make sure that it &apos;s , and to make a real life real as if we were dry . So , when you come into the game , you put in that area , you know , in the area , and doubles that we &apos;re in real time , data that show exactly the cost of oil , things that are not available , the impact on the distribution of food , the distribution of food ,
The impact on the transportation , if there are roll , if there are riots , and you have to think about how to live your life if this is real .
We started this game with 1,700 players in 2007 , and we looked at them from that time for three next three years , and what I can tell you is that it &apos;s an experience that transform .
No one wants to change the way they live only because it &apos;s a good thing for the world or because it &apos;s a way to do it .
But if you dive them in an adventure and say , &quot; We don &apos;t have oil .
This is an amazing story ! Anowadventure that you can participate !
Sfida same same to see how to survive . &quot;
Most of our players then kept the habits that has learned in the game .
So , for the next I wanted to save the world , we decided to save the world , we decided to put higher on a larger problem than oil .
We made a game called Superstruct , to the Istitute for the Futururururururgery , and the premise was : a supercomputer that humanity has only another 23 years on this planet .
The supercomputer was called , &quot; System of Have Global System . &quot; Of course . &quot;
We asked people to reach people online almost like in a Jerry Bruckheimer .
And you know , Jerry Bruckheimer , foreign a team from dream : there &apos;s the astronautue , scientist , scientist , the galaxy , and they have all to do to do to save the world , but in our game instead of having only five people in the team team of dream , they &apos;re all doing part of your dream from dream , and it &apos;s the future of the food , the future of the food , the future of healthcare , the future of healthcare , the future of food ,
8,000 people have played for eight weeks , they generated 500 incredibly creative solutions that you can find if you go online and try to Google on &quot; Superstruct . &quot;
Finally , the last game is going to start the three march . This is a game made with the Institute of the World Bank .
If I complete the game , you will be certified by the World Bank , as Social Innovator , as Social Innovator , the 2010 .
Lavoring with university of sub-Saharan Africa , we &apos;re inviting them to learn techniques of social innovation .
There &apos;s a story about comic , it &apos;s increasing levels like local knowledge , collaboration , sustainability , collaboration , sustainability , the imagination and inventive .
I want to invite all of you to share this game with the young people , wherever in the world , particularly in the developing world , which may benefit from being able to begin to imagine their social companies to save the world .
It &apos;s now to conclude .
I want to ask a question .
What do you think that &apos;s going to happen ?
We have all these incredible players , we have these games that are the pilot of things that we could do , but none of these have still saved the real world .
Well , I hope that you agree with me that the players are used to be a human resource that we can use to do in the real world , that games are a potent platform for change , that we have these incredible superpowers , a games that we have these incredible superpowers , the ability to be a bunch of social , this optimism , this optimism .
And I really hope that we can come back to play games that have importance , to survive on this planet for another century , and my hope is that you joined me to do and participate to play like this .
When I look forward to the next decade , of two things are : that we can do any future to imagine , and that we can make any future to imagine , and that we can play any game .
So , I say , let &apos;s start to games that will change the world .
Thank you .
For some time , I was interested in the placebo effect , it can look like a weird thing that magician magician , unless that I consider it from my view of view , which is , you know , &quot; something that &apos;s true . &quot; In other words , the pills of sugar , the pills of sugar , it just because the person thinks thinks , because the person thinks .
that what &apos;s happening is to be happening with a drug or something similar --
The therapy therapy , for example , if they believe they have a measurable effect in the body called placebo effect .
Something that is true for the perception that if you have .
And I &apos;m going to show you a magic trick , very simple .
And I &apos;m going to show you how it works . This is a trick that &apos;s present in all the books for years .
I learned it from only Cub Scout Magic in the 19th years .
I &apos;m going to do it for you , so I &apos;ll explain it .
And so I &apos;m going to explain to you because I explained it .
That &apos;s what happens .
The tello , that you can look at ; my hand , you can look at it .
He just got the knife in my clean , so .
Tiro on the manual .
To be sure that nothing goes down or jumped from my manual .
Now , I &apos;m going to shut my wrist .
And so you can see that ever something can go . It &apos;s going on . It &apos;s going on or down from my manual .
And the purpose of this is simple .
I &apos;m going to open my hand , and if it all went right , my hand , my shmagnetism , it &apos;s going to be the camera .
In fact , I &apos;m going to be able to shake it , and the knife doesn &apos;t falls .
It &apos;s not going on or down from my manual .
no trick . You can look at anything .
Ta-da !
This is a trick that I often teach children .
that they &apos;re interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about ingenious metodologically is very simple .
Many of you in this room , they will know this trick .
This is what happens , I think the knife in my hand .
I say my wrist hanging my wrist .
to make sure that nothing jumped out of my manual , that &apos;s a lie .
And the reason I &apos;m having the wrist is because it &apos;s the secret of illusion .
In the time my hand is moving away from you , this finger here , my finger here , my finger , it stands out of where it was , in a position that hanging out there .
There &apos;s someone who didn &apos;t have a childhood here .
It &apos;s like this , right .
And when I also went out .
We can talk about why it &apos;s ingannouncement , because you don &apos;t notice that there &apos;s only three fingers down there because the mind , and the way that the information is not counts , one , two , three . Looks .
But it &apos;s not the point . Right ? And when I open my hand , obviously stays not through the animal magnetism , but through the ingenium , but through the inging-and-and-up .
And when I close my finger , the same thing , when I come back , that &apos;s the finger that comes back .
I &apos;m going to go away . The knife comes away .
It &apos;s a trick that you can do with your friends and neighbors . Thank you .
Now , what has to do with placebo effect ?
I read a study , a year ago I had read my mind .
I &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , so it was an amazing thing .
It seems to be that if you add a placebo in the form of a white pill , it &apos;s made like an aspirine , just a white pill , it &apos;s measurable .
But if you change the shape and you put it in a smaller form of a smaller pill , and the blue color and you press a letter is visibly more effective .
Even though no one of the drug -- they &apos;re pills of sugar .
But a white pill is not effective as effective as a blue pill .
What ? He really has me .
But it &apos;s not where it &apos;s going on .
The capsules are more effective than any shape .
A colorful capsule , which is a red part and red part of the other is better than a white capsule .
The dosage has a role .
One pill twice a day , it &apos;s not as effective as three pills -- I don &apos;t remember the statistics . Sorry .
But the point is --
Things have a role .
And it also has a role .
And if you want to definitely , you have to use a needle .
Right ? A little bit of something -- a pair of something inert .
You injected in a patient --
This is a picture so strong in their mind , much stronger than the white pill .
It &apos;s real , this graph -- I &apos;m going to show you another time when we have slide .
The point is that the white pill is not effective as effective as the blue that is not as effective as a capsule as a way .
And none of these pharmaceutical quality .
It &apos;s just your belief that makes them real in your tail and strength .
I wanted to see if I could take this idea and apply it to a magic trick .
And do something that &apos;s a finished trick and do it looks real .
And we know from the study that when you want to have to use the needle .
This is a seven inches of seven inches .
It &apos;s a little bit of it .
This is my meat . This is not a special Carne of Damian .
This is my skin . This is not a special hollywoodian effect .
I &apos;m going to hole my skin , and I &apos;m going to go to the opposite part .
If you try to nausea -- if you can do easily -- I did it for some friends in the albergo , the other night , and for some that I didn &apos;t know , and a woman is almost sell .
So if you try to nausea , I suggest that you don &apos;t look for the next 30th -- in fact , I &apos;m going to do the first bad part here .
You can see , you can look at another part .
So here &apos;s what happens , right here , the beginning of my lower on my lower part of my lower than I do just a little hole .
Excuse me . Ti am I impressive ?
And now a little bit through my skin , and out of the other side .
Now , we &apos;re in the same position where we were with the knife trick .
More or less . But you can &apos;t count my fingers now , right ?
So I &apos;m going to show them . Here , two , four , five , it &apos;s good --
I know what people think when he sees this .
They think , &quot; Sicurely , it &apos;s not going to be stupid to hole on the skin only to have some minute . &quot;
So , let me just leave you to leave a beeater .
How do you look like ? I &apos;m good .
Yeah , I know , I know , I don &apos;t see it good . &quot;
People in the rooms are entering rooms .
Let me show you .
This is really my skin . It &apos;s not a special effect of Hollywood .
This is my meat , and I can turn it around .
Sorry , if you feel bad look at another part , you don &apos;t look .
People in the bottom or that will look in a few years , the video say , &quot; Well , it &apos;s clear that it provoke some effect , but if it &apos;s true .
You see , there &apos;s a hole here and a hole here , if it was true . &quot;
Well , I &apos;m going to get some blood for you .
That &apos;s there .
Now , I &apos;m going to fix the needle .
I would like my arm , and I &apos;ll show you that there are not stop .
But I think in this context and with the idea of taking something true , and I &apos;m going to turn it into something real , I &apos;m going to let it go to the stage .
We &apos;re going to see many times in the next days . I hope you can &apos;t see the hour . Thank you very much .
So , in my life I met a lot of fish .
I got only two .
The first one , it was more than another passionate story .
It was a beautiful fish . It was a beautiful fish . It was one of the most sold on the menu .
Which fish !
It was even better , it was from a Ph.D. .
So , I heard you to the consciousness in sell .
I was involved in a relationship with this beauty for several months .
One day , the company called me and said to talk to me to a dedicated event to sustainability environmental sustainability of training .
&quot; Of course , &quot; I said .
This was a company that was trying to solve what has become an unimaginable problem for our chef .
How do we do to keep the fish in our menu ?
During the last 50 years , we have weighted in the brands in the same way that we raso to the forests .
The destruction was tremendous .
90 percent of the big fish , the ones that love us so much the tons , the halive , the houses , the weighs are roughly reduced by number .
There &apos;s almost nothing left .
So , we liked or not the acquaculture , the fishes of fish , it &apos;s going to be part of our future .
There &apos;s a lot of contrary arguments .
The tons of fish pollution , for the least largest part of them , and they are inefficient . You take the tone for example .
A big problem is that there &apos;s a food concrete for 15 to one .
That means that they want to 15 libber of wild fish to get a lie of practice .
It &apos;s not very sustainable .
And also , the knowing is not a big one .
So here , finally , there was a company that was trying to do it in the right way .
I wanted to help .
The day before I call the public event , I call the PPut of the company .
Camiamil .
I said , &quot; Don &apos;t , I said , &quot; You know , you &apos;re famous to do training so far , in the open sea , which not inquine . &quot;
He said , &quot; Exactly , he said , &quot; We &apos;re so far away from the coast that our shows are diluished . &quot;
And then he said , &quot; We &apos;re basically a world in part . &quot;
&quot; The rate of the conversion rate ? 2.5 to one . &quot;
&quot; The best in sector . &quot;
2.5 , great .
&quot; 2.5 to one thing ? What do you like to eat the fish ? &quot;
&quot; Protewable Protewable , he said .
&quot; Great , &quot; Great , &quot; I said , &quot; And I said , &quot; Great . &quot;
That night , I was in bed , I thought , &quot; but it &apos;s a sustainable protein ?
So the next day , just before the event , I called Don &apos;t .
I said , &quot; Don , do you do some example of sustainable protein ? &quot;
He said he didn &apos;t know , and he would ask around .
Well , I &apos;m talking to a little bit of people in the company and none sepocket response .
Finally , I finally talked to the biologist .
We also call him Don &apos;t .
&quot; Don , &quot; I said , &quot; Do you do some example of sustainable protein ? &quot;
Well , he mentioned some algae some algae , and then he said , &quot; Well , you know , &quot; Chicken chicken chicken . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Pollo ? &quot;
He said , &quot; Yeah , I think , skin , bones , downloaded and processed to manguns . &quot;
I said , &quot; What percentage of your mangime is made of chicken ? &quot;
I thought , let &apos;s say , two percent .
&quot; Well , it &apos;s about 30 percent said . &quot;
I said , &quot; Don , what is sustainable in order to give the fish of the chicken to eat ? &quot;
There was a long pause at the telephone , and then he said , &quot; there are too many chickens in the world . &quot;
I &apos;m sorry of this fish .
No , not because I &apos;m one of those loving virtuoses of good food and traditional food .
Well , to say the truth is .
No , in fact , I &apos;m sorry of this fish because , I &apos;m going to tell you about the conversation , the fish of the fish had no chicken .
The second fish is a different love story .
It &apos;s a romantic story that is more to know about the fish and the most of them .
I ate it for the first time in a restaurant in the southern of Spain .
One of my friend journalist had been talking about this fish .
Basically , he had to meet .
He went to the table , he had a brilliant white , almost scintillant .
The chef was too much .
Basically the double of how she had to be cooking .
Incredibly , it was delicious .
Who &apos;s able to make a fish so good after I got it ?
I &apos;m not , but this guy did .
Let &apos;s call it Miguel .
It &apos;s actually called Miguel .
No , he didn &apos;t have the fish , and it &apos;s not a chef .
For least , not in the sense that we usually mean .
It &apos;s an biologist at Vet . The Palma , which is a fish farmers in the southern corner of the Spancies of the River Guadalquir .
In the &apos; 80s , the training was managed by claims .
They were sweet on what first was essentially a palad area .
They had to make the land building a series of channels by containing so the water in the river .
Well , they can &apos;t make it work out of an economic view .
And , from the ecological point , it was a disaster .
He killed something like 90 percent of the birds and , considering the place , it &apos;s a lot of birds .
So , in 1982 , in 1982 , in 1982 , in 1982 ,
What did they do ?
They get the flow of the water .
Letterally , they actually pull up the interrupt .
Instead of waste water out of the ground that they used the ground to flood it .
They give all the channels .
They created a weightalling from 27 mila acrates , anguille muggers , anguille and in this process , Miguel and this process , Miguel and this company completely inverted the ecological destruction .
The training is incredible .
I mean , you &apos;ve never seen something like this .
And then you look at the horizon that seems to be far a million , and everything that you see is injudgments and this rich , dense land .
I was a little time ago with Miguel .
It &apos;s an incredible quarters , Charles Darwin and a fourth Crocodile Dundee .
Okay ? We were doing it in the middle of this lagement and I would like , I had the fucknee and Miguel , he hot and Miguel .
First , I gave a white nakes .
And then he explains to me the minerals of the phitoplanckton , then you see a kind of fish of the Tanzania .
It turns out that Mikumi &apos;s great part of his career at the National Park Mikumi in Africa .
I asked him as he became such an expert of fish .
He said , &quot; Pesci ? I don &apos;t know any fish .
I &apos;m an expert in relationships . &quot;
And immediately , when you &apos;re still junkles on the rare , and strange plants and aquatic algae .
Don &apos;t get me , this was very fascinating , that was very fascinating , which is , like biotic community revealed to natural state .
It &apos;s interesting , but I was in love with love .
And my head was continuing to rethink about that dolphar fish that I had eaten the evening .
So I interrupts , and I said , &quot; Miguel , what makes your fish so good ? &quot;
He pointed the algae .
&quot; I know , I know , the algae , fitoplancton , yes , it &apos;s incredible .
But your fish what eat ?
What &apos;s your food constitute ?
Well , he told me about how their is a rich system so rich the fish that eat exactly what the fish would eat in a wild environment .
The biomass of plants , fitoplancton , the zooplankton , that &apos;s all of the fish .
The system is so self-renealities .
There are no missed .
Have you ever heard of a training that doesn &apos;t give the animal ?
And later , I was driving around the ground with Miguel , and I said , &quot; In one place like this , which seems so natural from any training that has ever seen , how do you measure the success ? &quot;
In that precise moment , it was like the regist of a movie had to the shift of the set .
We went to the corner , and we saw a scene between the most incredible thousands and thousands and thousands of phenicopters and thousands of phenicopth-view .
&quot; That &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; Look at their pance , they are red .
They &apos;re banking . &quot;
Banthrowing ? I was completely confused .
I said , &quot; Miguel , but they &apos;re not banking with your fish ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , he said .
&quot; Well , let &apos;s look about 20 percent of the fish and eggs of fish for the birds .
Last year on this property , there was 600,000 birds over 250 species .
It has become the greatest , and one of the most important health for birds in all over Europe . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Miguel , but a population of bird is not the last thing that you would like in a fish hall ? &quot;
It &apos;s not .
He said , &quot; We extensive way not intensive .
This is an ecological network .
The phenicopters eat .
The leambers eat the phanos .
So much more is pink the fenicopters the fenicopter is the system . &quot;
OK , then we stay up : A training that doesn &apos;t give the animals to eat his animals , and it measure his success in the basic health of his predators .
It &apos;s a fish training , but also a birds for a birds .
Ah , by the way , those phenicopters should not even be there .
They &apos;re doing the nest in a 150 miles where the ground conditions are better for the building .
Every morning , they fly 150 miles , and they come to the training and every night , they &apos;re doing another 150 miles for the back .
They do it because they &apos;re able to follow the white line of the A92 .
Sseriously .
I would imagine something like the penguins , so I looked at Miguel .
And I said , &quot; Miguel , they want for 150 miles to the training and then 150 miles to night to go back ?
They do it for them ? &quot;
He looked at me as if I had just quote a Whitney Houston .
He said , &quot; No , they do it because food is better . &quot;
I don &apos;t talk about the skin of my loved fish that was delicious , and I usually don &apos;t like the skin of the fish .
I don &apos;t like hasn , I don &apos;t like crowd .
It &apos;s that acre , as an asphalthids .
Not almost ever ever ever .
And yet , when I got it in that southern restaurant of the Southern of the Southern of fish .
He had a sweap and clean was like to give a sweap to the ocean .
I said to Miguel , and he annued .
He said , &quot; The skin is like a sponge .
It &apos;s the last defense than whatever in the body of the fish .
It &apos;s evolved to hold the impurity . &quot;
And then he said , &quot; But our water doesn &apos;t impurity . &quot;
OK . A training that doesn &apos;t swim his fish .
A training that measuring their success on the bottom of his predators .
And then I realize that when he says that the training doesn &apos;t have minimum very much of the thing because the water flows into that training is from the River from the river Guadalquivir that is a river that brings with all the things that the physics tend to bring all the things that the right-chemicals of fishing chemicals .
And when you go along the system , and it comes out of the water is more clean than when it came in .
The system is so healthy , that clean water .
So , not only one training that doesn &apos;t feed his animals , not only one training that can measure its success in the health of his predators , but a training training that it &apos;s literally a clean of cleaning of water and not only for those fish and not only for those fish , but to you .
Because when the water comes to the Atlantic .
It &apos;s a drop in the ocean , but I know the welcome , and you should also do you , because this love of romantic love for how romantic is also .
You may say that it &apos;s a recipe for the future of good food is that you talk about bovins .
So , what we need now is a radical conception of agriculture in which food really has a good know .
But for many people , this is a little too radical .
We are not realistic , we &apos;re passionate about food .
We are frightened .
Let &apos;s take the small farmers of the small farmers .
We put the little familiar farms .
We talk about local land .
We have biological .
And when you say that these are the things that will make the future of good food , someone &apos;s going to make it althids , and he says , &quot; Hey , even I like the pink of the pink , but how do you think we can feed the world ?
How do you think we can feed the world ? &quot;
Can I be healthy ?
It &apos;s a question that I don &apos;t like .
No , not because we already make more than enough calories that we can feed the world .
A billion people have hungry today .
One billion -- more than a billion -- the more than you &apos;ve ever been -- because of the tremendous amount of expensive .
See , I don &apos;t like this question because he determined the logic of our system for the last 50 years .
From the cereals of the fishes of the weightful monoculture , chemicals on the ground to the chicken , and all of that time the industry has just asked , &quot; If we can feed more people in the cheaper way , what &apos;s wrong about what we do ? &quot;
This was the motivation .
It was justification .
It &apos;s been the business plan of American agriculture .
We should call it for what is , a liquidation , a liquidation industry as quickly as the ecological capital that makes a production possible .
This is not a industry , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
Our bread today is threatened not because of the supplies in decrecrease , but for diminial invention of mechanics , not for the last mechanics , not for the pumps , but for the fresh , not for the engths and not for the motoseageres and networks , but for the fish in the sea .
Do you want to feed the world ?
We start asking us : How are we going to feed ourselves ?
Or better , how can we create the conditions that are consentence in every local community to feed itself ?
To do that , we don &apos;t look at the agricultural model of the future .
It &apos;s an old and a model .
It &apos;s all about capital , chemistry and machinery , and it never really made anything good to eat .
Instead , we look at the ecological model .
That &apos;s what &apos;s about two billion years of work .
Let &apos;s look at Miguel , as Miguel as Miguel as Miguel and farms that are not just closed in if themselves to farms that are reconstructing instead of consuming farms that they grow extensive instead of consuming farmers that are not only producers , but experts in relates , because they are also the ones that are experts in the knowing .
If I have to be truly , they are better chef than I could ever be .
You know , to me , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it &apos;s going to be delicious .
Thank you .
I grew up with a fantaisy diet .
At high school , I got to take a shelter , and back every day .
And I was always immersed in a book , a fiction book , which was brought my mind in other worlds , and satisfied , in the narrative form , that insatiable sense that I had .
And that curiosity was manifested in the fact that every time I was not in school I was out in the woods , and snarms , snap , snap , snarrow , I was watching them at home , I was watching them at the microscope .
I was a real geek of science .
But it was always trying to figure out the world , understanding the world , understand the limits of possible .
And my love for science fiction was actually respect the world around me , because what was going on , in the late 1960s -- we were going to the depth of the oceans , we were exploring the depth of the oceans , Jacques Cousteau entered in our room , Jacques Cousteadians came in our room , and a wonderful world that we can &apos;t even imagine .
So , all seemed seemed to forced my passion for fiction .
And I was an artist .
I knew draw . I knew paint .
And because there were no video games nor this is this Saturation of the computer movie , or all of these images in the media landscape , I had to create these images in my head .
From children , when we read a book , we all had to do , through the description of the author , put something on the screen of our heads .
And so , my answer was painting , to draw creatures , aliens , robots , aliens , robots , all this stuff .
In the mathematics of mathematics , I &apos;m always stopped out of the textbook .
That &apos;s because creativity had to find some way out .
And it happened to be interesting : The Jacques Cousteau programs were involved very much for the fact that there was an alien world right here on the earth .
Maybe I would never be done in an alien world on a space navicle .
It was very unlikely .
But that was a world where I could go to really , right here on the earth , the richer and exotic of what I would ever imagine these books .
So , I decided that I would become a submozer at the age of 15 .
And the only problem was that I was living in a small Canada country , at 600 miles from the nearest .
But I didn &apos;t let me fifting .
I assign my father until he found a dive school until he found a dive school in Buffalo , New York , just past the border to live .
And so I was able to take the certified in the YMCA &apos;s in the winter to Buffalo , New York .
And I wouldn &apos;t have seen the ocean , for the real ocean , for other two years , until transfed us in California .
Since then , in the last 40 years , I spent about 3,000 hours underwater , and 500 of these hours in submersibles .
And I learned that the depth of the ocean , even a profound oceans , are very surprising life that goes beyond our imagination .
Now , the imagination of nature is without confinishal of human imagination .
Again today , I &apos;m intimate from what I see when I diving .
And my story of love with the ocean continues , stronger than it was ever .
But when I picked a career , I chose to do movies .
It looked like to be the best way to conciliating this smania to tell stories with the smania to create images .
And , as a guy , I was designing constantly and so on .
So to do film was the only way to put together images and stories and stories .
Everything came back .
And of course , the stories I chose to tell were stories of fiction : &quot; Termintator , &quot; Aliens &quot; and &quot; The Abyss &quot; and &quot; The Abyss . &quot;
And with &quot; The Abyss &quot; I joined my love for depity and immersions with the realization of a movie .
So , I fuse the two passions .
As &quot; The Abyss , &quot; The Abyss &quot; came out something interesting that was to solve a narrative problem in that movie , which is to create the kind of liquid water -- we &apos;ve adopted the computer .
And so it was the first character to the first morbid and animated computers that was ever seen in a movie .
And even though the movie didn &apos;t do a lot of money , I would say that at the malapena , I &apos;ve been testimacy of something extraordinary , all the audience was helped by this very magic .
You know , it &apos;s Arthur Clarke for whom every technology is indistinguished by the magic .
They were seeing something magic .
And that was very excited .
And I thought , &quot; Fantastic , this is something that has to be adopted in the movie art . &quot;
So , with &quot; Terminator 2 , my next film , we went much beyond .
Lavoring with Industrial and Magic , we created the liquid metal guy in that movie . That success depended on that movie .
And it worked . And we &apos;ve got again created a magic .
And we got the same outcome with a audience .
But we &apos;ve gained a little bit more with that movie .
So , as a line between these two points of experience , I came to the conclusion that this would be a whole new world of creativity for the movie artists .
So , I put up a society with Stan Winston , my friend Stan Winston , which was the main main maker and designers of creatures at that time , and we called it Digital Digital .
And the principle of society was left to shoulder , the analogical prints and so on , and go directly to the digital production .
And so we did , and he gave us a competitive advantage for a while .
But we &apos;re stayed back in the middle of the &apos; 90s in the design part of creatures and characters , which is what we had started the society .
So , I wrote this textinct called &quot; Having &quot; with the intention to push the visual effectively , generated to the visual effectively , generated human characters , and all the major generated computers , and all of the major generated computers and the entire world in the computer .
And the whole thing was left to the mitter .
The kids of the society told me that we wouldn &apos;t be able to do it for a while .
So , I accounted it , and I did this movie of a big ship that fashion .
At the study , I throw it out there as a &quot; Romeo and Juliar on a ship . &quot;
It would be a love history of love , a passionate movie .
Segrgrain , what I wanted to do was immersed to see the Titanic .
That &apos;s why I did that movie .
And it &apos;s the truth . The study didn &apos;t know it .
But I convinced them . I said , &quot; We &apos;re going to take it . We &apos;re all going to take it alive .
We will use it for the beginning of the movie .
It &apos;s going to be very important . It &apos;s going to be a great marketing . &quot;
And I convinced them to financial expedition .
It looks like crazy . But this comes back to the imagination that makes reality .
Because we really created a reality and six months later , and six months later , I found on a couple of miles and a half depity in the Atlantic , to look at the real Titanda , not in a high-definition movie , not in a high-definition , but really .
I was stuck .
And it took a lot of preparation , we had to build movies and a lot of other things .
But I stayed from those profound dive , it was like a spatial mission .
where everything was highly technical and they require enormous planning .
And you put in this capsule , go down to this hostile environment where there are no hope to be saved , that you can &apos;t go back from .
And I thought , &quot; Fantastic . It &apos;s like to live in a fiction movie .
It &apos;s really great . &quot;
And so , I was related to the depth of the depth of the ocean exploration .
Of course , curiosity , scientific component .
It was all . It was adventure .
It was curiosity . It was imagination .
And it was an experience that Hollywood couldn &apos;t offer me .
Well , I could imagine a creature and create a visual effect . But I couldn &apos;t imagine what I could see out of the hobled .
In our next expeditions , I saw with hydrothermal , and sometimes things that I had never seen before , things that no one had ever seen before , which is not even described from science at the time .
So I was all taken from this and I had to do more .
So I got a curious decision .
After the success of Titanic , I said , &quot; OK , I &apos;m going to put on my newspaper of Hollywood , and I do the explorer for a while . &quot;
So , we started planning these expeditions .
We found us to go to Bismark and explore it with robotic vehicles .
We went back to the Titanic .
We took small robots that we had done with fiber optics .
And the idea was of going inside and do a nave inside of the ship , which was never done .
No one had ever looked at the inside of the ceiling . They didn &apos;t have the means to do it .
So there &apos;s the Titanic , sitting in a submersible , sitting in a submersible , by looking just like this , where I knew that they had played the violinists .
And I &apos;m driving a little robotized vehicle through the ship of the ship of ship .
When I say that , I &apos;m driving it , but my mind is in the vehicle .
It seemed to be physically present inside of the Titanic .
And it &apos;s been the most surreal that I &apos;ve ever ever ever ever lived , because I had before to turn the corner , I knew what would would have to be behind , before the vehicle the vehicle , because I had the set for months to spin the movie .
And the set was based on an exact replica of the ship of the ship model of the ship .
So it was an absolutely extraordinary experience .
And it really made me realize that in the telepresence that you can experience through these robots , the mind is injected in the vehicle , in this other form of existence .
It was very profound .
And it may be a small amount of what could happen between a few ten-decade when we will start to have cyborg for explorations or for the explorations or for other reasons in some kinds of future human post-human future that I can imagine , by the amongst what they are .
So , we &apos;ve done these expeditions , and then started to appreciate what was there , like the openness of the depths of the ocean and there were these ordinary animals .
And basically , they are aliens right here on the earth .
They live in a chemosynthesis .
They don &apos;t survive in a system based on the sunlight as we do .
So , you see animals that live next to 500 degree centigrade .
It looks like even even impossible that exist .
At the same time I was interested in the same time , I was interested in space science , again , is the flu of phanthids , as a guy .
And I ended up in space environment , really involved with NASA , sitting in the advice of NASA , sitting in advice of NASA , to plan spatial missions , go to Russia , to go to Russia , go to go to Russia , to go to fly to international station with our 3D tells .
It was fascinating .
But what I ended to do to do is bring the space scientists with us in the abissi .
And they bring them down because they could have access -- astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people interested in these extremes , they were interested in these extremes , bring them down and allow them to see , take samples , and so on .
So , we were looking at the documentary , but we actually did science , space science , spatial science .
I had ring the ring between being being fan of fiction , as a boy , to do those things for really .
And you know , in the course of discovery , I learned a lot .
I learned a lot of science . But I also learned a lot about leadership .
Everybody thinks that a regist should be a leader , the ship of the ship , or something like that .
I didn &apos;t know any leadership before I do all those expeditions .
Why do I had to say , &quot; What am I doing here ?
Why am I doing that ? What did I do ? &quot;
You don &apos;t get anything to do all these spectacles .
You know , we &apos;re going to pares . There &apos;s not famous .
People think about it as much as I went to Titanic and &quot; Have &quot; and &quot; Have to , &quot; and the same pollic sitting on some beach .
I did all these movies , all these documentary documentary for an audience so limited .
No , no glory , no glory , no money . What am I doing ?
I &apos;m doing it for the task for itself , for the challenge -- and the ocean is the greatest challenge that there is , for the brid of discovery , and for that struggle to instature when a small group of form a team of compact .
Because we did everything with 10-12 people , working together for years .
Sometimes in the sea for 2-three months .
And in that bond , you realize the important thing is the respect that you have for them , and that they have for you , when you finished a task that you can &apos;t explain to any other .
When you go to the earth and explain , &quot; We had to do this , and the fiber optics , and the fiber , and that , all of technology , and the difficulty , the perfect thing when you can &apos;t explain .
To create a bond , create a bond of respect .
When I came back to do my next movie , &quot; I mean , &quot; I was trying to apply the same principle of leadership is respect the team to be respect their respect .
It &apos;s really changed the dynamic .
And so there is still one again with a small group , in the earthquake to do . &quot; In fact , &quot; with new technologies that didn &apos;t exist before .
Terribly exciting .
Tremendtionously .
And we became a family , in four and a half years .
And it completely changed my way to do movies .
People have commented by saying that I took the organisms from the ocean and I put them on the planet Pandora .
For me , it was the way to do business , the process of doing business ,
What can we find ?
What is the lessons that we have learned ?
I think the first is curiosity .
It &apos;s the most powerful thing that we have .
The imagination is a force that can actually manifestate a reality .
And the respect of the group is more important than all the allowers of the world .
Now , regists come to me and they say , &quot; Damps me to do this . &quot;
And I say , &quot; Don &apos;t bribe .
Other people will do it for you , don &apos;t do it for you , don &apos;t beat against yourself .
And you &apos;re going to get risks .
And NASA is always said , &quot; The mistake is not contemplated . &quot;
But the mistake must be an option in art and exploration , because it &apos;s like to do a vacuum in .
And no important attempt that required innovation was done without risk .
You have to be disposed to run these risks .
This is the thought that I want to leave you , which is the mistake is an option , but fear not . Thank you .
If I wanted to figure out one big idea would be the one great idea of the data that we use is larger than the sum of its parts , and that , instead of thinking about thinking about how to get you to use information to emerge new trend , otherwise invisible .
And here you see the typic statistics of organized mortality .
This instrument that I use is a small experiment .
It &apos;s called Pivot , and Pivot , and the Pivot , and the accidents .
And then we can see emerge new relationships .
The reason is that in the central part of people are more active . And they are more fragile .
We can take a step back and reorganizing the data because of death , we see circulatories and cancer are the greatest , but not for everyone .
If we go on and filtering for age , we see the accidents are the cause of death to worry about .
It &apos;s closer for men .
So you have to figure out that out of information and data in these way is a little bit like to swim in a sea of information information .
And if we can do it with grew data ?
For example , we have the cover of every Sports Illustrated .
Everything here . Everything in the network .
You can get into your rooms and try and you also .
You can look at a decade .
Or a specific year .
You can iar a particular number .
For example , we take athletes that look at this number , their sports .
I &apos;m a fan of Lance Armstrong , so click here and I see all the numbers in which I see Lance Armstrong .
Now , if I want to give us a look , I would think , &quot; Why don &apos;t I look at all the cyclism ? &quot;
I &apos;m going to go back and I &apos;m going to put up the visual .
And I see Greg Lemond .
You know that when you get to figure out that when you navigate the information in this closer , and forth is not only a research , it &apos;s not just the browser .
But you do something slightly different .
It &apos;s a half a second way that will change as we can use information .
Let &apos;s refer this idea that may look like a little crazy .
We took every single page of Wikipedia , and we reduced it to a short ripppage that is a small synosses and an icon that subject the area .
I &apos;ll just show you the first 500 of the most visit on Wikipedia .
Even in this limited screen , we can do very much .
You can understand what areas are the most visit on Wikipedia .
They start at this governments .
This option we see that Wikipedia categories more often associated with this voice are the &quot; Personages of the Anno &quot; of Time Magazine .
This is significant because it makes something that in Wikipedia , there was no .
And you can see it just by making a step back to see the together .
If I take one of these reassunts , I can zoom on the category of &quot; Time Magazine . &quot;
and see them all .
And I can see most of the government of the world , some of the government of the world . Some of the world of science .
That &apos;s my boss .
One comes from music .
And rather interesting , Bono has also won a TED prize .
So , we &apos;re going to see all the windows of the TED prize .
For the first time , we &apos;re really navigating as if it was a network , it &apos;s not page , but to an upper page .
I want to show you another thing that could surprise you could surprise .
This is the New York Times site .
Pivot , this application -- we don &apos;t call a browser , because it &apos;s not a browser , but it &apos;s not a browser , but it &apos;s technology for any web page , like this .
I can take a step back and I can go back to a specific section . This is important because the only seeing the Web pages so I see my navigation in the Internet at the same same same way .
I can zoom on what I did in specific moments .
In fact , you can see the state of the demo that I just presented .
I can somehow to re-see other things I &apos;ve seen in the day .
If I want to do one step back and see all I can do with my historic or the historic of my research , or the historic of my research .
I was looking at the netic way , I was trying to be the Bing , here for Live Labs Pivot .
And I can come from here . I can zooming my Web , and I can just put it up here .
One metaphor reused many times , and every case , the result is greater than the sum of the parts , of the data of parent data .
So the world , the data are seen as a kind of a malmaledition .
It &apos;s talking about overload of information .
It &apos;s about drowning in data .
What if we put all subject to if we put the Week instead of going to go from one thing to another , we would used to go from one thing to each other , and then we can see those structures that otherwise would be hidden ?
And then instead of hearing it in the data , we could really extreme information .
Instead of worrying about information , we can pull out of knowledge .
And by knowledge , maybe you &apos;re also going to wisdom .
And with this thank you .
And these days , they all talk about happiness .
I asked to count the number of books , the word &quot; happiness &quot; in the title and published over the last five years , they stopped to 40 , and there were many of them .
There &apos;s a huge wave of interest on happiness , between the researchers .
There &apos;s a lot of coaching about happiness .
Everybody wants to make people happiest people .
But despite this flow of work , there are a series of jobs , there are a series of cognitive translation , which somehow do they make impossible to work on happiness .
My speech is going to be about these cognitive trappings .
And it &apos;s about people who think about their happiness , and it &apos;s about studying happiness , because it turns out we are confused as all of the other people .
The first one of these trappliance is the puck to admit the complexity .
In fact that the word is not useful , the word is not useful as much as much as much as it looks like .
And I think we can do that in a particular meaning , but the maximum line , we &apos;ll have to do this acception , and we &apos;ll have to adopt the most complicated view of what is well-being .
The second second transplates is the confusion between experience and memory : that &apos;s basically choosing between being happy in life and be happy about their life and be happy about their life .
And these are two concepts , both of the concept of happiness .
And the third is the illusion of the focus is the unfortunate for which we can &apos;t think about a circumstance that affects on the well-being without respect the importance .
I mean , it &apos;s a real cognitive transplates .
and there &apos;s no way to do the right thing .
I &apos;d like to start with an example of a person who , after a session of questions and answers , after my lesson , he told a story .
&#91; unclear ... &#93; He said that while he was listening to a symphony of music , right at the end of the recording , and he heard a terribly strange .
And then added , very emotional fashion , which was rovined the entire experience .
But it wasn &apos;t true .
What he was rovinated was the memories of the experience .
He had lived the experience .
And she had heard for 20 minutes of music .
but it didn &apos;t matter because he stayed with a certain memories ; the member was roved , and the memories was all that stay .
What this episode tells us , in the bottom , is that we could think about ourselves and other people in terms of two . &quot;
There &apos;s a sis that lives of experiences , which lives in the present and knows the present , and it &apos;s capable to live , but it &apos;s actually just the present .
It &apos;s the &quot; himself that lives the experience and the doctor comes up -- you know when the doctor asks , you know when the doctor asks is bad now , when I touch here ? &quot;
And then there is a reminds of it , &quot; it &apos;s the &quot; himself that reminds the story of our life , and it &apos;s the story of our life , and that &apos;s what the doctor is coming up to ask , &quot; How about the last days ? &quot;
or &quot; How did your journey in Albania ? &quot; or something like that .
Those are two different entities , the himself that lives an experience and what if you remember , and confusion between the two is part of the confusion of happiness .
The self that reminds , it &apos;s a story .
And this process starts with a fundamental answer of our remembered -- it starts immediately .
We don &apos;t tell stories only when we decided to tell them .
Our memory tells stories , which is the one of our experiences is a story .
Let me start with an example .
It &apos;s an old study .
It reports the experiences of two patients during a painful procedure .
I &apos;m not going to do it in details . It &apos;s not even more painful to the day , but it was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
He asked the patients to report their pain every 60 seconds .
And here &apos;s the results for two patients .
Those are their results .
If you ask you , &quot; Who &apos;s two suffered ? &quot;
It &apos;s a very simple question .
Of course , the PatiB has suffered more .
And the columns was more and for every minute of pain of the patient suffered from the patient A patient has suffered at least as well .
But now there &apos;s another question , &quot; How much these patients think they have suffered ? &quot;
And here &apos;s the surprise : Osis the Patient A had a member of the Patient B.
The columns of columns were different because one of the delicate part of the procedure is the way to end -- none of those stories are particularly positive -- but one of the two is particularly -- one of the two is particularly worst -- one of the two is particularly worst of the other .
And the worst is that where the pain was most at the time .
It &apos;s a negative story .
How do I know ?
Why we asked these people after the colongoing , and even distance of time , &quot; How negative was the experience , everything considered ? &quot;
and it turned to be much worse for B , in the memories .
So it &apos;s a conflict between the sis that lives the experiences and the sis that it reminds .
From the point of view that it lives the experience , is clear that B has been suffered .
So , what you could do for the patient A , and we did clinical experiments , and it was really done , and it was really done , and it could extending the columns of the Patient A Patient . And then , you could extensive the columns of the Patient .
This will cause a little bit of pain in the patient , but just a little bit , and much less than before .
And by doing this for a couple of minutes , the sis that lives the Patient A will be worse , and the sis that reminds the experience of Patient A will be much better , because now the Patient A memories of his experience .
How do you call a story ?
And this is true for the stories that are reminds for the stories that we &apos;re going to define . What is the changes the significant moments and the final moments .
The final is very , very important and , in this case , the final dominated .
So , the sis that lives his life life continues .
It &apos;s moments when it lives experiences that they follow .
And the answer is simple .
I &apos;m lost forever to say that most of the moments of our life -- for how I have calculated them -- I mean the psychological present , it &apos;s about three seconds , which means that in a life , we have about 600,000 . In one month , we count about 600,000 . In a month , they count about 600,000 , most of the part of them .
Most of them are completely ignored by the way that remember .
And yet , somehow you have the sensation that should count , what happens in these moments of experience is our life .
It &apos;s the limited resources that we &apos;re spending as we &apos;re in this world .
And how to spend it , it would seemingly relevant , but it &apos;s not the story that it reminds for us .
So we have a sis that reminds and a sis that lives that are quite different .
The greatest difference between two is how to treat time .
From the point of view that it lives , if you go to vacance , and the second week is funny as the first , then the vacation of two weeks is twtwice better than a week .
But this is absolutely not the way that works the sis that remember .
For the sis that reminds , a two-year vacance of a week of vacation because there are no new member in addition .
You have no story .
And in this way , the time is the variable variable , the critical various , that reminds out of the sis that lives .
The time has a limited impact on this story .
Well , the sis that reminds the experience of the most to remember and telling stories .
It &apos;s actually a decision that makes decision , because if we consider a patient who has had , for example , two split in with two different doctors and is deciding what the two-columns is the one that it &apos;s going to be willing . &quot; And that &apos;s going to be the doctor .
The sits that lives doesn &apos;t have voice in these choices .
In fact , we don &apos;t choose between experiences , but among members of those experiences .
And even when we think about our future , we don &apos;t think of our future as experiences .
We think of our future as anticipated memories .
So , you can actually look at this situation as a tyrannia of the sis that reminds , and you can think of how if you transmit the sis that lives through experiences , it doesn &apos;t need .
I have the sensation that when we go in vacation is often the case that , you go vacation in good part to the service of our sis that reminds .
And this is a little difficult to justify .
That &apos;s , how do we consume ?
This is one of the explanations that is given for the predomination of the sand that reminds .
When I think about that , I &apos;m in mind a vacation in Antarctica a few years ago , which is one of the best vacation of my life , and that I think relative to the other vacation vacation .
And I probably spent the time thinking of that three-year-old journey , for 25 minutes , for the last four years .
If I had ever opened the sign with the 600 photographs of the journey , I would have spent another now . It &apos;s about three weeks of journey that translated into the most of the journey that translation into a bunch of time .
Well , I could be a little extreme , in my shot , in my shot , and I could be a little bit more than that , a genuine questions .
Why do we have so weight to memory than the weight that we have experiences ?
Now , I want you to think of an experiment with thought .
Imagine that during the vacations that at the end of the vacance of the vacation will be destroyed , and you take a medical medicine for amnesia so that you don &apos;t remember anything .
And if you could choose the same vacation ? And if you could choose a different vacation , you create a conflict between the two sits , and you have to think about how to solve conflict and actually , it &apos;s not so obvious why , if you think of time you &apos;ll have an answer .
And if you think in terms of remember , you could get another answer .
And because we choose the vacations that we do , is a problem that puts us in front of choices .
The two is bring two notions of happy .
There are actually two concepts of happy that we can use , one for every dream .
So you can ask : How happy is , how happy is that experience ?
And then you can ask : How happy moments are the moments in life of the sas that lives ?
And it &apos;s -- happiness for moments is a complicated process .
What are the emotions that we can measure ?
And , by the way , we are able to do a good idea of the happiness of the sand that lives in the time .
If you wonder about the sis that reminds , it &apos;s a completely different thing .
It &apos;s not about how happy happy a living person .
It &apos;s about how satisfactured is the person when she thinks his life .
It &apos;s a very different idea .
Anyway can &apos;t tell these two notions , it &apos;s not going to be able to create confusion in happiness , and I looked at a group of wealthy students , and I look at a group of wealthy students , which have unfolded the studies of the long time .
And the difference between happiness of the subtle experiences and satisfaction of the sand that reminded has been recognized in the last years , and there are now some efforts to measure the two separately , the Gallup to a world where more half a million people in the world , where more than half a million people have been subtle to a questions about what their life and their experiences .
And there were other studies in this direction .
So in the last few years , we started to learn about two sits .
And the biggest lesson that we have learned , is that they &apos;re very different .
You may know how a person is satisfied with your life , and yet this doesn &apos;t tell you very much about how happy they are living their life and close .
To give you an idea of correlation , correlation is about 0.5 .
Which means that if you meet someone , and they said , &quot; Oh , his father is 1,80 , she &apos;s 1,80 feet up ?
Well , you would know something about his height , but with a lot of uncertainty .
You would always have a little uncertainty .
If I tell you that someone thinks that his life is at eight in a scale by one to 10 , you will be very uncertainty on how happy they are to be with their sis that live experiences .
So correlation is low .
We have a certain knowledge of what controls satisfaction of the satisfaction .
We know that money is very important , objectives are very important .
We know that being happy means to be satisfied with people that we like , to spend the time with people that we like .
And there are other pleasures , but these are the main ones .
So if you want to male the happiness of two sits , you &apos;ll end up doing very different things .
The conclusion of what I said so far is that we should not think about happiness as a wealth .
It &apos;s about two completely different ideas .
So , very quickly , another reason that we can &apos;t think about linear ways that we can &apos;t think about the same things when we think about life , and when we live .
So if you ask the simple question of how happy people in California , you can &apos;t get the right answer .
When you ask this question , you think you should be more happy in California , which in Ohio .
What happens is that when you think about life in California , you &apos;re thinking about the contrast between California and other places , and for example , is the climate .
Well , it turns out that the climate is not so important for the sand that lives , and it &apos;s not very important for the sand that it &apos;s not very important for the reflects that it &apos;s the people .
But because it &apos;s reflects is , you could end -- some people could end -- some people could end , at the end , transfer to California .
And it &apos;s interesting to be what &apos;s going to happen to people who transfer to California in the hope of being happier .
Well , the sis that it lives , it &apos;s not going to become happy .
We know it .
But something will happen . They think they &apos;re more happy , because when they think about it , they will remember what awful was the time in Ohio .
And they &apos;re going to think of the right decision .
It &apos;s very difficult to think of wealth and I think I gave you the idea of how hard it is .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you . I &apos;ve got a question for you .
Thank you very much .
When we were at the phone a couple of weeks ago , he mentioned to me that an interesting outcome from the Gallup .
Is it something that thinks we can share as we see that we still have a few minutes ?
Daniel Kahan : Yeah .
I think the most interesting result that we found in the Gallup is a number , that we didn &apos;t expect to find out .
We found that , with reference to the sis that lives .
When we observed as the income feelings with income , we found that , at the bottom of a 60,000 dollars per year , for Americans , on a very vast study of a very vast sample of about 600,000 Americans , it &apos;s a sample of about 600,000 dollars a year --
CA : 60,000 dollars a year , 60,000 dollars a year , people are inhappy , and they become progressive , and they become progressively happy as they become more poor as they become more happy as they become more poor .
I mean , I saw rarely the lines .
Of course , what happens is that the money doesn &apos;t buy happiness of the experience , but the lack of money , of course , misery , and we can measure that misery , and we can measure that misery .
In terms of the other sis , it &apos;s all another story .
More money , the more content you are .
This talk is not regard on emotions .
CA : But Danny , everybody &apos;s efforts of Americans are looking for life , liberty , the pursuit of happiness .
If people take seriously this discovery , you actually understand this , you basically understand what we &apos;ve believed , for example , the policy on taxes and so on .
Is it the possibility that politicians , and the country general , can take a discovery like that seriously and bring on a public policy about it ?
DK : You know I think he recognizes the role of happiness in public policy .
The prise of consideration will be slow in the United States , there &apos;s no doubt , but in the universe , it &apos;s becoming reality , and in other states .
People are starting to recognize that they should think about happiness when they think about public policy .
It &apos;s going to be a little bit and people will start to talk if they want to study the experience of happiness or whether they want to study the valuable life that we need to start this debate to the most soon .
As you accept the happy happy , it will be different directions to how you think about , and to depense , and the second that you think of the sis that it makes the experiences .
That &apos;s going to affect politics , I think , in the years will be .
In the United States , they are doing efforts to measure the experience of the population .
And this , I think , it &apos;s going to be part by the next decade , maybe two , the national statistics .
CA : Well , it seems to me that this argument will be , or not should be , the most interesting policy to follow in the next years .
Thank you very much for invented behavioral economy .
Thank you , Danny Kahan .
I &apos;m going to talk about climate and climate .
It may seem strange , because in my work at the foundation of vaccine and seeds , and things to invent and make the world to help the two billion people in the world in order to help the other lives .
But climate and energy , actually , they are extremely important for people , actually are more important for them than anybody else in the world .
A worst climate means , for many years , loss of loss .
It &apos;s going to be too much rain , or too bad .
Things will change in ways that their fragile environment just can &apos;t sustain .
That leads to hunger . At the uncertainty .
So the climate cames , they will be terrible for them .
Even the cost is , for them , important .
In fact , if you could load the price of one thing , to reduce the poverty , you would choose of long energy .
The price of energy is except in time .
And a civilization of the progress in the energy field .
The coal-powered revolution has food that industrial .
And in the 20th century , we &apos;ve been seeing a quick decline in the price of electricity , which explains why we have refrigoriference , we can create modern materials and do so many things .
So in the rich world , so we &apos;re about electricity in an excellent situation .
But as the price goes down , for example , we have to respect a new vination , the vination of CO2 emissions .
The CO2 is climbing the planet , and its equation is very simple .
Remitted causing a temperature increase , which induces very negative effects .
Effets on the climate and , maybe even worst , indeed , in the sense that natural ecosystems , they can &apos;t fit to the natural ecosystems .
The usation of how much increasing temperature because of an increasing CO2 , and as each of the two worst things the other , and it &apos;s uncertain , but not very much .
And there &apos;s definitely uncertainty of how negative will be , but it &apos;s certainly going to be extremely negative .
And I often asked the best scientists : we have to really reduce our best scientists ?
Don &apos;t we only reduce half or a quarter ?
And the answer is , until we go down to zero , the temperature will continue to get up .
It &apos;s a big challenge , so .
It &apos;s not like to say , &quot; Let &apos;s go to 3.5 miles down a 3 bridge . &quot;
It &apos;s not about &quot; just a little bit . &quot;
It &apos;s about zero .
Now , we have a lot of CO2 every year , over 26 billion tons .
About 20 tons per American .
For the poor countries in the poor countries , is less than a ton tlaid .
The world is about five tons per capita .
And somehow , we have to do progress that can take that amount of zero .
emissions are constantly increased .
Only some economic changes this tendency , so we have to go to rapidly decrease to zero .
This equation has four factors .
It &apos;s a series of multiply .
We &apos;ve got it on the left , CO2 , which has to be roughly , and the factors on the right is the population , the services that in each person uses each service , the average energy request from each service and CO2 for units of energy .
We stick each factor and we see how we can put it .
Probably , one of those numbers has to lower fin almost zero .
It &apos;s higher algebra .
We see a little bit .
The first factor is the population .
The world has now 6.8 billion people .
We go to 9 billion .
If we do a good job with new vaccine , healthier , health reproductive , we can decrease it , we can decrease it , maybe about 30 percent .
The second factor are the service that we use .
Which is understanding all the food that we eat , the clothes , the TV , warming .
It &apos;s desirable things , and liberation of poverty means to provide these services for almost everybody in the world .
And it &apos;s a good thing that this is increasing number .
In the rich world , in a billion world , we probably could save and use less , but in average , every year , this is going to be going to be the number .
And so , complex , the amount of service is going to be more than double .
This is a very simple example of service .
You have the lightening in your house , to do your homework , but these guys don &apos;t , so they exist and read their homework below the lampions .
As efficiency as efficiency as efficiency as efficiency as well , there are good news .
This factor is not increasing .
Thank you very much inventions , new ways of illuminate , automobiles made differently , for many services , you can decrease the energy consumption .
In some services you can reduce 90 percent .
There are some other services , like fertilizer , or airplane transport , where margins of improvements are very , much lower .
So , complex , in the best of the cases , the energy consumption will be three to are six times .
But this first three factors reduces 26 , in the best one of the best one , maybe 13 billion tons .
It &apos;s not enough .
Let &apos;s look at the fourth factor , the key factor , the amount of CO2 emitted .
The question is , can we reduce it ?
If they burn coal , no .
If they burn natural , no .
Almost all the ways to produce today , electricity , in part of renewable and nuclear , emit CO2 .
So what we &apos;re going to do on a global scale ,
And we need , &quot; energy miracles . &quot;
I &apos;m going to miracle , I don &apos;t mean something impossible .
The microprocessor is a miracle . The computer is a miracle .
The Internet , and her services , I &apos;m a miracle .
People here today have participated with many miracles .
We don &apos;t usually have a scade , one given by which to reach the miracle .
And usually , it &apos;s the window , and something else is not .
In this case , we have to drive at all , and make a miracle in very small times .
I wondered : How to illustrate this concept ?
Is there some natural example , some natural demonstration that captured the imagination of people ?
I thought about a year ago , when the mosquitoes , and people found it fun .
You know , the particles of the fact that , in the world , there are people who live with mosquitoes .
That &apos;s my idea for energy .
I decided that we want to fly the mothers would be this year my contributed to the environment .
So here &apos;s the fill .
They tell me that they &apos;re not going to come out of the barattle .
Now , we can invent us as this , but it &apos;s not going to be help .
We need solutions , one or so many of them are , which are working on large scale and very reliable , and even though you &apos;re exploring in many directions , I think only five will be important .
I excluse the brands , nuclear fusion , nuclear fusion , nuclear fusion , biofusion , biofusion .
It may also help help help help , and if they can do more than I look like , but I &apos;m interested in the subject that we &apos;re going to work on each of those five , and they don &apos;t give up any one of those five , and they don &apos;t give up any , because all of those are challenges .
We &apos;re going to do for the first combustion fossil fuel , coal or natural gas that is .
So here our task looks simple , but it &apos;s not , and it &apos;s not , and it &apos;s catching CO2 , after the combustion , pressuing it , remains , put it somewhere , and hoping that we put it in .
Now , there are experimental technologies that capture 60 -- 80 percent of CO2 , but it &apos;s going to be very complicated , and it &apos;s going to be very difficult to agree on where to preserve all this CO2 .
The most frightening issue is anyway .
Who is going to fix ?
Who will guarantee something that &apos;s literally billions of times more voluminous than any other kinds of rejecable , how nuclear or anything else ?
It &apos;s a huge volume .
So it &apos;s a difficult problem .
Another source would be nuclear .
But the nuclear is three big problems .
The cost , especially in very regulate countries , it &apos;s high .
The issue of security , security feeling that nothing can go wrong , although the empile is missed by human operators , and that the fuel doesn &apos;t be used to be used to be beautiful .
And how would you deal ?
In fact , the amount of reducts , the concern are many .
People need to be rassured .
Therefore difficult problems , which you could solve , and what you should work .
The last three sources of five sources .
They are those that people often call &quot; renewable . &quot;
And to say , real , although the great advantage of not require a fuel , they present a few disadvantages .
The first one is that the density of energy with these technologies , it &apos;s very lower than the electric central .
It &apos;s collecting energy , and so many square kilometers , of areas of thousands of times as an electric central .
And these sources are intermingly .
The sun doesn &apos;t sun all the day , or all the days , and even the wind suffering .
So if you depends on these sources , you have to find an electric energy even when the source doesn &apos;t produce .
Grosed challenging us on the front of the costs .
And the distribution .
For example , let &apos;s say that this energy source is outside .
So not only need you technology , but you also have to do the risks with the risks on the outside .
And finally , the problem of accumulation .
To estimate the size of the problem , I analyzed all the kinds of bacteria that are doing today , for computer , telephones , any , I have compared to the amount of electrical energy in the world , and I found that all the bacteria now produced that all the bacteria are now production of all that stuff .
So we really need a big step on , a hundred times as an improvement of the approaches .
That &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not very simple .
This problem is now now now , when the sources of intermelts , say , 20 or 30 percent of the energy consumption .
If you then , you get to those sources for 100 percent , you need a battery &quot; miraculous . &quot;
But how are we going to do this road ?
Is it a Manhattan Project ?
A lot of companies , in hundreds , they have to put at work .
We need at least hundred people in each of these five sectors .
Many of them , observing them , you would call them crazy . That &apos;s good .
And I think that in the TED group , many people are already working in these fields .
Bill Gross has different companies , including a call eSolar that vast large technologies in the thermal solar .
Vinod Khosla is investing in the dozens of companies that are doing great things , and they have interesting potential power , and I &apos;m giving my supporting all this .
Nathan Myhrvold and I are funding a company that , it &apos;s going to give you , following the nuclear road of .
There are some innovations in the race , nuclear modular , nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear ,
But from a good time , the sector is stopped , that there &apos;s some good ideas around , it &apos;s not so amazing .
And the idea of Terrapower is that , instead of burning only part of the U235 , the one percent of the uranium available , we &apos;ve decided to burn the one percent of the available , we &apos;ve decided to burn for the 238 , 99 percent . It &apos;s a crazy idea , in a sense .
For the truth if it talks about a long time , but it &apos;s never been adequately proved if it would work or not , just because of the modern supercomputer , you can do a simulation and see that yes , with the right materials , it seems to work .
And because they burn 99 percent of the uranium percent of the uranium , the costs highly .
They burn down , and they use as a fuel , and they use as a fuzzy reactors of today , they become , from the problem that they were , a resource to exploit .
It &apos;s the uranium as as combustion processes . It &apos;s a kind of candle .
It &apos;s like a leap of wood wooden burning . It &apos;s called a progressive reactor .
From a combustible , the problem is solved .
Here &apos;s a picture of a place in Kentucky .
This is the download , 99 percent of the uranium , which has been taken the part as a fuel , and so therefore it is called an impovered .
So , these downlower energy in the United States for centuries .
And filtering the sea water , with an economic process , there would be enough fuel for the rest of life of this planet .
So a lot of challenges us , but this is an example of the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to design .
How should we measure our progress ?
What would they do for the page ?
Identify the goal , and then we value the internal steps .
You &apos;ve heard a lot of people talking about an 80 percent reduction for 2050 , it &apos;s really very important to do that .
20 percent will be produced by poor countries , and a little bit of agriculture .
At that point , hopefully , we &apos;ll have deforestation and the production production .
To get 80 percent , so , the countries developed countries , including nations like China , they have to replace their electric production .
The other question is : are we doing this zero emission technology ?
We put it in practice in the developing countries ?
Are we spread .
It &apos;s a very important thing .
It &apos;s a key element of the page .
By the way , what should it look like the 2020 ?
Even that should have the same two aspects .
We should implementary efficiency of efficiency to start getting reductions .
We empathy , minor will be the amount of CO2 , and so the temperature .
But the voice in this matter , to do things that are not great reductions , has a weight only pari , or even slightly or even lower , to another one , which is the speed of innovation .
We have to push these progress at all , and we can measure the speed of companies , pilot , changes of regulations .
Many opties have been written about this .
The book of Al Gore , &quot; choice , &quot; and that David McKay , &quot; Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air . &quot;
Those books are approaching the problem and they create a context in which they do the debate , because these things need to be a spread .
Many things have to be contemporary .
So , I have a wish ,
A very concrete that we &apos;re going to invention for technology .
If I had to choose a only wish for the next 50 years , between : we could choose the president of the country , the realization of a vaccine , which I also try to do this .
It would be the largest impact .
If that &apos;s not going to be done , the fracture between those who thinks in the short and the United States , between the United States and China , in the poor and rich , it will be awful , and mainly , the life of those two billions of people will be much worse .
So what do we have to do ?
What am I inviting you to take the initiative and go ?
It &apos;s necessary to do research .
When nations came together in places like Copenhagen as Copenhagen .
And they should be talking about the innovations program , and you would be stupid of how much ridiculous we invest in these innovative approaches .
We need incentives , taxes on the CO2 , &quot; cap and trade , which evidence the cost of pollution .
We have to spread the message .
We have to make this rational dialogue and understand , and it has to include the government choices .
It &apos;s a busy desire , but I think .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you .
Thank you .
First of all , you can give us a sense of investment ?
Bill Gates : Realize the software , to buy the supercomputer , to take all the great scientists , what we &apos;ve done we &apos;ve done , it only tens of millions , and even when we &apos;re testing the materials in an reactor , to be sure that we &apos;re going to work to have , we &apos;ll be talking about hundreds of millions .
The difficult thing is to build the pilot , find billions of , the competent authority , the place that will be built the first place that will be built the first animals .
Once built the first , if it works as an announced , it &apos;s going to be eggs , because the costs , density of energy , are completely different from the nuclear that we know today .
CA : So , if I understand that , this implica the construction , well-under-great-batoypal batoial full of nuclear fuel , of this kind of unburies .
And then the process starts from the top and the bottom ?
BG : Right . The reactors , today , they are continually request , many people , many controls that can &apos;t work , open , and things that come up --
It &apos;s not good !
If the fuel is very cheap , you can do it for 60 years , put it down for 60 years , put it and forgotten all those complexity .
It &apos;s there , burning for sessing years , and then finished .
CA
BG : Yeah . Well , you can leave them there , then you can put them in another reactor and burn them .
And we &apos;re going to start with the refident , now conserved in the vast of roughly reactors .
It &apos;s going to be our first fuel .
So what was a conventional reactors is going to be the coal of our , and the flourish will be impressive .
CA : But when you talk around the world of the potential of this technology , where most interest to do it ?
BG : Well , there &apos;s no place in particular , and there are all these interesting rules of transparency on everything that is defined nuclear , so we shake a lot of interest .
Our staff was in Russia , India , China .
I just met the Segretary for the Energary .
We &apos;ve been talking about how this idea came to the program .
They are optimistic . French and Japanese did work in this field .
It &apos;s a variation of something that was done .
It &apos;s an substantial improvement , but it &apos;s a quick reactor , which many countries have already built , so anybody has built a fast reactor to account our .
CA : You know , what are the time and the probability of the kind of thing ?
BG : Well , for one of this whole scale projects , which is not very much , we talk about 20 years to design it and 20 to build it .
It &apos;s this scadence that environmental models are being tassy .
Terrapower , if everything is good , it &apos;s not wondered , it may easily satisfy this goal .
And now there are , luckily , dozens of companies in the sector , that analogously , if their research works , if their research works , if the funding for their pilot , will compete .
And it &apos;s better if a lot of solutions will have succeed , because it &apos;s going to have a set of solutions .
It &apos;s necessary that at least a success .
CA : The important innovations , revolutionary innovations , this is the greatest you know ?
BG : A energy revolution is the most important thing .
And it would be even without the environmental vination , but the environmental vination , they really make it much more important .
In nuclear race , there are other innovators .
We don &apos;t know their work as well as this , but one is the nuclear weapon , a different approach .
There &apos;s a liquid reactor . I think it &apos;s hard to do , but maybe they say the same thing about us .
So , there are different , but the good is that a molecule of uranium , a million times more energy than one molecule , let &apos;s say , if you can manage to manage the negative , in terms of fact , the potential , in terms of the environment , in terms of effects on the environment and other , it does almost a classroom .
CA : What if it doesn &apos;t work , what do we do ?
Couldn &apos;t we start to get emergency misure to try to keep the earthquakes ?
BG : If you &apos;re in that situation , it &apos;s a little bit like when you eat too much , and you &apos;re going to have a heart attack .
Where do you go to that point ? You could need a surgeon or something similar .
There &apos;s a whole line of research on the so-called geo-engineering , which are various technique that would slow up to make 20 or 30 years in which coordinate the action .
It &apos;s like a reassurance polization .
I hope you don &apos;t need it .
Some people say that you don &apos;t even have to work on the polyzza , because it could put up and keep eating , because the surgeon will save you .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a wide choice , view the importance of the problem , but now in the geoengineering of solutions in the case that the solutions of solutions in the case that the events , or innovations get later on .
CA : Clima-skeptics : if I had a sentence or two from them , how could you persuade them ?
BG : Well , unfortunately , there are different types of skills and the ones that have scientific topics .
Some people say that there &apos;s a negative feedback , because of the clouds that are shaking the effects of warming .
I &apos;m very , very few things that you can also tell you that there &apos;s a probability on one million that are going to look like AIDS .
You can have a mistake now and pay the consequences only much later .
And so , when you &apos;re a thousand emergences , the idea of making sacrifice that you see the results just after ...
It &apos;s sacrifice for junk .
In fact , the IPPPC is not necessarily the worst case ; there &apos;s people in the rich world that look at IPPPC and says , OK , it &apos;s not so bad .
The fact is that that uncertainty should take us the action .
But my dream is that , if we can do it economically , and respect the CO2 , then the skeptics on CO2 , then the skeptics are going to say , &quot; Well , I don &apos;t care if I don &apos;t empathy , I &apos;m going to do it because it &apos;s cheaper than before .
CA : Would it be your response to Bjorn Lomborg , that if you invest all your energies to try to solve the CO2 problem , your other goals , are going to be sacrifice . And that put money , when there are better things to do , it means stupid resources ?
BG : Well , you know , the actual purposing and development --
Let &apos;s say that the U.S.A should spend 10 billion in more than now than they are now .
It should not destinded resources to other scopes .
The things that make a lot of money , and here also people reasonable may display , are the anti-economic solutions .
For me , it &apos;s mostly to me .
Unless that you &apos;re not funding the learning curve , as it comes up to the point where it will be very economic , I think that it &apos;s going to become very economic , I think the efforts are focused in in technologies that have the potential to ababove costs .
If the alternative is , &quot; Let &apos;s make the expensive energy , so that only rich rich rich , all the presents can afford to pay energy five times as much without changing lifestyle .
The disaster would be for those two billion .
And Lomborg saw his positions .
Her subject ? &quot;
And the past he still hit with the skeptics in the skeptics , but it realized it &apos;s a bunch bunch , so it &apos;s a bunch , and so it &apos;s lifting the question of the Remember and Svils .
And it &apos;s a question that I think it &apos;s appropriate .
It &apos;s unbelievable as little as much as you invest and development .
CA : Well , Bill , I think I &apos;m talking about the name of the audience by saying that I hope to see your desire to become reality . Thank you .
BG : Thank you .
I &apos;d like to share with you a discovery that I did a few months ago , as I was writing an article for the Wired magazine .
I &apos;ve always got my dictionary of synonymous , to see what I was writing about something , but I had already ended to correct the article and I realized that I never ever in my life tried to see what I would find .
Let me read the result .
&quot; I said , &quot; He said , &quot; damage : damaged , claimed , claimed , retreaty , inated , peoples , stop , straighted , shopping , overwhelmed , shouted by impotent , empowered by , Senhaked , Senyyyield , depiled by the circulation , bleaves ,
Contrary : In the form , strong .
And I was reading this high-voice list voice to a friend and at the beginning , it was so ridiculous , but , just read the word , I had to put my voice , and I had to stop shock , and I had to get me to the shock and the impact that the assumption of these words have to me .
You know , we &apos;re talking about my old dictionary .
I &apos;m thinking , it &apos;s going to be an old edition , right .
But in fact , it was the early 80s .
When I was starting to elementary schools , and learning what I was forming out of my family and relative things to other children and the world around me .
and , in fact , thank God God , I wasn &apos;t using the substantial dictionary to that time .
I mean , by this explanation looks like that I was born in a world that someone has no positive in any way for them , when I did today , I &apos;m celebrated for them , when I did today , I &apos;m celebrated for the opportunity and the venture that my life has done .
So , I &apos;m immediately going to see 2009 in the network , waiting , waiting for me to find a review without value .
This is the version of the description of the description .
Unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
I find the ultimate two words in &quot; nearly contrary &quot; particularly uncomfortable , &quot; whole &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot; So , it &apos;s not just about the words .
That &apos;s what we believe in people when we call them with these words .
It &apos;s about the values behind these words , and how we build these values .
Our language of influence our thinking and our view of the world and how we see other people .
In fact , many antic civilization , including that Greek and the Romana , believed that they offer verbally was more powerful , because to say , very high-voice things would take them to the existence .
So what do we want to bring to exist , one person who &apos;s limited , or a person with greater force ?
So , casually by doing something simple like nomininate one person , a child , a child , we could put the tapples and thin the shadows of their force .
Don &apos;t we want to open some door for them ?
So one person , who opened up the door , was the doctor of what I was a girl Alin the Dupont in Wilmington , Dupont in Wilmington , Delaware .
His name is Dr. Pizzutille .
Italoe , whose name , it was too difficult to ready for most of Americans , so much of the most of the Americans , so it became docor P.
And the Dr. P had always wossed and colored , and he had a perfect inclination to work with children .
I practice practice that I spent in the hospitals , with the exception of fixes .
I had to do what they seemed to be infinite repepties of exercise , in different colors , you know , to help me build the muscles of legs .
And I hated these elastic elastic .
I would hate them , really hated them .
And , you know , I knew that was about five years old , with Dr. P , to try to figure out out of these exercise , Inutilably .
And one day , one , he came to one of my sitting in Stanants and inesorable , these sitting .
And he said , &quot; Wow , Aimee , you &apos;re a little girl so strong , I think you &apos;re going to break one of those band .
&quot; When I break it , I &apos;ll give you 100 dollars . &quot;
Now , of course , it was just a little handle of the doctor to make me do the army that I didn &apos;t want to do in the perspective of being the second floor , but what he did was to do , it was to give me a different shaped form of a different routine newspapers .
and turn it into an interesting experience for me .
And I wonder today , the entity of his view , and of her deployed on me as a strong , he redefined my vision of me as a little girl , and athleletic and athleletical person to the future .
This is an example of as adults with positions of power can inflate the force of a child .
But , in the example of the first one with the definition of the synonimi , our language is not about the ability to evolversus to the reality that we all want , the possibility of an individual to see in the same way .
Our language , it was not at the step of the changes of our society , many of which have been created by the technology .
of course , from a doctor point of view , my legs , both of my legs , the ginoccurs of titanium and also remarkable for bodies that are helping people to cooperate with their skills , and move beyond beyond the skills that nature has imposed , and to move beyond the skills that nature has imposed to do with the social social networks , allow people to identify ,
So , maybe technology reveals that we are now more clearly what &apos;s always been a truth , that each one has something rare , and to offer to our society , and the human ability to adapt us is our greatest quality .
The human ability to adapt , it &apos;s something interesting , because people always always wanted to talk to me about an insurfactie and I have to admit .
This sentence never did me right , and I &apos;ve always felt in disorder to respond to people to this on the answer to people to this , and I think I &apos;m starting to figure out why .
It &apos;s subject in this sentence , insurmonable , is the idea that success , or happiness , is the idea that success , or happiness , is to come up on the other side of a challenge , if my success in life has come from a skills to slavor or circumcy circumcles .
But in fact , we &apos;ve changed , we are changed , logically , from a challenge , physically or mentally or both .
And I would suggest that it &apos;s a good thing .
The adversity is not a obstacle that we have to rare in a way to reach our life .
It &apos;s part of our life .
And I tend to think that &apos;s like my shadow .
Sometimes almost known as much , and sometimes almost for nothing , but it &apos;s always with me .
And , of course , I &apos;m not trying to decrease the impact , the weight of a person &apos;s suffering of a person .
There &apos;s adversity and challenges in life , and it &apos;s all true and relative to every single person , but the question is not if you &apos;re going to have adversity , or not , but as you &apos;re going to face .
So , our responsibility is not simply protect people to help us from the adversity , but they prepared them to get it in the right way .
And we do a damage to our children when we feel that they &apos;re not ready to adapt .
There &apos;s an important difference and distinction between the fact that the subjective person to be a amputed person , and the subjective opinion of society that you see me or not .
And , in fact , the only disability that I had to face is if the world has ever thought that I could be described by those words .
In our life desire to protect those that we love to give them a cold , hard truth about their medical design , or , really , the designs of their life expectancy , or , really , we have to be able to not to put the first morning in a wall that we can &apos;t put the first morning in a wall that we &apos;ll probably have someone .
Maybe the model of the existing model to look at what &apos;s broken in you and how to put it in the place , it can inquire the subject that the disease itself .
In fact , to not treat one person in the birthday , not to understand his potential , we &apos;re creating another illness to natural suffering that already have .
We &apos;re actually giving a vote of a person in our community .
So we have to see through the disease and in the elenco of human capacity .
and , much more important , there &apos;s a relationship between the perceiver perceived and our great creativity .
So , it &apos;s not about the way to get , or negating , these numerous research as something that we want to avoid or dig below the tapthrooms , but rather find those opportunities in a accident .
So , maybe the idea that I want to explain is that there &apos;s not what like to overcome an adversity , as we applied it to it , to be able to use an aggrabbis , to use a like term , maybe even dancing it together .
And maybe , if we look at an accident as a natural thing and useful , we are less from its presence .
This year we have the birthday of Charles Darwin , and it was 150 years ago , and it was 150 years ago , when I write about evolution , that Darwin illustrated , I think , the truth about the human character .
To tell it in another way , it &apos;s not the strongest of the mirrors that survive , and it &apos;s not even that smart to change .
The conflict is a cration .
In Darwin &apos;s work , between other things , we can recognize that the human ability to survive and develop and develop is driven by the suffering of human spirit through conflicts through human spirit .
So , again , transformation , adaptation , it &apos;s our greatest quality .
And , maybe , until we are not put at the evidence , we don &apos;t know what we are made .
Maybe this is what gives us the adversity , a sense of possess , a sense of your force .
So , we can do a gift it .
We can re-imagine the adversity as something more difficult time .
Maybe we can see it as a change .
The adversity is a change that we &apos;re not even adapted .
I think the biggest adversity that we created is this idea of normality . Now , who is normal ?
There &apos;s no normal . There &apos;s a common , there &apos;s a typical . There &apos;s no normal .
And do you want to meet those wheel people if there were ?
You know , I don &apos;t think .
If we change this paradigm from one on how to get the normality to one on the possibility , or potential , to be a little bit more dangerous , we can understand the force of so many children , and invite their precious skills with the community .
The anthropologists teach us that what we , as humans , we &apos;ve always wanted for the members of our community is to be held , to contribute .
There &apos;s an evidence that in Olanda , 60 thousand years ago , they brought to the triumph , and the subjects with grabs , and , maybe because of the experience and the survival of these people was the value of the community : Don &apos;t see this people as a rare rare and of valuable and value .
A few years ago , I was in a citizens where I grew up in that red area in the Pennsylvania .
and I was standing in front of a tomodors .
He was summed and handed the packages .
I &apos;ve heard this guy , her voice behind me , &quot; but , it &apos;s not Aimee Mullins . &quot; And I flew up , and there &apos;s a half a age man . I had no idea what it was .
And I said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , let &apos;s figure out ? I don &apos;t remember that I &apos;ve ever met me . &quot; He said , &quot; But , I don &apos;t remember you to meet me .
I mean , when we encountered you , I was born with her mother &apos;s panish . &quot;
Rised Oh , that guy .
And , of course , in fact , he was playing a camel .
That guy was the Dr. Kean , a man who had known by the stories of my mother on that day , because , clearly , typically , I arrived in two weeks .
And so , the hostetrical ginecologist of my mother had gone to vacation , so the man who had me birthday was a birthday for my parents .
And , because I was born without performing , and I had the foot , some fingers in this foot , a few fingers in this foot , and he had to be the messagger , this extranem had to be a bad news news news .
He said to me , &quot; I had to give this progress to your parents that you &apos;d never been walking , and that you &apos;ve never had the kind of mobility of mobility that have the other children or no independent life , and you gave me some some of the addressed , and you gave me some of the journal . The extraordinary thing is that he said to me that he had a newspapers of my childhood , which I had won my entire school school ,
that I had married the Girl with the Girl , you know , the Hahan-shoulder , which I had won my own studio bag , or all of my sports , and he used , teaching the students in his course , by teaching students in the school of Hahane and Hahane .
And he called this part of the course , the factor X , the factor of human will .
No progress can keep account of how poderous can be and as a determining in the quality of a person &apos;s life of a person .
And the Dr. Kean continued to explaining me and said , &quot; In my experience , unless you have said , &quot; In my experience , unless you have told them , and even though he &apos;s given a support of a support of , if it comes to us . &quot;
You see , so Dr. Kean has changed his opinion .
It understood that there &apos;s a difference between a medical condition and what each one can do with it .
And there &apos;s been a change in my thinking about the years in this , if you &apos;d asked me when I was 15 , if you &apos;d put in the protesthed of the prosthetic legs that I wouldn &apos;t have a second .
And I was all of that time .
If you ask me , I &apos;m not sure .
And it &apos;s because of the experiences I had with them , not because of the experiences I had with them .
and , maybe , the change in me , because I was exposed to the people who opened me up the door of the door of those that I had obstacked .
See , all that you need is a person that shows you the epiphany of your potential , and you &apos;re talking to your potential . If you can give someone to their chips of their force , the human spirit is so remarkable , if you can do it and open a door for someone at a critical moment , if you can do it and open a door for some of the best ways .
You &apos;re teaching the door to open the door .
In fact , the meaning exact of the word education comes from the root , &quot; which means , to pull out what &apos;s inside , to get the potential .
So again , what is the potential we want to pull out out ?
There was a case study in the 1960s in Grand short , when they were passed from elementary schools to media schools .
It &apos;s called the &quot; evidence in continuity , &quot; we call it aliggment in the United States .
It means to separate students dependently .
And the students with the best people have a more hard program , and teachers , however , they did it for a period of three months , they did it for a period of three months , they gave them optim . &quot; The said they were good , who were smart .
And at the end of the end of this three months , they were having the results at the end of the optim . And , of course , the sad flap of this study , and they took some of the &quot; Othm . &quot; And that &apos;s what happened to the end of the three months .
Those who were remast at school , over the ones I had left .
The crucial part of this study was that the teachers had been given .
The teachers didn &apos;t know it was done this change .
He was just said , &quot; These are the very good students and these are the ones with insufficient .
And so it &apos;s how they started to teach him .
So , I think the real disability is to have a damaged spirit , and a spirit damaged spirit , it doesn &apos;t hope .
It doesn &apos;t see beauty .
It has no longer our natural , child curiosity and our ability to imagine .
If instead , we can sustain the human spirit to keep the hope , to see beauty in themselves and other , to be imaginative and other , to be imaginative and other , to be imaginative and curious , although we &apos;re using our correctly .
When the spirit has these quality , we can create new reality and new ways of being .
And I &apos;d like to leave you with a poetry of a poem for 1,300 named Hajacques my friend Jacques Demboyfriend .
And the poem is called , &quot; The god who know only four words . &quot; Every child known God , not the God of names , not the god of NO , but God &apos;s only know four words and continues and repeated them , saying , go to balling with me .
Thank you .
