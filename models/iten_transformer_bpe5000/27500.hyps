Last year I showed these slides to show that the artica of the artica , which is almost three million years has had the size of the 48 U.S. continental size , it &apos;s retrofit of 40 percent .
But this subtle the gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice ice of the ice .
The artica ice ice ice is , in a sense , the heart of the global climate system .
It expanded up and summer reverse .
The next slide is going to be a carrying carloned on the last 25 years .
The glaces are reported in red .
You see , they go up to the blue blue box .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter , which is summer ice retreated .
You can see that the constitute , five years or more , is like the blood , that &apos;s like the blood , which is like the blood , which is like the blood , which is like the blood , which is like the blood , that &apos;s like the blood , that &apos;s like the blood , that &apos;s like the blood , that &apos;s like the blood , that &apos;s like the blood , that &apos;s like the blood , which is like the
In 25 years , it &apos;s gone from this , so .
This is a problem because the interests of the interests , the glacied land around the arctic ocean where there are huge amount of coal coal ocean where there are huge amount of fuel that , they &apos;re transformed into metane by microbes .
I &apos;m going to do with the total-warming pollution to global warming , that amount could doubling , overwhelming this thing .
In some of some profound profound lagues in Alaska metan laghs already .
The Katey Walter of the University of Alaska University of Alaska team , which was a team praise team last winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You &apos;re good . The question is if we &apos;re also .
One reason is this is this exchange termal , the Groenland from the northermal .
This is a river at regime .
And he had never reached that .
This is the Kangerlussuaimation , in the southwest of the Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea , the melting of the glacts on land , here is where it reaches the sea .
These currents are growing rapidly .
Antarctica , the largest block of the planet .
Last month , last month , the scientists have details that ice &apos;s in negative , and the Western Antarctica , which raises on some submarine , is particularly quick with some submarine , is particularly quitous , in the sons .
It &apos;s foot at six meters of the water , like in the Groenland .
Sulla Himalaya , the largest block of ice , you see new lakes , which a few years ago , they were glaciers .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population received half of the water .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the water source of this city .
The carry is increased .
But when he decrease , the same thing happens to the water .
In California , snow , in California , the Sevada is decrew of 40 percent .
The hypers are in crisis .
The predictions , how you &apos;ve read , they &apos;re grave .
The increasing safe in the world leads to an inceness .
The environmental disaster are increasing in a rhythm and unprecedented .
Four times more of the last 30 years I &apos;m going to be on the last 30 years of the age 75 .
This is an unsustainable andable .
If you look in the historical context , you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day .
Look at the attempyal Pacific , from the Americans , to the Americans , to the west and on both parts of the Indian continent , where there is a radical impoversment of oxygen in the oceans .
The greatest cause of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the fossil use of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with more emissions , together to China .
And he proponates to build many other coal centers .
But we &apos;re seeing a direction of a direction .
These are the annullated projects in the last years and some alternative alternative vers .
At any way , there &apos;s a politics struggle in our country .
The oil industrial and oil industrial has spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the coal will , which is a bone .
That image would reminded me something --
Verice , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a loss of 3.8 billion litri litri waste .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen it on news .
This is the second largest flow of the flow of the shortage in America .
It &apos;s happened around the Natal .
Nuring Chrian alize of one of the coal industrial .
Good : Singer : Golden the carbon is a kind of allegry and happy .
It &apos;s abondant here in America , and growing our economy .
Frosty the carbon is and more clean .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and worable to keep the workers .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The largest society mineral minerary mineral society is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I &apos;m going to be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelososy -- don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clime for the Clime .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : ALergy : ALergy , we see the climate change as a snap of our business .
For this , our priority is to invest a lot of money in a publisher to make public public and confused the coal truth .
In fact , coal , coal is not sports .
We think it &apos;s clean -- it &apos;s also a good profuma .
So , you don &apos;t prefer of climate change .
Let me do .
Video : Coubt : Carbone -- you &apos;ve heard about it very much .
So we &apos;re going to do a turn into a look at the avanguard as as it &apos;s as a clean .
Straordinarily ! The machines are a little noise , but this is the sound of the technology of clean .
The coal consumption is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology that you see changes everything .
Take a look at : this is the rolling technology .
Al Gore : So , the good alternative , you can connect to the economic issue and the national security .
Video : America is in crisis ; the economy , national security , the climate crisis .
The filter links all : our dependence from fossil fuels , like the sports and oil oil .
Now , though , there &apos;s a new , auduty , auduty , solution to use .
Repower America : 100 percent clean , in 10 years .
A plan to re-America to work , make us more safe , and help stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that drink to solve our problems .
Repower . Scoprite than Repower .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It &apos;s re-energy to America .
One of the fastest ways of getting to the dependence from the fuel that killing our planet .
Comparsa : The future is here . Vent , sun , a new energy network .
Narrator : Number two : New aging for well-retributed jobs .
Really , Repower . It &apos;s time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old African said , &quot; If you want to go fast , go from solid .
If you want to go away , go together . &quot;
We have to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED I made a introduction on the LHC .
And I promise to return you to the back to you on how the car works .
So I &apos;m here . And for those that time , the other time , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever attempted -- 27 kilometers of circumfirst-mile .
His task is to reate the conditions that were at less than a billionth of a second since the beginning of the universe , until 600 million times a second .
This is just ambitious .
This is the machine under Ginevra .
We photographing these mini-Big Bang in the remarkable Big Bang in the remarkable Big Bang in the reflectors .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- is largely 44 meters and he has a 22 meters .
This is an amazing image of ATLAS in construction so you can see the proportions .
The 10 September of the last year we &apos;ve pushed the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was because of immense fescued in control .
It &apos;s an image of the first fascination of particles that had done all the around the LHC , and he &apos;s going into the LHC , and spread particles in the well-flood in the detector .
In other words , when we saw that image the 10 September , we realized that the machine worked , which is a great vinvittory .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to make us exulating more or this , when someone went on Google and saw that the initial page was this .
That means we &apos;ve had a cultural impact beyond that scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had to be a problem with the machine , and this dorate dorates .
These files 13,000 ampampes when the machine works at the very much of power .
Now , the technical , between you will look at the files and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . They &apos;re too throws . &quot;
And instead can do it because when they &apos;re very cold to become the cosyn-called files .
So at least 271 degrees , at a lower temperature in the space between the stars , these files can bring that current .
In one of the giunture between the most of new magnetic magnetic magnees in the LHC , there was a defect of factories .
So the files are going to warm , and the 13,000 ampamparily all suddenly met an electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think these magnees are worth worth worth of 20 tons . And that &apos;s gone of about 30 inches .
They are damaged about 50 magnetic magnetic .
We had to take them , what we did .
We re-flip them .
They are now coming back to their underground .
I &apos;m the end of the sea LHC will be integrintegrated again .
We &apos;re going to account it , and we expect the data or lude , and we keep our data and keep our adventure to find out what the morning is the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents reaching the value of science and the frontier of the science and the frontier engineering .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s so hard , I think it &apos;s the value of things like LHC .
I want to conclude with the words of a scientist Inglese , Humphrey Davy , which , I imagine , in defenense of the feature of his clean , his clean was Michael Faday , he said , &quot; Nothing is so dangerous for the progress of the human mind as we think that science is defines that the ideas of science as we think we have to be complete , and that we &apos;re not a new worldwide of conquises of the world . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start asking about rethinking when , you &apos;re , you play with children , you play with the morning .
As you were able to reach them and grab them , and take them and move , and you learn them , and you learn to think about problems and doing and by the space relationships .
The spacal reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , by the useful information of our interaction with physical objects , together to my physical objects , together to my Patatatattached , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking asking , &quot; And if , when we use a computer , instead of having the only one of the mouse as a digital chickicker , we could defit on a desktop , we could defit on a desktop , we can defuse information with both hands ,
and fix it to our pleasure ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Sifmonk is a big interactive computer like a biscanning .
In a few words , a Sifmonk is a big interactive computer like a biscanning .
You can move them with your hand , can see them , &quot; they can see their movement and they have a screen and they have a screen and a radio wireless radio .
But overwhelmingly , they &apos;re physical objects , like the morning , you can just move it out .
The Siftable is an example of a new ecosystem ecosystem , to manipulate digital .
And as they become more physics , aware of their movement , some other other people , and as they become more physical , aware of the movement , of the other things , how we can look at the fun , of how we can explore new and fun style of interaction .
I &apos;m going to start with a simple example .
This Sifounding is configured to show video . If you would incline it in one direction , it &apos;s going to rotate it so , if you &apos;re going to start .
These interactive portraits are aware of the other .
If I release , they &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re around .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can agitate a little bit .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can agitate a little bit .
They also have their inclination and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the way that we could use common gestures , for example , &quot; let a color as if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Sifmonkly configured as a painting , and I can use them to the poured color in the central , where you measure .
and I can use them to the central color in that central , where they &apos;re missing .
If we &apos;re too , we can put a little bit of it .
You &apos;re also beautiful possibility of learning , like languages , like languages , the mathematics and logic where people can try things things fast , and see the results immediately .
I &apos;m going to --
This is a sequence of Fibonacks that I do with a equations program .
Here we have a game of words that is in half a game in Scarabeer and Boggle .
Basically , at every Turn , a letter to every Sifmonk-flion-like letter in the Siftears , and while you &apos;re trying to do it , and while you try to understand him , and as you &apos;re looking at him , and as you &apos;re looking at a dictionary .
And then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the children came in in the Media Lab , I made in a way that I would try and turn them a video .
They were very much .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people many instructions .
You just have to say , &quot; You know , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s other people who try it .
This is our beta younger tester , right there on the right .
It actually wanted to be impllary .
They were only in the morning for him .
Now this is an applate of an interactive cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool for learning . He &apos;s Felix . He &apos;s Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , lifting the Sifmonkly , they associated .
It can put new characters in the scene , lifting the Sifmonkly , they associated .
So , it &apos;s going to be out .
Video : The Sun is smild .
David Merrill : Now he took a treatment in the scene .
Video : The treatment .
Good job ! Yeah .
So , we shake the Sifmons and putting them closes out of the characters --
Video : Bau !
by inventing your story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a story with open open , and it can decide him as he does .
DM : It &apos;s a story with open open , and it can decide him as he does .
Video : Gola , cat .
DM : The last example that I have time to show you is a tool , which is made of a fold , to sample and performing music .
it &apos;s a tool that I made of recently , to sample and performing music .
The Siftable here are compare from sound as the bottom and the battery .
Every one of these has four different variations , and you can choose to use .
You can also also put these sound sound in a sequence that you can compose to your pleasure .
And just to change a sound and a sequence .
These are actually you can control from alive , like the reverse and the filter .
The attacks at a particular sound and then incline for the wanting .
And then there are general effects as time and volume , that they apply to the entire sequence .
Let &apos;s look at how it works .
DM : We &apos;re going to start a very much in two Sifairly sequence , &quot; We fix &quot; , we systemate it in a series , we add it into a series , we add .
Now , I &apos;ll put a line .
DM : Now I do some percussions --
DM : And I &apos;m going to put the battery to the battery , so I can control the vive effect from alive .
DM : I can require the entire sequence , by a whole sequence of the time , or from one side .
DM : I &apos;m going to add the bottom to the bottom to give more expression .
DM : I can re-in-in-flew to the sequence .
So I didn &apos;t have to plan this before , but I can suddenly improvise , making it it it longer or more correct .
And now , finally , I can smoking the entire sequence of inclining on the left Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new human-machine interfacing , more resembling like our brain and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some possibilities that we &apos;re trying to bring out of the lab .
So , the concept I want to transmit is that we &apos;re going to take this new generation of the digital media , which will lead information in our world .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time to talk to everybody .
I &apos;m a writer .
I &apos;m going to be books , but it &apos;s more of this , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the fascinating of my life .
And I don &apos;t look like it can change .
But , he said this , something specific has happened in my life and my career , which led me to reealybrate the entire relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called &quot; Mangia , Prega , &quot; which , diversously from my previous books , for some reason that was in the world and became a great sensational , a sevenler , interational .
And the result is that it &apos;s right now , people treating me as if I was convicted .
It &apos;s true -- convicted .
They are all worried and they &apos;re saying , &quot; You don &apos;t afraid of it , &quot; Do you not afraid of doing better ?
You don &apos;t afraid to keep write all the life without being able to create a book that could matter to someone ? &quot;
what can you care about someone ? &quot;
It &apos;s reassuring , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was an adolescent -- I was a rhyththththier .
I would go back to the same reaction .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t I feel throw couldn &apos;t success ?
Do you afraid that the humiliation of the refer killed you ?
You don &apos;t afraid to do this mestih all of the life without anything that ever come out and to a dry of a snaking of every infrin-filling with the mouth of failures to love cumble ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer all these questions is , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
Yeah , I &apos;m afraid of all those things .
I &apos;ve always been afraid .
And I also have afraid of many other things that people may not insection .
As the algae and other things very frightening .
But , as I think it &apos;s about write what I thought and I would ask me , and I wonder is why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logical that anyone should expect to be frightened by a work that he was born to do .
But what is there are so creative in the creative companies that can make us nervous about the mental health as a mental health way that other carefully don &apos;t they do it ?
As my father , for example , he was an engineer and I don &apos;t remember one time in his 40 years of activity in his 40 years of activity that was asked if he was an engineer ?
There was never -- that stuck of the engineer John , how do it ?
It wasn &apos;t working so , you know ?
Onestly , chemicals are not certainly in the centuries , in centuries , earn the reputation of being alolized .
We have enough this reputation , we have enough this reputation , and not only creative , but creative instables , we have this reputation of being an unstable instables .
And he doesn &apos;t reach that look at the sad of the magnifies of creative minds that , only in the 21st century , and often by hand .
And the ones that don &apos;t seem to be really disdisappeared to be really disdisdissed by their dones .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , &quot; Every book has killed me a little more . &quot; A fashion to the work of your life .
But we don &apos;t throw it , when we feel this because we heard these things so long that we &apos;ve completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are in some ways legate and the suffering are in some ways legate and that art , at the end , it will always conduration and the art , at the end , it will always conduration .
And the question I want to ask everybody here today is : Do you agree with this idea ?
You go well this thing -- because it also looks at a distance centimeter to me doesn &apos;t well for anything that supposing me .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous , and I don &apos;t want to see it in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our big creative creative minds to live .
And certainly I know that , in my situation -- in my situation -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to that I was a sense of a sense of a sense of a sense of a lot of circumstances that are in my career .
That &apos;s pretty young people , I &apos;m pretty young , I have about 40 years old .
I &apos;ve got about four work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that everything I &apos;m going to write about the world , as the work that was going to be judiculous by the world as I was going to say , &quot; What I think it &apos;s going to be right from my last book .
I &apos;m going to be slavor , because we &apos;re all more or less friends here -- it &apos;s likely that my greatest success is in my shoulder .
Oh , Gesu , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to drink in the nine in the morning , and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I &apos;m going to keep doing this work that we love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it looks like , after many reflective reflective , that the way to work to continue write is that to create a real psychological construct , OK ?
I have to find a security distance between me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxiety of which I think that &apos;s going to be going to go through . And as I was trying to find a lot of other models about how to do it , to find other society to see if they could have better ideas better and more healthcare about how to find other societies and more healthy ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthier ideas .
how to help people manage the creative creative people to manage the emotional risks of creativity .
And that research led me to the ancient Great and ancient Rome .
I go back because I come up and then comes back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
And it was thinking that creativity was this spirit looks divine and that it was a little bit of a distant and unknown as as many as unknown as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as
The Greeks called these spirits of the deones of the demons of creativity .
Socrying , wonderful , he believed that we had a demon wisdom .
Romans were the same idea , but they called the kind of spirit without a body genius .
That &apos;s great , because the Romans didn &apos;t really think a genius was somebody who was particularly intelligent .
They believed that a genius was this kind of divine that he lived in literally in the walls of a dvine , a little bit like the elevent of a party , and it came out of the work of hidden the work of the artist , and model the outcome of that work .
Here &apos;s an extra -- that &apos;s the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological construct that we protected from your work .
And everybody knew it was so he worked , right ?
So , the antic artists were protected by certain things , as the example of narcism , not ?
If your work was exceptional , you couldn &apos;t take it , and all the deserred , everybody knew that you were helped by this genius .
If your failure work , it wasn &apos;t all your work , it was not your entire , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be an inable incapable .
And so people who conceived creativity in the West for a long time .
And then the Rended Rended and everything came , and it turned out this big idea ; we put the human being in the center of the universe on the universe on the melting all of the mystery and without leaper space to the mess .
This was the rational principle and people started thinking that creativity came to think that creativity came out of the idividly .
And for the first time in history , you start to refer this or that artist as a rather than a genius that artist as a person with the genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think it &apos;s going to allow someone , a simple person to believe that it &apos;s like a recient as a source , as the source , and unknown , unknown and unknown and unknown and ethernicy and unknown and ethernical and a lot of being a very big responsibility for human fragile .
It &apos;s how to ask someone to enjoyed the sun .
It &apos;s details and completely completely distors and create all these kinds of ingesishes on the performance .
And I think it was the pressure of the artists in the passed 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think it &apos;s , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do it diversously ?
Maybe we would return a more ancient understanding of human relationship and mystery creative .
Or perhaps not .
Maybe we can &apos;t take 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience who would be linked scientific suspects on the notion of , including people who fed their own own own own own own plans .
I &apos;m probably not going to convince you all about this .
But the question I want to ask is -- why isn &apos;t it ?
Why don &apos;t you think about this way ?
Because it has more sense of everything that he has ever heard to explain the explanting imprevedability of the creative process .
One process that , as anyone who ever attempted to do something -- so , basically , everybody here knows , you don &apos;t rationally .
And in fact , it can seem to sometimes seem very paranormal .
I did this recent meeting with the extraordinary Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years old , but it was a poem for all life and he said to me during his childhood in the Virginia , working in the Virginia , working out in the camps and he felt , in if a poem coming from the landscape .
He said he was like a chair train of air .
And he was going to roling up to her landscape .
because he felt that , because he could make the earth under its feet .
He knew that he had one thing to do at that point and it was , words , &quot; run as a match . &quot;
And he was going to home and he was followed by this poem , and he wouldn &apos;t have to make any of paper and a mature match enough , as the trapart , and grab it on the page .
Other time he couldn &apos;t be fast , so corrective and corrective and corrective and he would without getting to the house and his poem , and he would continued to whem and he keeping through the landscape , looking for , and he keeping , and he would continue to rotate through the landscape , and he would continue to rotate through the landscape , and he would continue to rotate through the landscape of the faster , so it &apos;s going to be able .
And then there were these times -- this is not forget -- there were moments when there were moments when it was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was trying to paper and the poem through , and he said , he was going to be like the hurt , and he said , he was like you stick up with the other hand and the office .
And he was the poem from the tail and he would re-her body and transmitted it on the page .
And in these cases , poem would be presented on the perfect page , but the contrast , from the last word to the first word .
So when I was thinking about -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly same as a creative thing in my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conduction .
I &apos;m a mule mule , and my way to work is ; wake up to the same orary every day and work and go and go on on on the goffly .
But even , in my aggin my aggin , I struggle with that thing , sometimes .
And I guess a lot of you , even many of you the han .
You know , even if the work and ideas came to me from a certain source of a source , I could not be honestly aware .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it , not to go out and let us not losing the head , but rather , than that we do healthy ?
As I think it &apos;s about , the best example of the best contemporary , which I have is the Tom Waits , which I interviewed years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of the life was incarnation of the art of the incarnation of the art of deep-managed artist , to be able to be very interiorized .
But then he invecked , he socks , and he was driving on a highway in Los Angeles , he changed everything for him .
He was going fast and all of a very very subject , this little framment of melody , which is coming in in his head of how inspiration , and althive it &apos;s fasting , and the desise , but it doesn &apos;t know how to take it .
He doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a mature .
So it starts to hear this kind of old anxiety , growing up in him , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to sessionated by this song even .
I &apos;m not enough , I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to the panic , he stopped .
I &apos;ll do the entire mental process and made something completely new .
He just looked at the sky and he said , &quot; Sorry , don &apos;t you see that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; It seems to write a song now ?
If you really want to exist , it &apos;s going to be more relief .
Otherwise , you &apos;re going to bring to someone else else today .
You can disturbing Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his work process changed changed after this .
Not the work , the work was still dark as always always .
But the process , and the fish that was re-rolled , when he was released when he was , the genius that was going to take away from the nursing , and freezing it back from where it was , making it not to be an interorized and tormented .
but it &apos;s not a wealth , wonderful bizarre , wonderful bizarre , a conversation between Tom and this strange thing that was not Tom .
So how much I was feeling to change a little bit of change the way that I worked on and already saved me once .
This idea , I &apos;m saved when I was writing , &quot; Mangia , Prega , &quot; and fall in one of the despair of the dispair that we &apos;re causing all of us when we &apos;re working on something and we &apos;re not going to be a disaster , which is going to be the worst book .
Not just bad , the worst book wrote .
And I started thinking about how to throw this project .
But then I remember Tom who was talking to the air and I tried .
So I got my face on on the manoscriticize and I was going to a vacuum of the room .
And I said high voices , &quot; Sefore , I know , both of them know that if this book is not going to be very cold , isn &apos;t it &apos;s going to be entirely .
Because as I see , I &apos;m putting all I have , I don &apos;t have more than this .
So if you want it to be better , you have to talk and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , I don &apos;t do anything .
I &apos;m going to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I would like to be recorded that I was recorded that I presented to do my part . &quot; Because , you know , &quot; OK -- centuries ago in the deserts of Northern Africa people were roomed in the deserts of the lone , and the music that went on for hours and until the high grass .
And they were always wonderful , because the dancing were professionals and were fantastic .
But every time , he was rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became actually transmitted .
And I know what I talk about , because I know that you &apos;ve all seen , at a point , a performance so .
It was like the time he stopped , and the dancing walked through a kind of portal and not different from the usually , like the 1,000 noticed before , but it was going to be able .
And suddenly , not just as a human .
But he accurate from the divinity of divinity .
And when this was going on , the time , people knew what he was , called him .
They were , they started to sing , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , God , &quot; God , &quot; God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
I &apos;m not historical note -- when the invest the Spaign Spaign , I preserved this abitude with them and the ready to change in the centuries from Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , &quot; which you can still hear in the corrids or flamenk .
In Spagna , when an artist has done something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , wholder , Allah , and I &apos;m just a magnification , &quot; Alah , &quot; Next , &quot; Cleg , &quot; Pleep , &quot; Alah , &quot; Alah , &quot; Allah , &quot; Allah , &quot; Allah , &quot; Alah , &quot; Allah ,
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But the problem comes after , the problem comes after , for the dancing itself , when you wake up and find that are the 11 in the morning , and I &apos;m the last one in the morning , God is no longer .
It &apos;s simply a very bad dealing to the ginocneneneither , and perhaps it will not be able to each other .
And maybe nobody will sing the name of God again while it &apos;s going to do with his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most sweaper re-restful re-the-life .
But it may not have to be so angosciant if you can not believe , advanced , the most extraordinary aspects of your being being from you .
But just believed that you get data in the present inimaginable source of this team of your life that team of your life that team of your life that team , you have to go to someone else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think it &apos;s all about it changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s certainly like I thought about it for several months during the working working that I &apos;m going to soon during the work that I &apos;m going to soon soon , the dangerous , attempted by my great success .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel electrized by this is , not going to be afraid .
Not flows . It &apos;s just your work .
And he lightening to you in your part , any one can be .
If your work is dance , you know , you can &apos;t .
If the divine , absurd genius assigned decides to leave some wonderful , for a single time , for one moment through your effort , then &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Otherwise , you do the same dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot; You ! &quot;
I think it &apos;s got to teach it .
&quot; Oh , &quot; to you the same , even for having human love and testablishine tal testal , that &apos;s a lot of you will keep you presenting you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
You know , I &apos;ve talked about some of these human genome , on what it can mean and the discovery of new genes .
We &apos;re starting a new path : we started digitize biology and now we start digital biology and now we &apos;re coming up in a new phase of biology , designing and synthesizing life .
We &apos;ve always tried to ask big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists , I think they attempted to understand various levels .
We tried different approaches , reducing it to the minimum terms .
We &apos;re digitize for almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the analogical world &apos;s biology in the digital world .
Now we ask : can we regenerate life , or create new from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the smallest species from the smallest genome between those that can self-oreplication in the lab .
And we tried to reduce that genome that &apos;s a little smaller .
We can eliminate a hundred genes of the genes of the about 500 that are here .
But when we look at his map metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our .
I think it &apos;s simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this can bring into a living cell cell .
So we decided that the only way to design was synthesizing this chromosome in a way that chromosome that chromosome in a way that you could actually change the components of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of &quot; Can we synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Can you have the chemistry constituent to produce these big molecules that we never had to create before ?
And in case , in case , can we work a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemomosome .
The speed that we &apos;re able to digitize life is growing at exponential rhythm .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , design , rather slowly , but it &apos;s improving .
And our most recent results the results of an exponential curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process required a lot of passages , starting with a bioethical review before the experiments .
But we found out that we were synthesize DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that produce small segments of DNA , the long DNA length , and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the most mistakes there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these fragments and correct the mistakes .
And this was our first attempty , starting digital information from the genome of Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a small virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the framments , we &apos;ve been designed the fragments of errors and get a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemicals , and we put it in bacteria , and we put it in bacteria , and they started reading this genetic code and produce it genetic particles .
The viral particles have been released by cells , they &apos;ve come back and they destroy .
I &apos;ve talked about recently with the blast members of the oil industry , and say they &apos;re certainly going to understand this model .
They have more than you .
We think this is a situation where the software can really build the same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in big .
We wanted to build the entire chromosome of the bacteria .
They are more than 580 mila letters of genetic code .
So we thought we would build it in clothes of the virus , so that we can change cassette to understand what the components are of a living cell .
Surning is critical , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard of a mistake for every 10 midations .
We found out , resequencing it , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence that we never would ever be able to work .
One part of the process is designing segments 50 letters that overwhelmingly over-to-sovereign sovereign little smaller sub-small suburity to build smaller suburity that work together .
We try to unic elements together here .
You &apos;ve probably read that we put in the flourishing .
Think it this : we have a genetic code based on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters together that they code about 20 amminoacids , and there &apos;s a specific order of letters for every amamamamateful .
So we can use the genetic code to write , frasy , thoughts .
What we did at the beginning was self-re-made .
Some have been delusers have delusers from the fact that it wasn &apos;t poem .
We designed these segments to be able to unting them with enzyme .
There are repair and put them together .
And we started assemble parts , starting with the parts , starting with five to seven mile letters to seven mile letters , and they &apos;re going to form segments of 24 mile to them up to them to 72 mile letters .
So , in each step , we &apos;ve made these segments in abundance so we could sequence it because we &apos;re trying to create a very good procedure -- as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So this looks like the tellon of a basketball gables .
When we get these very long segments , over 100 thousand basis , it doesn &apos;t grow directly more than 100 , they &apos;re not going to grow directly in Eccoli .
You get to the limitations of modern molecular biology .
So we &apos;ve been considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called the homological romological romological repair to repair the DNA that could unit to repair the DNA that could unit .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinoccurred , can absorb three million rad rad rad .
You can see in high riquitous ric reach .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s exactly as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms you can completely security .
They can live under empty .
I &apos;m sure that life exist in space , and it &apos;s subjects to find new environments .
Actually , NASA showed that this is going to happen .
This is a molecule image that we built using these processes , simply using the lieven-me-appropriate design .
The yeast , assemble them .
This image was not taken with an electric microscope , but with a regular microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It &apos;s a molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that they cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the publisher that we did a little bit of time .
They are more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the largest molecule molecule .
It &apos;s got a 300 million molecular weight to 300 million .
If we &apos;re going to be on a 10-spaces , we &apos;d like to 142 pages only to transmate this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ? How can we activate it ?
Of course , you do a virus is a game from kids .
It &apos;s a little more complicated when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s simpler even when it &apos;s eucarily cells like our : you can simply extract nuclear or and put another , and put another , which is basically the process of clonation .
In the archaea of a chromosome is , instead integrated inside the cell , but we recently demonstrate that we &apos;re able to make a chromosome from one cell to another and activer it .
We clean a chromosome parent from a microbial species .
The two are different as men from tops .
We &apos;ve added some genes in a way that we could decide what to chromosome for chromosome .
And then he swarm with the enzyme so that they would kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell is amazing -- and you &apos;ll open our soup graph -- and you &apos;ll open our synap -- the new chromosome is gone inside the cell .
And we were thinking that we didn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to try anymore .
This is one of the majorchanisms of evolution .
We found that that they &apos;ve been a second or a third chromosome , in a second or a third chromosome somewhere , I &apos;m going to a second thousands of new traits to that species .
So , who think about evolution as one gene at the time , it doesn &apos;t understand much of biology .
They have enzyme called restriction enzyme , which even digital enzyme , which even digital DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell not possible one .
The mobile -- the chromosome that we put it .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other chromosome as a material extraneum , and he had it , and we found it with only the cell and the new chromosome .
it &apos;s become blue because of the genes that we &apos;ve put .
And in a short short time , all the characteristics of a species , they &apos;ve gone lost , and it turned around a new species , which we &apos;ve put in a new species , based on the new software that we put in the cell .
All the proteins have changed , members are changed , and when we read the genetic code exactly what we &apos;ve moved to .
Now this may seem like a genetic alchemy , but by by by by the way , it might be essentially , in a very substantial way .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that we don &apos;t talk about genesis -- but progression from three million years and half years old evolution , and I &apos;ve told that perhaps we &apos;re creating a new version of the Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion that they &apos;re going to create new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty obvious when we think about our need .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion and half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each other in 1946 , in 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medicine and well-zinal and well-zinal water .
It &apos;s going to be even more hard to nine .
We use five billion fuel barrels , more than 30 billion barrels .
That means a hundred million barrels a day .
When we look at biological processes , or whatever , of the process to replace them , it will be a huge challenge .
We also have to understand all the CO2 emission from these materials that finished in the atmosphere .
And today , because of the scientific discovery in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the designed for the future .
The electric industry , only has a dozen about components , and think of how many different things are come out .
Our limitations here are data in the biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , because of these methods of these synthesization , that we call this combinatory genomics .
We can build a big robot that can produce a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think of the 20 million different genes or try to optimize the processing to produce the processes to produce their clothanks , new vaccines , we can change , because of a small team , and create more molecular biology in the last 20 years .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemicals or fuel production or fuel , production of vaccines .
This is an instantaneal of some software programmed software that we &apos;re working on to be able to seat and design a computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how they will be .
We know exactly how their genetic code .
We &apos;re focusing on the fourth generation fuel .
You &apos;ve seen you also saw that extract ethanol from the grain was an experiment .
We have depending on the third generation , which will be used enough to be soon soon soon in the zucchererereral , as they get or different kinds of butanol .
But the only way biology that biology can have a big impact without increase the cost of food and limited the cost of food and limlimestone the cost of the energy of the energy of reach , so we &apos;re working on to design cells that can reach this pursuing , and we can achieve this pursuing , and we think we can have the first fourth generation in about 18 months .
Saturated light with CO2 is a metodo--- but in our discoveries in the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It &apos;s going to the deep ocean , about 2,500 feet of depth of the water .
It creates metane by CO2 using molecular hydrogen as energy source .
We &apos;re trying to understand whether we can incanalate CO2 , which can easily be transported by pitch , converting that CO2 in coal , to drive this process .
So , we think we might be able to increase what the basic question of what life is the question . &quot; It &apos;s what life is life is we , versus the goal of replacing the entire oil industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can you do it ?
It would come a main source of energy .
And we &apos;re working on the same methods to create instantaneous vaccines .
You saw this year with influence , we &apos;re always forth of a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s right now to find the right vaccine .
I think that &apos;s going to change building combinable vaccines in anticius .
Here &apos;s how the future may start to look at , time , the tree of evolution , accell-the-the-arching bacteria , arches , archeucariote , and finally equals .
We &apos;re so much from improving people .
Our purpose is to make it a living enough way to try to do it . Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the faster , some fundamental work , the new technology that we took the Microsoft , which is almost a year ago . This is Seadragon . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s a environment where you can interact is local local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data .
We &apos;re seeing this , many gigabyte of digital photos with a kind of a constant suit and continue , for a very quickly , display .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much the amount of information that we see , how big these collects of data or the images .
Most of these are common photographs , but this for example is a scanning sent scanning from the Library of Congress , and reentry in the 300 megamma .
It doesn &apos;t make a difference because the only thing that &apos;s limits its prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time . It &apos;s also a very flexible architecture .
This is a book , all of the data , not of images .
This is the Dickens &apos;s desolate . Every column .
To show you that it &apos;s just about text and not the images , we can do something like that , to really show you that it &apos;s a real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be an artificial way to read an electric book .
I don &apos;t recommend .
This is an older example . It &apos;s a number of The Guardian Guardian .
Every , big image is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading the real carrying of a magazine or a daily magazine , which is for a multi-type type of half .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of The Guardian .
We created a high-resolution advertising -- much higher than what you use in a normal publishing one that you use in a normal publish .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific models .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the space limits of space on the screen .
And I hope that this means that we would end people and other similar porcheries , and other similar porcheries , not to be able .
Of course , maps is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say that we have contribute to give you even in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. overcome the Sovrapid image of NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually from the web . And it &apos;s actually alive on the web .
This is a project called Photososynth , which is a fighting two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual computer that was very interesting by Noah Snavely , a student at the University of Washington , with the help of Steve Seitz of Muhrosoft Rick Seads . It &apos;s a great collaboration .
And it &apos;s from the live , the web , I managed by Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from one image to the other and have this kind of experience to have multiple resolution .
But the spacecraft of the images here is actually a meaning .
The algorithms of the computer algorithms , so that they would correspond to the real places that are re-imagined -- all the next to the lakes -- all the next to the lakes -- all the next to the lakes of a -- they &apos;ve been taken . Here you see the elements of a sli-stable algorized .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more split .
I want to go directly to one of the Noah-data set set of Noah-data set set up with the first time of Photosynthrowing that we &apos;ve done for the first time , to show you what I think is really the key behind this technology , Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily very evidence that we &apos;ve put in the website . And it &apos;s not necessarily evidence that we &apos;ve put in the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so forth .
This is a re-building of the Nobody Caucral of Nobody Dame Flickr . Bauct Baucuct NoDame in Flickr , and you get images of types in shirt , and so on . Once one of these ards , it represents a picture that &apos;s discovery that it looks like this .
So they &apos;re all images from Flickr and they were all spacted on this way .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this very simple .
You know , I would never be thinking about going to work for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifying to receive this kind of accounting here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different kinds of phones of phones that : from the cell cell cell phone in SLR , a significant number , that &apos;s meaning in this environment .
And if I can try and try and look at those more strange .
Many stuck by faces , etc .
Somewhere you have a series of photographs --
This is a Nobody . Dame registered correctly .
We can go from the physics to the environment physics .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is taking data from the susuit -- from the entire collective memory of how to appear the Earth , from visual point of view -- and connecting all that data together .
All those photos become connected together , more than the parts of the parts .
You have a model of the earth of the entire that emerges .
Think about this as the prolungent of Stephen Lawler &apos;s work on the Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as people are using it , and the whose advantages to do it , and the most useful useful .
Their photos are marking with meadapted by other people .
If someone comes to contrast all these sets , you can contrast all these sets , and I can use any of No-Cax-Cax-sisight of all that data , and I can use it as ingress for diving me in space , in that meadow , using anyone else , and having a social experience of the kind of cross-user and having a social experience of a cross-user and cross-user .
Of course , a consequence of all that are very very elaborate models of every interesting part of the earth , not only by the airplane and satellite images and similar , but from the collective .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized that ? What your software will be doing is that at a certain point in the next years , in the next years , all the photographs that everybody in the entire world will be practically connected ?
BAA : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is basically , he &apos;s doing is , and in fact ,
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And he &apos;s doing it in the content of the images .
And what becomes very interesting if you think about the rich seant information that many of these images have .
As you do a images of the web , you know , a sentence and the heads on the web , it &apos;s a frase and the heads on the picture .
Now , what happens if that picture is connecting all your photos ?
So the amount of seant interconnection and the amount of wealth that comes in really huge . It &apos;s a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really amazing .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the most of the pleasant pleasures , and one of the ethnographic research is the one of the living who has not forgotten the ancient of the traditions , between the wings , the stones in the wind , the stones , the stones in the walls , and it &apos;s driving the plants .
I think that the shamani Jaguar , they still travel over the Via Lattea , or that the Inuit &apos;s &apos;s even a model of reality , or Himalaya , the distinct of the Dharm , to remember the central importance of anthropology , and the idea that the world we live in the anthropology , and the idea that the world we live in a sense , but it &apos;s just a reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stirp-made stunning , very well or , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of essential traw-grade trails .
We all come . We all procream .
We are subjects .
We have to face the inesorability of death , so we don &apos;t surprising us and whales .
We all have an art .
What it &apos;s the particular rhythm of the song , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that they &apos;re the Borneo &apos;s forests , or the follow of the Voodoo &apos;s desert , or the Chinese train of the Kaizen in Kenya , Curanderers , or a cammer in the Sahara .
He was my journey of the trip in the desert a month ago , or a yak hallelder in Qomolangma , on Everest , the world &apos;s mother &apos;s dea mother of the world .
All these populations teach us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And , if you think a moment , it &apos;s a concept that it can give you hope .
Together , the miriades of culcultures in the world , they create a spiritual life and cultural that you want the planet , and it &apos;s important for the planet as biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural spill as a way to an etnosphere and you can call the etnosphere , the total of all the concepts of all the concepts , dreams , mites , mites , ideas , inspirations that we can call the human imagination .
The etnosphere is the great parimonium of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be as as inquisitive species .
And because biosphere was very much of the biosphere , and it &apos;s been very quickly .
None biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all the species is on the earth is on the earth of the sumintion is because it &apos;s fake , or -- in the most apocalyptic diversity -- and you don &apos;t even get very very little bit more mystic -- that &apos;s cultural diversity .
The surx of all that is , of course , the linguistic loss .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just composed by a vocabulary or a series of rules .
One language is the spraking of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the half of the culture comes to the world &apos;s animate .
Every language is a forest , a kissing , a thought , a thought ecosystem of spiritual .
And of the 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re sitting in Monterey , at least half not comes in the world , at least half doesn &apos;t come in in the ears the ears of the children .
They don &apos;t get to children , which means , unless than even even even even even even even even even even though something is .
What is more traffic than being willing with silence , of being the last to talk about a language , the last to talk about a language , the way to be the re-supporting wisdom of the children ?
This horrying is the state of someone in a few of the world every two weeks . every two weeks , every two weeks , every two weeks of the world .
And I know that somebody who will say , &quot; Is it better ?
The world would not be a better place if we were going to let all the same language ? &quot; Welly , we &apos;re all yoruba .
We talk about kogs .
You &apos;ll have a sudden what it means you can &apos;t talk to your own own own own .
I &apos;d like to give you a journey through the etnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a taste of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , &quot; several ways of existing ways of existing .
Let &apos;s take for example this bimmmmazon SSololder , the people of the anaconda , which creds in the midating of the latte of the West in the most west panish panes .
It &apos;s a people who can &apos;t distinguished the blue blue blue from green because the time celestified color from the forest because the celestified celestified in the forest , which depends the people .
They have a strange language and a matririmonial rule , depressed , &quot; exogamic language , &quot; We have to marry a person talking different language .
And all of this has roots in the mitological past , though the particolarity is that in these families six or seven languages because of the midden marriage of no wisons that there is a language .
They &apos;re just listening and then they start talking .
Let &apos;s take one of the most interesting tribe with , the Waorani of the Ecuador , a incredible people that had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionar-fighting , and he was a fatal mistake .
They &apos;ve been going to go out from the top photographs that retrouble them that they would love to be forest , forest that this people in the rainforest that this people in the rainforest .
They collected the earth , they &apos;ve been spinning the research of a form or a figure and not out , they have conclused that it was treated that the hell , and they killed the five missionals with the lance .
But Waorani didn &apos;t kill only the foreign &apos;t killed .
They killed in their own .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We were saving eight generations and we found two natural death cases , and we found two natural death cases , they admitted that one of them was invecked , and then they killed it , and then they killed it . &#91; Risate &#93; Awidth &#93; . Awidth way , they had an incredible knowledge of the forest .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine 40 pass and recognize the species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned a very interesting task in the early &apos; 80s , I was asked to go to Haiti in my Harvard , truly , I was going to intruly go to intruly the basis of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes , and I was the poison of the poison .
To make a sense of the miraculous , I should have understand Voodoo culture and the Voodoo is not magic .
It &apos;s pretty much of a metaphance view of the world .
So , interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christianity , Islam , Ebraism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Africa doesn &apos;t have religious , and thinking that &apos;s not religious . And instead , and the Voodoo is , and the Voodoo is , the distilled of these religious concepts .
What makes interesting is that voodoo is the relationship between life and death .
So , the vivivives are going to be the spirits .
The spirits can be invocated by the Great Act , they respond to the dance of the dance and replace temporary animate the vive way that for a short active active active active active , it becomes the god .
So , for this woodooists say , &quot; You &apos;re white going to talk to God .
We &apos;re going to be in the temple , and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment that you &apos;re owowning , is the spirit that drives you , how can you do it wrong ?
So you see these amazing events : following the voodoo in state state of trance that touches unseen , infuel , which is a pretty strong demonstration of the body when it &apos;s catalyzed in a state of extremely excitation .
I &apos;m going to the people who have been in which I &apos;ve lived the most extraordinary is Kogi War Santa CCECity , in the Colombia security .
They have to be in the ancient civilization that once had lived on the charge of the comfort of Colombia , who was willing to the volcanic masses that you could get on the volcanic masses that would be on the charge plant .
In a continent of a blood continent , this people has never been conquered spage-in--flood continent .
I &apos;m not a clever , they &apos;re government , but their formation is very extraordinary .
The young people are taken from the families to three or four years , and they live secrets in a good world and shads in a good world and shads in the stone of the flood for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years , by the way , by reproduce the nine months of gestation that transfused in the mother of the laws , now in metaphor the user of the GMaws .
For all this time , they &apos;re accululultural values that predict that their prayers and only their prayers and only their prayers the forar , and they &apos;re just forget the cosmic balance -- or to say the ecological balance .
And the term of this amazing initiation , suddenly , they &apos;re all taken out and for the first time to be in their age of 18 , they see an alba . And that &apos;s the moment of awareness , when the sun kiss , when the sun the beautiful landscape , everything that they &apos;ve learned in this splendor . The prefer pption is . The prefer it is going to go a step back and says ,
&quot; Do you ? Proprio as I said .
It &apos;s amazing . It &apos;s now to you . &quot;
They call a larger brothers and say that we , minors , minors , minors , we are the colpful of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the indigenous populations and the investment of Rousness and the old story of selling , which is a razy notice in its simplicity , or perhaps invoating Thoreau and we say these people are closer to the Earth .
The Indies are not safely nor indebate .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the malarial Asmat the Asmat Halalalth vents , but because of time and the rhythththanks , and they created a mystical of the Earth is not about aware of the notion of it , but it &apos;s a very much more intuition , but it &apos;s just infertile by human aware .
What does that mean ?
That a kid in the Ande that a kid of the Ande that he &apos;s increasing the mountain is a lot of Apu who will will be a deep-human being deeply different , and it &apos;s going to have a very different relationship with the mountain or that place respect to a Montana who will grow up with a rocket .
which is the dimoning of a spirit or a mineral caught is irrelevant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia Britannics , creating the forests that they were served to be cut .
And that has made me a different human being different from my friends . Kwaucutl who believe that the forests are the dimoning is the dimonic of heaven and the cannial of paradise and the cannifying cannial world , which live in the Hamatsa .
If you start to consider that these cultures can create different reality , you can start understanding some of them feature discovery . We take this plant .
I took this picture to open in the ninkle Amazon the ninkle Amazon .
Maybe some of you &apos;ve heard about the ayahuasks , the most powerful psychoactive , the most powerful psychoactive ,
What makes the same thing that makes the ayahuasks , it &apos;s the drug of the substance , but the processing elaboration . It &apos;s composed by two things .
From one side , this lian liana leap that contains a series of Tioline , harmoline and hardmoline , slightly hallucinogene .
I &apos;m trying to take the single plant smoke , which alter a little bit , which alter the concience of a coffee family , but it &apos;s mixed with the leaving of a coffee &apos;s family .
This plant contains powerful powerful , very similar to the serotonin , dithyptamine , dithyptamine .
If you ever see the Yanomami thumb on the nose of the nose of the substance that do from a different kind of species , it &apos;s contains methyptamine .
Tiring that dust on the nose is a little bit like being gone from a distorted pinch of painting box and land on a sea of electricity . &#91; Risate &#93; &#91; Risate &#93; &#91; Risate &#93; . Risate not reality .
I &apos;ve got often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who had a check was a Polug-cheese , with his discovery of fungi in Mexico .
In my thesis not going to be hurt these triptamine as as hallucinogens because if you did not tell any of being hallucinated . &#91; Risate The tripps can &apos;t be hurt because if you did not be hurt because if you did not be handed by a enzystem that is , of course in the intestine , which is , you know , you know , the monoon-looking .
It &apos;s as far as just absence to other chemicals that would be absold chemicals that would be MAO .
Now it &apos;s the beautiful : the fuel that are in this lian injitation of MAO , the same kind of necessary to potence the triptamine . The question is , a question of a four-species flashers , like these people can find two defologically not similar to the , but if you combined in this way , create a biochemistry that is to be part of the parts of the parts ?
We use the great eufemale of the evidence , and the mistake , which can revealing infruted .
But if we ask Indians , they will say to us . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribe , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayhuasks , which distinguishment in the forest , and that in our eyes would reentry to the same species .
If we ask them how they stbipitch their own tasonomy , &quot; I thought , &quot; I thought I knew about the plants , the rest of the rest of it ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take the 17 variety in a night night of moon , and each night , and each other will each other .
So , we don &apos;t have graduate Harvard at Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than count the stami .
Now , &#91; applausers &#93; the problem is that even those of us who have in the heart , the indigenous people find painting , but in some way reduced to our real world , and it &apos;s going to go .
In fact , the 20th century , in 300 years , it doesn &apos;t have remembered to his own , or its rather like the thing that we &apos;ve been stopped and we used to abstract , and we used active , or passive , or accepted the mass destruction of the planet . Now the problem is not change .
All the culcultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibility of life .
And the problem isn &apos;t technology .
The Soux Indians have no stop being Sioux when they put away away and frecked so as Americans don &apos;t have stopped to be American when they put on the horse and calculations .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that threatening the integrity of the etnosphere . It &apos;s power .
The hard hard hard hard .
And if you look at the world , I think , you &apos;ll find that these are not cultures destined to disappear .
They are living creatures and spinted dynamics out of identifable forces that go beyond their adaptation skills .
It &apos;s disbing in the Penan of Penan --
a people who have been a Sarawak , in the Asian Southeast , a people who have lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to a generation ago , and now reduck to a generation ago , where you can see the river river , where you can see the river &apos;s river , the wanting of the wiss that seems to be able to be able to bring the horizon , where the woning yelelonic woning the horizon ,
You can fill the wooden wooden .
Or in the case of the Yanomami , are the diseases that have come with the discovery of the gold .
If we &apos;re going to move on the mountains of the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the face of the political domination .
As you know the genocide , the physics of a people who are convicted in the world , but the ethnic . But the ethnic , the destruction of the style of a people , not only is to be constyle , but even even even celebrated , because it &apos;s part of the development strategifestypitategy .
And you can &apos;t understand the Tibet &apos;s suffering in the Tibet until you start .
I &apos;ve lost 6,000 miles from Chengdu in the Western China through Western Tibet , coming to Lhasa young link , but only arriving in Lhasa with a young link , but only arrived in Lhasa with a young link , but only arriving in Lhasa with a young link , but only came to Lhasa with a young link , but only came to Lhasa with a young link , but only arriving in Lhasa young link , but only came to a young link ,
6,000 thousand monuments and caught .
1.2 million people killed from military during the Cultural Revolution .
The dad of this guy was ascriteria in the Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed in the age of Chinese invasion .
Human uncle , in Santity during the diaspora that he brought the people in Nepal .
His mother was imprisoned and his fault fault is being rich .
It was taken to hide in caring the age of two years , hidden birth because he could not live without him .
The sister , which made the same , it was mitted in re-education .
One day he revertently a cooled fashion a fashion , and , for this transgression , was sent to seven years .
The Tibet can be insopportable , but the spirit of the people is from tener tener .
And it was , all it reduces a choice .
We want to live in the world of the monocromatic monocromatic world , or we want to account the world of diversity ?
The great anthrologist Margaret Mead , before he died said that his largest fear was that in our largest fear , we &apos;re going to be able to see the entire gamorage of the world , we don &apos;t just see the whole gamma of the human imagination , but one day we &apos;ll see us a damage to forget that there were other possibility .
And it &apos;s humiliating that our species is existed for 600,000 years .
The Neolitica Revolution , which has given us agriculture , which has made us healthy for the crust of the seed , replace by replace , replace by by by by the way , creating the church of specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has to be 300 years .
That sharing story doesn &apos;t suggests me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we &apos;re going to have to deal with in millennia .
When you do these miriades of the world is asked what to be human , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we &apos;re all refer the chance of being what we are : a unable species , which has to make all the people and the gardens can trigger . And there are great moments of optimism .
I took this picture on the northern end of the Baffin , when I went to the whales with the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The Chanadese government has not always been gentile with Inuit and in the 1950s to stabilire our sprematia , we &apos;ve enabled them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refused to go .
The family , theme for his life , he took them away all the weapons . And all of his wells .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t have the cold , they do it .
The skin of the origin were made of fish fish flying in the skin in charge of charge .
The grandfather of this man didn &apos;t intimidnight or the blizard or the blizard that was suffering .
It &apos;s unflew away , he &apos;s calculated the pantaleating skin in the skin in his hand . When I did it was frozen , he worked out with a lifetime .
He &apos;s spring up on this shot of this cacking cholder , and when I became solid , he killed a dog .
He shake the dog and created a brilliant , with the toracy , he has a sliter , he enliked another dog , and it &apos;s disappeared on the banking , he &apos;s got a bunch .
We want to talk about horarsely with nothing ?
In the bet of the Canadian government re-updamage of a world larger than California and Texas a whole world of the Texas .
It &apos;s their new paria . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s an independent land . They &apos;re all the minerary resources .
One beautiful example of how a natione-state can re-re-conciliating can re-up with his people .
And , to finish , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious to the people who have been in these remote areas of the planet , and I realized that they &apos;re not remote .
For someone is home .
They represent sections of the human imagination that go to the fresh of the time . And for us all , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of these children , become part of the geography of hope .
To finish , we of National Geographic we are convinced that politicians will never come to anything .
We believe that polemics --
&#91; Applausers &#93; not be lost , but we believe that stories can change the world , and perhaps we are the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month our website has 35 million visits .
156 countries transmitted our television canal .
Our magazines are being born by millions .
Our work is traveling in the etnosion to bring our audience in the etnosphere for our public places in the abstract of cultural as they saw and , hopefully abstract in the middle of anthroughout the anthroughout the antiology of anthroughout the diversity of anthroughout a life in a pluralist world and multiculticulticultural world , multickalist and multicking more of the world .
where all the people can contribute to our collective wisdom .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope is called other people who you &apos;ve heard and try and look at evidence that you &apos;ve heard , and I &apos;m going to talk about it .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the official dogma . &quot;
The official dogma of what ?
The dogma official society of all the Western industrial society . The Dogma official Dogma official , &quot; If we want to massive the well-being of our citizens . &quot;
The reason is , on one side , in fact that the freedom is in itself , in fact , useful , essential for human beings .
On the other thing that &apos;s done is that if we are free , each of us can do for understanding everything that massize our well-being , no one of that decide in our well-being , no one of the decide in our .
The way to massize freedom is massive the choice .
More choices , more choices are libing , and more is their well-being .
This , I think , it &apos;s so deeply royal , in society that nobody would dream to be doubt .
And it &apos;s also deeply royal in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress is possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;ll let me a simple note about the conducting conducting .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without counting the 10 variety of olive olive and the 12 acets whales that you can buy a huge number of conditions that you can buy for a huge number of in-in-in-grant number of 175 already ready is about your degree .
Here &apos;s what the supermarket is .
Then you go to the electric stumb to buy a stereo : cases , CD , radio pitch , flash amplificer .
And in this single electric store , there &apos;s a big number of audio components .
We can do six million different combinations using the components that there are in one store .
You have to admit that there &apos;s lots of choice .
Other camps : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all the telephones , at the stage that were supposed to be Bell .
He was nolegyed the phone , he didn &apos;t buy it .
One of that , in the other , it was that the phone never break .
These times are gone .
We have a nearly limited variety of phones , especially between cell cell cell phones .
Here &apos;s the cell phone .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 cutting , and MP3 cutting off the nose , and forb for the chromantic chronna .
If you haven &apos;t seen it again in the home store under home , you &apos;re very certain that I &apos;ll get .
And what &apos;s going on is that people come to the negotiations and doing this question . And this question , you know what the answer is ? The answer is &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
So , in other ways of life that are much more important than the acquiring aunt , the same explosion of choices .
Assistence : It doesn &apos;t happen in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor you can do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do A or B , &quot; You could do A , or B , &quot; Is it these benefits and these risks . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Dr. , what should I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A has these benefits , and the risks and the benefits , and B has these benefits . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebat , &quot; Dr. whether she was me , what would that do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
We call it &quot; autonomy of the malated , &quot; expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But in fact , it &apos;s not that you can move the weight and the responsibility of making decisions that someone knows something , which is the doctor , to someone else that &apos;s almost certainly no -- and almost certainly not in the ideal condition -- and it &apos;s not the ide-condition -- and so it doesn &apos;t have any ided of the patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing of drugs , direct to people like me and you , who , if you think it doesn &apos;t make any sense , because you can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why do they advertit them ?
The answer is that it wants to ask him to ask him to ask him to ask him to change the recipe .
Something that &apos;s how we &apos;re going to be the ordemic identity is a choice , as you see in this vignity . &quot; We don &apos;t want to forcing the children . It &apos;s not going to be a identity : we don &apos;t have to be an identity : we have to invent .
And we can reinventing us how many times us do .
which means that every morning , at the front of it , you have to decide what kind of person want to be .
I &apos;m going to the family and the matririmonium , a time time , the most of the common , which is almost to anyone , it was that we had the most early possible , and it started to make the most soon possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not when , and not when , and what do .
So , it &apos;s really to play .
I teach them 20 percent in a very smart students , and I &apos;m going to be 20 percent of work than a time .
And not because they &apos;re not brilliant , not because they &apos;re less diligent .
But why are it imthoughtful , I mean to ask , &quot; Should I spost me or not ? Should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; Should I get away ? I have to think before children or the career ? &quot;
They are logoring .
And they try to answer these questions , although this is not complete the tasks that I &apos;m going to do not get a beautiful voice to my own .
And they really have to do it . They &apos;re important questions .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , as Carl underneath , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from the Hotel Randolph .
And in the parentesthesis , and I &apos;m not saying to anybody who , where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use me .
What does this mean , this incredible freedom of choice we have about the work ? It &apos;s that we have to continue , continually , if we have to work or not .
We can go and see our son playing hurt , with the cell phone in a pocket , Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , tiles on the knees .
And even though they &apos;re all spending , every minute that we see our son who can re-in-play , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; Do I answer this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? I got email ? Do I have to email this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is &quot; no , &quot; That makes the experience of your son very different than the game that would be in other conditions .
So , any of the look at , small things and large , things , materials and lifestyle , life is a choice of choices .
Once the world was this : The real , there were some possibilities , but it wasn &apos;t all of the choice .
The world today looks like this : dilemma is , &quot; Is it a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Simplementy .
So the positive laws , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative .
So , this choice is two negative effects of the people .
The first one , paradoxygen , is that it makes paralysis that it &apos;s going .
With many options between which choosing , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I give you a significant example : a study of volunteer depending on the volunteer .
A colleague has access to Vanguard data , the gigantic society society &apos;s funding about pension , with about a million clients in 2,000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offering in more , the percentage of adhesight two percent .
With 50 offerts , there &apos;s 10 percent in less adhesions than when they &apos;re only five . Why are they only five . Why do they &apos;re available ?
Because with 50 sources of which choosing , is hardly hard to decide , and choice is replaced to the indomans .
And tomorrow , and tomorrow , tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course tomorrow .
You know , it doesn &apos;t mean only that these guys will keep food for dog . Because they &apos;re going to have enough money , it &apos;s also so dattach-lack source of work .
Not in the hurt , they &apos;re losing to five dollars from work , which would be very disposed to be able to versaries .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think that makes the world .
&quot; And to end , for ethernity : ketchup , ketchup , maionese ? &quot;
Would you like to make the right decision , if it &apos;s for the eternity , isn &apos;t it ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong bottom , and yet the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can avoid the paralysis and to do a choice , at the end of the result of how we would be with less options .
And this for several reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions that choose , if you buy one and not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would have been better . And what what &apos;s going on is that the alternative imagined us in the branch of the choice , and the remarkable decrease on the decision , and the decreation is reached by the decision ,
even when it was a very good decision .
More choices , there are , easier disliked any detail that is inssatisfaction of the option .
And it &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has clearly clear , how we &apos;re going to the things depends on what we &apos;re council .
From rest , when there are many options of possible options , it &apos;s easy to represent the alternative features of the option that you have a choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m sorry with all of the ones that are not New York .
But that &apos;s what you would probably think .
There &apos;s this copy in the Hamptons .
a place of luxury .
Spiach . Otma day . It &apos;s all day . It &apos;s all for them .
It doesn &apos;t miss anything . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , evil , it &apos;s Agust . &quot;
&quot; All my neighbors in Manhattan are away . &quot;
&quot; I could parking right in front of the home . &quot;
And he passes to two weeks assild from the idea that &apos;s perdying -- every day -- the ability to parking where he wants .
costo-opportunities decrease the satisfaction for what we have , even when choice was excellent .
And the more are the options that we have to consider , the most attractive features will be refer to us against how we cos-opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lighter tells us many things .
It &apos;s talking about living the moment , and perhaps of living slowly .
But the most important point is that whatever you choose , you choose to not do the other .
The things that we don &apos;t choose many attractive attractive that can make less attractive to make less attractive what we do .
Third point : the growing spiral of the expectations .
I tried it on my skin buy a new jeans .
I &apos;m almost always jeans .
Once jeans were just a single guy , buys and they were sevawarming , were slower , they were sancy , just after we took them a life and they were all going to do .
So , I went to buy a couple of time when the old people were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cutting . &quot;
The committed me , &quot; Luh , do you want to slim fit , fit ? &quot;
You want to do it with the cirniit or with the buttons ? &quot; Stonewashed &quot; or &quot; aciddle &quot;
&quot; Would you like it ? &quot;
&quot; You know , eight wants to stretch , or stretch ? Bla . &quot; Continupright .
I was swealth , and after a little bit I could say , &quot; I want the guy that was the only guy , which was the only guy , &quot; he had no idea what it was , so for a time I tried to all the sick , jeans , then out of the jeans that ever had .
It was the very much . I had the whole choice .
But I was worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice my expectations were altissime , jeans had to be perfect .
I was at the beginning of the minimum . I didn &apos;t expectancy at the end of the 100 different , but when I saw 100 different , you had to be perfect .
What I got was good at it , but not perfect .
After I was going to be inssatisfaction .
The addition of options in the life of the people don &apos;t do that to increase the expectations that are respect to the options of the options of the options of the people who don &apos;t do that to increase the expectations of the options of the people who don &apos;t do that to increase the expectations of the options of the people
And this will produce less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
None in the world of the marketing in the marketing world .
Because if they knew it , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more like this .
&quot; It was better when you were worse . &quot; And the reason he was better when you were worse is that when you were worse was still able to meet some pleasant survey .
Other day , in the world we live in -- opulent , industrialized citizens with the expectancy -- the most we can hope is that things are at the altitude .
You never surprised , because your expectations , my expectations , my expectations , they engiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Besearlier . &quot; Yeah , &quot; You want it . &quot;
I mean , small authographic moment -- which I really are married and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn &apos;t do it better , not I was acted .
But it doesn &apos;t always be a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of a couple of jeans , when there &apos;s only that jeans is that when there &apos;s only that jeans is that when you &apos;re not satisfaction , and you say , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot; The answer is clear .
The world is the responsible . What could I do ?
When you have hundreds of jeans , and you buy a insodisfacing , and you say , who &apos;s the responsible , it &apos;s the responsible , it &apos;s clear that responsible you are .
You could have done better .
With hundreds of variety available , there are no scans excuse for the insuccess .
So when people do decisions , even though the result is valido , they feel unsatisfacfacfaced and they give the hit to them .
In the last years , depression is exploring in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this depression is just that people have deludent experiences because the standard are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation they think the cold is .
So the result is that we &apos;re better , we &apos;re better better , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take good for good and it &apos;s completely fake .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little choice of choice is better than having any much better than having any time , but it wasn &apos;t going to have a lot better choice .
There &apos;s a critical value , magical value . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure that we &apos;ve overcome from a piece of the level where the choices make life .
Now , from the political point of view -- I almost finished by the political point of view , the notion of the political view , the nocy is the following .
What allows all this whole choice in the industrial society is wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know about it , where the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too pitch .
So the facceness I &apos;m talking about is a modern exclusive in the Western , rich society .
And what it does depressing and angry is this : Steve Levitt spoke about the yesterday , he talked about how much those expensive , and they &apos;re wearing it &apos;s a money .
I mean these choices , complicated and dispensive , it &apos;s not that they &apos;re just useful .
I &apos;m even deleterie .
They do it worse .
If a little bit of what we do is in our society allows choice to be reversed in those where people have too too much chance , it would not just their life to improve but also our life .
This is what economists call a parthian improvement .
A re-income re-income re-income re-income re-income re-income re-income re-us .
So , to conclude , &quot; You can become everything you want . &quot;
You , people in culture , you &apos;ll think , &quot; But what does that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t do anything in a glass . &quot;
&quot; A castrade imagination , a limited view of the world --
and I &apos;m interpret it so , in the beginning .
But then , I realized that that that fish knows the long one of the long time .
Because the reality is that if you miss in frankly , you know , it &apos;s all possible . &quot; You don &apos;t get freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you break the mocol in a way that all diminminuity .
You &apos;re going to account the paralysis , and you reduce the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too strange , perhaps even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of some symbolic sphere is a recipe for inhappiness and , I &apos;m theme for the rovine .
Thank you .
