Last year I showed these slides to show that the glacial ice ice to show that the artica , which for almost three million years has had the size of 48 , the United States continental , it &apos;s restrip 40 percent .
However this subjected gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice of the ice .
The acious ice ice ice is , in a sense , the clean of global climate system .
It &apos;s reverse and revern expanded .
The next slide is going to be a carlying re-relief , the last 25 years .
The glaces are reached in red .
As you see , they &apos;re going to be on the dark dark dark dark .
That &apos;s the winter in the winter , which is summer .
You can see that the constitute constitute , five years or more , is like a blood , which here fire out of the body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been from so , in 25 years , so .
This is a problem because the frozen heat around the artical ocean where there are huge amount of coal frozen , and they &apos;re going to be into metane , and they &apos;re made in metane from the microbes .
I &apos;m going to be able to the totality of the atmospheric pollution to global warming , that amount could doubling , overeign this point of not around .
In some lahi deeper in Alaska metane is already relief from water .
The professor Katey Walter of Alaska University of Alaska .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You &apos;re good . The question is , if we &apos;re also going to be that .
One reason is that this extra termal exchange the Groenland from the north .
This is a river in regime glacial .
The led never reached levels like this .
This is the Kangerlussuaunt , in the south-over-overs .
If you want to know how the sea level to be shouts on the ground , you &apos;re going to know , you &apos;re going to be the sea .
These currents are increasing rapidly .
On the other side of the planet : Antarctica , the greatest block of the planet .
The last month , the scientists have told that the ice &apos;s balancing of ice is in negative , and that Antarctica , which pogy on some submarine , is particularly quitous , is particularly quick in the slum .
Equival at six feet of the water , like in Groenlandia .
Suli Himalaya , the third largest block of ice , you see new lakes , which a few years ago , they were glacious .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population red-water water from that smom .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the water water than this city .
The laptop is increased .
But when it demining , the same happens to water .
In California , the snow on the Sierra Nevada is deminuity of 40 percent .
The hyririries are in the crisis .
The predictions , as you read , they &apos;re grave .
The growing physics in the world leads to a remarkable increasing inceness .
The environmental disaster is increasing to a rhythm and without previous .
Four times more than many times in the last 30 years I was before 75 .
This is a unsustainable and unsustainable .
If you look in the context that you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day .
Look at the attempting area of the Pacific , the Americans , to the West , and on both the parts of the subcontinent , where there &apos;s a royal root of of the ocean .
The greater cause of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossil fuels .
The oil is a problem , and coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two of the more emissions , together to China .
And he proponates to build a lot of other central central .
But we &apos;re seeing a change of direction .
These are the annullated projects in the last years and some alternative versus .
At any way , there &apos;s a political fight in our country .
The coal industrial and oil has spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote fuel fuel , which is a bone .
And the image I remember something --
Verice , in the Tennessee , where I live , there &apos;s been a loss of 3.8 billion lights .
Maybe you have seen it on the news .
This is the second largest flow of flow in America .
It &apos;s around the Natale .
The Nalive of one of the coal industrial .
Video : Spet of the carbon is a guy and happy guy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and growing our economy .
Froseel is increasingly clean .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and worthy workers keep the workers keep the designers .
Al Gore : From this is a lot of the West Virginia .
The greatest society is Massey Coal . This is the Massey Coal . This is the administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I &apos;m going to be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosy , Harry Reid -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima &apos;s Prottion , he has launched two campaign .
This is one of them , a part .
Video : Attore : At the time , we see the climate change as a seriy threat to our business .
So , for our priority is to invest a huge amount of money in a public effort to make public and confused the truth on the coal .
In fact , coal is not sports .
We think it &apos;s clean -- it also has a good profumo .
So you don &apos;t prehensive climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Attore : Carbone -- you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
So , let &apos;s take a turn into a structure at the avanguard of how it &apos;s about fuel .
Straordinarily ! The cars are a little noise , but this is the sound of the pulit technology .
The coal consumption is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology , but the remarkable technology that you see changes .
You have a look at : this is the puzzle technology .
Al Gore : The end , the positive alternative is connected to economic question and the national security .
Video : America is in crisis , the national security , the national security , climate crisis .
The willion that connected to all : our dependence from fossil fuels , like coal and the oil coal .
Now , though , there &apos;s a new , auduty , the way to use .
Repower : 100 percent clean energy in a decade .
A plan to remit to get America to make us more safe , and help stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that basts to solve our problems .
Repower . Scoprite more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It &apos;s about re-re-energy to America .
One of the faster ways of getting to dependence from the fuel that killing our planet .
Comparsa : The future is here . I feel , sun , a new energy network .
Compppace : New investimate for jobs that we have a lot of retributed .
Complplplan : Real . It &apos;s time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old lunch African says , &quot; If you want to go fast , you go from the speed , you go to the speed , you go to the speed , you go from .
If you want to go , you go together . &quot;
We have to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED I did a LHC .
And I promise to return to the back to you on how the car works .
So , I &apos;m going to be . And the ones that the other time there were not , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment that I &apos;ve been trying to -- 27 kilometers of surrounding .
His task is to reach the conditions that were less than a billiondespite the second of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
This is just ambitious .
This is the car under Ginevra .
We have a Photographing these mini-Big Bang in the flights .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- is largo to 122 feet and it has a diameter diameter diameter .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions .
The 10 September 10 years , we &apos;ve got the machine for the first time .
And this was taken by ATLATLAS .
It was caused to immense in control .
It &apos;s a picture of particles that made all around the LHC , and he walked into the LHC , deliberately , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles inside the rain .
In other words , when we saw that image of the 10 secember , we found that the machine worked , which is a great vicuation .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to make us exulating more or this , when somebody went on Google and I saw that the initial page was this .
That means we &apos;ve had a cultural impact beyond that scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the car , we had a problem with the car , we had the dored .
These files took 13,000 ampampfies when the car works at the potence .
Now , technical , between you will look at the films and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . They &apos;re too much much . &quot;
And they can do it because when they &apos;re very cold , they become the constitute of the constitute ,
So at least 271 degrees , at least 271 degrees , at least , the space between stars , these files can bring that current .
In one of the giunture between the more novel magnetworks in the LHC , there was a fet of fabrication .
So the wildlife is going to be slightly , and 13,000 ampampsuddenly met an electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think these magnetworks are moving over 20 tons , and that they moved from about 30 centimeters .
They &apos;re damaged about 50 magnetworks .
We had to take them , what we did .
We &apos;ve reflied them and wandstates .
They &apos;re now back all the underground , they &apos;re going to be back to them .
I end up the sight of the LHC will be again .
We will accain , and we expect to get some data or lue , and continue so our adventure to find out what are the morning morning that constitute the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents , they reach the debate about the value of science and the engineering of frontier . It &apos;s easy to conjecting .
I think the fact that &apos;s so difficult , the fact to go beyond the limits , I think is the value of things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of a glad scientist , Humphrey Davy , which I imagine , in the defense of inutilize , his clean was , his clean , his clean was , his clean , his clean was Michael Faday , said , &quot; No , it &apos;s so dangerous for the progress of the human mind , that the ideas of science is defines , that we don &apos;t have any mystical monkeys are complete in , &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start asking you about rethink about when you , you play with kids , play with the morning .
And as you get them and get them , and you get them and get them , and you learn , you know , actually , you know , to think and to do problems by doing and by the space relations .
The spacecraft is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , by the useful useful information about our own interaction with physical objects , together to my consultant , and the collaborator , and the collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of having the mouse as a computer , rather than the mouse as a digital chickicker than the mouse as a chickickens , and we can make it ,
and fix it ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big interactive computer like a biscanning .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big interactive computer like a biscanning .
You can move with your hand , you can see , &quot; you can see &quot; they , &quot; you feel the movement and they have a screen and radio wireless .
But overeign , they &apos;re physical objects , like the morning morning , you can just move it .
The Sifmonly , is the example of a new ecosystems to manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physicists , awarming more physical , unvehicles , as they become more physical , unwardness , the movement of the movement , of the other , how we can explore new fun styles of interaction .
I &apos;m going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show video video : if you start it in a direction , the video will rotate it so , if you start on the other hand .
These interactive portraits are aware of the other .
If I release , they &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re around .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can be agited with a little bit .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can be agited with a little bit .
They also revertling their movement and inclination .
And then I realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was to use communities on data , to be able to use communities on data , to just give you a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configured out how you &apos;re going to get into the color in that central , where they &apos;re missing .
and I can use them to use it to the central color in that central , where they &apos;re missing .
And we can see it too , we can get a little bit .
And I &apos;m also a good thing about learning , like languages , like languages , the mathematand logical games where people can try and do things fast , and see the results of the things that are going to be able to be able to be able to see the results of the things that are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
Now I &apos;m --
This is a sequence of Fibonacci that I do with a equations program .
This is a game of words that is in half of Scarabeer and Boggle .
Basically , at every turn-----letter letter , you know , you know , in every turnter you get a letter to -- and when you &apos;re looking for him to understand , and while you &apos;re looking for him to be a dictionary .
Then , about 30 seconds , you get a new set of letop and new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
And here &apos;s the kids came in in the Mdia Lab , I made it so that I would try and I turned them a video .
They liked a lot of pleased .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
You just say , &quot; You know , &quot; You know , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s the other people coming it .
This is our Tibeta young boat , there on the right .
It was actually wanted to be implpilars .
They were only only morning morning , for him .
Now , this is an interactive application of a interactive carton .
We wanted to build a tool for learning languages . He &apos;s Felix . He &apos;s Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , lifting the Sifmonks , they associated with .
It can put new characters in the scene , lifting the Sifmonks , they associated with .
So , it &apos;s doing out of the sun .
Video : The sun is surprising .
David Merrill : Now he took a treatment in the scene .
Video : The aranancil trewer .
Go work ! Yes !
So , shelling the Sifmons and put close , can be interacting the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing your story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a story with opening , and it can decide him how you can do it .
DM : It &apos;s a story with opening , and it can decide him how you can do it .
Video : Vola , gateway .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , I made , to sample and do music .
It &apos;s a tool , I made of recent , to sample and performing music .
The Siftable here are aging sounds like the basic , and the battery .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose which you use .
You can also also put these sounds in a sequence to your pleasure .
And it just by making it a sound and a sequence .
These are actually you can control from the vivivious , like the reverse and the filter .
The attacks to a particular sound and then incline for a bunch .
And then there are general effects as time and volume , which is apply to the whole sequence .
Let &apos;s look like it works .
Video : DM : We will start putting a base on the bottom of two Siftool , we put it in a series , the extending , we add , we add on , we add on , and we add on , and we add on , and we add on , and we add on , and we put it in a series , we add on , and we put it in a series of things .
Now , I &apos;m going to put a low line .
Video : DM : Now I added some percussions --
Video : DM : And I &apos;m going to put the glass on the battery , so I can control the effect from the vial .
Video : DM : I can reveal the whole sequence of the sequence , and on the other .
Video : DM : And I &apos;m going to add the bottom to the bottom to give more expression .
Video : DM : I can get the sequence of the flying .
So I don &apos;t have to plan it before , but I can suddenly , making it more long or more court .
And now , finally , I can smoking the whole sequence of the left the Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new human human human interface , more resememements like our brain and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the results of this path , and even some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that coming this new generation of design objects to interact with digital media , which will lead to the information in our world that we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time to talk to you about you .
I &apos;m a writer .
I &apos;m going to be a profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the love and the fascinating of my life .
And I don &apos;t look like it can change .
But , I said , something particular , it &apos;s been recently in my life and my career , which led me to reeating the entire relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called &quot; Mangia , &quot; Prega , &quot; which , in fact , in fact , in some reason , in some reason , and it &apos;s a great feeling , in the world and I got a great sensitive , the interational , and it &apos;s interactions .
And the result is that everywhere , you go now , people treat me as if I was convicted .
It &apos;s true -- convicted , conducted .
They &apos;re all me worried about and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t . &quot;
You don &apos;t fairly care of continue to write all life without being able to create a book that can matter to someone ? &quot;
that can matter anybody ? &quot;
It &apos;s recomure , you know .
But it could go worse , at the part of that I remember 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a scrotum .
I would go to the same reaction of the fear .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you feel not going to be able ?
You don &apos;t have afraid the ulililifted you ?
You don &apos;t have fear to do this to be a whole life without anything that it &apos;s ever out and to die on a cumb cule of setting up the bow of failure ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I &apos;m afraid of all of those things .
I always had afraid .
And I also have afraid of a lot of other things that people wouldn &apos;t be ininary .
As the algae and other things saving .
But , as I write what I thought and I was asking myself about , and I would ask myself , is why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logical that anybody who &apos;s weak for being afraid by a work that you &apos;ve been sent to do .
But what is that , particularly in creative companies that they can make us nervous about the mental health care , you know , in a way that other carefully not ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemicals and I don &apos;t remember one time in his 40 years of activity in his 40 years of activity in which he was asked if he was an engineer ?
It was not -- that -- that block of engineer , how does it go ?
It wasn &apos;t working so , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
Onestly , chemicals are not certainly , in the small small small , earlier , earn the reputation of being alcolized maniacated .
We have a writers , we have enough this reputation , and not only not only writers , but we have this reputation of being huge instables .
And it &apos;s not the other that you look at the tristes of the magnifts of creative minds that only in the 20th century , they die and often , by their young and often by hand .
And the ones that don &apos;t have suicked to be really disdisdisdisconnected by their dones .
Norman Mailer , before he died in the last interview said , &quot; Every book has killed me a little bit more . &quot; A fashion , &quot; A fashion on to the work of their life .
But I don &apos;t throw it when we feel saying it because we &apos;ve heard these things so long , that we &apos;ve completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are in some ways , you know , the end , the end , will always confer to the corosx .
And the question I want to ask you to all of this is , you agree with this idea ?
It &apos;s all good for this -- because it &apos;s also looking at it from a centimeter to me not that &apos;s good for me .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous , and I don &apos;t want to see it in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better encourage our big creative minds to live .
And I know that , in my case -- in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start to fix to that I was very dangerous , overeign surrounding around the circumstances that I &apos;m in my career .
That &apos;s true -- -- I &apos;m a little young , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m about 40 years old .
I still have about four worthy of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything I write about it , and then it &apos;s going to be judicted by the world as the work that after the last book .
I &apos;m going to be slavor , because we &apos;re all more or less friends here -- is likely that my greatest success is to my shoulder .
Oh , Gesus , that thinking !
You know , that &apos;s the kind of thinking that leads a person to start dying to blow in the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would keep on doing this work that we do this work that we love .
So , the question becomes , how does it , how do you do that ?
And so it looks at me , after a reflective , that the way to work to continue write is to create a construct constructed , right ?
I have to some way to find a security distance between me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural natural advancing that I would write for all the last year , looking for it for all last year , looking for other societies , to see if they could have better ideas and more healthy ideas to see if they could have better ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthy ideas .
how to help people manage to manage the emotional of creativity .
And that research me to the ancient Great and ancient Rome .
I do do it because I come back in circle and then it comes back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
And it was thinking that creativity was this spirit looks like , and that sell men from some distant surprised , for some distant and unknown for distant reasons and unknown , for distant and unknown .
The Greeks called these spirits of creativity .
Socrrates , wonderful , he believed to have a demon that elargive .
Romans were the same idea , but they called that kind of spirit without a genius .
which is great , because Romans didn &apos;t think that a really thought that a genius was somebody who was smart particularly intelligent .
They believed that a genius was this kind of divine that he lived in literally literally in the walls of an artist , a little bit like the elevent of the artist , and it sell to be able to be able to be a nose of hidden the work of the artist and models the outcome of that work .
Here &apos;s east -- here , that is the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological construct that you get from the results of your work .
And everybody knew it was so that it worked , right ?
So , antic artists were protected by certain things , like , for example , too narcism , right ?
If your work was exceptional , you couldn &apos;t take it all the deserve , everybody knew that you were helped by this genius .
If your failure work , it wasn &apos;t all your fake , you know , you know , you know , you know , if your failure work , you know , if your work failure , you know , you know , if your work failed , you didn &apos;t all your work ,
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a inable .
And so people have han conceived creativity in Western time .
And then the Rince came and everything else , and it changed , and it does this great idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe on top of all of the melded and without left space to the creatures and without left space to the creatures .
This was the principle of humanity and people started thinking about thinking that creativity sell .
And for the first time in history , you start to get this or that artist , as a rather than a person with the genius that artist , rather than a person with the genius .
And I have to say , I think it was a big error .
I think allowed someone , a simple person to believe that you can believe that you &apos;re like a recient recient , the essence and the surprising of all the divine mystery , creative , unknown and unflew , and unknown to be a very big responsibility for a foundation to be a very big deal for human fragile .
It &apos;s like to ask someone of ingoate the sun .
It &apos;s details completely completely about the ego and it makes all these unexpected to be expected to the performance .
And I think it &apos;s been this pressure to destroy artists in passed .
And if that &apos;s true , and I think that &apos;s , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do it ?
Maybe you go back to a more ancient understanding of human relationship and mystery .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can &apos;t get 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And probably people in the audience in the audience that would only be lined to relate scientific suspects on the notion of , they do people , they do , they do people fed on their own projects .
It &apos;s probably not a mind , I &apos;m not going to convince you all about this thing .
But the question I want to ask ask is -- why not ?
Why wouldn &apos;t you think about this ?
Because it has more sense of anything else that I &apos;ve ever heard to explain the imprevehesasperating the imprevehicable of the process .
A process that , as anyone ever tried to do something -- so , basically , all of the way , you don &apos;t understand rationally .
And in fact , in fact , it can sometimes seem completely paranormed .
I did this , I was recently with the extraordinary poetry , and he was now 90 years old , but it was a very poem for all life and said that during his child in the Virginia , working out in the rural rural rural rural rural rural , and I felt in the rural rural arrow .
He said he was like a fold of air .
And that was roling to get off of the landscape .
It was feeling to get , because he was going to be a loud of the ground .
He knew that you had one thing to do to do at that point and he was , &quot; to run like a match . &quot;
And it was going to be done by this poetry , and it wouldn &apos;t have to be able to get a piece of paper and a fairly fairly fairly fairly , and they would get it , collected it , and it &apos;s going to be done by this poem , and it was going to be done by this poem , and it was going to be done by this poetry , and get it out of the hanging , and then it was going to be done by this poem , and it was going to be done by the way .
Other times you couldn &apos;t be fast , so correct and the hanging and the poetry and get the hell through the house and the poetry and get the lumped and she was going to continued to rotate through the landscape , trying to be , and she was going to be a little bit through the landscape , and she was going to be able to be able to be able to be fast . &quot;
Then there were those times -- this piece never forget -- there were moments when it was almost losing , right ?
So , he was running home and she was trying to paper and poetry and card it was going through , and he was going to be going , and then he said , &quot; He was going , and then he said , &quot; He was going to be able to be able to put with the other hand and the office .
And it was the poetry from the tail and repair in his body and transmitted it on the page .
And in these cases , poetry would be presented on the perfect page and intings , but at the contrary , from the last word to the first word to the first .
So when I was I thought -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly the same as I think .
Not my creative process -- it &apos;s not a conducucucucucucture .
I &apos;m a mulo , and my way to work is ; I wake up at the same orary every day and work and go and go and working on the goffly .
But even I &apos;m in my testardaggin my testy , I &apos;ve got laid against that , sometimes .
And I guess a lot of you in the han .
You know , even if the work and ideas came to me from a certain source of source , I wouldn &apos;t be able to be able to know .
And what is this ?
And how can we relate to it in it , how do we want to be a head , but rather , rather , that it &apos;s going to be healthy ?
As I think , the best example of me , the best example I have a musician . Tom Waits , which I interviewed several years ago for a journal .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life was a remarkable reminded of this , and management , trying to control , management , to keep these species of impulses creationally creative impulses .
But then I invecked , he scalm , and a day , and he was driving on a highway in Los Angeles , he changed everything for him .
It was going to be fast and all of a sudden this little framing of melody , which comes in in his head as inspiration , and the desider , and the desider , and the desider , and the desider , but they don &apos;t know how to take it .
It doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a pencil .
So it starts to hear this species of old , growing up in him , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose it from this song even .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to be in the panic , he stopped .
And I &apos;ll put the whole mental process and made something completely new .
He just looked at the sky and he said , &quot; I &apos;m driving , don &apos;t you see that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Do you look like it ?
If you really want to exist , you get a bit more you you just get a bit of you , when I can take care of you .
Altrain , you go to importantly someone else .
You can disturbing Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his work process started changing after this .
Not the work , the work was still dark .
But the process , and the fishing anxiety that was released when the genius , the genius that out of him , the geniuses that it was going to be a reduced , and liberated it back to the time , and the reminded .
But yeah , this peculiar , wonderful , a conversation between Tom and this thing that &apos;s very strange and the outside that but it wasn &apos;t Tom .
So , how the story started to change a little bit of changing the way I was working , and I &apos;d already saved me once .
This idea , I &apos;d save me when I was writing , &quot; Prega , &quot; and I fell in one of those dispppair cave of the dispppair that we all do when we &apos;re all working on something and you can &apos;t do and start thinking that will be a disaster book , which is going to be written , which is the worst book .
Not only good , right , the worst book wrote .
And I started thinking about to gect this project .
But then I remember Tom that I talked to the air and I tried .
So I raw my face on on the manecriticize and I would comment to a vacuum angle in the room .
And I said high voices , &quot; Sath , what we know , if this book is not going to be brilliant , not it &apos;s going to be a very cold , no ?
Because I &apos;m looking at it , I &apos;m putting all of this , I don &apos;t have this .
So if you want to be better , you have to introduce you and do your side .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know , you don &apos;t .
I &apos;m going to talk to write the same , because it &apos;s my work .
And I want to please that it was recorded that I &apos;ve presented to do my part . &quot; Because it &apos;s so , OK -- centuries does in the deserts of the North of people were going to be dances of lone , dances and dances and music that went on and and and and and the hadmit to the high school .
And they were always magnifts , because the ballerini were great .
But every one of them , I &apos;m going to happen , and one of these artists became actually transcending .
And I know what I &apos;m talking about what I &apos;m talking about , because I know you &apos;ve all seen , at some point , a way .
It was like the time you stopped , and the ballerin walking through a kind of portal and it wasn &apos;t doing anything else else from the usually , like 1,000 noticed , but it was all halled .
And suddenly , you don &apos;t look like a human .
But it &apos;s got from divinity and below the divinity of divinity .
And when this happened , he was , people knew what he was , they called it .
They were , they started to sing , &quot; Allah , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , &quot; God , &quot; God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curious note historical notes -- when the Mori I invaded the Spn of the Spn , I was going to be able to change in the centuries , Allah , Allah , &quot; which you can still hear in the corride or famenk .
In Spna , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , the sound , Allah , the magnic , &quot; uncomcomprehensive , &quot; uncomprehensive , &quot; His , &quot; Huncomcomprehensive , God .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes up the day after , for the ballerin the same , when you wake up and you see , it &apos;s the 11 in the morning of God is there is no more .
It &apos;s just a lot of hurt to the ginocc , and maybe it &apos;s not going to each other to that altitude .
And maybe nobody is going to be the name of God again as a gira , and what is going to do with his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most sweet rereconciliations to do in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so corporate if you can &apos;t believe , you can &apos;t believe , advanced , that the most amazing aspects of your being being from you .
But it just makes you a bit of a reimaginable source of this team of a unimaginable source of this team of your life that you have to get someone else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think about this way it changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s certainly like I thought about it for different months in the working of the book that I &apos;m going to present , the dangerous , I &apos;m going to be able to be , and I was following my great success .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel electrized by this is , I don &apos;t have afraid .
Not falls . It &apos;s only a lot of your work .
It &apos;s going to be presented for your hand , any can be .
If your work is dance , you &apos;re balling , you &apos;re balling .
If the divine , it &apos;s a little bit of assigned , you know , I &apos;ll let me get some kind of wonder , for one moment through your efforts , then &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Otherwise , you do the same dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot; to you the same .
I think it &apos;s about it .
&quot; You know , &quot; to you , even only for having human love and testing and tables tals to make you introduced to a tal tal , and you &apos;ll be continuously .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects on human genome , what can mean to be meaning and about new set of genes .
Now we &apos;re starting a new perspective : we started digitize biology and now we &apos;re going to start digital code , we &apos;re moving into a new fase of biology , designing and synthesizing life .
We always tried to ask big big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists , I think they have been trying to figure out out of various levels .
We tried different approaches , reducing it to the minimi terms .
We &apos;re digitizing about 20 years of now .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the world analogy of the biology in the digital world .
Now , let &apos;s ask us : can we regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome that can self-self-self-self-self-self-self-self-self-self-relative in lab .
And we tried to reduce genome to create a little bit more .
We can get a hundred genes of a hundred genes of about 500 that are here .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our .
It &apos;s just a little bit of this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can get , one at the time , it &apos;s very unlikely to bring this can bring to a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to design was synthesize this chromosome in a way that we could change the components to take some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of &quot; &quot; &quot; Can we synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Can the chemical chemical contain these big molecules that we never able to make it before ?
And in case , we can make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemical material .
The speed with which we can digitize life is growing to be growing .
Our gene code , instead , of course , designing gene code , but it &apos;s going on .
And our more recent results the results up a exponential curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process has been required a lot of passes , starting with a bioethical review before we started the first experiments .
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult .
There &apos;s tens of thousands of cars in the world that make small segments , the long DNA , the long length of 30 to 50 to letters and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the segment is long , more errors .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments and correct the errors .
And this is our first attempt , to start with digital information of Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , we &apos;ve designed the fragments of the errors and I got a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material , and we put it into the bacteria , and we put it into the bacteria , they started to read this genetic code and to make virals .
The virals were then , you &apos;ve got to reduce the cells , they &apos;re back and they &apos;re destroy .
I talked about recent with the oil industry and say that they &apos;re certainly understood that they have to be certainly understood this model .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build the same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things more in big .
We wanted to build the entire chromosome of bacteria .
They &apos;re more than 580 midness .
So we thought we &apos;re going to build it in the size of the viruses , so that they can change the cassette to understand what the components of a living cell .
The design is critical , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , 1995 , the standard was of a mistake for every 10 midst .
We found , resequence it , 30 errors . If we had that we used that original sequence we never , we would never be able to do it .
One of the process is designing segments 50 letters that they oversovraped with all the other segments of 50 , and to build smaller subunity that work together .
We try to get unic elements here .
You probably read that we &apos;ve read that we put in the fire .
So , think of it &apos;s so : we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters , put together about 20 amminds , and there &apos;s a specific order to letters , and there &apos;s a specific order to letters for every amammed .
So we can use the gene code to write , frash , frash , thoughts .
What we did at the beginning is self-reflect .
Some of them were delused by fact that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
We designed these segments to be able with enzyme .
There &apos;s me that they repect them and put them together .
And we started to assembling parts , starting with the parts of the parts , starting with a fire , and they &apos;re going to form segments of 24 mies to the letters to them , and then they get to 72 .
And we &apos;ve made these segments in abundance so that we could sequence it , because we &apos;re trying to create a very robbbblew processing -- -- like you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this looks like the tabellon a basketball game .
When we get these little segments very long , more than 100 mies , more than 100 thousand basis , they &apos;re not going to grow directly in the E.
You get to the modern molecular biology .
So we &apos;ve been considered more mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called homological refinding , which in biology is used to be used to repair the DNA that can unit .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinococcur Deinococcur , can absorb three million radiation .
You can see in high hours like his destroomes as his destroome is destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s reassembled exactly how it was before .
There &apos;s thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be completely completely .
They can live under empties .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life exist in space , and it &apos;s to find new environments .
In fact , NASA showed that this is going .
This is a molecule image that we built using these processes , just using the lieventually with design appropriate design of the segments of the segments of the segments .
The hell them to automatically .
This image was not taken with a electronic microscope , but with a regular microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It &apos;s a so big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope .
These are pictures that they cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the publisher that we did a little time ago .
They &apos;re more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the largest molecule of a defined structure that &apos;s ever created by man .
It has a high molecular weight .
If you &apos;re going to be a little bit of a 10 without spaces , you would want to be 142 page only to transform this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ? How can we take it ? How can we take it ?
Obviously , you take a virus is a game .
It &apos;s a little more complicated when they &apos;re using bacteria .
It &apos;s more simple as even when it &apos;s eucarily cells as our : you can just get the nuclear and put another one , which is basically the process of cloning .
In the battery bacteria in the bacterium , instead of integrated inside the cell , but we &apos;ve recently shown that we can do a complete trapion a cell trapion a cell to another and activer it .
We clean a chromosome that we can start a micbian .
The two are different than men from mice .
We added some gene in more way we could decide what to choose for this chromosome .
And then I &apos;m sholed with the enzymes so that they kill all the protein .
And when we put it in the cell is amazing -- and you &apos;re appreciate our so-like , and you &apos;re going to be able to be in the cell .
And we thought we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to try to get us more in there .
This is one of the major of evolution .
We found that tantissim species , they added a second or a third chromosome from some of the new traits to that species .
So , who think about evolution as one gene once you change , it doesn &apos;t understand much of the biology .
There &apos;s a enzyme called &quot; restric fresh of which they even digit .
The chromosome that was in the cell , you didn &apos;t have one .
The mobile phone -- the chromosome we put it .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other chromosome as a material extraneum , and we found with only the cell and the new chromosome .
It &apos;s become blue because of the genes that we put .
And in a short amount of time , all the characteristics of a species , they go , and it turned out into a new species , based on the new species , based on the new software that we put in the cell .
All the proteins have changed , memories are changed , and when we read the genetic code .
Now , this may seem to be a gene , but by by by by making the way , you can change things in a very substantial way .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that it &apos;s not about genis -- but progress from three million years and a half million years and a half of evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion that will be created new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think that &apos;s pretty obvious when we think about our needs .
We &apos;re going to go from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now , there are three people on the planet for each other in 1946 ; 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medical and wellin for six billion and a half billion people .
It &apos;s going to be more dying to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion fuels of fuel , more than 30 billion barrels of oil .
That means 100 million barrels a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replace them , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to realize all the CO2 emission from these materials that finds in the atmosphere .
In the world , thank you to scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the design for the future .
The electronics industry , only only one dozen about components , and you think about how many different things came out .
Our limits here is a principle of biological reality and our imagination .
Now , we have techniques , thank you to these synthesization metods , able to create what we call a combinatory .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think about processing these 20 million different genes or to try to optimize the processes to make it optimize the processes to make it , to a little team , and create more molecular biology now , and create more molecular biology now that in the last 20 years .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemical production or fuel production or fuel , producing vaccines .
This is a few software instant software programmed that we &apos;re working to be able to sit and design .
Well , we don &apos;t know how they &apos;ll be .
We know exactly what their gene code .
Now , we &apos;re focusing on quarter generation .
You also saw that hit out of the grain was a hurt experiment .
We have depending on the third generation that will be used to be in the sugar to be very high as the ophical or or different butanle .
But the only way that biology can have a great impact without increasing the cost of food and limlimited the cost of food and limlimited the energy in the world , so we &apos;re working to design cells that can achieve this purpose , and we can think that you can have the first coal impact fourth generation in about 18 months .
The combined sunlight with CO2 is a metodowntown -- but in our discoveries in the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It &apos;s in the deep ocean , about 2,500 feet deeply to the webollights of water .
It creates metane by using molecular hydrogen by using molecular hydrogen .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can incanaling CO2 , which can easily be transported by toubbees , convert that CO2 in fuel , to drive this process .
So the short we think we might be able to increase what the basic question is , &quot; what &apos;s life is &quot; we , &quot; is &quot; what &apos;s life is . &quot; We have the modest goal to reflect the entire chemistry of the entire chemistry industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can you do it ?
It would be a major source source of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working on to use the same metods to create instantly vaccines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with flu , we &apos;re always forth of a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s about the munique .
I think that can change by making combinable vaccines in anticipe .
And that &apos;s how the future might start to look , and it &apos;s going on , now , the evolution with syntheists , and then equals , and then equals , and finally cells .
We &apos;re so much of improving people .
Our purpose is to make a long enough to try to make it . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the faster , some fundamental work , the new technology that we took to the Microsoft in the follow of a year ago . This is Seadragon . This is Seadragon .
This is a environment where you can interact is local local level that remoon is that you can remote with a huge amount of visual data .
This is now we &apos;re seeing a lot of digital photos with a kind of digital photos with a kind of goom and continue , for a fast breakthrough , despite the images like .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much the amount of information that we see , how big they &apos;re seeing , how big they &apos;re these data , or images .
Most of them are communities , but this for example is a re-called , and this for example is a provened by the Biary of Congress , and it &apos;s going to be in the gamma of 300 megamma .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that &apos;s limited the prestations of a system like this is the number of plug on your screen in any time . It &apos;s also very flessible architecture .
This is a book whole , for example of data not .
This is the Dickens of Dickens . Every column . Every column .
To show you that it &apos;s just about the text and not of images , we can do something like that , to show you really that &apos;s a real representation of the text , not of a picture .
It might be a little artificial way to read a little electronic book .
I don &apos;t tell you .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s a number of The Guardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a section .
And I really enjoy and the good experience of reading the real real version of a magazine or of a journal , which is for a half a kind of a half .
We also have something with the corner of this particular number of The Guardian .
We created a fashion that , which is a very high resolution -- much higher than what you use in a normal publishing -- and we put you in the content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to get out of space on the screen .
And I hope that this means to put people and other door , and other door to the same , not to be able .
Of course , maps is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say that we have contributing you to do in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. sovraped up a geospace of NASA .
So , let &apos;s go to something else .
This is actually from the wellow of the web ; you can go to see it .
This is a project called Photosynth , which fighting two different technologies .
One is Seadron and the other is a visual research that was very interesting by Noah Snavely , a student of Washington , with the University of Washington , with the help of Steve Seadrnow and Rick Szelki Microsoft Rick Szelch . A great collaboration .
And it &apos;s from the websent , I &apos;m in the web .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from a picture to the other and have this kind of experience of a multiple experience of experience .
But the spacecraft of images here , actually a meaning .
The algorithms of visualization , they recorded these images together , so that they &apos;re going to be re-re-related algorized , the Picks on the Montagne Roccive channel -- they &apos;re scapes . And here you see the elements of a detap or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or
I don &apos;t know if I have time I &apos;m showing you some other environment .
There &apos;s a lot more spacecraft .
I want to spend directly to one of the Noah. And this is from a previous prototype that we did work for the first time the summer prototynth that we did work for the first time the summer -- to show you what I think is really the key behind this technology , Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily evident to look at the environments that we put in the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a rebuilding of Nothree Dame &apos;s rebuilding a PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPlickr and you get images of types in magliet , and you get some kinds of globe , and you get some of these things that are discovered to keep the image that it &apos;s discovered to hold to it .
So they &apos;re all taken from Flickr and they were all connected to the spacecraft level in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to igate this very simple way .
You know , I &apos;d never thought to end up working for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifying to get this kind of accounting here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of photocamers : from those cell cell cell phone in the SLR , a significant number , a significant number ,
And if I can , I try to try to look more strange .
Many block are by faces , etc .
Somewhere you &apos;re here is a series of photographs -- it &apos;s got a series of photographs --
This is a Nothree of Nothree Drecorded correctly .
We can go from the poster of the poster of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with the social environment . This is taking data from the entire collective memory . This is now taking data from visual point of visual view -- and connected all those data together .
All those pictures become connected together , more than the sum of the parts .
You have a model of the earth .
Think about this as a prolungation of Stephen Lawler &apos;s work on virtual Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity , as people use it , and the whose advantages for who are increasing it with the use .
Their photos are marched with metaphor by other people .
If you are the idea of contrast , you can see all these sants , I said , my picture of Nobody Demail , my picture of Nobody Dimprovisisisely arring of all of those data , and I can use it as a point of ingress in that space , in that metaphor , using the photos of the other , and having a social experience of the kind of like , and having a social experience of the kind of modes and cross-like ,
Of course , a consequence of all that are very elaborate models of all interesting , the ground , you have collected you not only see planes and satellite images and similar , but from the collective memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understood ? What your software is your software will be to do is that at some point , in the next years , all the photographs of everybody in the world &apos;s all the whole world will be very , you &apos;ll be connected with ?
BAA : Yes . What &apos;s doing is doing is basically .
It &apos;s about hyperlink , if you want , you want , you know , in images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of seant information that many of these images possible .
As you do a research of images on the web , you get a sentence and the text on the web is on the web , it has a lot of information about the images .
Now , what happens if that picture is relates to all your photos ?
So the amount of seant interconnection and the amount of wealth that it &apos;s really huge . It &apos;s a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really amazing .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the main pleasants when you travel and one of the ethnogical research is that you can live in the wings of the people who have the antic traditions , between who you have the past in the wind , the stones in the wind , the hangs , it &apos;s in the wind , and the falls in the wind of the plants .
Basti thinking that the sciaman Jaguar , they still travel the Via Lattea , or the eleast of the Inuit &apos;s still colms of significed , or that in Himalaya , the buders still follow , the distinctive importantly , to remember the central importance of anthropology , and the idea that the world that we live in in a sense of reality , but it &apos;s just a model of reality , but it &apos;s really a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stirpful stirpful has done , well or bad , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of essential trails .
We all come . All of the projecting .
We are subjects .
We have to deal with the inexorability of death , so we don &apos;t surprising us and we whalalales .
We all have an art .
What &apos;s the thing that hits is the particular rhythm of the song , the dance of culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that they &apos;re the Borneo &apos;s forests , or the follow of the Voodoo &apos;s Borneo , or the desert warriers of the Sahara , or the Chaign Chaign , or a cammas , or a cammas , or a cammas , or a camp in the Sahara .
He &apos;s been my company , by the desert a month ago , or a month ago , or a yak hallelder in Qomolangma , the mother &apos;s dea mother of the world .
All these populations are teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And if you reflect a moment , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
Insight , the miriades of cultures in the world create a spiritual and cultural life that you want the planet and it &apos;s important to the planet , and it &apos;s important for the planet as biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural roll as a ethnosphere and you can call the etnosphere and you can call the total nosphere and you can call the total , dreams , with ideas , inspiration , intuitions , by being the human imagination of the awareness .
The ethnosphere is the great potential of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how to be as as as initiitive .
And because biosphere is just been very , very much more , as it &apos;s happened to the ethnosphere and unfortunately much more quickly .
Nobody biologist , for example , would say that 50 percent of all the species is been or is on the east of the extinction just because it &apos;s flew , or -- in the most apocalyppppy -- and you don &apos;t even get to even even even get to the most optional hythesis .
The indicator of all that is , of course , the language loss .
When you were born , they were 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not composed by a vocabulary or a series of rules , or a series of rules .
One language is the spraking of human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle of every culture comes in in the material world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a kick , a thought , a thought , a spiritual of spiritual possibly .
And of 6,000 languages , and we &apos;re sitting in Monterey , at least half not , at least the middle of the children .
They don &apos;t get to kids , the which means , less than the camps that don &apos;t have any more , which are already death .
What is more sad than you were going to be the silence , of being the last to talk about a language , the last to talk about a language , of the uncable of being able to transmit the wisdom of the kids ?
This is a flied by someone in some of the world in some of the world every two weeks , every two weeks , or a old language , and door with it in the toms , the last silly language .
And I know somebody who will say , &quot; Is it better ?
The world wouldn &apos;t be a better place if we were to talk about the same language ? &quot; Welly , we &apos;re all yoruba . Let &apos;s talk about it . We talk about the cancers .
We talk about kogi .
You &apos;ll get a sudden what it means you can &apos;t talk to your language .
I &apos;d like to do a journey through the etnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a bit of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , &quot; different ways of existing , &quot; I mean , really different ways of existing .
Let &apos;s take for example this Barasan Barasan Amazon , the Amazon in the Amazon , which crees to come from the river of the tool of the West in the west breeders in the snap &apos;s breeders .
It &apos;s a people who can &apos;t distinguished the color blue from the green green because the time cell cell is identified in the forest , and it &apos;s identified in the forest , which is the people .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rule , called &quot; exogamia language , &quot; you have to marry a person talking about a different language .
All of this has roots in the mitological past , though the particularly the particularly , is that in these families that they talk about six or seven ing-s-up .
They &apos;re limited to listen and then they start talking about .
We take one of the most interesting tribe with which I lived , the Waorani of Ecuador , a amazing popular that has the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five , they tried a contact error .
They made up up on the top photographs that they were going to be amichevolving , forest that they were going to be among the forest of the forest plug that had never seen anything bi-dimensional .
They collected the photos , they turned to the research of a form or a form or and , not find anything , they have concluse that it was the diavily about the diavily , and they killed the five missionaries .
But Waorani didn &apos;t kill only the foreign .
They killed between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by their own .
We were saving eight generations and we found two natural death cases and we found two natural death , and when we &apos;ve been born with a way to know , they had a lot of them was invecting , and then they killed it . And then they killed it itself . And then they had an amazing knowledge of the forest .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine animal , and you recognize the species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned a really interesting task for me , if I wanted to go to Haiti , I asked to go to Haiti in intruly , I &apos;m going to get Haiti of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes , and the Tonton Macoutes , and I was going to make the zoms .
For a sense of the miraculous , I would have to understand Vodoo culture and the Voodoo is not magic .
It &apos;s pretty a complex metaphor of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to tell me about the world &apos;s big religions , what would you say ?
Christianity , Islam , Buddhism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has not faith religious . And instead of them and the Voodoo is not another one that the distilled to these religious religious concepts in the tragic diaspora slavor .
What makes voodoo is the intense relationship between life and death .
So the vives are going to hide the behave .
The spirits can be invocated by the Great Acqua , they respond to the rim of the dance of the viviable way that for a short active active active active , the folds becomes the butterly .
So , this is the voodooomomic , they say , &quot; You &apos;re going to talk about God .
We give them in the temple and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re posing , is the spirit that you , how can you do you do , how can you do you ?
So you see these incredible events : follow voodoo in the state of trance that touch impunes that touch impunishment is a rather strong demonstration of the body when it &apos;s catalyzed in a state of extremely excitation .
And I &apos;m all the people with which I lived the most amazing people in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta Santa Marta , in the Colombia security .
They have to be a remarkable , the people who were living on the heart plan of the commodity of Colombia in the waiting for the conquiter , the people would be on the volcanic massure that you would be on the volcanic plant .
In a maceatchipped continent , this populations has never been conquered by the spageed .
But I &apos;m not today , they &apos;re government by a cler , but they &apos;re so extraordinary .
The young people are taken away from families to three or four , and they live secret in a world made of good and shadly shading in a world of good hoods for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years , by the way to make the nine months of gestation that they spend in the mom , now they &apos;re metaphor , they &apos;re now metaphor , they &apos;re now .
For this time , they &apos;re acculturated to their societies , values that are looking at their prayers and only their prayers , and they keep the cosmic balance -- or to say the cosmic balance .
And the term of this amazing initiation , it &apos;s all taken out and for the first time in life , at the age of 18 , they see an awn . And that &apos;s the face of the first bull , when the sun kiss , when the sun kiss , all that they have learned in theory in the way , all that they &apos;ve learned in theory in the way , and it says , &quot; I &apos;m going to be in the way , and it says , &quot; I &apos;m going to be a step out and says ,
&quot; Visit ? Proprive as I said .
It &apos;s amazing . Now it &apos;s now to you protect it . &quot;
They call a greater brothers and say that we , minds are the colpful of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the indigenous populations and the environment we call Rousseau and the old history of selvacuum , which is a race of the same concept of his own , or maybe invohypoth-ense Thoreau and we say that these people are closer to the Earth .
The Indies are not nor feels are not indebate from nor taly .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the Asmsmat the Asmat or in the Asmat the em of Tibet , but because it &apos;s made a mystical mystical ununexpected by the conception of being unbelievable by an ununable notion of the injeckle , but on a very much more , and it &apos;s just as infuse by awareness , but it &apos;s going to live only because it &apos;s infected by awardness .
What does that mean ?
It means that a little bit of Ande that a kid of Ande that you can create the mountain is a spirit that will be a deeper of human being deeply different and it will have a deeper , or that place a lot of different , and it will have a lot of a little bit of rocks is a ammasses of rocks are going to be scan .
That &apos;s the dimonds of a spirit or a mineral is irrelevant .
What &apos;s interesting is metaphor that defines the relationship between the individuals and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia Britannica , by making the forests that the forests you were going to be cut .
And that I made me a human being different from my friends Kwakiutl , who believe that the forests are the dimonds are the dimonist of heaven and the bakakaks of heaven and the downballs that live on the world , the south , and the downnnntown , and the buttered world .
If you start to look at that these cultures can actually start to be able to start to understand some of them feeling of the sensational discoveries .
I took this picture to open up in the Soret Amazon the West Amazon .
Maybe some of you have heard about the ayhuasks , the most powerful submmmelanic submelanic .
What makes it fascinating the ayhuasks is not the drug potential of the substance , but its elaboration . It &apos;s composed from two elements .
On one , this liana legning that has a series of Tioline , harmoline and harmoline , harmoline and harmoline , slightly hallucinogen .
And by trying to the only plant a plant that it will be a little bit blueprint that it will be a little bit of a bunch of family coffee , but it &apos;s got a bunch of family , and they said Psycheck .
This plant contains powerful powerful , very similar to the seriotonin , dithyptamine , dithyptamine .
If you &apos;re going to see Yanomami pull on the nose of the nose of the substance that they do from a different set of species , it &apos;s a methyptamine .
You can &apos;t create that dust on the nose is a little bit like being shown by a frog of painting and land on a sea of electricity . &#91; Risate &#93; &#91; Risen &#93; &#91; &#91; Risen &#93; . &quot; It &apos;s not a distortion of reality .
I often have to use my professor , Richard Evan , Shultes , the man who took the man who took the balloon was sheet , with his discovering fungi in the 1930s in Mexico .
Second my testhesis not classiflew these triptamine as hallucinogens because if you &apos;re done you can &apos;t tell anybody to be hallucined .
It &apos;s possible to be absumerely if you get other chemicals that would deny MAO .
Now , the nice thing : the Tie , the Ti-A-AO , they ininjury are inbitors of the same guy needs to potentially potential to potential triptamine . The question is is spontaneous . The question is is , you know , but that &apos;s a little bit of plants , like these people who are in two defetings , but that &apos;s the ones that are going to be on the parts of the parts ?
We use the great eubbbble-trying to be infruted by the way , which can be revealing .
But if we ask Indians , they &apos;ll tell us , &quot; The plants talk about it . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan has 17 variety of ayahead , which distinguished in the forest , and that they would come into the forest , and that we would come into the same species .
If you ask them how they stopped their tasonomy will say , &quot; I thought , &quot; I thought it was a lot of it , you don &apos;t know ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take 17 varieties in a flights and every one will be a bunch of different .
And this is not a graduate at Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than count the stami .
Now , &#91; applausers &#93; the problem is that even the ones of us that have to heart people at the heart of us find them painting , but in some way , I would give them to the world &apos;s bringing in the world , and it &apos;s going to move .
In fact , the 20th century , in 300 years , it &apos;s not going to remember her or his technology , but rather like the thing was that we stopped and we used actively abbraced and we used actively , or accepted the mass destruction of mass biological diversity and cultural planet . Now , the problem is now .
All the cultures have been involved in a dance for new possibilities of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Soreis not stopped to be Sioux when they put from the arco and freceived as Americans have no stop being American when they put on the horse and calcil .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that threatened the integrity of ethnosphere . It &apos;s the power .
The hard hard hard to domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you find that these are not despair to disappear .
They &apos;re living creatures and dynamic dynamic existence from forces that go beyond their adaptation .
Which is that it &apos;s disbosammed in the Penan --
a peaks nomads , in Sarawak , in the southern Watan people who lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to a generation , and now reduces the servitery and the prostitution of the rights that the rivers of the lim that seems to be brought back to the Mar CMarian , where you can see the Bornewspaces , where the Japan , where you can see the wave of the zones , where you can see the flew ,
It &apos;s ready to fill the wooden of the soth and the forest .
Or in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that have come with the discovery of gold .
If we move on on on the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you will see the hard hard hard hard to see , you &apos;ll see the safe of the political domination .
As you know the genocide , the physical extinction of a people , is constitute to the universal level , but the ethnoison of life , not only is not only unbelieved , not only is not about , but it &apos;s not a constantly , but even celebrated in certain environments , because it &apos;s part of development strategies .
And you can &apos;t understand the Tibet until you go from the beginning .
I &apos;ve path 6,000 miles from Chengdu in China , Western China through the West through Tibet , and I got to Lhasa with a young connected , but only came to Lhasa with a young connected , but it &apos;s behind the statistics that we feel about .
6,000 sacred monuments in the dust and centers .
1.2 million people killed from military during the Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascritted to Panchen Lama .
which means that it &apos;s been killed in the Chinese invasion .
His uncle flew with Santiity during the diaspora that led led to people in Nepal .
His mother was imprisoned and his cold was to be rich .
It &apos;s been brought to hide in a career at the age of two birth , because he couldn &apos;t live without him .
The sister , which has done the same , has been med in reduced .
One day he was called a hot button a frog of Mao and , for this transgression , was mitted to the work forced for seven years .
The pain of Tibet can be insopposable , but the spirit of the people is from the present .
And it was , all it reduces a choice .
We want to live in the world world &apos;s Man monocromatic world or we want to get the policy ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he died he died that his greatest , it was that in our way to go to this amorage of the world , not only we will see the whole gamma of thinking , but one day we &apos;ll see the whole gamma of thinking , but one day we &apos;ll wake up to a sleep ep ep ep in the way , we &apos;ll see it &apos;s going to be more possibilities .
And it &apos;s a loud to remember that our species is 600,000 years .
The Neolitica Revolution , which has given us farming farming , which has made us to socwarming the seed , by replacing the poetry of the skim of the poetry , and talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has been 300 years .
And that sharing story not suggests me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we &apos;re going to deal with in millennia , you know ,
When these miriades of cultures the world is asked what to say to be human , they respond to 10,000 different different voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all refer the possibility of being what we are : a unable species , that has to be able species , which has to be able to be what we &apos;re : a big moments of the gizones .
I took this picture on the north of Baffin , when I went to the whales of the bouncing of whales with Inuit , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and I &apos;ve got my grandfather .
The canads is not always been gentile with the Inuit and the 1950s to stabilize our sprement , we have them in colonies .
The granddad of this man refused to go .
The family , I fefeed her life , and it took all the weapons , and all of his equities .
You have to know that the Inuit &apos;s not freaking , they do it .
The pieces of the slitte of the sliter in origin were made of flew carier in the skin .
The granddaughter didn &apos;t put up from night or the bull--------------------------year-old man didn &apos;t put on the bunch of this man , or the butter , or the bullicense of this man , and the bullands of this man did not put out of this man in the middle of this man , who was suffiversus that it was suffed by the way .
It &apos;s flew away , and it &apos;s hot the panteived in the skin in and defected in their hand . When I did it &apos;s frozen , the working on a lighted .
It has salive salive on the shop of this cack of this caca dog .
He shake the dog and created a dogs , and it &apos;s got a dogue , and it &apos;s imbrired another dog , and it &apos;s disappeared on the banking , and it &apos;s disappeared on the banking , and it &apos;s disappears .
Do you want to talk about horrilled with nothing ? &#91; Risclear &#93; And this , in different ways , &#91; Applausers &#93; is the resilience of the people in the Inuit and of all the Indies of the world .
In 1999 , 1999 , 1999 , the CCCCCalan government refer to the total control area of an area of California and Texas .
It &apos;s their new paina new thing . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s an independent land . They &apos;re all mineraries .
One of a beautiful example of how a nation-state can re-concied can re-concisation can re-concient to be concient with her people .
And , for fining , I think it &apos;s rather obvious to the people who we have been in these remote areas of the planet , I realize that they &apos;re not remote .
For someone is home .
They represent seections of human imagination that they go at the time . And for us all of these kids , like the dreams of these kids , like the dreams of our kids , are part of the geography of hope .
So , we &apos;re in National Geographic , we are convinced that politicians will never come to anything .
We believe that polemics --
&#91; Applausers are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month our website has 35 million visits .
56 countries transmit transmitted our television dog .
Our magazines are lls from millions of people .
Our work is traveling in the ethnosphere to bring our public places in the etnosphere to bring us out of how they &apos;ve seen and , hopefully , abbracing , for the central reveal revealing in the etnosphere , and we have to find a life of life in a pluralist world in a world , and we have to find a life in a pluralist world , and we have to find a life in a pluralist world , and we have to find a life in a world
where the wisdom of all the people can contribute to our well-being .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope you &apos;ve heard and I &apos;m going to tell you some links , in the case you don &apos;t notice .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the official dogma . &quot;
The officide official what ?
The dogma official of all the West industrial companies . The dogma official official , &quot; If we want to massize the well-being of our citizens . &quot; The way to do it is massize the well-being of our own own own . &quot;
The reason is , on one side , in the fact that the freedom is itself a value , is pretious , useful , for human beings .
On the other is in fact that if we are free , each of us can act to do anything that we can do for all of us , without anybody who decided to be , without anybody decided to decide in our .
The way to massively freedom is massize the choice .
The more choices of people , they are liblow , and more is their freedom , the greater is their well-being .
This is so deeply radiced in the society that nobody would dream to be constitute in the society that nobody would dream to be constitute .
And it &apos;s also deeply rown in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress is possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not very big .
I &apos;m going to allow me a simple note about conditions to the injump .
In my supermarket is 175 conditions , without contacts of olive olive , you know , the 10 varieties of oil and the balloons you can buy a huge number of conditions in the circumbling circumbling around around the circumbling around , which is going to be a remarkable .
That &apos;s what &apos;s supermarket .
Then you go to the electronics store , to buy one stereear , the CD , radio , rain , the CD , radio , flefer .
And in this single single store , there &apos;s a big deal of audio .
We can do six and a half million different combinations using the components that there are only one store .
You have to admit that there &apos;s a lot of choice .
Other fields : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a kid , you could get all the desire to be able to , at all that they were supposed to be made by mom Bell .
And he was noleged the phone , didn &apos;t buy it .
One of that , one of that , in the other , was that the phone never break .
These days are gone .
Now , we have a nearly limited variety of telephone , especially between cell cell phone .
So , here &apos;s cell phone .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , cutting the nose , and forcing for the krice , and forcing for the brulells .
If you don &apos;t have you even seen in the store under the home store , you &apos;re very certain that will be .
And what &apos;s going on is that people come into the store and does this question . And what is the answer ? The answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the acquising of the purchose .
His there &apos;s health , is not going on in the United States you go from the doctor and the doctor , and the doctor you know , what you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do it , or B , &quot; &quot; &quot; You can have these benefits , and these risks , &quot; Well , &quot; Well , &quot; what do you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Dr. , &quot; Dr. , what I would do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A has these benefits , and these risks , and B has these benefits , and B has these benefits . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebat , &quot; Dr. if you were , you know , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result we call it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
But in fact , it &apos;s not that you can move the weight and responsibility to make decisions that someone knows something , which is the doctor , to someone else that you don &apos;t know -- and almost certainly , it &apos;s sick -- and so it doesn &apos;t know -- and it &apos;s not a patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing of products , directly to people like me and you , if you think about it doesn &apos;t have any sense , because you can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why do you get them ?
The answer is that they want you to ask ask them to change the recipe .
Something about this is the same as our orgeon is a choice of choice , how we see in this vigngnity , &quot; We don &apos;t want to forced the kids . I &apos;ll be able to do the kids . I don &apos;t want to be more an identity : we have to invent it .
And we can reinventing us as many times to be aggrade .
which means that every morning , at the time , you have to decide that you want to be .
I &apos;m going to the family and a matriage , a long time , the perspective , almost for anyone , it was that it was that we had the most preserve possible , and it started to be the most preserved for the most soon possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not even what to do after .
So , it &apos;s really to play .
I teach a very smart students , and I &apos;m going to be a lot of work than a time .
And not because they &apos;re not very brilliant , not because they &apos;re less diligent .
but why are they imthoughtful , you want to ask , &quot; I would be going to be going to be doing now ? &quot;
&quot; I should be worse later ? I have to think before kids or to the career ? &quot;
They &apos;re logoring .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this implement not complete the companies that I &apos;m going to do not get a big voice to my exame .
And they really need to do it . They &apos;re important questions .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , as Carl underneath , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from the planet , I &apos;m going to do with every day , from the Hotel Randolph .
And the parentesesesis , there &apos;s a corolin , and I won &apos;t say to which , where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , this amazing freedom of choice we have about the work ? Is it going to continuously decide , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son play , with your cell phone in a pocket , the Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the notebook .
And even if they &apos;re all spending , every minute that we see our son to reduce the game , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; I have to answer this ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? I have to email this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , you know , it makes the experience of your son very different than the game with your son &apos;s own son &apos;s very different than the conditions .
So , any of the look at , small things , materials and lifestyle materials , life is a choices of choices .
And once the world was this : White , there were some possibilities , but it wasn &apos;t a matter of choice .
The world today is what is about this : dilemlemma is , &quot; Is it a good thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Splan is .
We &apos;re all familiar with them , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative .
All this is this is two of fact , two negative effects .
The first , paradoxally , is that produced paralysis that it &apos;s going .
And so many options between which choose , becomes very difficult to do it .
I give you a significant example , a significant study of volunteer .
A connected to my connected to Vanguard data , the giant company , the giant company in 2000 different companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offer in the more , the percentage of adhhhhot from two percent .
With 50 to offer you , there &apos;s 10 percent in less than adhesions when they &apos;re available only five . Why are they only five . Why are they only five . Why are they only five . Why are they just five .
Because with 50 sources of which choose , is sick to decide , and the choice is removed to the intomorrow .
And tomorrow , and tomorrow , tomorrow , tomorrow , and of course tomorrow , and of course never comes .
You know , it doesn &apos;t only mean that these old work on the old people to dog , because they don &apos;t have enough money , it &apos;s also saying that the decision is so unforcing the decision is so uncable that they also lose the funding of the work dator .
Not in the participating , they &apos;re losing up to five dollars to work , which would be well disposed to be able to be there .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think it makes the world that .
&quot; And to end , for the ethernity : ketchup , or maionese ? &quot;
Would you take the right decision , if it &apos;s for ethernity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong wrong , and yet the condition .
So that &apos;s the first effect . The second is that even if we can avoooke the paralysis , we &apos;re less satissssatissssatissssatissssatisssssatissssed by .
And that &apos;s about different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of them , and you can buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have been able to do a different choice that would be better . And what &apos;s going on is that the alternative imagined us to brick up with the choice , and the repays decrease fitted by the decision , and the decrew reed by the decision ,
even when it was a great decision .
The more choices are , more likely to be displeased to any detail that is insoddispleasing of option .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has clared very well as a value of the value that we give things depends on what we &apos;re comparison .
On the rest , when there are a lot of possible options , it &apos;s easy to represent the characteristics of alternative shot , and be less sation-made option of the option that you have to be a good choice .
So , here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m sorry of the ones that are not in New York .
But that &apos;s what you &apos;re probably going to think .
There &apos;s this couple of Hamptons .
A slow place of susband .
Splendida . Ottttle day . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not going to be . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , evil is Agust . &quot;
&quot; All my neighbors in Manhattan is away . &quot;
&quot; I could talk about it in front of the home . &quot;
And it &apos;s going to spend two weeks from the idea that &apos;s losing -- every day -- the ability to parking where it wants .
costo-opportunity : demining sodness for what we have , even when the choice was excellent .
And the more the options that we have to think , the more the actual characteristics will be going to be going to be able to be constitute , will be going to be able .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a liver says a lot .
It &apos;s about the time , and maybe of living slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you choose , you choose to not do the other .
The things that we don &apos;t choose many attractive attractive that can make less attractive , what we do .
Third point : spiral stairs .
I tried to my skin buying a new couple of jeans .
I &apos;m looking at jeans .
Once jans were just a guy , buy them and they were , bought and vestivate from the bestia , and they were uncomcomfortable , and they were going to be well .
So I went to buy a couple of old , when the old old old were gone , and I said , &quot; I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cccccccccow , this is my cutting . &quot;
And he said , &quot; You &apos;re going to be a fit , you know , and fit ? &quot;
Do you want to be a certain certain cernian or with the button ? &quot; Stonejjjjobs ? &quot;
&quot; Would you like , &quot; Wait ? &quot;
&quot; Sotto wants them to strike them , or loublela , &quot; Continun to elencare .
I was salord , and after a little bit I could say , &quot; I want the guy that -- which was the only guy . &quot; He didn &apos;t know what it was , so for a moment I tried to all of them , jeans , and then I came out of the jeans , and then I came out of the jeans that I had ever .
It was the maximately . And all that I had the best one .
But I was worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse is that with all of my choice was altissue , jeans had to be perfect .
I had waited for me . I didn &apos;t expect anything that was in the way , when there was one , there &apos;s a kind of thing , but when I saw 100 different , by accidents , at least one , at least one , at least one of them had to be perfect .
What I did was good , but not perfect .
And after I started to the chosen with what I was so I was going to try to do in the waiting for expectations .
The added added of options in the life of people don &apos;t do that to increase the excellence of the same options .
And this will make less satisfation , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the marketing world , if you realize .
Because if they knew , they were not talking about .
The truth is more to this .
&quot; It was better when you were worse , &quot; was better when you were worse was worse , when you were worse was even able to meet the surprising pleasant .
In the world that we live in the world that we live , opulent citizens with the waiting for perfafaith -- the maximum that we can hope is that things are at the altitude of the expectation .
You never surprised it pleasant because your expectations , you &apos;re not going to be a giant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Baxation . &quot; Yes , &quot; I want it . &quot;
I mean , little autobiographic moment -- which I &apos;m really married and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn &apos;t do it , I didn &apos;t do it , I didn &apos;t do it .
But it &apos;s not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of buy a couple of jeans , when there &apos;s only that kind of jeans is that when you &apos;re not satisfacts , and you wonder , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who &apos;s responsible ? &quot; &quot; The answer is clear .
The world is the responsible . What would I do you do ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of jeans , and you buy a insoil , and you wonder who is the responsible , it &apos;s the responsible , it &apos;s so clear that the responsible you are .
You could have done better .
And with hundreds of varieties , not there are no scuse for the insuccess .
So when people make decisions , even though the result is valido , they feel unsatisfacfaced and they give the cold to their own .
In the last years , depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this wave of depression is just that people have deludent experiences because the standard are too high .
And when they need to explain this situation , they think the cold is .
So the final result is that we &apos;re better , substantially , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely fake . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little choice of choice is better than a bit of choice is not going to be much better than a little bit .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic value . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we overed by a piece of level where the choices improving our life .
Now , from a political point of view -- I almost finished -- I &apos;ve been finished by the political point of view , the nocy is the following .
What allows this whole choice in industrial society is the wealth .
There &apos;s a lot of places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too poor .
So the faccenters that I &apos;m talking about is a sick of modern , ren societies .
And what makes it depressing and angry is : Steve Levitt has talked about yesterday of how those expensive and seats for bimmad are useful . It &apos;s a money .
I mean these choices , complicated and dispendious , is not that they &apos;re just inutilize .
I &apos;m addictous .
They &apos;re worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows allows you to have a lot of choice , you don &apos;t , it &apos;s not only the life to improve , but our our own .
This is what economists call a relievation .
A redistribution of income redistribution of the income , it &apos;s not only to poor -- because of this choice in the excess that it mend us .
So , you can get it , you can become all you want . &quot;
You , you know , people of culture , you think , &quot; What does that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t do anything in a veglass . &quot;
&quot; A castrate imagination , a limited vision of the world --
and I &apos;m interested in the way , at the beginning .
But then , I realized , instead , I realized that that fish the long knows that the fish knows the long .
Because the reality is that if you &apos;re missing in franksmoke , so that you can &apos;t do the freedom . You can &apos;t get the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you break the boccia in a way that all of the divents that all possible decreation .
You get the paralysis , and you reduce the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too strange , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of some symbolic , is a recipe for inhappiness and , I &apos;m going to be a recipe for the rovine .
Thank you very much .
