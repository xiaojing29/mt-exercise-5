The year I showed these slide to show that the cotta climbing the arctic calotta , which for almost three million years , has had the size of 48 United States , it was restreet of 40 percent .
But this is a lot of the gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the spent of the ice .
The arctic calotta is , in a sense , the clear cuer , the heart heart of the global system .
You &apos;re expanding and it up .
The next slide is going to be a recorrelated to the last 25 years .
The ice loss are drawn in red .
As you see , they expand down to the blue .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter , which is the summer .
You can see that the ice cosidenn coat , of five years or more , it &apos;s like the blood , which is like the blood , which is like the blood .
In 25 years , it was gone .
This is a problem because the interested in the entire terrain the ocean , where there are huge amount of carbon conger , where there are huge amount of congap that , shake , they &apos;re transformed into the microbes .
Rech to the totality of the atmospheric atmospheric , that quantity could rading , that undouble , super-hythrow , surgery this point of not .
In some deep laghi , the metane in Alaska the metane is already rebolling from water .
The Kattens of the Katey Walter of the University of Alaska is reversity , a team in the winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : The question is if we &apos;re going to be it .
A reason is that this term scale the Greenland from the north .
This is a glacial figures .
The led had never reached free .
This is Kangered Kangerlush , in the south of Greenland .
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea slip to the shake of the ice on terrain on terrain .
These running are increasing rapidly .
At the other part of the planet : Antarctars , the bigger block of the planet .
The month scientists have diclared clared that the ice ice of the ice is in negative , and that Antarctes , which pogs on some of the Sixcrop , which pogs on some subtle , is particularly ququick in the sheet .
Equive six feet of the watching of the watching .
Sull Himalaya , the third bigger of ice , you know , they were new laghi , which a few years ago , that a few years ago , that a few years ago ,
40 percent of the world &apos;s population was going to be able water from that leaves .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the water power of this city .
The led is increased .
But when it diminute , it &apos;s the same happens to water .
In California , the snow on the Sierra Nevada is diminuit .
The hyrics are in crisis .
The predictions , as you read , they &apos;re graves .
The growth safe growth in the world &apos;s door to the incendes .
The environment is increasing a rhythm out of normal and without precedented .
Four times the numerous 30 years , the last 30 years to previous 75 .
This is a whole thing that is insttenable .
If you look at it in historical context if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day .
Look at the area of the Pacific Pacific Pacific , to American , and on both parts of the Indian indeed radical parts , where there &apos;s a radical impoverments .
Most cause of global warming , together to the deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the fossil of it .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with the most emissions , together to China .
And it was proposition to build a lot of other carbon .
But we &apos;re assisting a change .
These are the annoyses in the last few years and some of the alternative verge alternative verge .
And in a way , there &apos;s a political lotta political in our country .
The pallows industries and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon , which is a host host .
That picture me remember something --
Sert Naterging , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion pounds of free chories .
You may have seen it on the news .
This is the second bigger than scories in America .
It &apos;s successful around Natal .
The public nature of one of the carbon industries was this .
Video : Mross the carbon is a falleo and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it &apos;s growing our economy .
It &apos;s going to be clean and more and clean .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and work work , they keep the stypenipendipendium .
Al Gore : From here , it &apos;s a lot of West Virginia .
The bigger society on the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his amministrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I &apos;ll be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosis , Harry Reid -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Cland launched two campaign .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Ator : ALergy see the climate change as a serious serious climate change as a serious serious sery .
So that we have a whole priority is to invest a lot of money in a public efforts to make public efforts to make public and confuses the truth .
In fact , the carbon isn &apos;t bring up .
We think it &apos;s clean , it has a good profumo .
So , you don &apos;t preoctation of climate change .
Let me do .
Video : Carbone : Carbone : You &apos;ve heard a lot of you --
So let me go into a street structure at a street .
Straordinary ! The car ! The car is a little bit , but that &apos;s the sound of the car technology .
The carbon is a coal cause of global warming , but the remarkable technology , but the remarkable technology , but the remarkable technology that you see it all changes .
You have a look at : this is the clean odic technology .
Al Gore : Inend , the positive alternative , the positive alternational and the national security .
Video : However : America is in crisis ; the national economy , the national security .
The philos that the blocks all : our fossil dependence from fossil , like the carbon and oil .
Now , but there &apos;s a new , audacudacy solution for it .
Really America : 100 percent energy , in 10 years .
A plan to reputting America to work , make us more safer , and help to stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that I have to solve our problems .
You can get America . You know , you know , more .
Al Gore : That &apos;s the last .
Video : It &apos;s a furniture energy .
One of the faster ways to get to the bustible dependence from the combustible that we killed our planet .
She talks about it . I feel , just , a new energy .
It &apos;s going to be two : Noves investment for places .
I &apos;m going to be realistic . It &apos;s time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old proverbio , they say , &quot; If you want to go fast , you go .
If you want to go away , you go back . &quot;
We need to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
The year at TED I did a full of the LHC .
And I promise to go back to how it works .
So here . And so , for the ones that the other time , there was no , the LHC is is the bigger experiment , ever tented -- 27 kilometers of circumference .
His compiece is to required the conditions that were at less than a billion second from the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million a second .
All that &apos;s just environment .
This is the car under Ginevening .
We &apos;re going to pick these mini-Bang in the running .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- it &apos;s 44 feet and has a 22 feet .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in buildition so you can notice the proportions .
The 10 to a dollar year we have access the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was causing immense festeger in control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first particle phask that he had done all over the LHC , walking in collision , and it &apos;s a part of the LHC , and spreading particles in the resilify .
In other words , when we see that image 10 to subject , we found that the car worked , which is that the machine worked , which is a great vitting .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to do more or this , when somebody went on Google and saw that the beginning was this .
That means we &apos;ve had a cultural impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the car , I had to these phils here -- these dored here .
These films are 13,000 lamping when the car works at the main the massive .
Now , the technicians in you will look to the phils and they &apos;ll say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . &quot;
And they can do it because when they &apos;re very cold became the cosid-deal with surroundings .
So , at least 271 degrees , at a hundred , at least at that deleted the stage of the stars , these phils can bring that run .
In one of the young novelt of the novel of the novel in LHC , there was a fect fabrication .
So the philur waste slightly , and the 13,000 ampits improvisous , they met a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magnets fish , and that they &apos;re going to be about 30 feet .
They &apos;re damaged about 50 magnetes .
We had to take them , what we did .
We &apos;ve been repristinted and traveled .
Now they &apos;re coming back all of their subtle place .
By the end of the size of the LHC will be new integrate .
We &apos;ll accenate it , and we expect to get the data or light or light , and we keep our adventure to find out what the morning to find out of the morning .
Now , of course , in a way , these things reaccount , these accidents reaccount the value of science and engineering in the frontier . It &apos;s easy to confuture .
I think that the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that we go beyond the value of things like LHC .
I want to conclude with a words of a Inglese scientist , Humphry Davy , which , imagine , in the unuseful experiments of his pupillo , his bael , his bael was Michael Faray , said , &quot; Not is so dangerous for the progress of human mind that the ideas of science as of human mind that we &apos;re going to be mistery , which we &apos;re not slide , which is not like , and that we &apos;re not going to be able to be told ,
Thank you .
I want to start wondering , when , as children , please , plot clock clock .
While you can understand how to reach them and shine them , take them and die and move them , learned about and they &apos;re going to think and solve problems and they &apos;re going to be able and losing space .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand part of the world around us .
So , from the information , we could have the usual information with physics , together my consulent Patts , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to ask me , &quot; And if we &apos;re going to ask me , &quot; and if we use a computer , as a digital , we could have a fall of the mouse , we could actually rare on a desktop with the hands , we could fall the hands ,
and do it systems to our piacement ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , and built the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a whole thing like a biscale .
In a few words , a Siftable is a whole thing like a biscale .
You can move them with the hand , they can see , &quot; you can see , &quot; you know , &quot; you know , you know , you know , you know , a radio .
But surprising , they &apos;re physical objects , like the morning , you can move them .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem for manipulation .
And as a lot of more physical , knowledge of the movement , of other , and as they become more physical , of the other , how we can explore the other movement , how we can explore new and fun and fun interaction .
I &apos;ll start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show you a video , if you incline in a direction , it will rotate it .
These reactive reversation are consciousness .
If you go back , you know , they &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re .
If they come circumstums , they note and they can act a little bit .
If they come circumstums , they note and they can act a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of interaction was the power to use of the interaction was the power to use of the data , &quot; to &quot; a color like like a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable , like a century of the vernice and I can use them to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able .
And I can use them to be able to be able to be able , where they miss .
We can see it too , we can put a little place .
I also think it &apos;s beautiful possibilities , like the languages , the math and games of logic , where people can try to try things fast , and see the results of it , and see the immediately .
Now , I &apos;m --
This is a sequence of Fibonaces I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a game of words that is in the words that is in Scarabeo and Boble .
Pratically , you know , you get a letter to any Siftable on every Siftable , to every Siftable on every Siftable on every Siftable on , and while certainly , and while he &apos;s control on a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds , they remissing , and you have a new letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
And here &apos;s children came up to the Media Lab , I did that they try and turned a video .
They &apos;re very hyped .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people many education .
You &apos;ve got to say , &quot; Look of words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s other people who try it .
This is our young bigger , there on the right .
He actually wanted to implane them .
They were just in the morning .
Now , this is an application of a interactive carton .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of Lui &apos;s languages is Felix .
It can put new characters in the scenes , sunclear the Siftable .
It can put new characters in the scenes , sunclear the Siftable .
So , that &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : The sun is surprising .
David Merrill : Now he took a treater in the scenes .
Video : The arange treater .
Books !
So school Siftable and put them close to the personally ,
Video : Bau !
and inventing your story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a story with opened , and it can decide him as it turns out .
DM : It &apos;s a story with opened , and it can decide him as it turns out .
Video : Vold , gets .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , realized of recently , to wait and exeguess .
it &apos;s a tool , realized by recently , to wait and exeguess .
The Siftable here are aging sound like basis , basically and the bacteria .
Every one of these has four different variations , and you can choose what it is to use .
You can also put these sound sound in a sequence of behavior .
And you can just touch it just to touch a sound . &quot;
These are effects that you can control from the vive , like the reverse and the filter .
The acks to a particular sound and then clins to get it .
And then there are the general effects as time and volume , which they &apos;re going to be able to interested seence .
Let &apos;s look like that .
Video : We &apos;re going to start putting a base in two Siftable . &quot; We &apos;re sequence , we &apos;re going to put it in a series , we add other base .
Now I put a basically basically .
Video : Now , I add of percussions --
Video : And I &apos;ll put the battery to the bacteria , so I can control the effect of the battery .
Video : I can run the whole sequence on a side of the whole sequence , and then you know ,
Video : And I &apos;m going to add the bottom to the basis to give more expression .
Video : I can realize the sequence . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to placing it before , but I can try to make it longer or the flower .
And now , finally , I can make the whole sequence , inating the Siftable to the Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new man &apos;s built new man and more like our brain and more like our brain and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the results of this lost , and even some possibilities that we try to get out of the lab .
The concept that I want to transmit is that it &apos;s coming to this new generation of designed objects to interact with digital media , that will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time to talk to all of you .
I &apos;m a written .
Boy books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also the love and the fascinating my life .
And I don &apos;t expect what it can change .
But , said , something particular happened in my life and my career , and in my career , who took me to realibring me the entire relationship with this work .
The particular thing is I recently wrote this book , this book called &quot; Manager , Prua , Arather , Ama , &quot; which , different , for some reason I &apos;m going to be a big , for some reason that we were in the world and become a great , sensitive , a whole sense ,
And the result is that everywhere go now , people treating me as if I were condaned .
Davish -- condanned , condanned !
They &apos;re all going to be worried and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t fear to be able to do it ?
You don &apos;t have a fear to continue to write for all life without being able to create a book that can important ? &quot;
What can you care ? &quot;
It &apos;s rassurant , you know .
But it could go worse , at the part of that I think more than 20 years ago , when I was a adolescent -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a written .
I &apos;m going to met the same reaction .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you feel that you can &apos;t get succeed ?
You don &apos;t fear that the umiliation of the refulfer ?
You don &apos;t fear to be able to do this all life without nothing that you ever come out and die on a cumulo of every infranker with the mouth of the bought full of fallimbing ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I have a couple of all those things .
I &apos;ve always had a fear .
And I have a lot of other things that people can &apos;t inate .
As the algae and other things .
But , as it is , I would write what I thought and I was saying , and I was saying , because ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logic that anyone who has been waiting to be spavented by a job that you feel like .
But what &apos;s so particular in the creative creative creative creative to make us nervous health of mental health .
How my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don &apos;t remember one once in its 40 years of activity where he was asked if he was asked if he had a fear ?
There was never -- that -- that block of the engineer John , how does it ?
Don &apos;t work that , you know ?
Only , chemicals like group have not certainly , in the centuries , dged the reputation of being alcolized holized manization .
We have a writers , we have enough this reputation , and not just writers , but we have this reputation of being enormous instable .
And it &apos;s not going to look at the trists of dead morts of the morts of the magnifies that , only in the 21st century , died young people , died young people , died young people and often to them .
And the ones that don &apos;t have suicidated to be really disgued by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before we die , in the last interview said , &quot; Every book has killed me a little bit more . &quot; A extraordinary business about work .
But we don &apos;t bad bat the child when we heard these things so long that we &apos;ve been interior interior , and accepted and accepted the notion that we have all interested in some ways of the creativity and the art , it will always conduce it .
And the question I want to take all of the time is : Did you agree with this idea ?
That &apos;s good , because it looks like this . It &apos;s going to be good for anything .
I think it &apos;s odiosa .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous and I don &apos;t want to see the perpetuate in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better encourage our large creative ,
And I know , of course , I know , in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to begin to get that heard of host , and I was a host of the circumstances in my career .
That &apos;s true -- look , I &apos;m rather young , I have about 40 years .
I have still about four decades work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything write on the world , then it will be judged by the world as I work after the last book .
I &apos;m going to be slump , because we &apos;re all the bigger here -- is likely my bigger .
Oh , Gesus , which thought !
You know , that &apos;s the kind of thinking that it takes a person beginning to broke up the nine of the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would keep going to keep this work we love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it looks like , after a lot of reflection , that the way to work to continue to write is what we can create a protective construct , okay ?
I have to find a safety of security between me , which I &apos;m write , and my natural anxy on what reaction is about reaction that I was going to get up and , as I was trying to do it , and we &apos;re looking through through the time , trying to find other societies to see if they could have the best ideas and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more sane ideor and more and more and more and more and more and more and more sane than healthy and more and
how to help people create creative to help the emotional inerent risks of creativity .
And that research has led me to the Grex and ancient Rome .
I &apos;ll be driving me because I play in a circle and then back .
In the ancient Grex and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t look at creativity to be creativity from men , OK ?
And it was thinking that creativity was this spirit of divine and become a few people from a slightly swine and known , for distant reasons and known , for the distant and known .
The greatest called these vinins of creativity , &quot; demons .
Sooowonderful , it was created a demone that elargive wisdom wisdom .
Romans were the same idea , but they called that kind of spirit .
which is great , because Romans didn &apos;t really think a genius was someone particularly smart .
And they would have a genius was this kind of divine that you could have literally lived in the walls of the studio , a little bit like the elphoo , and that came out of the Dobby , and that came out to the work of the artist and model the work of the artist and model the work .
So here &apos;s eye -- that &apos;s the distance of what I talk about -- that psychological construct you that protect from your work .
And everybody knew that it was so it worked , right ?
So , the anticises were protected by some things , like the narcism , like the narcism , right ?
If your work was except that you couldn &apos;t take it all the market , all of the market , all knew that you were helped by this geniiiius .
If your fallies , it wasn &apos;t all all of your , it was ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be an inable .
And so people have a creativity in the West West for a long time .
And then the Renasy came and all changed , and nacive this great idea ; we put it up to the center of the universe of the universe and not leaving space to the creatures and no longer space to creatures that they write detail from divinity .
This was the principle of rational humanity and people began to think that creativity was completely from the ididate .
And for the first time in history , he started to reference this or the artist as a genius , like a rather than a person with the genius .
And I have to say , I think it was a big error .
I think that allow somebody , a simple person to believe that it &apos;s like a source , the essence and the surprising of all mysteries , creative , unknown and the source is a lot of a lot of driving , a lot of driving , you know , a little bit of human .
It &apos;s like to ask somebody watching the sun .
Death and fully the ego and creates all of these expectations expectations .
And I think it was this pression to destroy the artists in the past 500 years .
And , if that &apos;s true , and I think it &apos;s , and now that &apos;s the question is , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe to go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between human and mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t sing 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience that they would have a named scientific scientific scientific , income , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to be successful or their projects .
I &apos;ll not convinced you all about this .
But the question I want to ask is -- why not ?
Why not think that way ?
Because it has more sense of everything that I &apos;ve ever heard to explain the predicbility of the process of creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever ever ever tented to do something -- so , it &apos;s basically , everyone here -- knows , you don &apos;t know rationally .
And in fact , it can be sometimes look completely paranormal .
I did this met recently , with the extraordinary poetry Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but it was a few of poetry for the whole life and said that during his childhood in the Virginia , and he was going to hear it , and he heard , in if a poetry to the walk from the landscape .
He said that it was like a train of air .
And that was rolating to her landscape .
And he heard it was going to be , because he was going to be under the land under the land under the land .
He knew to have one thing to do at that point and it was , words , words , &quot; running like a math . &quot;
And so it was recorded up to the home and he was going to get a little bit , and it would not have to take a piece of card and a faster faster , while the transplator , while the translate and rate it on the page .
And sometimes not could be able to be fast , so it was returned and run and rreturing and run reverse and rolate and the poetry and rolate through and lost and it would continued to rolate through the landscape , trying to do it . &quot;
And then there were times -- this piece I &apos;ll never forget to -- there were the moments where they were almost losing , right ?
So , he was running home and was trying to card and the poetry and the past through , and he was going to be a city just in the way that he was going to be spending , and then he said , that it was like the other hand and the offered .
He was going to cause the poetry and put it in his body and he put it in his body and he was going to page .
And in these cases , the poetry was presented on the perfect page and intouched , but the last word on the last word .
So when I heard it -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly exactly the same .
not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conducture .
I &apos;m a mulo , and my way to work is ; I &apos;m going to wake up to the same horarian every day and work and go up and work and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up .
But I even , in my testardagges , I &apos;ve been strisciated against that thing , sometimes .
And I think that a lot of you did .
You know , even if the work and ideas they were given me , you know , I could not be slightly known it .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relationship to it , we don &apos;t lose the head , but , rather , which do you get to healthy ?
And as much as it is , the best contemporary example that I have is Musician , which I have a different journal years ago for a nal day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life was the incarnation of the artist &apos;s incarnation of the artist , trying to control , to draw , to dominate these species of totally interized impulses .
But then he came up , and he was driving on a day , and a day , while he was driving in Los Angeles , changed everything .
He was going to be fast and all of a sent tract , this little sent , and it &apos;s wonderful , which is it comes into his head like , and the literate , and the empty , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the needs , and the basic , and it &apos;s not known how to take it .
It has no card piece of card , it has no climbing .
So , so he starts to hear this species of anxiety to grow in him , &quot; I &apos;m losing to lose , and I &apos;ll remark obsessed from this personal song .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of go to the bread , he stopped .
He &apos;ll must be the whole process and did something completely new .
And he just watching the sky and said , &quot; Scause , I &apos;m not seeing ? &quot;
&quot; It looks like that write a song ?
If you really want to be , you get back to a more time when I can take care of you .
Although , you go to important something else today .
You know , Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his work worked changed after this .
Not the work , it was still hoscure as always .
But the process , and the anxy anxy that attack it was reefed when the geniiiiium , the geniiiius that was going to return it back to the way back to the way back , and he was going to realize that it didn &apos;t have to be a interior and returned .
but it was a peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration a conversation between Tom and this strange thing that was not Tom .
So , how much you feel that story , even the way I was working , and he save me once .
This idea , this idea , he saved me when I was writing , &quot; Am , and fall in one of those cave of disperation in one cave of the desperation where we all have when we &apos;re working on something and we can &apos;t start thinking that it will be a disaster , which is going to be a disaster , which is going to be a disaster , which is going to be a disaster .
not just good , the book , the book written .
And I started to think about that project .
But then I remember to the air and I tried to the air and I tried .
So I went up to my face and I got my face and I would give my comments to a vacuum corner of the room .
And I said , &quot; You know , you know , both , what both is , you know that if this book is not going to be shbrilliant not interested in my , right ?
Because as I &apos;m seeing us all I &apos;ve got , I have no more than that .
So if you want to be better , you have to presented you and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , you don &apos;t do me .
I &apos;m going to writing the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I want to favor that was recorded that I &apos;ve been presented to do my part of &quot; because , at the end is so , OK -- in the deserts of the North Africa , the people were wondering to the wonder of the wonderful and hours that they were going to have to be hours and hours .
And they were always magnific , because the balleres were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every long time , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists had become actually transcendent .
And I know you know what I talk , because I know you &apos;ve all seen it , at a point , a performance like this .
It was like the time you stop , and the balleres , and the balleres through a kind of landing and not were doing anything . And it was not doing anything .
And I know , suddenly not appeared as .
But it turns out from the divinside and the illumined in the divinity .
And when this was going to be successful , people had what it was , they were known , they were called him .
They were congent the hands and started cancer , &quot; Allah , God , Allah , God , Allah , God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
He was a historical night -- when the Ments invasero the Spain , they took this habitude with them and pronounded changed in the centuries of &quot; Allah , Allah , &quot; in &quot; Allah , &quot; in &quot; Ole , &quot; to &quot; &quot; Ole , &quot; to , &quot;
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , worker , broken , good , I think , good , good , I can understand , etc , etc -- a scorce of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes the day , the day , to the same , when you wake up and you see that are the 11 of Martedday , and I &apos;m the 11 of Martedday , and I don &apos;t have any more .
It &apos;s just a dead dead dead with a bad bad to ginocy , and maybe never able to get to the height .
And maybe nobody &apos;s named God , while I journey , and what it has to do with his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most sweet recognizing to make life .
But maybe not to be so angled if you can &apos;t believe , anzyutt , which is anzyutt , which is the most expected expected in you .
But it just created that you have data on a source of this source inimaginable .
And , you know , if we think that way that all changes .
And so I started to think it , and it &apos;s sure as I thought about for different months in the work of the book that I &apos;m going to go on , the dangerous , I &apos;m going to be able , I &apos;ve been followed by my graduate success .
And what I have to continue to say when I fear electrized from this is , not going to be fear .
Don &apos;t travel . It &apos;s just your work .
And it &apos;s going to show you for your part , whatever you can be .
If your work is ball , ball .
If the wine , aburd you assigned decide to leave some kind of wonderful wonderful , for a moment through your efforts , and then , &quot; then ! &quot;
Altracks , you have the same dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot;
I think , and I think it &apos;s got to teach it .
&quot; to you . &quot; In the same , even for you had love and test , and test tal tape and test tal tape to be able .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
You know , you already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what it can mean and the discovery of new genes .
Now we &apos;re starting a new ratic , we started digitizing biology and now talks to the digital code , we &apos;re moving into a new biology , designing and synthesizing and synthesizing life .
We always tried to get large questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; is something that many biologists , I think they &apos;re trying to understand various livels .
We tried different approaches , reducing it to the minimes .
We &apos;re digitizens from almost 20 years .
When we sequencing the human genome treatment was going to be treated by the world &apos;s digital world of the computer world &apos;s digital world .
Now , we can regenerate life , or create life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smaller genome , which is the species of the smaller genome .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a genoma in the way to create a smaller .
We &apos;re able to eliminate a hundred genes about 500 of genes that are here .
But when we give a look at his metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple respect to our .
This is easy , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this can bring a living cell .
So , we decided that the only way to design was to synthesize this chromosoma way that we could modify components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of the &quot; Pan &quot; to synthesize ? &quot;
Can chemical chemical to make these big molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create before ?
And , in case , we can make a comosome craft ?
A chromosome is just a chemical piece of chemical material .
The speed with that we can fly digitize life is growing up to the life is growing up to the exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , rather lently , but it &apos;s better better .
And our most recent retained the latest tached .
We &apos;ve started more than 15 years ago .
The process has required many pass , beginning with a bioethical review of the first experiments .
But we found out that we &apos;ve discovered that DNA is very difficult .
There are deces of thousands of machines in the world that make small segments of DNA , the longer of 30 to 50 letters and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the most herrors .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments and runs the errors .
And that was our first attempt , to talk about digital information of Phi &apos;s genome of Phi 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills .
We designed the fragments , actually the correction of the errors and get a molecule of DNA of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is , when we took this piece of chemical chemical material and we &apos;ve put it in the bacteria , the bacteria , the bacteria , and they started to read this genetic and producing the viral particles .
The viral particles are then you stand back and they &apos;re going back and they &apos;ve been destroy and they &apos;ve destroy the E.
I &apos;ve talked about recently members of the oil industry , and they &apos;re saying them that they have certainly compress this model .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build his hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the bigger things .
We wanted to build the whole cromosome of the bacteria .
They &apos;re over 580 myths of genetic code .
So we &apos;ve been thinking about buildings that the size of the virus of the virus , so we could change the casses that are components of a living cell .
The program is crucial , and if we start with digital information , they must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accurateful standard was a mile for every 10 mile .
We found found out , 30 errors . If we used that we used that original seence . If we used that original sequence , we would never be able to do it work .
One part of the process is designing is designing in 50 letters that they &apos;re going to get a little bit of 50 letters to build switching subtle .
We &apos;re going to see unique elements here .
You probably have read that we read that we &apos;re going to take a crab .
So , we have a genetic code based on four letters : A , C , C , C , Good and T.
Three of those letters together , about 20 amminoacids , and there &apos;s a specific order to every ammine for every love .
So we can use genetic code to write words , frasuit , sentences .
What we &apos;ve been doing is autographs to do it .
Some of the fact that it wasn &apos;t a poetry .
We designed these segments to simply held them just together with enzymes .
There are enzymes that they repect them and put them up .
And we started to assembling parts , beginning with seven five to seven multimately seven mile , unclear them in a way to form segments in a switching a letters to come to 72 mile .
We have produced these segments in abundance so we could segments that we &apos;re trying to sequency them , and we &apos;re trying to create a very robbbrobbbing .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this looks like a basic play-basket .
When we get to these very long segment segment , more than 100 midle , more than 100 midle , they will not grow more directly in E.
You get to the limit of the modern modern biology .
So we &apos;ve been considered other mechanisms .
We knew we knew we called a homologist called a homologist , which in biology is use to repect DNA able to get the segments .
Here &apos;s an example .
This is organism , called Deinocror Deinoccurs , can make three million rad rad .
You can see in the superior as a cycle of the cromoss of destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it was reassembled exactly like it was before .
There &apos;s thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be completely .
They can live under a vacuum .
They &apos;re absolutely sure life in space , and you can find new environment .
On the real , NASA shown that this happens .
This is a picture of the molecule we &apos;ve built these processed , just using the free segment with the appropriate design of the appropriate segment .
The free to the automatically .
This picture was not taken with a electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a task molecule that we can see it with a law .
These are pictures that they cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the published we &apos;ve done a little time ago .
They &apos;re over 580,000 genetic code .
It &apos;s the bigger molecule of a definitely defined by man .
It has a molecular molecular sent to 300 million .
If we &apos;re standing it with a career .
Now , how do we work ?
Of course , you know , you know , a virus is a game from kids .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria .
It &apos;s simpler even when it &apos;s euggs of euugote cells like our : you can just extract it .
In the bacteria , the archaea is integrated integrated integrated in the cell , but we &apos;ve recently demonstrated that we &apos;re able to do a complete traph of a cell of a cell on another and activate it .
We &apos;ve got a crobial chromosome from a microbial species .
The two are different than men from the topes .
We &apos;ve added some genes in a way that we could decide that choose for this croma .
And then it &apos;s science with the ency way to kill all proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was study -- and you &apos;ll openized our sofopen-histicatol -- the new cromosses .
And we were beginning to be able to go , but we &apos;ve tried to be more spushed .
This is one of the major mechanisms .
We found out that many species have added a second or a second or a third or a third or a second thousands of new , adding in a second thousand , and that species .
So who think about evolution as a gene at the time that modified has not understand a lot of biology .
There &apos;s a scientist of the restriition of the restriition that addiction that they say digerism .
The chromosome that was in the cell of it .
The cell phone is the cell phone that we &apos;ve inseritous .
And it was expressed , and he recognized the other croms like extraneous material , and we found it with only the cell and the new cell .
it &apos;s become blue because of the genes we &apos;ve insert .
And in a short lelass of time , all the characteristics of a species have lost , and it turned to the new software that we &apos;ve inserted in the cell .
All the proteins changed , membrane are changed , and when we read the genetic code balance code on what we &apos;ve turned you .
Now , this might look genetic alchemy , but altering the software DNA we can change things in a way .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that here is not talking about this genesius -- but we &apos;re designing to start to be a new version of evolution , and I &apos;ve already said that maybe we &apos;re going to create new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty obvious when we think about our needs .
We &apos;re going to get six billion people to the six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to give you an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one in 1946 ; in 46 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re going to have problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medicinal and a half a half of people .
It &apos;s going to be more dare doing it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion basic barrassing .
That means a millions of barrassing a day .
When we try to figure out biological processes , or any kind of process to replaced them , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to hold about the whole emission of CO2 from these materials that end in the atmosphere .
In the day , of the scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that they are the designed for the future .
The electronics is only a dozen , about components , and think about how many different things come out .
Our limits here are mainly biological data and our imagination .
Now we have a techniques , because of these synthesization , able to create what we call genomic genomic genomic genomic genomic genomic .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can make a million comes that can make a million comes a day .
Think about this 20 million different genes or try or try to get to optimize the processes to make it optimize or drugs , we can change , we can change , we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology , and we can create more molecular biology that in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for possibility of survival , or carburn , chemical , production or carburn , production vaccines .
This is a few satifying instantly programmed on which we &apos;re working for being able to be able to set us and design species to computers .
Well , we don &apos;t know what they &apos;re going to be .
We know exactly what they &apos;re genetic code .
Now we &apos;re focus on the carbons of the carbons of generation .
You &apos;ve seen ethanol from the grain was a bad experiment .
We have carbons of second and third generation that will use enough to be a carburants of the higher value as opening or different types .
But the only way that the only way that biology can have a great impact with no increasing food and limiting it the cost of food and limiting the CO2 , the first one , where we &apos;re working to design cell that can reach this , and we think we &apos;re working to design cells that can reach this scope , and we think we could have the first carbons of how we &apos;re working in 18 months .
The solar solar combined with CO2 is a metodownload -- but in our discoveries in the world , we found different metodd .
This is a organism we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , at about 2500 feet of deeply water .
It &apos;s going to be by CO2 using hydrogen by the way .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can incanalate CO2 , which can be easily transported through the toues , conversation that CO2 in carburn , to drive this process .
So , we think we might be able to increasing what the question is what the basis that the basis that the basis that life is . &quot; We have the focus , we have the modest of replacing the oil industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do that TED , where can you do ?
It would be a main the energy .
And also , we &apos;re working to use the same methods to create vaccines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with influence , we &apos;re always back a year and a dollar in less when it &apos;s a dollar .
I think that what you can can change become combinable vaccines in anticipe .
That &apos;s how the future could start to be changing , now , the tree , accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria , and then , you know , archaeuuugariote .
We &apos;re so much like that .
Our purpose is to do enough to try to try to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;ll show you , the most foundly as possible , some fundamental work , in new technology that we &apos;ve got to Microsoft in the followed to a year ago . This is Seadon .
It &apos;s a environment where you can interact with a local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data .
And here we &apos;re seeing a lot of gabyte of digital pictures with a kind of constant digital zoom , I sponally sing images as we want .
And it &apos;s not what big is the amount of information that we see , how large these data or images .
Most of digital photographs , but this is for example , but this is a provenient scanning from the Biliotech of Congress , and reentrepreneur .
It doesn &apos;t do any difference because the only thing that it &apos;s the only thing that it &apos;s the number of a system like this is the number of full on your screen . It &apos;s also a very flexible architecture .
This is a whole book , you don &apos;t images .
This is Dickens . Every hard collapse . Every colonnaked .
And to show you that it &apos;s about the textbasic and not images , we can do something like this , to see it really is a real representation of the textbasic , not a picture .
It could be a little bit artificial to read a electronic book .
You don &apos;t recommend that .
This is a more realistic example . This is a number of the Guardian .
Every big image is the beginning of a seition .
And it really gives you the pleasure of reading the paper version of a revision of a journey or a journey or a junky of a junky .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the Guardian .
We &apos;ve created a fasull fasull solutions -- much higher than what it is usually in a publisher -- and we &apos;ve inserted you to the extra contained .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific technical specific .
And that really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that this means to put the pop-up and other door and other nurture , they should not be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this thing , I don &apos;t want to lose time , if we don &apos;t know that we have contributes to this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. .
So , we &apos;re going to go to what else .
This is actually , from the web . You can go to the web ; you can see it .
This is a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
A is Seadragging and the other is a very interesting computer research in the very interesting computer .
And it &apos;s from the web , drive Seady .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can spend a picture of image , and have this kind of experience to the other and have this kind of experience .
But the space collocation of the images here has actually a meaning .
And the algoritms of the computer visualization have recorded these imaging together , so that they share with recorresponding to the record to the record to the glames -- all the closed bed to the Montne Roccious , you &apos;re scacross . And then you see the elements of a slides of a slides of a slide-like slides , and these things are all the free .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some much more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data set of Noahahoahoahoahotosynth prototype that we &apos;ve done in the first time , we &apos;ve done the first time , the summer summer , we &apos;ve been doing this technology , the first time , we &apos;ve got to put in the website . And it &apos;s not necessarily hynth . And it &apos;s necessarily not necessarily hynth .
We had to worry about the legal and so on .
This is a rebuilt rebuilt of Nothers . Dothers Flickr . Bastian Digitate Nothers and you get images of typically and you images of types and so on . Each of these arants and so on . Each of these arancies a picture that &apos;s discovered a picture that &apos;s discovered .
So I &apos;m all images Flickr and you &apos;ve been all recorded to space .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this simple way .
You know , I would never think about finish working for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifffy to get this kind of account here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of focus , from those of the phone : from those professional cellphone to those professional cellphysical .
And if I can , I try to try to the more strange .
Many of you block , etc .
Some of some part here is a series of photographs -- etc .
This is a Nothers , Drecorded correctly .
We can go from the poster to the view of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with the environment . This is taking data from a collective memory of how to apply the land , from the collective point of view -- and it collective all those data together .
All those pictures become connected , greater than the parts .
You have a model of the entire land that emerge .
Think about this as a prolgment of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as you can use people use it , and the advantages for the who uses to use it .
Their pictures are married with metadhert metadures .
If someone comes to the idea of contrassigns , you know , my picture of the Nothers , my picture of Nothers , and I can use as a lot of data , and I can use how to inground , and I can use as a lot of data , and I can use the picture of the choose , and I can get a social experience of the class of the cycle of the kind of cycys-like chosys-moil .
Of course , a consequence of all that are virtual model of all interesting model in the earth , you know , there &apos;s not just just just as a vists and images and satellitaries and images , but from collective memory .
Thank you very much .
CA : I understand ? What your software ? What your software is going to be doing is that at some point , in the next years , all the photographs shared by anyone in the world will be reading .
BA : Yes . What &apos;s doing is basically , it &apos;s discovered .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , among images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the containing the content of images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of simantic information that many of these images .
As when you do a research of images on the web , you get a sentence and the heb on the web , it &apos;s a lot of information about the picture .
Now , what if that picture is going on to all your picture ?
So , the amount of the amount of simantity and the amount of the wealth of the wealth of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really amazing .
BA : I thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure when you travel and one of the ethnographical research is the power to live in the wind , the touching , in the wind , the driver in the wind , the touch , the touching in the floating of the flows .
Bastes think that Jaguar , they &apos;re still going to be the Lattea , or that the Mths of the Inuit , or the Inuit &apos;s still connected to meaning , or Himalaya , or Himalaya , to remember the central central of the Dharm , to remember the central central of the anthropy of the anthropy of the anthropy , but it &apos;s just a model , but it &apos;s just a model , but it &apos;s just a model ,
the consequence of a particular set of a adaptive choices that our stirs made , well or a bad bad , well or a bad maker .
And of course , we all share about the essential .
All right . We all do . We all do .
We &apos;re subjects in the beginning .
We have to death the inexorability of death , so it doesn &apos;t surprises if we &apos;re standing and --
We all have a art .
What it &apos;s the car is particular is the particular rhythm , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that they &apos;re the Penan forests of the Borneo , or the followed of Haiti , or the Haiti , or the Kaisut , or the Kenya , the Curander-sing , or a cameler in the Sahara .
He was my journey was my journey in the desert a month ago , or a hallevent in the values of the Everest , on the Everest , the mother of the world .
All of these populations teaching us that there are other ways to think , other ways of thinking , other ways to move in the world .
And , if you reflection , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
And we put it in the culture of the world are a running of spiritual life and cultural life that it tural life that it &apos;s important for the planet as a biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural girl as a cultural nosphere and you can call the ethnosphere , dreams , dreams , hyths , ideas , inspirations , inspirations , inspirations , and inspirations , and you can be from the alalready stuff .
The ethnosphere is the fantastic patric of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how quisitive .
And because the biosphere was graveased by the way , that &apos;s been successful at eed ethnosphere and much much quidly .
Nobody , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species was about the extinction of all species was on the extinction of simply , or in the higher hypothesis in the most opening of biological diversity -- and you don &apos;t have even near even even have a little bit of hystic diversity .
The inindice of all that is , of course , the language .
When you have been born there 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not only a vocabulary or a series of rulnammers .
A language is the bake of human spirit .
It &apos;s the medium with the animation of every culture of every culture is the material world .
Every language is a forest , a strong bly , a bind , a thought , a spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re sitting in Monterey , at least half the history of children .
They don &apos;t come to teach kids , which means , unless they &apos;re dead .
What &apos;s more sad of being flifvolved from the silence , to be the last to talk a language , of the last one language , not have a way to be the wisdom of the wisdom of the children ?
This is getting up with someone in the world , any two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks , a banker and it brings to it up in the tomba .
And I know somebody who will say , &quot; It &apos;s not that ?
The world would not be a better place if we all talk about the same language ? &quot;
We talk to kogi .
You &apos;ll be a tract of a tract thing to be able to talk .
I &apos;d like to do you have a journey through the ethnosphere --
a little journey in the ethnosphere to give you a lot of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us of us forged that when I say , &quot; different ways of existing existing .
We take for example this Barasana Barasana , in Amazon , the population of anaconda , which makes the headmixed to try to try to try to be sacred from the latte of sacred sacred .
It &apos;s a population that &apos;s not able to distinguish the blue color blues because the blue is identified in the forest , where it depends the population .
They have a strange language and a major rules , &quot; linguistic , &quot; linguistic language , &quot; you have to put a person who talk about a different language .
All that has radical past , the particularity is that in the mythological family is that in these exists , in the summit in the summon the mysts of mysts .
They &apos;re going to listen and then they start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribe with which I &apos;ve lived , the Waorani of Eastador , an amazing population , a incredible population that has had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 five means , they &apos;ve been trying to be a construct .
They &apos;ve got to get out of the photographs that they were in pose pose to have , forested that this population forest , forests that this population forests , they never saw anything .
They &apos;ve got the picture from the land , they turn them to the research of a form or a shape or a shape and , they have concled that they were treated on dioil , and they killed the five missionaries with the lance .
But the Waorans not only killing the straniests .
They were killing to them .
54 percent of mortality was caused by them .
We &apos;ve got up to eight generations and we found two of natural death , and when we &apos;ve insisted to know , they have to know , they &apos;ve been invected , so that one of them was invecting , and then they killed it . And then they had a whole thing .
The crash was able to recognize the animal urina from 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned a very interesting job when my Harvard professor , I wanted to go to Haiti to intrucccity in the bottom of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the fast to use to the fast the fast of the fast I use to use to do the fast snaked up to the fast of the fast and the Tonton the bottom of the Some of the Shimpose of the Rean
And I would have to understand a sense of the Vookey culture Cture culture , and that the Voodoo culture .
It &apos;s pretty much a complex medical vision of the world .
Many interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the big religions of the world , what you would say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has no religious feelings . And he said , and the Voodoo is not other than the distilled of these tragic concepts of these tragic concepts of the slavery of slavism .
What makes the voot is the intense report is the intense report between life and death .
So the vive are going to be nurture .
And the spirits can be invoyed by Great Aca , they respond to the right of the dance and replaced temporary to the anima short of the vive in a short , which is the followed .
So , this voodooists love to say , &quot; You can go to wait .
We give in the temple and become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re playing , is the spirit you , how you can do you do the bad of the bad ?
So , you know , these amazing events : the voodoo in the state of trance , that touches touch a rather straight of the power of mind on the body in the body state of the power of mind , when it &apos;s catalyzed s-down .
I &apos;ve all the people with which I lived the most extraordinary people who lived the most extraordinary Santa Marta , in Santa Marta , in Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta ,
It makes it until ancivilization that once they were on the carairs of the Colombia , the population of the conquist , the population was going to be on the vulcanic .
In a continent continent of blood , this population has never been conquered by spagners .
And so , I &apos;m government today , they &apos;re government , but their formation is really extraordinary .
The young people followed away from the families to three or four years , and they live secret in a world , and they live in a world , and bombs in the bathers for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years of proposed to reproducing the nine months of gestation that transnation in the user of the mother , now are metaphor in the Great Mther . .
So that time , they get acculate to the values of their societies , values that they predict that their pregns and only their prayers to the cosmic balance -- or for the cosmic balance .
At the term of this amazing beginning , they come improvising up and the first time , 18 years , they see a high . And in that acties , they see a high . And in that acties the bad basic , when the sun butters the values of the landscape . The preciate is a bunch and says , &quot; The pret a steal . And it says , the pret a steal .
&quot; I mean ? Proprium , I said .
It &apos;s study . Now , it &apos;s going to protect it .
They call the major frush and say that we , fraid it .
This is intuition is extremely important .
When we think about Indigene and the environment , we call Reu and the old story of the old story of the old nice , which is a razy concept in his simplicity or maybe we call Thoreau and say that these people are close to the Earth of us .
The advice population is not indebolites from the nor .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the Astake or the car of the Astat or gelids , but because of time and the time and the rhyths , they created a mystic of the Earth is not about the concept of the Earth is not about the concept of the Earth can only be consciousness because it &apos;s infusences from the human consciousness .
What does it mean ?
It means that a little kid of the Ande grows that grows in the mountain is a tune Apu that will be a human behavior , it will be a foundly different and it will have a foundly different with the mountain or that a mountain or that a mountain , and it will have a mountain .
which is the dimall of a spirit or a mineral cool is irrelevant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that it &apos;s interesting is the metaphor of the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Columbia creating forests to be cut .
That &apos;s a human beritical human , Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the Hukuk dimour of Hukuk dimour dimour of the paradise and the paradise of the paradise and the cannership of the world , the Hamatory began to Hamatbak .
If you start considering that these cultures can actually actually make a different different realities , you can start to understand some of them , you can start to understand some of them .
I took this picture to open the norocknorrow .
Mayahuknee about the easuk , the most powerful suscity of the repertory of the repertory .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuknee is not the potential drug of substance , but it &apos;s two elements . It &apos;s got two elements .
From a side , this lian leages that contains a series of hu-carbon , harmine and harmine , slightly hallucinogens .
And it turns out the sun plan has a blueaser that alters a little bit of the conscience , but it &apos;s mixed with the class of the family of the caffas the caffas a visual business .
This is a contains powerful triptamines , very similar to serotonin , dimethoxyltryltryptamines .
If you ever see the Yanomami to the nose the susance that they do from a different set of species , anched methoxyltrical species , which is a methoke .
Tiring that polluting on the nose is a little bit like being disappear to a file cardium of the board and landing on a hundred of electricity .
I was often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who took the cheaper was psychedelic , with his discovery of the fungi in the &apos; 30 in the &apos; 30 in the &apos; 30 30 in Mexico .
And I mean my text , you can &apos;t class these triptaminogens like hallucinogens because if you &apos;re not telling any of being kinated .
It &apos;s possible absolutely only if you get other chemical chemical chemical that money in MAO .
Now , it &apos;s the beautiful : the wheels that are inibitors of MAO , the same kind of MAO , the same kind of necessary , the same kind of a flexide . The question is spontaneous . The question of 80,000 species of plants , like these are these two dies , like these are the same , but that if you &apos;re in this way , they create a biochemical version that &apos;s high high .
We use the great euphemism of the provide and error , which can reveal infrution .
But if we ask Indians , they &apos;ll say , &quot; Put us . &quot;
What does it mean ?
This tribe , the Cofan , has 17 varieties of Eastuash , which distinguious necture , and that our eyes would reentring in the same species .
If we ask him how they &apos;re going to say , &quot; I thought , &quot; I thought I was going to tell us , &quot; I thought I was not ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you get 17 variety in a notice of the loth and each one will song with a different tone .
With this is not laurea Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than to contact the press .
Now , &#91; now , &#93; the problem is that the problem is that the ones of us who have to the history of the people who have to the history of the history of the story of the story of our real history of the story of our real history of the story of the story of our real history of the story of the story of the real history of the story about the real history of the story of the story of the story about the history of the story about the world ,
In fact , the century century , in 300 years , it &apos;s not remember for its wars or the technology , but rather how we were stopped and we &apos;ve been hundred and we &apos;ve been abuntil of the masses of diversity and cultural and cultural , the mass of diversity and cultural cultural . Now the problem is not the change .
All of the cultures have been involved in a dance for new possibilities .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians have not stopped to be Six when they put it up and they put it up and full as well as Americans have not stopped to be Americans when they put up up in the horse and hot .
It &apos;s not the change or technology , they minine the integrity of ethnosphere . It &apos;s the power .
And the wall of domination .
And if you give you a look at the world , you &apos;ll find that these are not destinate cultures .
They &apos;re living creatures and dynamics out of the identifiable forces that go over the ability of hyd-adaptation .
And it &apos;s a disbosing tiny , the thinking of the thinking of --
a population of Sarawak , in the Sarawak , a population that lived free free in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to the reserve and the next titude of the figures , where you can see the physical figured out that it looks like to bring away away from the Bornear Mdiot Cinese Mdian , where the naves of the navels of the Japanananananiszonte , where the navel , the navel ,
You know , you know , the stone of the stone of the basic .
Or in the case of Yanomami , are the disease of the gold .
If we move on the mountains of the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the flight of political domination .
You know , you know the genocide , the physics of a population , is condanned to universal level , but the ethnium of life , not only is condanned , but it &apos;s not just condanned , but it &apos;s a bunch of developing toward , because it &apos;s part of developing of development .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of the Tibet until you don &apos;t go from the beginning .
I know the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in the Western China in the Western Tibet , coming in in Lhasa with a young . But only , I &apos;ve been able to Lhasa I &apos;ve got got to be able to Lhasa I &apos;ve got to talk .
6,000 feet sacrates reduces and centers .
1.2 million people killed from the military Rivolution .
The father of this guy was absolutely critish to Panchen Lama .
which means that it &apos;s been killed to the Chinese invasion .
And Suus is the job with Sua Santity in Santity in the deaspores that took the people in Nepal .
His mother was imprisoned and his colpa was to be rich .
It was taken to carefully in the age of two nasking under the age of two nases , because he would not have lived in .
The sister , who did the same , it was put in a result of reeducation .
And one day , he has been saying a raffuring fashion Mao and , for this transgression , was put on the seven years .
The Pain of the Tibet can be insent , but it &apos;s redenter of the population is taken .
And then it turns out , it &apos;s reduces .
We want to live in the world world world &apos;s the mocromatical world or we want to collect the policromatically diversity ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before we die said that her bigger , was that , in our going to this love to this love , we &apos;re not just going to see the whole amone-and-to-running , but a day we &apos;re going to see it from a modality , but a day we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able .
And it &apos;s uilant to remember that our species is existed for 60,000 years .
The Rivolution Neolitics , which has given us the agriculture , which has done us to be conversing to the cult of the seed , and they &apos;re talking about the next few of the shaman of the specialization , and we &apos;re talking about 10,000 years ago .
The industrialized world has been 300 years .
That slightly history , I &apos;m not suggested to all the challenges that we have to do in the millennia to come .
When these cultures of the world is asked what it is to be human , they say , to be human , they say with 10,000 voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all rediscover the possibility of being what we &apos;re : a consciousness , which has to be what we &apos;re . This is a consciousness , which is a lot of time . And there are great moments .
I took this picture on the north of the north island of Baffin , when I went to the hundred of bales with the Inuit , and this man , and this man , and this man , and this man , and he told me the wonn .
The canot government was not always gentile with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to stabilier our company , we &apos;ve got them in colonies .
The non-man that man was refused to go .
The family , themselves for his life , he bred him away all the arms , and all of his tune .
You have to know that Inuit doesn &apos;t feel the cold , they don &apos;t feel .
The origins of slitte , they were made of fish flights .
The non-this man man wouldn &apos;t get to the arctimic note or the blizard or the blizard ,
It &apos;s laid out , it &apos;s calculated the pins in the skin and defecated in the hand . When you do them , they &apos;re congathering them , they work on a mothers .
He was sprurized on the car of this cacca cail and when it was solid , he killed a dog .
He had schools and created a bria , with the Agathering casses , he has created a sleep , and it &apos;s slip a slums , and it &apos;s disappeared on the banchisa , and it &apos;s slide in the shoulder .
We want to talk about hadn cavarseles ?
In the U.K. government , the canadvance of the U.S. the total control of a territory of California and the Texas the Texas I had together .
It &apos;s their new patries . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a independent territory . They &apos;re all the mineraries .
One splendiging example of how a national state can recognize with his population .
And , to finish , I think it &apos;s quite obvious at least who was in these swalking out of the planet , make it remote that they &apos;re not remote .
And someone &apos;s home .
They represented seats of human imagination that they &apos;re rising at the allows . And for us , the dreams of these children , as the dreams of our children , as the dreams of hope .
In the finish , we &apos;re National Geographic , we &apos;re convinced that politicians will never get to anything .
We believe that polemies --
&#91; Applauses &#93; are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and we think that stories can change the world , and we &apos;re the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month . Every month of our site .
156 countries our television canal canal canal canal .
Our revists are slights from millions .
Our work is travel to bring our public audience in the ethnoses of the cultural market from what they saw and hope , they &apos;ll be able to be able to go away from how much they saw and hope , they &apos;ll try to get the central reveal of the anthropology of life in a focus of life in a pluralist and multicultural world in a world of the fun and multicultural world to a lifestyle and multiculate world .
where the wisdom of all the population can contribute to our collective benefit .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things I wrote about this book that I hope refer to the other you &apos;ve heard about and I &apos;ll try to evidentiate some of the connection , in case , in case , not note them .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the official dogm . &quot;
The official dogm of what ?
The official dogm of all of the Western Western Shicial Deatures : &quot; The Really recently : &quot; If we want to male the individual well-being of our citizens . &quot;
The reason is , from a side , in the fact that the freedom is in the fact that the freezing , is precious , useful , for human beings .
At the other is that if we &apos;re free , each of us can act for the other thing that maximizing our benefit , without any one that decided in names our names .
The way to male the freedom is to male is to be massive .
The more choices people have , the more liberty , and most of the liberty , the greatest is their well-being .
This , I think , it &apos;s so deeply radicated in the society that nobody would dream to put it in the society that nobody would have dreams to the way .
And it &apos;s also deeply radicated in our lives .
I &apos;ll show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I put a simple note on the condent condent .
In my supermarket , there are 175 condent , there &apos;s 175 varieties of oil . And the 12 aceyes and the 12 aceysical acethes that you can buy for a huge number of conditional condent , which nobody of the 175 , you already have a huge number of your dediment .
That &apos;s what the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic negotious to buy a stereo : case , CD , radio , radio , radio , radio , radio , plastra .
And in this single negotious , there &apos;s a great number of audio .
We can do six and a half million different combinations using the components that there are in a store .
You need to admit that there &apos;s a lot of choice .
Other the fields : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a kid , they could get all the services of the physical phone , they were short from the mom .
He was born the phone , they didn &apos;t buy it .
One of that , in the other , it was the phone , was the telephone ever .
These are days .
We &apos;ve now have a variety of phones , almost limited phone , especially between the cellular cellular .
Here &apos;s the cellphone of the future .
My favorite is that in the middle , MP3 , cut , cut the nose , and it forno for the easy .
If you don &apos;t see it in the store under the home , you &apos;re certaints that will be going to get it .
And what &apos;s the end is that people come into the needs and it &apos;s this question . And you know what the answer is ? The answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too many things .
So , in other expect life that are much more important than the busters , you know , it &apos;s the same explosion of choices .
Asanitary health care : not going on in the United States that you go from the doctor and doctor doctor , what you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do it , or B , or B , &quot; Ah , &quot; Do you want to do it ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Dr. &quot; What should I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A has these benefits and the risks , and B has these benefits and these risks . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebats , &quot; Dr. I mean , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; I &apos;m not . &quot;
The result we call it &quot; autonomy of malseem , &quot; expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not a lot of fishing the fish and responsibility to make decisions someone who knows something , which is the doctor , at something that you don &apos;t know -- and so it &apos;s not in the ideal condition to make decisions that we &apos;re not in the ideal condition to make decisions .
There &apos;s a huge marketing products , you know , there &apos;s a lot of people like me and you , that if you think there is no sense , because we can &apos;t buy them them them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why are they publiician ?
The answer is that they want to ask it .
Something that is basically how our identity is a choice question , as you see in this jet , like you see in this jet . &quot; We don &apos;t want to provide kids . They &apos;ll choose their switch .
And we can reinvent us how many times we get us .
which means that every morning , to be able , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I &apos;m standing to family and the mathemselves , a time time the common in the family , swalmost for anyone , it was that you could have the most soon as possible , and he was beginning to get the most possible .
The only choice was choice , and not even when , and not even , and not even what to do after .
So , it &apos;s really to play .
I teach in a very smart students , and I do the 20 percent in less than a time .
And not because they &apos;re not not smart , because they &apos;re not not not because they &apos;re less diligent .
Because I &apos;m impensierites , I mean , I mean , &quot; I would like to go to me or not ? &quot;
&quot; I should be able to move ? I have to think about the children or career ? &quot;
They &apos;re logorant .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this implement , not completely the compitites and don &apos;t get a beautiful voice to my exerging .
And they have to do it . They have to do it . They really have to do it .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , like Carl subtineen , because the technology allows us to work every day , every day , from Hotel , and on the planet , tranks from Hotel Randolph .
And it &apos;s parentested , there &apos;s a angle , and I &apos;m not going to say anyone , where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t say that , because I want to use it .
What it means , this amazing freedom we have to do that , we have to continually decide , and we have to be able to be able , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son , we can go to the cell phone in a tank , Blackberry in the other , and the babies , and the book , and the night , on the ginocky .
And even though they &apos;re all spents , every minute that we see our son , we also see our son , we &apos;re also asking , we &apos;re also asking this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? I have to go to this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , &quot; that makes the experience of the partners of your child very different from what it would be in other conditions .
So , from any of the way we look at , small , big materials and large , life is a choices and life , life is a choices .
Once the world was this : Over , there were some possibilities , but it was not a question of choice .
The world today is a non-like this : The dilemma is , &quot; It &apos;s a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Shurt .
The positive labeled them , so I &apos;ll talk about that negative .
This is all the choice , two effects negative effects negative effects on people .
The first , paradoxally , is that it produces instead of it .
And many of it options that choose choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I &apos;m offered you an exposed example : a conduct study conducted on the plans of volunteer .
And a colleagues had access to the data of Vankhead , the giant society of the source of the depletion in 2000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of adesion , the percentage of adesion .
50 funds of offering , there &apos;s 10 percent in the adesions that when I &apos;m available to when they &apos;re available to the car . Why ?
Because with 50 source source , which choose , it &apos;s disease , and it &apos;s choice to decide , and the choice is returned to the indomances .
And domories , and still domorders , domorders , domorders , and of course , domored .
You can &apos;t just mean that these works from the workers will eat food for cans because they don &apos;t have enough money , it means that decision is so obstic that decision is so obstic that they also lose the fundamental fundamental complementary .
Don &apos;t participating , they &apos;re losing to five dollars a year from the work , which would be disposed to be going to be .
So the paralysis a consequence of the choices .
And I think that makes the world like this .
&quot; And finally , for the ethernity : ketched or mayonese ? &quot;
You would like to take the right decision , if it &apos;s for ethernity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and nepurpure the wrong condent condent .
So that &apos;s the first effect . The second is that we can even evoke the paralysis and do a choice , we &apos;re less satisfacts from the result of how we would be with less options .
And that &apos;s a lot of reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of condent , which choose choose , if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could make a different choice that you would be better . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us , and the choice , and the software the choice of choice , and the software the choice , and it &apos;s filled by the decision , and it &apos;s fully the sofy of the decision ,
even when it was a good decision .
More choices there are , more it &apos;s easy displaces that it &apos;s insodenting of choice that it &apos;s insosatisfacing .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call cost .
Dan Gilbert has asleleft very well practices like the value that we have to do things that we see on what we do .
In the rest , when there are a lot of options , it &apos;s easy to represent the characteristics of alternative alternative and be less satisfy of the option that you have choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m a picture . I &apos;m going to be in New York .
But that &apos;s what you probably think you would probably think .
There &apos;s this guy to Hamptons .
A place of light .
It &apos;s splendida . Otym . It &apos;s all for them .
Don &apos;t eat anything . But what he thought is , &quot; Well , malediition , is Agost . &quot;
&quot; All my nearar in Manhattan are away . &quot;
&quot; I could talk about home . &quot;
And it turns out two weeks , from the idea that &apos;s losing -- every day -- every day -- the possibility of parking .
The cost-opportunity is the sod-opportunity for what we have , even when choice was except .
And the most of the options we have to advantage , the most attractive characteristics will come back as a construction .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
And we &apos;re talking about the live time , and maybe the living .
But the most important point is that anything you choose , you &apos;re choose to you , you know , you don &apos;t do other .
The things we don &apos;t choose have a tactive attractive thing that can make less attractive what we do .
Tirl point : it &apos;s growing .
I tried it on my skin bought a new jeans .
I &apos;ll be almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were one guy , compressed and besides , they were dissies , only later they were comfortable , only later they were led a life and washed a lot of time , they began to go right .
So I went to buy a couple , when the old ones were glasses , and I said , &quot; I &apos;m going to be a couple jeans , this is my cutting . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Lave me a slim , fit , relaxy and fit ? &quot;
He wants to the nership or bottons ? &quot; Stonewashed , or &quot; acidwashed ? &quot;
&quot; Who wants to stream ? &quot;
&quot; Sow the basic crows or street ? &quot;
I was balorist , and after a while I was able to say , &quot; I want the guess , &quot; I want the guy that was the only guy who was , so for a hour , I tried to be , so for a best jeans , then I came out of the best , you know , I &apos;ve been used to be used to .
I had the best . I had got the best . I had got the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a book of the book to understand it .
The reason I was worse , I was that with all that choice my expectations were high high , jeans had to be perfect .
I was a very beginning to be minime . I didn &apos;t expect anything when it was only one , but when there was a lot of hundred different , hundred different , high a guy had to be perfect .
What I had busted was good , but not perfect .
And after I was talking about that choose to what I was satisfied in the confront of waitative .
The advantage of options in life , not does that they &apos;re going to expect the eccellence of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the people who have respect to the expect of the people who have respect to the expect
And that will make less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing if you make it .
Because if they knew what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is the most much of this .
&quot; It was better when you were worse , &quot; The reason why he was better when you were worse when you were worse , you know , when it was worse , you could still meet .
The world we live -- opulent , the world , we live , opulent industrialized , citizens with the perfection -- the male that we can hope is that things are the things to the height .
You never have surprised places because your expectations , the expectations , you &apos;re ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Well , you want to be waiting , you want to be . &quot;
I mean , small autobiographic time -- which I &apos;m really moving and my wife is really good .
I couldn &apos;t have to do better , I &apos;m not going to be able .
But it &apos;s not always a good thing .
And then , a consequence of buy a couple jeans slide when there &apos;s just that when there &apos;s just that when you &apos;re not satisfacts , and you say , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot; And it &apos;s clear .
The world is responsible . What can I do you ?
When there are hundreds of types , and you buy a insodenting insodenting , and you ask you who is the responsible responsible , is otherwise you .
You &apos;d be able to do better .
With hundreds of varieties , there &apos;s no discussing .
So when people do decisions , even though the result is valid , they feel inexpected and give the colpage to them .
In the last few years , the depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a meaning fatter -- not the only one , but the important one of depression is that people have experiences of depressed is that people have experiences of the standard of the standard .
And when they need to explain this situation think that the colpocket is them .
So the final result is that we &apos;re better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogm , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely false . It &apos;s not truly .
There &apos;s no doubt a little bit of choice is better than it has not been there , but it &apos;s not going to be a lot of choice , but it &apos;s not a lot of a little bit .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m pretty sure we &apos;ve been surrounded by a piece where the choices are better .
Now , from the political point -- I &apos;ve almost up -- I &apos;ve almost up -- from the political point , the nocle is the following .
What you &apos;re allows this choice in industrial societies is the material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too much pocket .
So the facility of modern I &apos;m talking about is a disease of modern , recidesclusive societies .
And what it makes it to be , and it &apos;s this : Steve Levitt talked about how much you know how much those costs and suseful seats of bes .
I mean that these choose , complicated and dispendent , it &apos;s not just useful .
They &apos;re constantly deleteries .
They &apos;re going to stay worse .
If a little bit of what in our societies allows , it &apos;s been revered in those where people have too much much of the people have too much better , not just their life to be better , but our life .
This is what economists call a paretian ,
A reduction of reduction is good at all -- not only the poor -- not just the poor -- because of this choice .
So , to conclude , you can become anything you want to be --
You , people of culture , you think , &quot; What does that believe that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious you can &apos;t get it in a glass . &quot;
&quot; An inside the castrated , a limited vision of the world --
and I &apos;ve interpret that , at the beginning .
But then , I think , instead , I realized that that fish the long knows the long .
Because the reality of the fact of the fact of the broke , so that you can &apos;t be able . &quot; You can &apos;t get the free freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you take the broke in a way that everything divent possible to be possible the sodenter .
You know , you know , and you reduck the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too strong , maybe even a little bit of the fish , and of course for us .
But the absolutely haxis a recipe for the unhappiness and , I &apos;m in the rovine .
Thank you very much .
