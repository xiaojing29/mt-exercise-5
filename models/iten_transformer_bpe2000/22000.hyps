The year I showed these slide to show that the calculations to show that the calculations of arctic , which is about 48 percent .
It &apos;s a lot of this subject of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show it in the ice of the ice .
The artage glacial is , in a sense , the heart heart of the global climate system .
You &apos;re going to winter and it &apos;s ritier .
The next slide is a quickly carried on on the last 25 years .
The ice loss loss are drawn in .
You can see , you know , you get to blue up to blue .
That &apos;s the ice in winter , which is the summer .
You can see that the blood ice cosid-year-old , or more , is like the blood , which is like the blood , which five years from the body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s passed from this .
This is a problem because the interested in the whole terrain the ocean artage , where there are huge amount of congent carbon congites that , are transformed into metane from microbes .
I &apos;m involved at the totality of the atmospheric inquent of global warming , that amount could radyourself .
And some of them short laghi in Alaska , the metane is already rebecting from the water .
The Katey professoreye of Alaska at the University of Alaska team broke up with a team broke lay lay .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : The question is if we &apos;re going to be .
A reason is that this termal termal scale the Greenland from the north .
This is a glacial figures .
The brought didn &apos;t reached free .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the South of Greenland .
If you want to know how the site of the sea standing of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the sea .
These running are increasingly increasingly .
As the other part of the planet : Antarctica , the biggest block of the planet .
The month , the scientists have diclclose that the balance of the ice is in the negative , and that the Antarctica , which is on some islands , which is particularly rapid , is particularly rapid , is particularly rapid .
Equizero-level of acium level , like Greenland .
Sull Himalaya , the third biggest block , and they see new lages , and they were seeing new lages , which was glacier .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population is going to be able to be able water from that he slide .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the water power of this city .
The carried is increased .
But when it diminds , it &apos;s the same accept to water .
In California , the Sierra Nevada is is deminuitous .
The hyrics are in crises .
The predictions , as you &apos;ve read , are free .
The growth of the city growing world to a remarkable increase .
The environmental disasters are increasing out of the normal and without precedented .
Four times more numerous numerous in the last 30 years of the precedentented 75 .
This is a whole insustainable .
If you look at it in the context , if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons -- 25 million tons of tons in the ocean .
Look at all of the area of the Pacific Pacific , by American , and on both parts of the Indian subcontinent , where there &apos;s a radical impact of oxygen in the ocean .
Most of the global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of it &apos;s the use of fossil .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with the China .
And he was proposed to build a lot of other carbon .
But we &apos;re assisting a change .
These are the projects in the last few years and some of the alternative alternative .
At every way , there &apos;s a lotta political in our country .
The carbon industries and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon bone , which is a host .
That picture me remember me --
Verery Natal , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion scories .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen it on the news .
This is the second bigger than in America .
It happened to Natal .
The nature published of one of the carbon industries .
Video : The carbon , the carbon is a kind of alleo and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it &apos;s going to grow our economy .
Fross the carbon is increasingly clean .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and work work on stipendent .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The largest society in minerary minerary is Massey Coal . This is his amministrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I &apos;m going to clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosis , Harry Reid -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for Clima Protection .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Ator : At COALergy see the climate change as a minute serious mine change as a minute serious mine .
So our priority is invest a great amount of money in a public effort to make public effort and confused the truth .
In fact , the carbon is not sport .
We think it &apos;s a good free -- it &apos;s also a good profumo .
So you don &apos;t preocupon climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Ator : Carbone : Carbone : you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
So let &apos;s give you a look at a structure at a structure of the basic .
Strading ! The machines are a little bit , but this is the sound of the carbon technology .
The carbon is between the main the cause of global warming , but the nightments of the carbon clean , but the night-clean &apos;s night-up ,
You have a look at this : this is the technology of the carbon clean .
Al Gore : Inally , the positive alternative alternative , and at that security and the security .
Video : Shince America is in crises ; the economy , security crisis .
The philos that colleages all : our dependence from fossil combined , like the head and the oil oil .
Now , but , there &apos;s a new , audace solution for using circumstances .
Really , 100 percent of energy , 10 years .
A plan to put America to make us more sure of safety , and help to stop the global warming .
Finally , one solution that &apos;s going to solve our problems .
Really power America . You &apos;re reading more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It &apos;s going to reduced energy to America .
One of the fastest ways to bring up the combined of the combinable moon that our planet .
She talks : The future is here . I feel , just a new energy network .
He &apos;s going to be two : Noves investments for places of the blob .
I &apos;m going to be realistic . It &apos;s time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old old old African , says , &quot; If you want to go to fast , you go to the fast .
If you want to go away , you go together . &quot;
We have to go away , we have to go away ,
Thank you very much .
The year at TED I did a whole thing about LHC .
And I promise to go back to how the machine works .
So here . And so that I did not , the other time , there were no , LHC is the biggest experiment , ever tented -- 27 kilometers of circumstand .
His compit is to reach the conditions that were presents less than a billion second on the beginning of the universe -- under 600 million times a second .
And that &apos;s just environment .
This is the machine sitting in Ginevenra .
We picture these mini-Big Bang inside in the resilient .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- is 44 feet and has a 22 feet .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLATLAS in built so you can notice the proportions .
Ten sector of the last time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was causes of immense festegments in control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first phasm that was all around LHC , walking in collision , with a part of the LHC , and diffonto be in collision , with a part of the resiberately , in the resiliation .
In other words , when we see that picture of the picture , we could see the machine , that &apos;s a great vitting , which is a great vitting .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to do us to exultar this , when somebody went on Google and saw that the page was this .
That means we &apos;ve had a cultural impact on that scientific impact .
And it &apos;s a week after , there was a problem with the machine , and it had to these phils here -- these dored .
These films are 13,000 people carbs when the car works at the main the main of the power .
Now , technicians between you will look at the phils and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . I &apos;m not true . &quot;
And instead of them , because when they &apos;re very cold on the surface of the surface .
So , at less 271 degrees , at a hundred of inferior in the stars , these phils can bring that run .
In one of the young of the novemila in LHC , there was a fect of fabrication .
So , phils surprised up , and 13,000 ampount of met , and 13,000 ampount of electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressionating if you think that these magneties fishing more than 20 tons .
They &apos;re damaged about 50 magneties .
We had to take them , what we did .
We repristinted them and traveled .
Now , they &apos;re going back to their own place .
By the end of mark LHC is is is new integrate .
We will accenate it , and we expect to get data to juggling or light , and continuing our adventure to discover what are the morning is going to get out of what the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , of course , these accidents return the dibad of science and engineering in frontier . It &apos;s easy to confuture .
I think that the fact that &apos;s so hard , the fact of doing broken , I think is the value of things like LHC .
I &apos;d like to end with the words of English scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , imagine , in defense in the experiments of his blob , he &apos;s like Michael Faray , said , &quot; Not is so dangerous for the rest of human mind as the respect of human mind as the respect of human mind as the rest of human mind that the ideas of define . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to rethink about when , from kids , please , you play car .
While you get them and get them , and they &apos;re going to get them , take them and moved them , learned to really think and solve problems and became a re-connection relations .
The space is deeply connected to the way we understand how we understand the way we understand about the world around us .
So , from the information of our interaction with our interaction with physical objects , together at my country , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to ask me , &quot; And if we go to ask me , &quot; And if we go a computer , instead of the mouse as a digital pollen , we could diital the information of a desktop with the information , we could get a desktop with the hands ,
and we &apos;re doing it with our placement ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , and built the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer interactive computers like a biscale .
In a few words , a Siftable computer interactive computers like a biscale .
You can move them with the hand , can see , &quot; you can see &quot; between them , &quot; and they have a screen and a radio .
But above , are physical objects , like the morning , you can move them .
The Siftable is an example of a new ecosystema new ecosystems to manipulate the information information .
And as a hand that become more physical , consciousness , of other , and as they become more physical , of the other people , as we can explore new movement , of other , how we can explore new style and different tins of interaction .
I &apos;m going to start with a few simple example .
This Siftable is configurated to show it : if you cline in a direction , video will roter it will rotate out of the other hand back .
These are interactive of other things .
If you go , you know , it &apos;s interested in what they &apos;re around .
If they &apos;re circumstates , and they can act a little bit .
If they &apos;re circumstates , and they can act a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
And then I realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power to use communicates on data , &quot; to be a color like a liquid color like a liquid color like a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurated as a century of the color in that central color in that central , where they missing .
and I can use them to train color in the color in that central , where they misk .
If we &apos;re going to be too , we can put a little bit of a place .
They also beautiful possibilities of learning , as languages , mathematics and games of logic where people can try things to get out of the fast and see it out of immediately .
Now I &apos;m --
This is a sequence of Fibonaces that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a game of words that &apos;s half in Scarabeo and Boggle .
Pratically , in every turn to a letter to case on every Siftable , in any Siftable , at every waiterally , in any Siftable to go on every Siftable , and you try to figure out of a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new sector of letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s what kids came to the Media Lab , I did in a way that they were trying to do them and I turned a video .
They &apos;re very placeased .
And one of the interesting things about this application is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of education .
You just say , &quot; Look of words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s other people who are trying to do it .
This is our younger bigger , there on the right .
He really really wanted to implement them .
They were only at the morning , for him .
Now , this is an application of an interactive cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of languages . He &apos;s Felix .
It can be able to put new characters in the scene , solve the Siftable .
It can be able to put new characters in the scene , solve the Siftable .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : The sun is surprises .
David Merrill : Now he brought a treator in the scene .
Video : The arange treator .
By work ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah !
So , schooling Siftable and put them near the character ,
Video : Bau !
And by inventing their story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a story with final open , and it can decide it as you &apos;re going to make it .
DM : It &apos;s a story with final open , and it can decide it as you &apos;re going to make it .
Video : Volice on .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , realized by a recently , to fight to walk and exequiet music .
it &apos;s a tool , realized by recently , to walk and exeguide music .
The Siftable here are aging sounds like base , and battery .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose to use .
You can also also inform these sounds in a sequence of comport .
And modified it just to touch a &quot; sound &quot; and a &quot; sequence . &quot;
These are effects that you can control from the vive , like the reverse and filter .
It &apos;s going to be particular and then classes to go to the way to the way .
And then there are general effects like time and volume , that they applicate to interact .
Let &apos;s look at how it works .
Video : We &apos;re going to start to put a base in two Siftable , &quot; sequence , &quot; we &apos;re going to get it in a series , we add to the other base .
Now I &apos;m going to put a basket .
Video : Now I add to percussion --
Video : And I &apos;m going to put the filter , so I can control the effect of the bacteria .
Video : I can speed the whole sequence of the whole sequence of time by a side or another .
Video : And I &apos;m going to add the movie to the basic phillion .
Video : I can get the sequence &quot; to the sequence &quot; to the volo . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to planning it before , but I can suddenly suddenly , it &apos;s longer or more coral .
And so , finally , I can smoke the whole sequence inking on the left Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is built new man &apos;s interfaces of men , and more like our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the result of this lost , and also some possibilities that we &apos;re trying to bring out out of the lab .
The concept that I want to transmit is that &apos;s coming to this new generation of projects to interact with digital media , that will bring information in our world in our world in our way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time to talk to all of you .
I &apos;m a written .
The book is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also the love and the fascinating of my life .
And I don &apos;t really expect that it can change .
But , said this , something about , particular , something happened in my life and in my life and in my own own life , and in my own own own own .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called &quot; Mangia , &quot; which , I &apos;m going to say , but what , different from my precedented my precedented in the world and become a great sensational , became a huge , bestseller .
And the result is that everywhere &apos;s going to go , people treat me as if I was condanned .
Davimimum -- condanned .
They &apos;re going to me to go and say , &quot; You don &apos;t have to be able to do it better ?
You don &apos;t have to keep going to keep on all life without power to be able to create a book that can important to someone ? &quot;
What can you important to somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s sure , you know .
But it could go worse , part of that I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a written .
I was going to meet the same basic .
And people said , &quot; I don &apos;t do that I couldn &apos;t you have succeed ?
You don &apos;t have fear that the humiliation of the refree ?
You don &apos;t have to do this all of life without any living life without any any infranker out and die on a cumulation of all infrankers with the bought full of fallimbing ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
Yeah , I &apos;ve got lots of all those things .
I always had a couple .
And I also have lots of other things that people could not inate .
As the algae and other things .
But , as it is about what I thought and I was really , and I asked me , I asked me , and I asked me , I &apos;m asking me , and I asked me , I asked me what I thought and asked me what I thought and asked me , I was going to write what I thought I was going to write what I thought and asked me , and I was really care about it , and I was asked me , and I was really going to write what I thought about and I was a full ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logic that anybody have been waiting to be spent by a work that you feel like to do .
But what is so particular in the creative creative to make us nervous about it to make us nervous about health health , in a way that other career do ?
And as my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don &apos;t remember one time in its 40 years of activity where he was asked if he was asked if he was wondered if he was watchemical to be engineer ?
It never -- that &apos;s going to have -- that block of Engineer , how it goes ?
It didn &apos;t work that , you know , you know , ?
Onestly , chemicals like group are not , in the centuries , in the secreputation of being alcolized high hundred hold .
We have this writers , we have enough this reputation , and not just writers , but creative of all genes , we have this reputation of being huge instable .
And it &apos;s not going to look at the trists of dead death of the magnifies of the magnifies that are only in the 21st century , died young people died and often to them .
And also , the ones that don &apos;t have suicidated to be really disfacts from their dones .
Norman Mailer , before he die , in the last whole said , &quot; Every my book , he killed me a little bit more . &quot; A extraordinary hard to work on the work of their life .
But we don &apos;t bad it when we heard it , because we &apos;ve heard these things that we &apos;ve completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering the notion and suffering are in some ways of the way that we &apos;ve got to the home .
And the question I want to bring all of the time is : are you agree with this idea ?
It &apos;s OK , this is because it looks at a centimeter of distance to me not good for anything about this .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s also perforicangerous and I don &apos;t want to see it lost in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our big ground ments in living .
And of course I know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to begin to get to that heard of suppositions , surately , I &apos;m in in my career .
Of that &apos;s what -- I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;ve about 40 years .
I have still about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything I write about the world &apos;s work that I &apos;m going to be judged by the world as the work that was successful .
I &apos;m going to be cut , because we &apos;re all more or less friends here -- is likely that my biggest successes .
Oh , Gesus , who think !
You know this is the gender of thinking that that brings a person to begin to get to the nine of the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would keep going to keep this work that we love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so , it seems to me , after a lot of reflective , which is to create a psychological tricky , OK ?
I have to find a way of safety of security , and I &apos;m going to write , and my natural anxium is going to get out . And as I was trying to get out . And as I was trying to get to the whole scored on how to do it begin to look through time , trying to find some more society to see if they could have ideas and more sances and more sances and more sances and more sances and more sances and more sances and more sanexed .
about how to help people make creative to reach the inerents of creative inerents .
And that research to me to the ancient Grex and ancient Rome .
I sweat me because he gets back and then go back .
Nelantics Great and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity was from men , OK ?
And it was that creativity was this spirit of divine and sell men from a few distant and known , for a few slights and known , for distant reasons and known .
The greatest called these dins beyond about creativity .
Soke , wonderful , he had a demon that was a demon that was going to be wisdom .
The Romans were the same idea , but they called that kind of a spirit .
That &apos;s great , because Romans didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a very smart .
They would have a genius was this kind of divine , that was created literally lived in the walls of a study , a little bit like Dobby , and that came out to assisted to assisted the work of the artist and moon to take a hidden the work of that work .
Here &apos;s what it &apos;s going to -- that &apos;s the distance of which I talk about it -- that psychological costruth that you have to do .
And everybody knew that was so that it worked , right ?
So , antious artists were protected by certain things , like the too much narcism , right ?
If your work was excetional work was not going to take it all of the market , everybody knew that you have been helped by this incorporate .
If your work work , it wasn &apos;t all of the fallies , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be an incapable .
And so people are free creativity in Occident Occidest for a long time .
Then Rind the Rind came and all changed , and nacize this great idea ; we put it to be human to be at the center of the universe and no more to leave space to the creatures and no more to the creatures of the divinity .
This was the principle of rational humanesimum and people began to think that creativity was completely from the shared shared .
And for the first time in history , it began to reference this or the artist as a rather than a person with genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big herror .
I think that allow somebody , a simple person to believe that that &apos;s like a reciplies , the essence and surprises , creative , and the surprises , creative , unknown and the source of human hague to be a lot of driving human .
It &apos;s like to ask someone to ingoes the sun .
Deform and completely fully the ego and creates all of these expectations on performance .
And I think it was this pression to destroy the artists in the past 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it &apos;s , and I think it &apos;s going to be , and now ?
Can we do it a different way ?
Maybe to get back to a more than the relationship between humans and mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t song to 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience that only had a nice of scientific notion , inside , and they &apos;re going to make people out of their projects .
I &apos;m not going to talk about this .
But the question I would like to bring is -- why don &apos;t I ?
Why don &apos;t I think about this way ?
Because it &apos;s more sense of all other thing that ever ever heard to explain the exasperant exasperant for creative process .
A process that , as anybody who ever ever ever themselves , so , you know , it &apos;s basically , everybody here -- knows , you don &apos;t get rational .
And , in fact , it can be completely paranormal .
I did this met recently met with the wonderful poetry . Ruth Stone , which is now 90 years , but it was a poetic for all life and said that he &apos;s during his infancient in the watch , and heard it , in the watch , and heard it , in if a few wages .
He said that it was like a fragorous air .
And that was coming up to her out of the landscape .
He heard it was going to be , because he was tremendous under his feet .
He knew to have one thing to do to that point and it was to do that point and it was to run as a main . &quot;
And so it was going to go to home and he was walking up with this poetry , and it wouldn &apos;t have to get a piece of card and a faster , while he would be fast , and it would be fast it on the page .
Sometimes he couldn &apos;t be fast , so he was going to be able to get out of the house and correct the home and the poetry to get out and the lost and he would continued to go to the landscape through the country , trying to say , &quot; another poet . &quot;
Then there were times -- this is never going to forget to -- I never forget it -- there were some moments where they were almost dying , right ?
So , he was running home and he was trying to card and the poetry to the past through , and he was going to be a city , and he said , that he was going to go , and he said , that it was like the other hand and the acuffed .
He was going to cut the poetry and read it in his body and read to the page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be presented on the perfect page and intatta , but at the top of the first word .
So when I heard it -- it &apos;s lots of it , it &apos;s exactly the same thing to my creative process .
I don &apos;t have my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conducture .
I &apos;m a moving , and my way to work is ; I &apos;m seeing up at the same same horarian every day and go to the and go to the watch on the watch .
But even I &apos;m going to be in my test , I &apos;ve been stripped out that thing , sometimes .
And I &apos;m also imagined that many of you .
You know , even if the work and ideas were giving me from a certain source , I couldn &apos;t honestly know .
And what is this ?
And how can we relational it to do it in a way to do it , but rather , rather , rather , that do you get healthy ?
For as much as a best example of me , the best example I have is musician musician musician , which I interviewed for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life has been the incarnation of the artist &apos;s reminded , to try to control , to get to control , to move , dominate these species of totally interiorized impulses .
But then he invested , he got up , and one day , and one day , when he was driving on a &quot; self-build .
He was going to go quick and all of a bunch , this little basic melodia , which is coming into his head like ispiration , elusive and hall-health , and the wants , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the result , but it doesn &apos;t know how to take it .
It &apos;s not a piece of card , it doesn &apos;t have a climb .
So he began to hear this species of anxioned anxioned to him , &quot; I &apos;m to lose , and I &apos;ll remark obsessed by this persective song .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to go to the panic , it stopped .
And he gets the whole process and did something completely new .
And I &apos;m going to just the sky and said , &quot; Scause , I &apos;m not seen that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; You know , you know , you can write a song now ?
If you really want to be , you get to a more high moment when I can take care of you .
Altrimments , you go to important to something else today .
You know , Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his process of work changed after this .
Not work , the work was still hard as always .
But the process , and the anxium that was regiven when he was pressed when the genius , the genius that was going to go back to where he was going to sent it to go back to where he came out of , and he was going to go back to where he came out , and come to the foreign .
but it was wonderful , wonderful bizarre collaboration with a conversation between Tom and this external thing that it was not Tom .
And so how much you feel that story about changing a little bit about how I worked me and he save me one time .
This idea , he saved me when I write , &quot; Mangia , &quot; and falls in one of those cave of the disperation where we &apos;re working on something and we don &apos;t start thinking that it &apos;s going to think that it &apos;s going to think that it will start thinking that it will start thinking that it will be a disaster , which is going to be the worst book .
I don &apos;t just bad , right the worst book .
And I started thinking about the project .
But then I remember Tom who talked to to the air and I tried to the air and I tried to do .
So I went to my face in the house and I got my comments to a handle of the room .
And I said to free food , &quot; Sent , what , you &apos;re both , &quot; Do , you know that if this is not going to be bright ?
Because as I &apos;m seeing us all of that I &apos;ve got , not more than that I &apos;ve got ,
So if you want you to want to be better , you have to presented and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , you don &apos;t do .
I &apos;m going to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to favor that was recorded that I &apos;m going to do my part of &quot; because it &apos;s so , OK -- at the end is so , OK -- in the deserts of Africa , in North people were going to get to the watch of the damage , damage music and until hand to hand hand to hand to hand to high hit .
And they were always magnific , because the balleres were professionals and were fantastic .
But every time , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists were actually transcending .
And I know you know what you talk about , because I know you &apos;ve seen it all , at a point , a performance .
It was like time , you stop , and the ballery walked through a kind of poral portal and it wasn &apos;t doing anything from the usual , like 1,000 notes . But it &apos;s all winef .
And I suddenly don &apos;t just like a human .
But it happened from the deduced and sled slow in the divinity .
And when this happened , to the time , people knew what was called it with her name .
They were were hands and started song , &quot; Allah , &quot; Allah , God , God , God , God , God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curious note storic -- when the More invasolas in Spain , I was this habits with them and pronounded changed in the centuries of the holds of the holds of the holds of the holling . &quot; Ole , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Oh , &quot; Oh , &quot; , &quot; Oh , &quot; Oh , &quot;
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , magic , &quot; Allah , magnificent , &quot; I &apos;m going to be , &quot; incomprehenable , etary God .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem is coming to the day after , to the ballery same , when you see and it turns out that are the 11 in Martedesday , and I wrote it &apos;s going to be there .
It &apos;s just a death with a bad with a bad bad to ginocky , and maybe never going to be to get to the tree .
And maybe no one name of God while I gave , and what is it must do with his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most pain recognizes to make a creative life .
But maybe not to be so angoscious if you can &apos;t believe , anzyutt , that the most extraordinary expects of your being come from you .
But created just that you &apos;re just going to get in a typical inimaginable source of this squish part of your life that you have to go to someone else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think that all of this change .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s sure as I thought I was going to think about a lot of the book that I &apos;m going to think about the book that I &apos;m going to be pressed , expected , exactly the great successful success .
And what I &apos;ve got to keep me when I feel electried to me ,
Don &apos;t go to the way . It &apos;s just your work .
It &apos;s going to presented you to presented your part , any of any of it can be .
If your work is balling , ball .
If the wine , aburd you ask it decide to leave some kind of wonderful kind of wonderful , for a moment through your effort , then &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Altrimments , you know , you &apos;re the same dance .
And &quot; Ole it ! &quot; You know .
I think you have to teach it .
&quot; You know , &quot; You know , even for you , even for human-lest love and test tape tape to be presenting .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
You know , I &apos;ve already talked about some of these projects on human genome , what can meaning and discovery of new genes .
Now we &apos;re starting a new percoral : we started digitalize biology and now to talk from that digital code we &apos;re both in a new biology , designing and syntizing and syntizing and syntizing .
We &apos;ve always been trying to make big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; is something that many biologists I think they &apos;re trying to figure out to various levels .
We tried a different approaches , reducing it to the minimes .
We &apos;re driving from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome is to go from the analogic world of biology in the digital world .
Now , let &apos;s ask us : can we regenerate life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smaller genome of those that can authorum in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome of it &apos;s a little bit of a little bit more tiny .
We &apos;re able to eliminate a hundred of genes about 500 of genes that are here .
But when we give a look at his meabolic maps , it &apos;s relatively to our .
It &apos;s a very simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it &apos;s very imlikely that this can bring to a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to design was synthesize this chromosoma way that we could modifying components to bring some of these questions .
And so we started the adventure of Pan , we can synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Can chemistry to make these big molecules that we never could make these big molecules that we never could create before ?
And in case , in case , can we make a chomosoma chomosoma ?
A chromosome is just a chemical material chemical material .
The speed that we can digitalize life is growing up to exponential .
Our capacity to write the genetic code , instead , rather than it &apos;s improving .
And our most recent recent retains the brings to a exponential curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process has require many past , beginning with a bioeethic ree-ey-review .
But we discovered that DNA is very difficult .
There are a thousands of machines in the world that make small sectity segments of DNA , of 30 to 50 lector and it &apos;s a process of it is a degenerative process : the most herrors is more herrors there .
So we had to develop a new metod to assembling these fragments and correct to the errors .
And this is our first attempt , to talk about the digital information of Phi &apos;s genome of Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , actually , the correction of the herrors and get a molecule of DNA about 5,000 lector .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of inert material chemical material and we put it in the bacteria , batters have beginning to read this genetic code and producing the particles .
The viral particles are then you refed by cells , and they destroyed the E.
I &apos;ve talked about recently with the oil industry , and they &apos;re saying that they have certainly compress this model .
They rese more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build his same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in big .
We wanted to build the whole croma of bacteria .
They &apos;re more than 580 mysts of genetic code .
So we thought we build it in casses of virus , so that we could change the casses to figure out what the casses of a living cell .
The progress is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accurate accurate was a herror for every 10 mile .
We found out , 30 errors . If we had been used that , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence , we never have been able to do this .
One part of the process is designing sector , 50 letters that are going to have to be reverse with all other segments to build smaller suburity to build smaller suburity that work together .
We can see unique elements here .
You probably have a read bed that we put it up .
Think about it this : We have a genetic code on four letters : A , C and T.
Three of those letters together , and there &apos;s a specific remarkable to be about 20 leters , and there &apos;s a specific order to lector .
So we can use genetic code to write words , frasured .
What we did is that we did in the beginning to do it .
Some of them are not going to be poetry .
We designed these segments to make them just together with the full .
There are enentives that they reped them and put them up .
And we started to assembling parts , beginning with segments from five to seven to seven , unclean together to form it segments in a segments of 24 ments to make it to 72 mile .
At every step we made these segments in abundance so that we could sequenced them by creating a very robs process of creating a very robbrobs -- as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems to be a basket play-basket .
When we get to these very long segments , more than 100 mile , more than 100 middle , they will not grow more directly in E.
It comes to the limit of molecular biology &apos;s biology .
So we considered other mechanisms .
We knew to know of another mechanism called homologize , that in biology is using to be able to repull DNA able to get segments .
Here &apos;s an example .
This is organism , called Deinoccurs , can make three million rad rad .
You can see in the quare of superior as his chomosoma brow .
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly like it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can do completely .
They can live under a vacuum .
They &apos;re absolutely sure that life in space , and you can find new environment of water .
As the real , NASA showed that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule we built this processes , just using the processed of free segments to put .
The lievil lightments .
This is not taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a molecule of that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that they &apos;re taking a period of six seconds .
This is the published we did a little time ago .
They &apos;re more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the biggest molecule of a definitely definitely created by man .
It &apos;s a lot of several site to 300 million .
If we &apos;re going to be practical career , it would take 142 pages to get this genetic code .
Now , how do we do it ?
Of course , you know , you know , a virus is a game from kids .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria .
It &apos;s simpler even when it &apos;s cells as well cells as our eucariote : you can just extract the nucleo and put another , which is practically the cell process .
In the archail &apos;s bacteria , it &apos;s instead of the chromosoma , but we &apos;ve recently demonstrated that we &apos;re able to do a complete trape from one cell of a chromosoma cell of a cell of a cell , and of activate it .
We got a chromosome chchromosome from a microbial species .
The two are different than men from topes .
We added some genes in a way to decide what he was going to decide to chromosoma .
And then he slide with the scientists in a way to kill all protein .
And when we put it in the cell was study -- and appreciate our software , and we &apos;re going to open in the cell .
And so we started to go to the way , but we tried to go , but we tried to spent us more in there .
This is one of the most mecchanisms .
We found that many of these species have added a second or a third chromosome from some part , adding in a second thousand new ones of new beings , in a second thousand of new people in that species .
So who &apos;s thinking about evolution as a gene at time that time it has no makes not a lot of biology .
There are scientists called me &quot; restrial restrial restrial . They &apos;re going to digerises the DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell .
The cell phones that we &apos;ve inseritous that we &apos;ve inseritous .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other croma like extraneous material , and we found it with just cell , and we found with just cell and the new chromosoma .
it &apos;s became blue because of the genes that we &apos;ve been insereous .
And in a short lass of time , all the characteristics of a species are going to be lost , and it turned out of the new software that we in the cell .
All proteins are changed , members are changed , and when we region the genetic code on what we &apos;ve turned to it .
Now , this might seem to be genetic altering , but altering the software that &apos;s enough to be sustained .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that this is not talking about this -- but to progress to go from three million years and a half years of evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create new species on this digital process of this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s enough to think that &apos;s enough to our need .
We &apos;re going to go from six and a half billion people to nine billion in the next 40 years .
Right to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each other , there &apos;s one in 1946 . There are four .
We &apos;re now having problems now to find food , fresh water and bulital , medicinal and well-zas for six and a half of people .
It &apos;s going to be more dare to do it to nine billion .
We &apos;re going to start more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion barrel .
That means millions of barils a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replaced them , it &apos;s going to get them , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenges .
And we have to hold out of all the CO2 emission from these materials that ended up in the atmosphere .
At the day of today , thank you to scientific discoveries in all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the design components for the future .
The electronic industry is only a dozen dozen about components , and think about how many different things come out .
Our limits here are maybe data from reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , thank you very quickly , able to create what we call combined genomics .
We can build a big robots of robots that can make a million croms of croms a day .
Think about this 20 million of genes or to try to get a very good team , or to make a very typical , new vaccines , we can change , thank , you can change , thank you to change , because of a little theam , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for a possibility of survival , chemistry or carburant , production of vaccines .
This is a few of a few software program on which we &apos;re working on to be able to sit and design species on the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how it will be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
Now we &apos;re focus on the carbon of how quarter generation .
You &apos;ve also seen you extract ethanol from the grain of the grain .
We have carbons of second and generation that will use enough to be present by the sugar to carbon on the high of the higher value as the open or different types .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact impact with no increase in the cost of food and limit to be transformed to the CO2 in the maybe transforming CO2 in master , which we &apos;re working to design this cell , and we think of the maybe it , and think we think of the earlier in the first carburants of how much quarter it &apos;s about 18 months .
The light solar solar combined with CO2 is a metodownload -- but in our discoveries in all over the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the ocean ocean , at about 2500 feet of deep on the temperature of the water .
It &apos;s going to put from CO2 using hydrogen as a source of energy .
We &apos;re trying to figure out if we can incanalt CO2 , which can be transported through your bes , converting that CO2 in carbon , to drive this process .
So we think we can be able to be able to be able to increase what the question of &quot; is &quot; life . We have the base question of &quot; that is life , &quot; We have the modest of replacing the whole oil industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can you do it ?
It would be a main the main of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working on to use the same metods to create vaccines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with influence , we &apos;re always back to a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s going to find the right vaccine .
I think that what you can change build vaccines in anticipate .
That &apos;s how the future could start to change , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria , archail , and finally cells .
We &apos;re going to be so much better .
Our purpose is to make it very long enough to try to try to make it . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the most founded , some fundamental work , in new technology that we brought to a car bunch a year ago ago . This is Seady guys . This is Seady guys .
It &apos;s a environment where you can interact is to the local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data .
Here we &apos;re seeing a lot of gabyte of digital photos with a kind of costant zoom , and continuous , for a speed speed , and I keep , to sponing the images of how we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these data or images or images .
Most of digital photographs , but this is for example is a scanning of the Biliotector of Congress , and it &apos;s entered in the gama 300 megapiel .
It doesn &apos;t make a difference because the only thing that &apos;s practical thing that &apos;s the number of plxel on your screen on your screen in any time . It &apos;s also a very flicky architecture .
This is a whole book , you know , you don &apos;t imagine .
This is Dickens desolate . Every colonnaked . Every colonnaked .
To show you that it &apos;s about heads and not images , we can do something like this , to see that it &apos;s a real thing , to see it &apos;s a real representation of the head , not a picture .
It could be a little bit of a little artificial way to read a book book .
It doesn &apos;t look at it .
This is a more realistic example . This is a number of the Guardian .
Every big images is the beginning of a set .
And it really gives you a lot of pleasure and beauty the experience of a reverse version of a review of a juggling , which is for a lot of median .
We also did something with the angle of this particular number in the Guardian .
We created a fasull the high-solutions -- much higher than that uses in a published normal -- and we put you on the published .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that this means to put the pop-up and other door , and other door door , they should not be more .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don &apos;t want to lose time , if we don &apos;t say that we have contributed to date in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. .
So , we &apos;re going to go to another .
This is now from the Web ; you can go to the web ; you can see it .
This is a project called Photosynth , which is two different technologies .
A is Seadragon and the other is a search for a very interesting computer search in Noah Snavely , a student of University , with the help of University and Rick Seliski &apos;s U.S. of Microsoft Research .
And it &apos;s from the Web , gested by Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this , kind of screen , where we can spend a picture of the other and have this kind of experience in the multipla .
But the space collocation of the images here has actually a meaning .
The algorithms of computers have recorded these imaging imaging together these imaging imaging , so that they share the recorresponds to the real place -- all the near of the Montne Rockers on the Montne Roccial Montne Roccial Montne Roccial Montne Roccial Montne Roccial , or you &apos;re taking .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot of them more space .
I want to go to one of the original sects of Noahahah -- and this is from a precedent prototype of Photosynth that we &apos;ve done in the first time , the first time the summer exted the first time , the Sadirectly the key technology , Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily watching the website .
We had to worry about legal and on saying .
This is a reconstruction of Noththout of Noththin Dimimages . Bastay . Bastay in Nothers and you get images of types in magic and so on . Each of these fields and on saying . Each of these arancies a picture that &apos;s discovered a picture that &apos;s discovered a picture that &apos;s discovered .
So , I &apos;m all images from Flickr and have been all of the space in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this way simplicate .
You know , I never thought I &apos;d never thought to end up to Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratificant to receive this kind of account here .
I think you can see that you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of different types of focus in those professional professional in the professional professional , a number of it .
And if I can , I try to try to get those more strange .
Many are blocked by faces , etc .
Some of the photographs here is a series of photographs --
This is a Noththers of Drecorded .
We can go from the poster to the view of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the entire memory of how to appear the Earth , from visual point of view -- and colleages all those data together .
All those pictures become connected together , most of the parts .
You have a whole model of the whole thing that emerge .
Think about this as a prolungment of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It &apos;s something that &apos;s going to be in complexity as a hand that people use it , and the advantages for the who use to use it .
They &apos;re married with metadopted metadors from other people .
If someone is the idea of contrast , and I can say , name , my picture of Noth-Dimprovising , my picture of Noth-Dimprovised , and I can use it as a point of inground , and I can use the way of inground , in that space , in that metaphopefully , using the photos of anyone , and have a social experience of class and cross-model .
Of course , a consequence of all that are extremely elaborated with all interesting . And there &apos;s no elaborate by the planet , and from satellitarious images and satellitarious images and similar images , but from collective memory .
Thank you very much .
CA : I realized what you can do ? What your software will contained us to do is that , in the next few years , all of the photographs shared by anybody in the world will be practically connected to the whole world will be practically connected together ?
BA : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is in practice .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , among images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the pictures .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of simantic information that many of these images are possible information .
As when you make a research on on the web , you get a sentence and head on the web page has a lot of information about the picture .
Now , what happens if that picture is connected to all your picture ?
So , the amount of interconnection and the amount of the amount of wealth , which is really huge . It &apos;s a classical effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible .
BA : Thank you very much .
One of the main pleases when you travel and one of the research for the power of the research , is the power of the power of the traditions , in the wind , the past in the wind , the past in the wind , the wind of the rain .
Bastes think that Jaguar Jaguar traveling , and that the Via Lattea , or that &apos;s Mians are still connected to me , or Himalaya , the buddddisters the rest of Dharm , to remember the importance of Dharm , to remember the world that we live in the world that you live in a sense of the world where we live in a sense of fact , but it &apos;s just a model of fact , it &apos;s just a model , but it &apos;s just a very ,
the conset of a particular set of choices that our stirs did , well or a bad , many generations ago .
And of course , we all share of the essential .
We all nets . We all project .
We are subjects in the beginning .
We have to death the inexorability of death , so it doesn &apos;t surprised if we &apos;re going to stop and --
We all have a art .
What it &apos;s about cancer is the particular rhythm of cancer , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that are the Penan forests of Borneo , or the watching of Haiti , or the Wooks of Haiti , or the Kenya , or the Curt , the Curander , or a camellier in the Sahara .
He was my own journey in the desert a month ago , or a hallevator of yak in the values of the C.C. .
All of these populations teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And if you reflected a moment , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
And we put them out of cultures in the world creating a spiritual life and cultural life that it &apos;s important to the planet and it &apos;s important to the planet as biosphere as biosphere as biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural girl as a nosphererman and you can call the ethnosphere , and you can call the ethnosphere of all the concepts , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions of the consciousness .
The ethnosphere is the fantastic patrimonium .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how inquises .
And because of biosphere was free to ethnosphere , as it happened to ethnosphere and much more quickly .
Nobody &apos;s been biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species is on the horse of simply because it &apos;s fallowed , or in the highest hypothesis in the field of biological diversity -- and you don &apos;t even have near even glasses -- that of the cultural diversity .
The whole thing is , of course , the lost lost lost .
When you were born there 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only composed by a vocabulary or a series of grammad .
A language is the human spirit .
It &apos;s the medium with the animation of every culture is coming into the material world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a bind , a bink , a thousand of spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , while we &apos;re sitting in Monterey , at least half no longer in the ears of the kids .
They don &apos;t come to teach kids , which is to say , unless that you wouldn &apos;t get something , which is already dead .
What is more trists of being flown from silence , to be the last to talk about a language , you don &apos;t have a way to be the wisdom of the wisdom of the children or to anticipate the promise of children ?
This is horring is someone in some part of the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks . And one of an ancient language .
And I know that somebody who &apos;s going to say , &quot; Is it &apos;s not better ?
The world would not be a better place if we talk all the same language ? &quot; Benish , then we talk all talk to all the same . We talk all talk about song .
We talk about kogi .
You &apos;ll buy a tract thing you &apos;ll want to say , not to talk about their language .
I &apos;d like to do a journey through ethnosphere --
a little journey in ethnospherant to give you a lot of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us of dimenting that when I say , &quot; different ways of exists , &quot; I really mean different ways of exists .
We take for example this Barasana Barasana , in Amazon , the population of anaconda , which is creating to myth of the lats of the latts of the lats of the latts of the lats of the west sacred .
It &apos;s a population that &apos;s not able to distinguished the blue color blue from the real time of the forest , which is identified in the forest , which it depends the population .
They have a linguished and a maybe a maybe , &quot; exogamia , &quot; you have to get a person to be able to get a person who talk about a person that &apos;s different language .
And that &apos;s all of it has gone in the mysts , yped the particularly , in these families that are talking about six or seven seven or languages no practice .
They move to listen and then start to talk .
We take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived , the Waorani of Ecuador , an incredible populable populable people that has had the first contatts in 1958 .
In 1957 five mesionaries have taken a comfortable to be a very herror .
They did it come out of the photographs that they retraditional , and they had been reended up , forest to the forest pluvial forest .
They collect the picture of the ground , they turned them to a form or a shape and , not find nothing , they have concled that they were going to be diot , and they killed the five missionaries with the lance .
But Waorans don &apos;t just killed the straniesters .
They killed to them .
54 percent of death mortality was caused by them .
We &apos;ve been sitting at eight generations and we found two of natural death homed , and when we put out to know , they had a lot of them , they had a very much thing that &apos;s dead , and then they killed it . They had a very , they had a incredible known known to know .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal of 40 steps of recognize it .
I was a very interesting compiece of the 1980s , I was a very interesting compiece of Harvard professor , if I wanted to go to Haiti to go to Haiti to ink me to go to Haiti and Tonton Mins of Dualier and Tonton Minines , and imposed me to do the baby to the books .
To give a sense to myraculous sense , I should have to understand the Vodoun and that Voodoo is not magic .
It &apos;s pretty much more than a metaphysics of the world .
Many interesting .
If I asked you to tell me about the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddisplay , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , and thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has no feeling . And instead of it &apos;s not religious . And instead of these very profound religious concepts of these very profound religious religious .
What &apos;s interesting is that makes the voot is the intense report of life and death .
So , you live with the spirits .
The spirits can be invoded by Great Aca , they respond to the rid of dance and replace on the anima way that for a short of the vive in a very short way that for a short , and they replace the following .
So , this voodooists love to say , &quot; You white you go to wait to wait to talk about God .
We give them in the temple and become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re sitting , is the spirit that you guide , how can you do you do that ?
So , you &apos;re asking these incredible events : following voodoo in the state of trance that touches ines infuel .
I was all the people with which I lived the most extraordinary people are the Kogi of Sierra Nevada Santa Marta , in Colombia .
It &apos;s ancivil ancivil ancivil that once was living on the carairs of Colombia , the population of the Colombia , the population of the vulcanic planation .
In a drugs of blood , this population never been conquered by the spagners .
And so , I &apos;m government today , they &apos;re government , but their formation is decided to be extraordinary .
The young people following out of the families to three or four years , and live secreators in a fact of good world and bumbers in capanian capanian huge and broken in the bag of the ice for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years old , proposed to reproduce the nine months of gestation that transmit into the user of the mother , now are metaphor in the Mushed of Madas .
So , this time , they get acculated to the values of their society , values that they are predicted that their prayers and only their price and their price , they &apos;re going to be the cosmic balance .
At termine of this incredible initiation , they &apos;re improvide out and for the first time , they see a high . And in that actioned . And in that actim of the first bad bad , when the sun buts the buts of the first bad beautiful llate , all that they &apos;ve learned in the health all its plender . The prets a steel behind and says :
&quot; I &apos;m going to tell you .
It &apos;s study . Now it &apos;s going to protect it . &quot;
They call it more than the most people and say that we , fracket them , we are the brothers , we are the paper of the world .
This is extremely important level .
When we think about Indigene populations and invooes invooes , and the old story of the old story of the non-history , which is a razy concept in its simplicity or maybe , and say that these people are more close to the Earth of us .
The indigenes are not nor sentimental people are nor indebolites .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the paludian disease or in the winds of Tibet , but thank you to the time and rites , they created a mystic mystic war &apos;t on the concept of the Earth &apos;s not about the concept that the Earth can only be consciously infused by the consciousness that the Earth can only because it &apos;s infected from consciousness .
What does it mean ?
It means that a little girl in Ande who grow up with that mountain is a Prit Apu that will be a deep human beings , and it will have a deep human . And it will have a deep bate . And it will have a very different place with the mountain or that a Montana &apos;s kids growing up to a Montana &apos;s growing in a Mont-boy is a mountain is a mountain is a mountain .
That &apos;s a miner-one spirit or a mineral cave is irrievant .
What &apos;s interesting is it is the metaphor that defines the relationship between individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia creating Britannic creating that forests were serve to be cut .
And that &apos;s a different human beings from my friends Kwakiutl &apos;s friends that creating forests are the forests of Hukuk and the hook of the paradisong and the waiting of the world , the spirits that are going to the northern of the world , explrites that are in Hamatsa .
If you start considering that these cultures can actually actually make different realities , you can start to understand some of their sensational discoveries .
I taken this picture to open in the noroccurs .
Mayahuge of you heard about the Mayahubbasic sustained by the short repertorium .
What it makes it fascinating the ayahuask is not the potential of sustaining , but it &apos;s his elaboration . It &apos;s composed by two elements .
From a side , this lian lian lian lian argument of history , harmine and harmin , harmin , harmin hallucinogen .
And it &apos;s going to the solar plants , you know , a bluef that alters a little bit of the consciousness , but it &apos;s myscoes of a house of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the caffecting of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family family of the family of the family .
This plants are powerful places , very similar to serotonin serotonin , dimethoxyltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltriced .
If you ever see Yanomami to get on the sushes that are doing from a different set of species , it &apos;s contains is methoxyltryltrained .
Tirate that policies on for the nose is a little bit like being disappear by a file carried fip bind distoring and lots on a set of electricity . Risn &apos;t believe a distorsion of reality .
I was often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , man who wrote the psychedelic , with his discovered fungi on the waste of the hallucinogens in the &apos; 30s in Mexico .
I mean , I &apos;m not going to class these triptames like hallucinogens because if you can &apos;t tell anybody to be able . You can &apos;t tell any of being kinated .
It &apos;s possible to assume if it &apos;s lots of chemical chemical sustaining MAO .
Now , the beautiful : the carboline , that &apos;s in this lian inibitors of MAO , of the same kind of necessary guys to be able to be the triptames . The question is spontaneous question : in a flow of 80,000 species of plants , like these people are , they don &apos;t have a hight-like , biochemical , but if you get a very biochemical version that &apos;s a biochemical version of ?
We use the great euphemism of the herror , that can be infractive .
But if we ask to the Indian , they will tell us &quot; The plants talk about it . &quot;
What does it mean ?
This tribes , Cofan , has 17 variety of Eahubes , which is nets out of the forest , and that our eyes would come into the same species .
If we ask them how they stabilies their tass will tell us &quot; to think , &quot; I was going to say , &quot; I didn &apos;t know ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot; I said , &quot; No .
The solution is : it &apos;s 17 variety in a night of the llloton and each one will song with a different song .
With this is not laurea to Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting that contact the prize .
Now , I applauses the problem is that also the problem is that the people who are in the handoresh people find them out of the history of history , but somehow reduced to our history of history in our world &apos;s real world , and pass .
In fact , the 21st century , 300 years , not will be remember for his wars or sues technological innovations , but rather as we stop and we bad active as we stopped and we bad active , we stopped active , the masses of diversity and cultural problems . Now the problem is not changing .
All of the cultures are involved in a dance for new possibilities .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians are not going to stop Sioux when they put out of Sioux when they put it up and fast as Americans have not stop Americans have to be American when they put out of the horse and caleators .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that are minished ethnosphere . It &apos;s the power .
The wall of domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you &apos;ll discover that these are not destined to comparison .
They are creatures and dynamic dynamic out of hypowerful forces that are beyond their capacity .
It &apos;s going to be disbosing in the patries of the Penan --
a population of Sarawak , in Sarawak , a population that lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to a generation ago , and it reduced to the ress of the fiums , where you can see the physics , where you can see the Borneo &apos;s going to be bring out of the MCinese MMCinese Merionte , where the naves naves , where the naveled the Japanese nount , where you know named named named the horial Borean names of the high nese names the names the nests of the names of the Chinese fiels of the hdionon
and flowed the stives with the blob .
Or in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that are the discovery of the discovery .
If we move on the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the right right dall of the political domination .
You know , as you know the genocide , physics of a populated level , but the ethnium of a population , but the ethnium of life style , not only is condanned , but it &apos;s also not only condannect , because it &apos;s part of the development .
And you can &apos;t understand the soft of Tibet until you don &apos;t go from the beginning .
I spent 6,000 miles from Chengdu in China in Western China in Western Houth , came to Lhasa with a young colleague , but only came to Lhasa , I realized what &apos;s behind the statistics that we heart .
6,000 of mountain sacred and cens .
1.2 million people killed from military military .
The dad of this guy was ascrited to Panchen Lama .
The thing that means that it was killed to the time of Chinese invasion .
Or guice is figure out with Santity during the diaspores that has brought the people in Nepal .
Soumther was imprisoned and his college was to be read .
It was taking to a hundred years to hidden the age of two naked under his gonna because he wouldn &apos;t have to live without .
The sister , which did the same , it &apos;s been put in in the field of reeducation .
A day , he &apos;s got a days , a days , a fashion Mao and , for this transgression , was put on the work for seven .
The Tibet of Tibet can be insation-insent , but the reduced reduced .
And then it &apos;s going to get a choice .
We want to live in the world world &apos;s world &apos;s a monotony or we want to collect the policromatical world of diversity ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before we die said that his bigger was that , in our largest fear was that , we &apos;re not just going to see the whole whole ama of human imagination is going to be a limited modality , but a day we &apos;re going to see it from a wonderful modality , but a day we &apos;re a few other possibilities .
And it &apos;s uilant to remember that our species is in 600,000 years .
The Neolitics Rivolution , which gives us the agriculture , which has done us to be to the cult of the sees of the sees , and replacing the poetry of the sciams , creating the gerarchy of specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The industrialized world industrialized has 300 years .
That square history not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we &apos;ll have to go .
When these cultures of the world is asked what it is to say to be human , respond to to be human , respond with 10,000 voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all return the possibility of being what we are : a kind of consciousness , that &apos;s going to be what we &apos;re in all the people and all the gardines can flow . And there are great moments of optimism .
I taken this picture on the north of Baffin , when I went to the hundred of balene with Inuit , and this guy , and this guy , and this guy , Olaya man , he told me the wonn .
The government has not always been gentile with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to stabilie our premational satures , we got them in colonies .
The non-throw this guy , I got to go .
The family , templation for his life , he brought them out all the arms , and all of his attractive .
You have to know that Inuit doesn &apos;t feel the cold , they don &apos;t think .
The pactins of the origins were made of the basic skin basic skin .
The non-throw of this guy , you know , the non-typical night or the blizard that was suffering .
It &apos;s broken , you get the banker in the skin of foca and defecated in their hand . When the fected and defecated into their hand . When you get them , it &apos;s working on a lama .
He was reading out on the house of this cacca cacca cacca and when it came up , he was killed a dog .
He schooled the dog and created a bria bria , with the hactical casses , he brought a song , and it &apos;s banchisa , and it &apos;s banchisa banchisa , and it &apos;s banchisa casses .
We want to talk about haves with nothing ?
In the open 1999 , the government has reduced to the Inuit &apos;s total control of a hunter of California and Texas the Texas the message .
It &apos;s their new patries . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a independent terribly . They &apos;re going to be mineraries .
One is a national example of how a national national state can recognize with his population .
And , finally , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious to the least of us is in these zones of the planet , make it remote .
For somebody &apos;s home .
They are seglasses of human imagination that are going to the alba time . And for us all of these kids , as the dreams of these kids , as the dreams of our children , become part of the hope .
Finally , we are not going to be convints that politicians will never get to nothing to nothing .
We believe that polemical --
&#91; Applauses are not persuasive , but we believe that history can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the best institution to tell stories about the world . Every month our site is 35 million living . Every month our site .
156 countries our television .
Our reviews are seven seven from millions of people .
Our work is to travel in ethnosphere to bring our public places from what they will go out out of what they &apos;re going to go out and hope , and hopefully , hopefully , hopefully , hopefully , the world of exists in the diversity , and we have to find a style of life in a pluralistic world , and we have to find a style world and multicultural style and mytaking out to be a living world in a world of the central revealing .
where the wisdom of all the people can contributed to our collective well-being collective .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope reverse about other people who &apos;ve already heard and I &apos;m going to try to evidentiate some colleages .
I &apos;d like to start with what I call &quot; &quot; the official dogma dogma .
The dogma dogma dogma dogma ?
The dogma dogma dogma societies of all the Western industrial society : &quot; If we want to male the benefits of our citizen citizen , &quot; The way to be to men the individual freedom . &quot;
The reason is , from a side , in fact that freedom is in fact that freedom is in the value , is essential , is essential , essential for human beings .
As the other is in fact that if we &apos;re free , each of us can act to do everything that maximizes our well-being , no one that decided in names .
The way to male the freedom is to move the choice .
More choices people are libers , and most of them is their freedom , most of them is their well-being .
This is , right , it &apos;s so deep in society that no one would be dreamed to put it in the society that would be able to put it in the doubt .
And it &apos;s also deep radicated in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what the progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly great .
I lose a simple notes on the condents for injustments .
In my supermarket , there are 175 condents , without contact 10 varieties of oil . The 12 acets acecececececets that you can buy to get a huge number of condents in the resciliced rescious circumstance that nobody 175 pronds of your degrees .
Here &apos;s the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic stereo to buy a stereo : case , CD , radio , radio , floats , please .
And in this single negotion of electronic components .
We can do six and a half million combinations using the components that there are in a only negotiate .
You need to admit that there &apos;s a lot of choice .
Other countries : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all the serve serve telephone , and the bad that were fornes from mama Bell .
And it was born the phone , not buy it .
A consequence of that , in the other , was that the phone was never going to get .
These time .
Now we have a variety variety of telephones , specially between cellular .
Here &apos;s cellular cellular cellular .
My favorite is in MP3 MP3 , MP3 cut out of the nose , and shapels for the eye crows .
If you don &apos;t have seen in the house under home , you &apos;re going to be certain that will be .
And what &apos;s going on is that people are going to go into the watch and does this question . And you know what is the answer ? The answer is &quot; No .
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell that doesn &apos;t make too much things .
So , in other exects of life that are much more important than the acquire of the case of choices .
Assistence , health is not going on in the United States that you go from the doctor and doctor doctor , what you have to do .
And instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , &quot; Well , we could do it , &quot; As &quot; is it &apos;s got these benefits . &quot; As it has these well-history and these . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Dr. &quot; Dr. &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; As these benefits , and B has these benefits , and B has these benefits . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebats , &quot; Dr. If she was me , what would be ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result of the result of the disease , &quot; expression that makes it a beautiful thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not that a fishing the fish and responsibility to make decision from someone who knows something , is the doctor , someone else that doesn &apos;t know -- and almost certainly not -- and most of course , it &apos;s not in the condition .
There &apos;s a huge marketing products , drugs to people like me and you , if you think there &apos;s no sense , that if you think there &apos;s no sense , because we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why are they published ?
The answer is that they want to say , we call the doctor to ask them to change the car .
Something like this is what our hythemselves is a question of choice , as you see in this jet . &quot; We don &apos;t want to force kids . They &apos;re going to be able to be force . &quot; We don &apos;t want to be a heritself .
And we can reinvent us how many times we aggrad .
The means that every morning , to decide you want to decide that kind of person want to be .
I read to the family and maybe , a time time , and a time , almost anybody , was that there was that you could have the most press the most possible , and he started to get the most possible .
The only choice was with who , not when , not even when , not even , and not even what to do .
Except , it &apos;s really to play .
I teach to a very smart students , and I think about 20 percent of work in less than a time .
And it &apos;s not because they &apos;re not going to be brilliant .
but because I &apos;m impensierites , I mean , &quot; I &apos;m going to move to me or not ? &quot;
&quot; I should move more tars ? I have to think about the children or career ? &quot;
They &apos;re interrogorant .
And they &apos;re trying to answer these questions , even if this implement not to told the compitation that and not get a beautiful voe to my exer .
And they have to do it . They have to do it .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , as Carl was , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , every day , from Hotel Randolph .
And I &apos;m talking about it , there &apos;s a angolin , and I &apos;m not going to no one , where WiFi works .
I don &apos;t say that , because I want to use it .
What does , this incredible freedom of choice that we have to go to work ? It &apos;s going to continuously , continually in every moment , if we have to work or not .
We can go to our son to see our son , with the cell phone in a task , Blackberry in the other , and the night , and the night , on the ginockberry .
And even if they &apos;re all spents , every minute that we see our son , we also see our son , we also ask , &quot; Do I answer this ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? &quot; I have to habbodies ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , &quot; that makes the experience of your child very different than it would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the things , little things , and big things , and big materials and style of life , life is a choices .
Once the world was this : Over , there were some possibilities , but it was not a choice .
The world today is a positive to this : The dilemma is , &quot; Is it &apos;s a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Shythday .
The positive lacks , so I &apos;m going to talk about that negative those .
This is all about two effects of two negative effects on people .
The first , paradoxide , is that it &apos;s produced to investigation .
And many of them , you know , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I offer an example : a study example : a study conduced study on the plans of volunteer .
A collected my colleague data , the giant society of the data of the source of sources , with about a million climents in 2,000 companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , percentage of adesion , percentage of adesion .
With 50 source of offered , there &apos;s 10 percent of adesion , when they &apos;re available only five . Why ?
Because with 50 source between which choose , is maleignered to decide , and the choice is remanded to the indomorange .
And domories , and still domories , domain , domain , domain , and of course , domorange , domances never come .
You can &apos;t know that it doesn &apos;t mean that these are workers will eat food for cans because they don &apos;t have enough money , it also means that decision is so hostica that they also have to say that the tricky complementary dator of work .
Don &apos;t participating , they &apos;re allowing up to five &apos; work , which would be wouldn &apos;t be going to be going to be trsarsarsary them .
So , paralysis a consequence of the shoes .
And I think that &apos;s going to make the world .
&quot; And finally , for the ethernity : OK , feeling , or maybe it ? &quot;
You would like to take the right decision , if it &apos;s for ethernity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and nepurchoose the wrong .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can avoice and do a choice , we can do a choice , we &apos;re less satisf-free , in the way of what we were with less options .
And that &apos;s a different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of these condents , and it &apos;s not perfect , if you buy a and it &apos;s not perfect , is to imagine that you could make a different choice that would be better . And that &apos;s going on to be better . And that &apos;s going to be better . And that &apos;s going to get a little bit of choice , and the soft defation of the choice , and the soon , and the soon , and the soon , and the soon , and it &apos;s a figure .
even when it was a very good decision .
More choices there are , more , it &apos;s easy displaced anything that &apos;s insodd-up .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunities .
Dan Gilbert has asked a lot of practice as the value that we &apos;re going to depend with what we &apos;re going to do .
And in rest , when there are so many possible options , is to represent the characteristics of alternative , and be less satisf-f-free of the option that &apos;s choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I wrote with all that are not in New York .
But that &apos;s what you probably think .
There &apos;s this coppia of Hamptons .
A place of lussize .
It &apos;s going to be plendida . Ottyma day .
I don &apos;t move anything . But what he thought is , &quot; Well , maledition , is Agost . &quot;
&quot; All my near Manhattan are on . &quot;
&quot; I could talk about home . &quot;
And it &apos;s going to go to two weeks , assiled from the idea that &apos;s lost -- every day -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The costo-opportunities is dealing the sodbed sofation for what we have , even when choice is .
And the most are the options that we have to consider , more active characteristics will come to it as a cost-opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
And it &apos;s going to live the time , and maybe of living .
But the most important point is that anything you choice , you know , you &apos;re going to do not do other .
The things that we don &apos;t choose so many attractive active that can make less attractive what we do .
Tirst point : spiral growing up .
I tried it on my skin bought a new jeans .
I &apos;m almost always going to jeans .
Once jeans were a only kind of , compressed them and wress wress of them , they were spring them a lot of time , and they were wasn &apos;t a lot of times , began to go right .
So I went to buy a new guy when that old those old old those old old those old old people , and I said , &quot; I need a couple jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Lave them , &quot; Have slim , fit ? &quot;
He wants to the certain or with the bottoons ? &quot; &quot; &quot; Stonewashed &quot; or &quot; aciwashed &quot; ?
&quot; You want them ? &quot;
&quot; Sow the path of them or street ? Bla bla bla bla -- &quot; Continuate it .
I was saying , and after a little bit , and after a little bit of I could say , &quot; I want the kind of -- that was the only guy that was , so for a &quot; thing that was , so for a little jeans , and I got out of the store , and then use of the best , and I &apos;ve ever had .
It was the maximum . I got all that choice .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a book at to understand it .
The reason I was worse for the whole thing that I was worse with all that choice , jeans had to be perfect .
I was waiting to me . I didn &apos;t expectations of it was just a kind of thing , but when there was a lot of it , but when you live 100 different , hundred different , hundred of it .
What I was good at the buster was good , but not perfect .
After I talked to that choose to what I was going to introy the expectations .
The adaddition of options in life doesn &apos;t make it to increase the expectations of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the people don &apos;t make the expectations in
And this product less satisfying , even when the results are good .
Nobody in marketing world of marketing .
Because if they knew it , you would not know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is the truth .
&quot; It was better when it was worse when it was worse , &quot; The reason that was better when you were worse when you were worse , it was going to meet the surprised of the surprised .
Excitizens , in the world we live -- opulents , industrialized citizens with the perfection of perfection -- the massive thing to be in the height of the height .
You never surprised places because your expectations , my expectations , they &apos;re ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Basse , &quot; You want to expectations . &quot;
I mean , little self-time time time -- that I &apos;m going to move -- which is really study .
I couldn &apos;t have to do better , I didn &apos;t have to be able .
But it &apos;s not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of buy a couple of jeans switing when there &apos;s only that you &apos;re not satisfacts , and ask you , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot; And he said , &quot;
The world is responsible . What could I do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a jeans , and you ask you who is the responsible , is otherwise you &apos;re the responsible responsible , is otherwise you .
You could have to do better .
With hundreds of variety , there are no screen for the insuccess .
So when people are decisions , even though the result is valid , they feel insodented and they give the college and they give the college .
In the last few years of depression is exploss in the industrialized world .
I think a fatter meaning -- not the only one , but it &apos;s important -- of this wonderful wonderful , is that people are experiences of the depression of the people are too high .
And when they need to explain this situation thought that the color is them .
So the end result is that in general , we &apos;re better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely false . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than it &apos;s not to have a little bit better than it &apos;s better than a little bit .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve been surgery by a piece of the level where our life .
Now , from the political point of view -- I &apos;ve almost finished -- from the political point of view , the nocle is .
What allows all this is in the industrial society is the material of the material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , which is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too much pocks .
So , I &apos;m talking about it is a malesclusive to be modern , remember that &apos;s a lot of the Western society .
And what it makes it to be involved .
I mean that these choices , complicated and dispendious , is not that they &apos;re just inuseful .
They &apos;re going to be addition .
They &apos;re worse .
If a little bit of what our society allows , it would be revered in those where people have too few possibilities , it would not be impressed to be impractical .
This is what economists call a paretian improving improvement .
A retroduction of the reduction is good at all -- not just the poor -- not just to the poor -- because of this choice .
To conclude , &quot; You can become everything you want to become everything you want &quot;
You , people are you , you &apos;re thinking , &quot; But what does it believe ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t make it in a glass . &quot;
&quot; An imagination , a limited view of the world --
and I &apos;m interpret that I interpreted in this .
But then , I realized that , I realized that that fish the length knowledge .
Because the reality of fact is that if you &apos;re handle in the broke , so that &quot; everything is possible . &quot; You get the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you can get the broke in a way that all diminutes you can diminutes the sofation .
You get the paralysis , and you reduced the well-being .
They all need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too street , maybe even in the fish , and of course for us .
But the absolutely symbolic symbolic for happiness and , I &apos;m in the rovine .
Thank you very much heart .
