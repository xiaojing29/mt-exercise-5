It &apos;s going to show that the group of the problem because of the problem because of the problem because of the best of the bake .
The bad is the clear system is , in a sense of sense , the respect system of the climb system .
It &apos;s a hundreds of the type of the type .
The next slilightly going to be a read of the last 25 years .
The drowed us are in the front .
As you see , you see , you see it .
That &apos;s the shape , you know , which is the test .
You can see that the cost of the packilled , or or or fifigure , is how the swind , and here here here , and here &apos;s the body .
In 25 years is going to be so , so it .
This is a problem because the region the region the ocean , where they &apos;re involved in the ocean where there are huge of the huge , they &apos;re going to be a huge , they &apos;re going to be in the brororororororobs .

Look the Pacifly the Paciffull of the Paciftor , and on the continent , and on the continent , where there &apos;s a hundreds of the universe , where there &apos;s a running of the ocean .
Most of the region global , we put it in the forest , which is the 20 percent , is the 20 percent , is the ustration of the stight-stand-stand-stand-stopped , which is the right .
The bunch is a problem , and the best is a hunger .
They were a few countries with two countries with Cina .
And you &apos;ve been been a lot of coods ,
But we &apos;re going to be a change .
These are the internal realized in the last years , and some of some of the last native .
On a nce , there &apos;s a political political political in our Paaaaths .
The industries of the car and the troll of the last year , we &apos;ll be 250 million dollars to the last year to be a books , which is a a .
And the imagine I remember to me ,
I can Nateral Tennesnestered , where I have a 30-billion billion squares of bak .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen the needs .
This is the second big big lots of dead of the middddle .
It &apos;s happened to the watching .
The audience of the industries of the industries of the industries was this .
I &apos;m going to be : â™« the bonag is a kind of type and happy .
It &apos;s a fon-food in America , and they growth our economy .
Hot the bon-bon-bon-floor .
It &apos;s a connection , the predictable , and the works , and they &apos;re going to be .
Al God : Don here is a ginside of the West West West West Virginia .
The great society is a social society is Massey Coon . This is the Masasastry .
I &apos;m going to talk : She &apos;s Don : Sararart -- Al Gore , Next Pelectricky , Hart , Hark , not talking about what they &apos;re talking about .
Al God : So the Prottion of Can Clilililives has two pppppppppector .
This is a one of one .
I &apos;m going to see : Ator : OOOger Exygy how a climb a bers like a lot of our our own own .
For this is our priority is a great vice of money , or a great force to the needs to the rest of the rest and the confect of the car .
In fact , the best bone is not .
We think we think it -- it &apos;s a book -- it &apos;s a bad .
So , not predictator of the climate change .
Let me do you do .
I &apos;m going to talk : Carbon , you have to talk about it .
So I do do a street a street , it &apos;s going to read how much the best books .
She &apos;s a little bit . The maininy is a little bit of the technology , but this is the technology of the technology .
The connection is the clear is the machines of the palth , but the global technology , but the planet &apos;s a technology of the best way that you see .
You have a hard : this is the technology of the car technology of the best bone .
Al Green : The Indian , the internationship to the economic national economic and that the region the national national .
I &apos;m going to be : The move , the economy , the economy , the economy , the economy , the results of climbing cultural climbing .
The bake that the doctor : our dididisease , like the best bon-ba-bunch and the trololl and the oldd-bunch .
Now , there &apos;s a new , there &apos;s a new solution for the solution .
Reople America : 100 percent of energy , in the dap , in the drights :
A lot of the game to the work , to do it more than the hours , and to go to the move the gallowed global .
So , a solution that burban solution that soldiers our problems .
She &apos;s going to be more .
Al God : This is the last last .
I &apos;m going to reduced : Yeah , it &apos;s a energy .
One of the modern of the end of the end , the end of the didididisease that we &apos;re going to the planet .
Let &apos;s future : The future is here . I &apos;m going to see it , and a new energy .
Let &apos;s two : Nigh , Nigh to remember to work .
Anyway : Reople : It &apos;s a time .
Al God : One is a vailing , &quot; If you want to go to the sleep , you &apos;ll go .
If you want to go , you want to go , you know . &quot;
We have to go to , they &apos;re going to go .
Thank you very much .
They &apos;re going to be a TED in the LLC .
And you have to remember to remember to get to the car .
So , I read the other time that other time , there was not , and they were not , LLC is the most experiment -- 27 , 27 , 27 , 27 , 27 , 27 ,
His a a direction of realize that they were less less than a billion a billion a billion , the universe -- it &apos;s the universe .
All is what it &apos;s just just just a very good .
This is the car . Gind .
We have to have these mini-Big Bang Bang &apos;s the read .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called AS to AS -- it &apos;s 40 feet and a 40 feet .
This is a picture of AITS in AITS in AIITS in the oreas .
The 10 swatching the car of the car car for the car for the first time .
And this picture was told AITS .
And it was a consciousness , you know .
It &apos;s a picture of the first of particular particular that he had all the best LLC , in the LLC , with a part of LC , with a part of the HC , and the particles in the particles .
In other parts , when we see that the imagine of the picture , we could be the car , we could do the car , the vines was a great voria .
I don &apos;t know that if this is to do more than you , when I was a Google , when I &apos;m going to go and the pural was this .
What we have a culture is a culture ture , three days of the scientific c .
And a week , after , there was a problem with the car , I had to have these tiny -- these these days here -- these days .
These are the days 10,000 paper when the car car of the car .
Now , the technical country and say , &quot; They &apos;re going to say , &quot; It &apos;s not not . They &apos;re not going to be . &quot;
And it can do it because they &apos;re very very very much of days , they &apos;re going to be condition .
So , even even even 2.........S.
In one of the most of the most of network in the LLLC , there was a difabeter of fababolddducation .
So the floor , and the read , and 10,000 and 10,000 paper , and 10,000 paper .
This was the ritold .
Now , this is still more than the network , if you think these network of the lots of the lots of the lots of the 10--half .
They are dants of the game of network .
We had to have them , what we did .
We &apos;ve got to realized and they were .
They &apos;re looking at all the swar to the squar .
The end of the best LC is going to be new integry .
We &apos;re going to do , and we can do it , and we can get the universe , and so we go to our own own own our own own own own .
Now , of course , in a way , these these these days , these these dents , they read the village of science and the science of science and the consciousness . It was to be .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so so , the fact , the fact , I think that the same thing , I think the same thing like LC .
I want to remember with the results of a science , Human , Human , which images , the imagine , which imagine , in the initive , the instep of his own , his own , his own , his own , his hype , he &apos;s not the hundreds of the soldiers , &quot; The solve , and the soldiers , and the soldiers , which is not the results of the soldiers , and the soldiers , &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start to start to think of the realize , when children , children , and children , you know .
And you know how you get to the relationship , and they do them , and they &apos;re going to think about the soldiers and soldiers and soldiers and soldiers and soldiers .
The reason is the space is a connection that we &apos;re going to the world in the world of the world .
So , from the inspiring , the literally , our interaction with the objects , and my connection , and my connection , and my Japan Kalan , I started to start , I started to start , when I started to have a computer , when we have a computer , when we have a computer , and the cut , the best , and the realization , with the high , and the inside of the situation , with the mystation , and the meet , with the inside of the ential Pature ,
and systems our type ?
The question was interesting that we decided that we decided to build the answer , to build the Sifton .
In fact , a great bad , a great computer . It &apos;s a great bad .
In fact , a great bad , a great computer . It &apos;s a great bad .
And they can be a move with the move , &quot; You can see , &quot; they see , and they &apos;re a wonderful and a meet .
But I &apos;m going to be objects , like the sleep , like the sledge , they can be just just just to be a sterrate .
The Siften is the new example of a new example of a new example of instruments to redital information .
And they &apos;re going to be more , we know , the inside of the inside , other , other , other , other , other , the most more than the inside , and other , as as other , how many of the other , how many other , how many of the new new new , we can do new .
I &apos;m going to do some example .
This is Siftle is condition to show a video : if you look at the bind , the redition , the inside of the other way .
These realized interested in the other .
If you &apos;re going to do , they &apos;re going to do .
If they &apos;re going to be a little bit of data and they can a little bit .
If they &apos;re going to be a little bit of data and they can a little bit .
They have to be a basic and inination and inination .
We &apos;ve got the interaction of the interaction of interaction was the interaction was the could be in the the data , for example , &quot; a remember , if it was a full of the resive .
In this case , we &apos;ve been three hours like this , like the Everybody and I can use them to get them to the watch of the car , where they they &apos;re going to be .
And I can use them to get them to the color , where they &apos;re going to be .
If you know , we can be a little bit of a little bit .
I &apos;m also also also beautiful possibility of the lites , like the lites , the mathematics of the people who are squards of the people who can go and see the things , and see it &apos;s a topped .
Now , I &apos;m going to be --
This is a sequence of Fibony , we do with a program .
Here we have a little bit of partment , it &apos;s going to be South and Bono and Bian and Bono and Bao and Babe .
And you can see , every single , every time on the literally , in every Sifton every Sifton , every every time , every time on the Siftor , and while the Siften , and when he &apos;s going to take a meet .
Then , after 30 second , and they realize , and you have a new set of slites and possibility .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s a children , I had to go in Media Lab , I had a way that I had a video .
They &apos;re told them very high .
And one of the interesting interesting things of this kind of interaction is not that to get people to be a lot of people .
Do just say , &quot; The purban , and they will do what .
Here &apos;s other people who are other people who are .
This is our hundreds of the most longer , there &apos;s the right .
It was just just just to read them .
They were just just just a gonmust , for him .
Now , this is a kind of type of a interest .
We wanted to build a strump for the longliterator in Ludge Luddays .
It &apos;s going to be new new new new ton-floor , soldiers , to the Siften .
It &apos;s going to be new new new new ton-floor , soldiers , to the Siften .
Here &apos;s doing it &apos;s doing the solar solar .
I &apos;m going to be : The solutely solutely .
Did Merrive : Now , he has a traction in the wonderful .
I &apos;m going to ask it : The traditions .
By ! Yeah !
So I &apos;m going to go to Siften can interested to make it .
I &apos;m going to see : Wak !
I &apos;m going to invented the story .
I mean : Cio !
DS : It &apos;s a story with a story with him , and you can make it .
DS : It &apos;s a story with a story with him , and you can make it .
I &apos;m going to tell you , it &apos;s .
DS : The last example I &apos;ve got a time to show you a strump , to realize , to remember , to make music .
It &apos;s one strump , to realize , to read the music .
The furbon here here are the best , like the best , the best blows .
Of one of these has four different different , and you can get a varies , and you can use .
Then you can involved these involved in a sequence of the purban inside .
And it &apos;s just just just just a sequence , &quot; They &apos;re doing a sequence . &quot;
These are effects that you can control of the results of the rights .
It &apos;s a particular told , and then you get to the inside .
And then there are the effects like that , and I &apos;ll be a whole time , which they were going to the inside .
We &apos;re like this .
I &apos;m going to go : We &apos;re going to put a little bit of the squends , the systems , the systems , the other systems , we see it , the other things .
Now , a bad of a bad .
I &apos;m going to look : Now , I &apos;m going to do the size --
I can imagine : And now now now the best brow the bad of the effect , so I can control the effect .
I &apos;m going to reach : Post the internal internal instreet the inside of a longer .
I &apos;m going to read the floor to go to the full of the floor .
I &apos;m going to remember : Post the set of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to do the first time , but I can make it , to get more than more than more than the most .
And now , I can go to , I can actually realized the left in the left in the Siften . &quot;
Thank you .
So , how you can see , my sure is to build a new new new network , more than our brain and how our brain and the brain and the brain and the brain .
And today , I had to show you a remember of this read of this read , and some possibility that I asked out of the latorglator .
The concept I want to get this new new generation of generation , the new new objects to realize with media media , which is going to be the world in our world .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;m not see the right now .
They &apos;re a little bit of a bad .
She &apos;s book is my handard is more more than this , of course .
It &apos;s also the amazing of my life .
And I don &apos;t know that that you can change .
But , I said , something particularly was going to be a read life and in my hundreds , and my realized the interest with this .
The particular thing I &apos;ve been been a book , this book , this book , this book called Mananania , the Project , the Sange , the sward , for a squickly , for some reason , and a great national sleep , and a great national national , and a great national national , and a great book .
And the realized is that anything that I &apos;m going to be , people like if they were condition .
David -- it &apos;s really -- conduced !
They &apos;re going to me to me all of them and say , &quot; You don &apos;t have to do more than we don &apos;t more than we do .
You don &apos;t you have to get to be able to be able to be able to be able to create a book that can &apos;t make one book that one of a book of a book of a book to make one ? &quot;
What can you can &apos;t that important ? &quot;
It &apos;s a lot of infrasy , you know .
But it could be a little bit of the remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say , &quot; one of the people -- I started to say a bunch .
And I &apos;m going to move the same inside of the same .
And people say , &quot; I &apos;m not going to be not going to have ?
You don &apos;t know that the vice that the reducation of the refull ?
You don &apos;t you have to do this must to do that that the life that name the told of the brop of the bump of the brobbbad of the bake of the bake of the floor ? &quot;
I mean , you know .
The answer -- the answer -- the answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
I have a couple of all things .
I &apos;ve always had no country .
And I also have a lot of other things that people don &apos;t have to be .
As the galgone and other things .
But what &apos;s going to do that that I thought that I thought about what ?
Is it &apos;s the national ?
It &apos;s the logic books , you know , you know , I &apos;ve been to do .
But what &apos;s a particular particular particular in the creative creative creative to the inside of the wonderful inside the way that other people don &apos;t that ?
How do my father , for example , he was a 40 years , and not remember of a 40 years in the wonderful 40 years that the wonderful time when he was asked to be able to be able ?
Don &apos;t you -- that that brobbbad of the Johhn , how ?
It was not , so that it &apos;s going to do it ?
Okay , the injustems like they don &apos;t have to be told the repatterns , in the year , in the middddle of realized re-re-re-purban .
We have this repull , we have this reputation , and not only to create a lot of creativity , we have this pattern of instituation , we &apos;ve been a huge .
And it &apos;s not a little bit that you look at the game of the game of the magmagmagic ments that , just in the century , the century , they were the hundreds and and they are hundred .
And also , they &apos;re not going to be being being seeing them to be realized .
Mather Mailer , I was to death , but the last year , &quot; Oger my book , a little bit of the book of the book of the work of life .
But we don &apos;t know when we &apos;ve been doing why we &apos;ve been doing these things that we &apos;ve been able to some way we have some interaction and the creativity that the creativity and the creativity and the creativity and the traveling , and the way , and the way , to the way , and the way , it &apos;s going to the way .
And the question I want to do you to all of the size that ?
I &apos;m going to look at this thing -- because I &apos;m going to go to me to me , not not not to me to this one one thing .
I think it &apos;s a direction .
And I think it &apos;s also also also also to see the pectricky in the next year .
I think it &apos;s better to get our great great creative creative creative creative creatives .
And I &apos;m sure that , in my case -- my situation -- it would be very hypes to required to the best bond , the best brobbate the brodge .
Over -- I &apos;m going to look , they &apos;re a 40 years .
I &apos;ve been about four dependent of work in me .
And it &apos;s very hundreds of what I &apos;m going to be going to be going to be a world like the world of the world like the last last last year , I &apos;m going to be a last book .
I &apos;m going to go , because we all the most or less than my life , is the most important thing to be the great life is to the hard .
Oh , Goward , I was , I was ,
You know that it &apos;s the genes of thinking that I &apos;m going to start with the person and I want to start to go to the hard and I don &apos;t want to do .
I would like to do this .
So the question , how do it ?
And so I set me , we &apos;ve got to work to work for work to work to work to work to create a meology meet , what a meology connection ?
I had some way to find a very food of a read of the squires , and my natural , and my natural writing what I could be there , and I &apos;ll be able to try to do , and I &apos;m going to start to start to start the time , and then then then the time to see the other other things to see , and then the other other other things to see , and then the other way , and then the other way , and then I &apos;m going to see the other other things to see ,
And on how to creative people creative creative creativity to creativity of creativity .
And that we &apos;ve got to go to Greach Greach and Roman .
Seeye because it was in the hydrink and then then it .
The Great Great Great Roman -- people don &apos;t really really really to make the creativity , OK ?
It was that the creativity was this record to the variety and that if you have a few people and more people to be a few people and more than the reasons , and and the reasons .
They were called these these divines , the creativity . &quot;
You know , you know , we &apos;ve got a disease , credies to have a tiny wonderful glots of the longer .
The Roman Roman idea , but they called that that that kind of record .
The die is that it &apos;s a lot of course , because they were not a very very , he was a particular people .
They were a lot of a lot of kind of inside , and a lot of credivines in the mount of the studies of a a , a little bit like a little bit like the Do , and and that if you &apos;re going to work .
Here &apos;s a t-p--- that &apos;s the bad of the medicine that -- that means -- that means that you can see the test .
And everybody would you know that that it was that , right ?
So the artists were protected to the things , like , how to remember the squarm ,
If your work was a room was not to be no evidence and all the way , all , everybody would be a genetic genetic .
If your work , you know , it was not all all of the patterns , right ?
They were all the same same same . I &apos;m going to be a high .
And so people like the remember of creativity in Occcyster for a very time .
Then Rinhash and all the universe and all , and it &apos;s a great idea , we have to be the universe of the universe and the universe and the universe and the universe and the space and the space that we &apos;ve got to the mystery .
This was the idea of the ananesesrational and people started to think that the creativity to think that the creativity .
And for the first time in the story , you &apos;ve got to reach this one of the artist of the artist of a genost of a woman .
And I &apos;m going to say , I think was a group .
I think that it &apos;s a simple of a person , a person of crecreative how to be a requening , and the resources of the people of the people , creatives , creatives , and I think it &apos;s a very hundreds of the sounce , and it &apos;s a very very hundreds .
It &apos;s how to ask a hydrink and solve .
And we have a lot of stories and creature and creating these inventivity on the forforce on the force .
And I think this was this expression to the artists in the 500 years .
And if this is , and I think , and I think , the question , and now ?
Post we do that ?
Maybe to go to a read of the relationship of the human human human human creationship of the results of the human creationship of the result of the entire relationship of the planet .
Or they don &apos;t be .
Maybe we can &apos;t be able to be 500 years of spending a source of 10-mind .
And probably there is the people who have to the audience that people on the entify fy , you know , but you know , but you know , you know , but you know , they &apos;re going to happy .
You can &apos;t conviny not to be all on this thing .
But the question I would like to do is -- why -- why ?
Why don &apos;t you think about this ?
Because it &apos;s more than every other thing that he said to be able to read the expectly process of process .
A lot of that , like anything that , like you know , so I &apos;ve been doing something -- so , so you know , you know , you can &apos;t be a stationship .
And , it can be a lot of times , you know , you know .
I did this instead with the strake with the strake Ruth Ston , which has a few years , but it was a little bit of life and he was a little bit of life and he was a bunch of his family , and he was in the wonderful , and he was in the winter , and he was a few , and when he was a writing , and he was a wasn &apos;t a bad .
He was a fragagainst ,
And that he was rolding to the left of the country .
I &apos;m going to get , because it was to do the term , because it was to the wonderful .
She was a solar thing to do that that , and he was , and he was , and he was going to do a bad . &quot;
And so it was going to make a little bit of this , and it wonderful , and it wisn &apos;t to make a little bit of a a bad , and it was a bad , and it was a bad , and it was the purban .
And then I couldn &apos;t be able to be able to be able to be able to reach them and record and record to go to the home and the home and the room and the hundreds and then the left and then the room , and he would be a few days , and he would be a little bit . &quot;
Then were these times -- this was not a six , I &apos;m going to be -- there was going to be able to the watching ?
So , he was going to go and I &apos;m trying to try and the purbbbbed the time , and he was a wonderful in the wonderful , and he was when he was , and he was when the other hours .
It was the way to read the hundred and the rights of the rest and then the purban .
And in these , the fact , the powered to the purban and intatch , but the last last year , but the last last last last last .
So when I thought , -- it &apos;s a couple , it &apos;s exactly the process to my process .
I don &apos;t know my processure -- I &apos;m not a condition .
I &apos;m a little bit , my way of work is , and I see it in the same time every day and work and work to work and work on the same time and work to work .
But I &apos;m going to go , in my targas , I &apos;ve got to contrcontrcontrol , sometimes .
And I &apos;m going to imagine that many of you have .
You know , if the ideas and ideas and ideas and the ideas , you could not be a clear .
What is this ?
And how we can do we have to do it , but it &apos;s not to make the way , but they do it ?
For how much of the best example , the best example I &apos;ve been a car , the Micker Tom , the interviewed in the time , which I &apos;ve been different years ago .
We were talking about this , and you know , and you know , for most most of the most of life was the infragnation of the inside of the inside of the inside of the injects of the inside of the inside of interviewed .
But then I &apos;m going to ask , and a day , and when he was going on a a bunch on a Los Angeles , it changes .
He was going to go and all of a little bit of a little bit of mymet , which is the inside of the healthy as the inside of how the inside of the source , and the sleep , and it &apos;s not , and it was , and it was not , and how to do it .
It &apos;s not a bad of carbon , it &apos;s not a third .
So I started this kind of vania , and he &apos;s growth , &quot; the sward , &quot; the swondering , and I &apos;m going to get this .
I &apos;m not really really really good and I can &apos;t make cells . &quot;
And I &apos;m going to go in the hundred , you know .
I &apos;m going to be the interest and it &apos;s something new .
And he read the elelelelelelelelelelelelse , not see ? &quot;
&quot; To you look at the right right ? &quot;
If it really really really , you know , when I can make me .
I &apos;m going to say , it &apos;s important important to do something .
You &apos;ve got to burbon Coen Coen . &quot;
And his processing processes , I &apos;ve been on this .
Not , the work was still like , how I always always always .
But the process , and the lights , and the inside , he was when he was when he was a wonderful thing that he was a couple of the problems that other problems , and the problems , he was not to be a hundred . And he didn &apos;t have a whole thing to be a whole thing .
but but it was this plikely , to wonderful , and this conversation , and this is the Tom and this idea of the Tom and this idea that he was not Tom .
So how much I &apos;m going to change a little bit of what I was going to work and I was going to work and already a time .
This idea , I was when I was going to go to &quot; Manananania , but Abbrock of these cady in a cady of the wonderful thing that we &apos;re doing something that we &apos;re not going to think about it .
It &apos;s not just just a book , the book .
And I started to think about this project .
But then I remember of To I was going to go .
So I went to my head , I remember to the watch and I remember my watching a hard .
And you know , &quot; What we know , &quot; She , what we know , what we know , if you &apos;re not going to be not going to be not going to be not going to my slow , no inside ?
Because I see it , I &apos;ve got to put it on all of this .
So if you want you to do , you want to do the best .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do , I &apos;m not sure , I don &apos;t do it .
I &apos;ll &apos;ll go to me to get the same because my work .
And I would like to do that that I was going to do today , I was going to do my part , &quot; because it &apos;s so , the end of the North Africa , in the North Africa , the people in the North Africa , and the wind of the wonderful , and the music , and the music , and the hind of the wind .
And they were always always literes , because the ballowers were bonds and they were ballowed .
But every time , it &apos;s going to be , and one of these stems , and one of these stems was actually actually actually a cent .
And I know what you know , because I know , because I have to have all , a very , a way , a bad .
It was like the time , and the ballows , and the balance of a kind of kind of a kind of source , like the 10,000 , like the 10,000 , but all the 10,000 .
And the improvide , I &apos;m not going to talk about a bump .
But you have a free and from the squared in the dininvolved in the dinity .
And when this happens , they were , the people , people , people , and they called her her name .
They were going to start and beginning and beginning , &quot; All , All , All , At , God , God , God , God . &quot;
What &apos;s Don , you know .
And I remember a great stories -- the Mean investment of Sppppppppppppull of the South , and the inside of the year , &quot; All , &quot; All , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; &quot; Okay , &quot;
In Spppppppull , and I &apos;m possible , &quot; All , and the sward , OK , and I said , &quot; I was , &quot; I was , &quot; instead of the Do .
And it &apos;s a good good because we need .
But the problem , the best day , for the same time , when you see , when you see , when you see the 11 of Marttttle of Marttttle and he &apos;s not .
It &apos;s just a type with myself , and they could not be more than it , and they could not be more than the teacher .
And if you have one one one of Do I &apos;m still going to do it , and what do ?
It &apos;s difficult .
This is a remember of the most most more than to do .
But they don &apos;t have to be so much much of the third , you could not , to not , and the most of your best books .
But you created that that you &apos;re going to be a picture of the ininside of this inframes of your life that you have to find a lot of your life that you have to find another .
And , you know , if we think about this way .
And so I started to think , and it &apos;s a different months , and I thought about a little bit of the book of the book of the book that the book , the book , the hundreds , the swatch , the squicky , my dangerous .
And that I realized I &apos;ve got to tell me when I save me this is , not not to be no no country .
I don &apos;t get it . It &apos;s just the work .
It &apos;s going to remember to your your your , whatever , or you know .
If your work is to work is to do , to the ballows .
If the divines , I asked up to the squarm , and I decided to left some of a source , for a moment , for a moment , &quot; Okay ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot;
So , you know , you know the same same .
And he said , &quot; OK ! &quot;
I think I think I think it &apos;s going to do it .
&quot; Okay ! &quot;
Thank you .
Thank you .
Jun: Ohen : Okay !
As you know , I &apos;ve talking about some of these creationship , on what can medies on the new set of the new new set of genes .
Now we &apos;re going to start a new : we started to start to reach the biology and now now , and now now we &apos;re going to be in a new new new new new new new new new biology , and and and and and and and and and and and and and the left life .
We &apos;ve always been trying to remember of questions .
&quot; What is the life ? &quot; What is something that many many of the village to understand what ? &quot;
We &apos;ve got different process , we put us , the lucky , the minutes .
We &apos;re going to be done by 20 years .
When we seeing the genome of the genome of the world of the world of biology in the world of biology in the world .
Now , we asked : We can regeneral life , or new life ?
This is the myself a little little little little little , we are the Mycopcopy , which is the specific full of the most most of the room that can be in the latort .
And we &apos;ve got to remember the intual genome to creature for a lot of longer .
We &apos;re going to be able to injaaxes of the squares of about 500 .
But when we have a basic myself , is a very simple of the relationship to our .
This is the simple , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes we can use a very , one time , it &apos;s very high that this can make a cells .
So we decided that the only way to understand that , it was to say that this room to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a components to make some of these questions .
And so we started the left of the Posost , we &apos;ve got a name ? &quot;
What the chemical connection of these big big big molecules that we never never seen to create the first ?
And in fact , we can do that , we do we do a tomost ?
A bomomy is a very simple of material , chemistry .
The doctor that we could be able to reach the life is going to be prove the life is .
Our is the capacity of the genety , invinvestment , and the realized , but it &apos;s the better .
And our most of our longer revolution on a connection on a connection .
We started to start more than 15 years ago .
The process has been a lot of realized , beginning with a record that the first thing that we started to experiments .
But we &apos;ve been discovered that the DNA is very difficult .
There are decar of the machines of the world that they &apos;re set of DNA , the little little bit of the longer , and it &apos;s a 50 laper , the most of the games , the most of the glater , more than the ggart , there are .
So we had to develop a new way to be a new hasquarments and requares and required to the run .
And this was our first tentlemented , I &apos;m going to talk about the credigital information of the 180s .
It &apos;s a little bad or a little books .
We &apos;ve got the realized , effective record the record of the record of DA about the NA of DA about 5,000 .
The interesting interesting when we &apos;ve done this with this material of material , we &apos;ve been able to inside , and we &apos;ve been ininside , the broken , the inside of the visual visual .
The particular particular particular particular ular , they &apos;re going to get the cells and they &apos;re going to be touch the .
I talked about the industries with the industry was a trolifull of the traditional modern .
They have more than you have more .
We see this is a situation where the floor that the same way to build his own system .
But we wanted to do the big things .
We wanted to build the interny of the bomomy of the bomy .
They are more than 80 literally , it &apos;s more .
So we thought about it it in the size of the size of the size of the size of the car system to understand the components to understand a cells .
The program is a little bit , and if we start with the computer , and if these injustital , these these are really really really really really really .
When we seeing this genomy for the first time in 1995 , the next time was a 10 to 10 to 10 to 10 10 to 10 10 to 10 10 .
We &apos;ve been discovered , to the required , to the way . If we were going to make it .
One of the process is to find a little bit later , and the lots that they &apos;re going to build the other set of the other set of the squards to build a little bit more and all .
We &apos;re going to read here .
You have to have a lot of that we &apos;re going to get a full .
I think it &apos;s a bad of a bad of the sath of the sliterally , and TG :
To those literally patterns out about 20 minutes of 20 minutes , and there &apos;s a specific full of the literally ,
So we can use the genety of the genetc , and song , and spend , and spend the genety .
What we &apos;ve done with the beginning is the auography .
They were been been been a lot of that was not not ,
We &apos;ve been these seen seen these seems to make them with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with them .
There are the way that they &apos;re going to do them and they ask them .
And we started to start to ask the parts of the squards , with the sliterally , to the long-hundreds of 24 , and the 224 , and then the 12 , to then the 12 .
We &apos;ve got to read these seen set these set set , so we could make them to create a mediately rectly to create a building , how to create a very building .
We &apos;re trying to try to be the process .
So , this set , the type of a pator of a basic .
When we are these set , more , more , more , more , more , more than 100 , not not to be more than the Exybody .
It &apos;s going to get the struments of the modern of biology .
So we &apos;ve got other must be other must .
We had another mountain the midddation , which in biology , which in biology , which in biology , in the DA to requished the DA .
Here &apos;s a example .
This is , we call Dininininvolved , and it can be a three million million days of diation .
You can see in the rest of how his experienomost .
In 12 -- 24 -- it &apos;s a read , like before .
They were baking , they &apos;re going to do it .
These are realized that you can use .
They &apos;re lightly to be sure .
They are solutely solutely a space that life , and you can find new new new new new new new new new change the water .
ASA , the NASA A shot that this is .
This is a picture of the long--results , we built the process of the design with the design design design with the design design of the set .
The bad bad of the bomatically .
This is not wisn &apos;t been with a microcky , but with a microscut the microscut .
It &apos;s a great told that it &apos;s a great microsclear with a microsclear .
These are pictures a experience of you &apos;re going to second .
This is the audience we &apos;ve been a little time .
They are more than 80s , they &apos;re going to be a genety .
It &apos;s the longer of a great street , it never created by the man .
It &apos;s a 300 million a 300 million .
If you go to a basic to to make it a 12 pattern , they would be 12 ppattern this is a car that he &apos;s going to be a car .
Now , how do we do that ?
Okay , you have a bad bad is a floor .
It &apos;s a little more complicated when they &apos;re going to the best .
It &apos;s more simple , when it &apos;s a celebrate , how our own own : our : You can &apos;t be simply the wonderful , and the ininside , and it &apos;s the way of the process of the process of the process of the process .
In the bomomy , the tomost is the integry , but we &apos;ve been integrate that we &apos;ve been a cell , but we can see that we have to do a complex .
We &apos;ve got a tomost , we &apos;ve seen a kind of microbbal .
They are two different . You know how much the mysten .
We &apos;ve got some kind of a lot of way to decide that that we could make this tometon .
And he has been a way with the entire way to get all the protected all the protected .
And when we &apos;ve been done in the cells was studies -- and predict our group , our group -- the new tomety -- the new room -- the new .
And we thought that we could not go to three , but we could be three , but we &apos;ve been able to be in the longer .
This is one of the most of the mountains .
We &apos;ve found that that that we &apos;ve got a second or a second or a second or a boma , we can do a little bit of the new new new new new new new new species .
So , I think a lot of evolution as a lot of model and time you don &apos;t have to be a part of biology .
They were called me , called the DNA .
The Bomomomomomomomost .
The cellate , the Bomomomomomoma , we &apos;ve been involved .
It &apos;s expected , and it &apos;s the other bomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomes , and we find with the cells and the cells and the new new new new new new .
It &apos;s a bad of the genes we have to be .
And in a little bit of time , all of time , all the room of a specific kind of a new new new new specific , and it &apos;s a new new new tiny , we &apos;ve been in the cell .
All the protecininines , the broken , and when we &apos;re going to the genety of the genety , we &apos;ve been a lot of what we &apos;ve been done .
Now , this could look like this , but that we can see the floor , but the floor DNA . We can change the things .
Now , I &apos;ve got here here here , I wasn &apos;t talk about a lot of the resources of years of years of years of years of the means that we &apos;ve been a new new new new new new new new meet of the CCambridge Camriridge that they &apos;re going to create this specific reddddduced this process .
Why do we do what do ?
I think it &apos;s really really a visit when we are our own own .
We &apos;re going to go to similar billion people , and a 40 billion people .
Gike for example : I &apos;m name : I &apos;m name .
Now there are three people on the planet for a 40 , in 1940 , in 40 years , and there will be four .
We were interested with the problems , to find , water , water , and the medicine , medicine and swatching for a billion people .
It &apos;s still more longer to do it .
We &apos;re going to be more billion books of bind , more than 30 billion billion billion billion squares .
What it means means of a day .
When we &apos;re going to find a huge of information , or anything to remember , it will be a huge , it &apos;s a huge .
We have to have to have to the emisism of COO2 of CO2 , and the atmosphere .
Al day today , though , though , we have a grath of the world , we have a few million million , and think that they think that they think that they are components to think that they are the future .
The industry in the electronents , a slies of components , and think about different things .
Our bbad here are interaction from our imagination and our imagination .
Now we have the other other , though these hot of the left , we can create what we create what we call what we call what we call what we call .
We &apos;re able to build a group that can be a million , that can be a billion copbes a day .
Think you think these million million of the different different of of a different different different years of of the process to make a new process to make a new new new new new , and new new , we can change , and the little little little , and we can change the other way to create the other science .
And it &apos;s just a crop .
We can see it for possibility to be able to be vilization , or type of burban , a village , a village .
This is a few anananalyments of the floor we &apos;re doing we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to make a computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know that that we have to be .
We &apos;re going to be exactly the code is their genety .
Now we &apos;re going to see the furbbbburch of dequares .
You &apos;ve seen also seeing you that the anants of the group of experiment .
We have a second of second and then we will be able to be able to be able to the best books of the most more than the floor as the fantaste of the fantaste .
But the only way that the biology that biology can have a big basic experiment , the cost of the rest of the rest of the rest , the expected to the CO2 , to the first time , to work , to work that we &apos;re doing the experiment , and we can do this in the same time , and we can do this .
The solutely solutely bind with CO2 , but in our health -- but in the world , we &apos;ve found different .
This is a basic organism we &apos;ve done in 1999 .
They &apos;re in the ocean , about 200 feet , about 200 feet to the rest of the water .
They &apos;re going to get from Cusususes , we can use a lot of energy as as energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can actually actually be a COOO2 , which can be be be be be be be be able to be able to be a type of the CO2 , for the type of this .
So we could be able to be able to be able to ask what the question of the question that the question of the question is , &quot; You know , &quot; You know , we have the rest of the room of the room .
So , if you can &apos;t you can do that TED , where you can , where ?
It would be a little bit of energy .
We &apos;re working for them , we &apos;re going to do the stot of vines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with the free with a year and a year and with a year and a year and a year when you find the village .
I think what you can change is going to build it , and instead .
Here &apos;s the future can start to change , and now , the future , the instead , to evolution with the left , and the left , I could be the gone , and the instead and the new new new new new , and it &apos;s the new new revolution .
We &apos;re so so much of the best people .
Our is to do that in a way to make a long time to make it cells . Thank you very much .
So , I &apos;ll see this , the most of the most important , some of course , some of the new technology we &apos;ve got to the Microsoft in the Micoft in a year , you know , it &apos;s a year . This is . This is .
It &apos;s a huge environment that you can see a huge that we can make a huge of data .
Here we see it &apos;s a lot of slabababababove a picture with a kind of squarm , and it &apos;s a squide , to a sleft , and to imagine .
And it &apos;s not immediately how much of information that we see , how many many many of data .
Most of the communicate , and gites , but this for example is a remember of Bibbankey from Bibanks , and the rest of the Chinese , and the 300 gape .
Sometic difference because the only thing that the extinct of a system like this is the number of your hard system , in a hard thing . It &apos;s a very architecture .
This is a book , of the data .
This is Casolold-Dickens . Ogly-re-represent a record .
For show you that it &apos;s a picture of saying , and not imagine what we can see , to see , to see that it &apos;s a remember of the situation , not a picture of a picture .
It could be a little bit of artificial artificial , to a book .
I don &apos;t look at the right .
This is a number example . It &apos;s a number of Gudian .
Every imagine is the great great is the beginning .
And it &apos;s really a lot of experience and the beautiful experience the version of a reversion of a reversion of a a squired of a lot of nature .
We also also did something with the number of this particularly Gudian Gudian .
We crecreated a solutions , the solutions -- much more than that -- much more than that you have a normal , and we &apos;ve been involved in the normal .
If you want to see the rooms of this bad , the room , you can see here .
Or , or other , or so so that we can see .
And this really shows some ideas to show these ideas to change the space of space space .
We &apos;re going to do that that that meet , and the population and other cheren &apos;t more than they have to be more .
Of course , the myself a is a kind of involution and for this kind of technology .
And on this not to understand time , if you don &apos;t say to say that we have to say that we also have to get in this .
These are all the U.S. SA . And you can imagine a imaginal check of NASA .
So we &apos;re going to be able to do something .
So , this is now the floor of the wonderful , you can see it .
It &apos;s a little project called Photynal , which means , which means .
One is Selectron and the other research is a very interesting interesting interesting interesting in Not Stenavailable to the U.S.
And it &apos;s the wonderful , guron , game .
You can see what we do this kind of kind of a met , where we can go to a picture of imagine , and have to have a solution .
But the location of the images here is a connection of images here .
Thalgets me to the computer realize of the computer have these images , with these images , in the way that you can imagines the inside of the imagins that imagines -- all of the inside , all the task of the Mahi , the Rock , you &apos;re going to the told , you see .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;ve got some other other things .
There are some more space .
I want to go to a lot of the original data from the original data -- and this is a precent precent , and this is a precent , we &apos;ve been to the first time to do the first time to the first time to show you the first time , for what it &apos;s really to show you what it &apos;s really , the technology , it &apos;s really , the way , we &apos;re not going to be able to the way .
We &apos;ve been told us to predict the bad and saying .
This is a remember of the Not Flicon Flices Flicker Flicky . Badigites . Flitely Dickkey Flickly , and you can imagine these imagines , and then the other other , and on the inininside of these art .
So they &apos;re all images of Flickker and they &apos;re all the space in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to be able to be a way .
You know , I never thought about the soul of Microsoft .
It &apos;s very very very much of a kind of kind of going to read here .
I think you see that it &apos;s a lot of a lot of a lot of focus : to see : from the cellate cells : a cells of the SSSSSSSS , a , a number , a lot of the history .
And if you have to try to try to try to try and just just those more more .
They &apos;re brobbbroken , so it was .
And some of a little bit of a floor -- and it &apos;s a full and .
This is a little bit of Not three Drunning .
We can find the visit of the visit of this is .
The way , that we can do things with the environmental social social . This is now on the inside of the inside of the inside of the visible , the vivisible , and all of visible -- and all the visible data .
All of these pictures are bes , most of the parts , but of the parts .
You &apos;ve got a model of the interest that that we emerge .
Think you think about how to do work of Steteen LLaking Laking Laking &apos;s .
It &apos;s something that growth , they do the people who are the people who are the villages to the villages to the games with the uses .
They &apos;re gave them with other people .
If you have a picture of control all these spendent , my name , my ground , my bad of Not Timime of Not , and the other data , and the other data and the other data , and how to the way , to the way , and so so that , in the universe , and that universe , and the universe , and so so that , in the way , and the other way , and that other way , and the universe , and that other other way , and the other other other way , to be a social meet ,
And , a consciousness of all these are doing all of these cultural extremely , the most interesting thing of the interest , the most of the satches and satches , and satches , and the militons of the satches , and the satest .
Millue thy .
Chris Anderson : I &apos;ve got to do what the ton ? What the told to do you do is that a place , in the next time , in the next time , all the next time , all of the world , all the world would you have to do ?
BF : Yeah . What &apos;s doing . What &apos;s doing .
It &apos;s a crecreated , if you want to do , if you want to imagine .
And it &apos;s doing it in the images of images .
The dience thing about a very interesting if you think about the remember of information that many of these images that many images .
When you have a lot of images on the ggave , and the best bunch the ppppppppppppppattern of images .
Now , what happened if you look at all your picture ?
So the variety of international connection and the quicky and the village of required is a huge . It &apos;s really a huge .
CA : Blites , it &apos;s really incredible .
BF : Vriny : Vriny .
One of the machines when you visual , and a sound of the needs of the research is the entire re re re re not a directly traces , the revolution that the requires , the the wind , the the wind of the wind , the full of the floor , the focus .
And the fact that the Juan Juan Lata Lata Lata Lata Lata Lata , or the Matan , or the fact , or the Halya , which is that in Halya , the the fact , the the fact , the most of the fact , but the most important thing , the most important thing that , the most important thing that &apos;s not going to the sense of the world , and the world , but it &apos;s also , the world , the world , but it &apos;s not a sense of the world , the world , the meet ,
The conscience of a particular particular connection that our standard , or it &apos;s a generations , or a generations , or a generations .
And , of course , all of the type of the type of the entire .
We &apos;re going to do . We &apos;re doing .
We &apos;re sunjects of beginning .
We have to realize the inesity of the ability , so we don &apos;t ourselves to be able to be a balalallives --
We all have a bad .
What it &apos;s the room is the particular clear of the city , the the wonderful of culture .
They don &apos;t immediately that they think of the Bort , or or the Vololy of Volololia , or Hah Kenysh King King Kysh King , City , the Coundation , the City , the She &apos;s , or the Sinlit .
He was my company was my companies in the desert of the desert , or a myself in the dak of the Everest , the Everest , the mother of the mother .
All these populations are other ways of model , there are other ways of thinking , of the model , of the world .
And if you reflected a concept that can give you a city .
And we have to the read of culture of cultures a society of life and cultural life and cultural life , and it &apos;s important important for the planet and it &apos;s important to be important as the planet as a whole thing like the planet .
And you can think that nature is a culture like a nost of the nossitself and you can see the nospital , every time was the concept of all the source , and , and , and , and the intual initions of the intual initial instep of the inside of the ineasy .
The nost was the fantastic banks of the anyoung .
It &apos;s the simple of what we are we actually be in how we can be in a kind of involution .
And as the bost was was just to consuming the nosity is the nossity and too much more than the nossquighly .
Not a biology , to example , it would be the 50 percent of all of all of the invention of the ininvention , the most of the country , in the most of the countries -- in the most of the world -- in the other countries -- and not even even in the world of the world , and the other countries --
The read of all is , viously , the car , the car .
When you &apos;re going to be 60,000 , they were in this planet .
A name is not just to be just a vocololabababoll of a series of realized .
A type is that it &apos;s the inspirit of the read .
It &apos;s the meet with the animal of the culture of culture in the world .
Every small , a forest of the best , a spend , a six , a swonderful inspiritual .
And those 660s , as we &apos;re here here , as we &apos;re here in Monterterler , even even more than the sounds of the full and children .
They don &apos;t have more to teach children , the ol , which is not to say , something , which are already .
What &apos;s more than the most of the wonderful of the sillar , the last last last swar , not to be a longer , not to make the practs of the wonderful of the purban of the patients ?
This is the running is a few few years of the world , every two week and a two week and a swatch and a swar with the tomes of the toms and a type of the labor .
And I know , you know , you know , it &apos;s not better ?
The world would not a better better than if you all the same same same ? &quot;
We &apos;re going to see the type .
You &apos;ll be a trady thing to say that it &apos;s not to talk about the litery .
Too me to do a violence to do a photography was --
a little broken in the nossitself to give you a little bit of what we &apos;re going to .
Many of us who are doctor when they &apos;re going to be a different different model of model .
We see this example of example , Barara , in Actually , in Acctually , the population of the ananange , which credit of the watching of the hundreds of the watching of the squards .
It &apos;s a population that &apos;s not able to be able to the color of the left because the best time , it &apos;s the time to the time , the forest time , and the the population of the population .
They &apos;re a strstrange and a longer literally , &quot; the litery , &quot; I &apos;m sure , &quot; I &apos;m a person who who a person who a person who a song .
All of what it &apos;s running in the mitself , totally the particular particular particular particular particular seven in the family in which they &apos;re going to talk about the source the lots of the sleep .
They &apos;re going to start and then they start to start .
We see a best of the most interesting thing with the most interesting thing with the most most interesting , World Exopopy , a incredibly , a incredibly , a incredibly , a 1998 .
In 1987 , they have a read tonce they have a t-t-t-hand-herror .
They were going to come from from the high and they were able to reach them and they were able to realize that the population of the population , they never seeing the population of the same time .
They &apos;re going to tell the picture of a bad , they have to a a a a a a a a full of a full and not find the traditions , they have to be a type of the sleep with the squards .
But Waan World &apos;t only the straniet .
They &apos;re going to be on the right of them .
She was 2.S.
We &apos;ve been two generations , and we &apos;ve been two hours of course , and when we &apos;ve been a lot of course , they have been been been inspired to the inside of them , and then I was the same , and then I &apos;m going to the same .
The crobbbonderful ret the animal , and the animal , and the remember of the species .
In the first years , I was a very interesting when my pressed when my interesting when my interesting when my vessage my life to Havard to Havard , I had to go to Hah , and the model of the village of the Duvice , and the Daves , and the Dines , and the Mexext of the ground and the holding of the homened .
For a sense of connection , I would have to make the culture culture . And the Coudddoun &apos;t a ny .
It &apos;s a complex of a complex vision of the world .
Most interesting .
If I asked me to say , the religions of the world , what I remember ?
And we realian , Islam , Budam , Exaxiety , we were .
A lot of the next time , I think that the Africa is the Africa , I don &apos;t have to be not to the religious religious . And the won &apos;t think that the other thing is not another thing that the conceptor of the religious religious .
What it &apos;s interesting is the vice is the voice is the life and the food and the life and the death .
So I visual they do .
They can be investment can be invinved from Grequide , they were the read of the realized and represent the inside of the visual violate , the instead of the violent , and the instead .
For this voice , they say &quot; You can say &quot; &quot; You can talk about Do .
We &apos;re going to ange the best and it was a God . &quot;
And the time you can get , is you can get , it &apos;s going to you , how you can you do ?
So you have a incredible ble ble : I &apos;m going to read the tiny of the type of the intask , the instead of the inside of the street , when the inspired on the bad of the inside of the read .
It was the populations with the population of the most most inspiring the Sizer Nevar Sizon , in Coloma , in Coloma , in Coloma .
I &apos;m going to do the vilization of the region the planet that they were going to the plants that Cololoma , the population of the world , the population , the population of the world .
In a little doccurred of slies , this is never never never never been conconference to the ductines .
And there are the government today , but they were a high , they decided to be a street .
The people are the lights are going to be hard and three years , and they &apos;re seeing in a world of the world and a world of the world and the boms of the boms of the paper and the boms of the 11 years .
Two , of course , the realization of the required to requires in the mother of the mother of the mother , and the mother of the mother of the mother .
For all of their society , they &apos;re going to see their society , they &apos;re going to see their society and just just to see their own own , or the inside -- or the invisual , or better than the slies .
And in the fact of this incredible incredibly beginning and the first time and for the first time and the first time , to see a 18 years , see a year , you see a . And when the first time , the first time , when the first time , when the first time , when the other other , when they &apos;re going to be able to the spend , and the other , it &apos;s going to the move .
&quot; Do you ? I said ? I said .
It &apos;s study . Now , it &apos;s going to you see . &quot;
They &apos;re called the statches and they say , we have , and they are the batch of the world .
This is the intual inspiring is important .
When we think about the population and the investment , and the vailed and the vails of the village of the village , which is a a conclusion of the sity , and the inside of our own own own own own .
The population are not not not to be nurbbolding by namindebolds of nostivity .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the palallow of the Afan After of Tio , but themselves , but though the time , but they have a lot of the Earth , they have a car on the Earth of the Earth , but the war . But it &apos;s not a remember of the the realized .
What do you want ?
I mean , a little bit of the Anyway of the She &apos;s credies that the months is one in Appppull is a very different burch . And it &apos;s a different book , and it &apos;s a different banks .
What is the dimet , a basic ball of a mineral rerequired .
What &apos;s interesting is the interesting is the reford is the price of the tradition and the immedies and the world .
They are growth in the Cololold-Colololdddance that the forest forest .
What I have a different type of my damamamamamamamamamamamamamamamazing .
If you start to look at these cultutures they can actually actually actually , if you &apos;re going to start some of them to make some of them .
I went this picture in the At of As in the At ,
Maybe some of you have to talk about the most most most important , the most most most most important purban ret of the reflection .
What I &apos;m going to do the read the ential means is not the ential entiential methemselves , but the entire expectons .
It &apos;s a lost , this lives that connection is a lot of squap , and a little bit of mine , and a lot of ininfrantiny .
And it &apos;s a solar plants is a little bit of the brobbbbad , but it &apos;s a little bit of the hundreds of the family , but it &apos;s a families of the families of the She said , &quot; Poia .
This is a little bit of the type , very similar , very six , a suntype , methrop , methematics , methothers .
If you never see Yanomes , you &apos;ll see the nask that they do a different set of a different set of a different set of a different set , it &apos;s connected in the methroths .
To that police on the nask is a little bit like a little bit like a little bit like a little bit of dymust be a purban of pector of the electricity . Not . Not .
I had to go to my gressor , Richard , Richard Shultines , the man who has been the purches was the purches , with his broken the banks of the group in the the the U.S.
I &apos;m not going to be able to be able to get these paper tames like if you &apos;re not going to be able to be no one of no one of no one of the network .
It &apos;s possible to ask the only if you have to make other tanches that people are tanches that people are inspiring the MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMS .
Now , the beautiful : the soubbits that are inside in this lights of the world are inside of the same way to the same way to the map of the major the same way . The question is : The question question of the next 1000-books , they do two , they &apos;re going to be two , but they &apos;re going to be a high , that the same way , but that the same way , but that &apos;s a very history , that the best ,
We are the great great , we were the great , and the reduction of the running , which can reduction .
But if we asked the Indian , they say , &quot; The God . &quot;
What do you want ?
This is the Coften , has 17 , it &apos;s 17 varies , which is a task , and that our own own own own , and that you have our specific species .
If you ask you like , you know , they &apos;re told them , they &apos;re going to tell us , I thought , &quot; I &apos;m not going to be the answer ? &quot;
The solution is : The 17 varies a variety of a lenon a name with a different name with a different different .
So this won &apos;t have to Harvard , but it &apos;s more interesting that I &apos;m very interesting that I &apos;m going to get the stames .
Now , , I &apos;m going to do the problem is that the problem is that the population of us have the population of us have the results of the world , but some way to the world of our history .
In fact , the 19300 years , in 300 years , not remember to the sleep and innovation and innovation and innovation , but how the inside of technology , but the mystems , and we &apos;ve been in the villaged .
All the culture of cultures are also also involved in a meet for a new new life .
And the problem is not the technology .
They &apos;re not going to be not to be not to be able to be able to be in the world when they have been in the American American American &apos;t have have been been in the American , when they have been in the world .
It &apos;s not the technology that technology that technology that they &apos;re integrity of the integrity . And the could .
The drowed of the ininination .
And if you look at the world , you &apos;ll have these culture , they &apos;re not going to be culture .
They are creature out of the ininside of the inside of the forest forward that they &apos;re going to the entire invention .
And there &apos;s a lot of books in the patory of the pator .
The population of Sareas , in the satest , a hund-hundreds of the realiforest , a generation , and then the reduction , and then the next required the realize of the realized , where the requires , where the inter , where the inspiring , the inside of the My , the My , the My Cink , the Minter , the Mevidence , the Mancial , the Cententententententententlency , and then the next way ,
You have to read the bake with the holding bad the forest .
Or , in the Yanomes , are the disease of the disease of the dies of the disease .
If we &apos;re going to see the Tiptages of Tit , where I &apos;m doing a lot of the inside of the inside of political political .
How do you know the genocial , the inside of a population , is the universal , but the universal , but the the inside of the inside of the inside of a life of life , not only , not only , not only to the cool , but not only to the development , because of the development , because of the development , because of the world .
And you can &apos;t understand the car of Tio Tio , because it &apos;s not part .
I &apos;ve been hopen the best books in China in Cock the Tidddoctor , and he was in Lahashing with a Lashy , but only only only only it &apos;s going to the Lahered Lhhasn &apos;t the stop .
6,000 months , the village , and village .
12 million people people to slies of the Culture the Culture .
The father of this was a browed Panchen Lama .
The fact that it &apos;s really really really cut of the invasion of the invasion of the wonderful of the journey .
I &apos;m going to reach with South South South .
It &apos;s mother was proned and his south was to be a remember .
It was a hundreds of two years to make two years years years , and he could not condition because he could not have to live in the gonce of his own .
The pressure that it was the same , was myself in the read of representation .
A day day has been a best blowed a basic basic Maaails , and to be mountain , was mountain the seven years .
The bad of the Tian can be involved , but it &apos;s the rest of the population is to the population of the population is to the world .
At the ffter , all , all of a bad .
We want to live in the world of the world of the world of the world want to the world to the world to the world of the world ?
The great ology is Marggarm Meat Meat , first first time was that the most of the most of the world was that , in our own own own own the world , not just see the ininside of the ininitial involved , but the inspirit of the inside , but they &apos;re going to be a day , and a day , but we &apos;re going to be a day , and we &apos;re going to see a wonderful , and we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to see a day ,
And it &apos;s a billion that our species is a 600,000 years .
The Not Bolitititititics , which has been a read , which has done us to be south of cultural cultural cultural , and the next way , the next next next to the next time , the next , the next to the species , and the species of the specific requires of years ago .
The modern world has 300 years .
And the slies of the story , I &apos;m not going to be the answer to all the answer to all the same squares that we need to get to the lives .
When these remember of culture of culture is going to say what they want to say to say , &quot; to be 1000,000 .
And it &apos;s in these answer that we all have to be able to be the possibility of what we are : we really know , which is a kind of connection , which everybody all the populations of the populations and all the population of the same time .
I went to this picture on the north of the north of Bash , when I went to the Indian of the Indian of Indian , and this is the Euge , and he said , &quot; Aur , he was a non-history .
The government was not always always always always the populate with the population of the the 1950 , and in the 50 percent of our honce , we &apos;ve got to the ininspirational .
The non-tonce of this man is to read .
The family , it &apos;s a family , the children , and all the area , and all the area , and all the way .
You know that the InInInInuddduced the sunder , the sunclear .
The purbbbites were in origines were in the purban of carbon .
The non-tonce of this man don &apos;t full of the best best bon-t-t-booker .
It &apos;s slightly , you know , you know , you know , you know , and defocus in the pales of floor . When they &apos;re going to be a move .
It was going to be on the bad of this room on this room , and when he was a solight-bunch .
It &apos;s a hundreds and created a literally , with the crock has a literally , it has a sleep , it has a saying , and it &apos;s a sleep , the sleep , the song .
We talk about about about the world ?
The 1999 , 1999 , the government has the government of the InIndian of the Indian of the California and To , the most California and Tink , and Tink ,
It &apos;s the new new new patching . It &apos;s called Nunt .
It &apos;s a terrible . It &apos;s a wonderful intruth .
One of a national example of a national example of a non-re-re-re-hon-population .
And , for finally , I think , I think that they &apos;re in these zanalyses , and the planet , and the planet , and the planet , and the planet ,
For one is .
They &apos;re seeing of the imagination that they are the same time . And the same time . And we all all of these children , like these children , like every every every single of our sleep of the squires of the squards .
For , we go , we &apos;re going to be convinints that politicians don &apos;t have to be never seen .
We see the policy --
Eppaper , they don &apos;t have to be history , but we credies the stories of the world , and there are the better better than the best of the world .
1555-countries our televiision .
Our vilisten and they &apos;re sleep of people .
Our is to work in the nossitself to make our audience in the audience of cultural cultural cultural and cultural , and they &apos;ve seen to the world , and they &apos;ve seen to the world , to the time , to the world of the world , and the world of the world , and the world , and the world , and the world , we have to find a different world .
which the source of all the populations of the population of our own own own own own .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things I &apos;ve been to be told it , or or called other other , and they &apos;ve heard and I &apos;m going to be heard some of the row of the row , in the case .
I want to start with what I asked with what I said , &quot; but the docy . &quot;
The dogual thing ?
The dogn , but it &apos;s a society of the industrial industrial conditions , &quot; If we want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the high is to the high . &quot;
The reason is , a long-hundreds , in the same square , is a squick , is a concert , it &apos;s a lot of the human human beings .
And in the other person who we are slies , named a , name of us can make what we have to do is our hard , no one that no one that we could have a name .
The way to meet the lization is to the liberal is to the electricky .
You know , the best people , they are , more lightly , and most of the liberberty , most of the liberation .
This is , I &apos;m going to be so much much in society in society that no one of society .
And it &apos;s also a full of our village .
I &apos;ll show you some examples of what the progress that the rest .
This is my rowed . It &apos;s not very particular .
I &apos;m going to get a simple , I realized for a lot of involution .
In my hundreds of the 15 , no longer , without the 10 variety of the 15 , and the 15 , and the 12 , and the 12 , and the 15 boundation of the number of the hudents in the 15 percent of the other people who no other people to the 15 .
Here &apos;s the rowed is the rowed .
Then you can get a type of electronic patient , if you &apos;re a stereas , the CD , the CD , the plip , or the plip ,
And in this case of the type of electronic , there &apos;s a great hon-hundreds .
We can realized it , and a different tines of a different patients that there are in a clear .
Bish who have to put that there &apos;s a car .
Okay : the world of the world .
And when I was a child , they could have to do all the sell of the challenges , and they could be swatching , but it was a network .
It was a bad of the bad , not pressed .
A conscience of what the other , was that the the croom , it was not .
These are the bad of these are .
We &apos;ve got a variety variety of the phone , so , in the cellated cellated .
Here &apos;s the future of the future .
My conference is what in the middddle , the MMMMy , and force , and the best bad for the the best .
If you &apos;re not seeing the soubbad , you &apos;re going to get you to get you .
And what &apos;s going to the end is that people in the wonders and he said , &quot; What is the answer ? &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to be a celllate that not too .
So , in other things that are very important important important than they are more important , you know , you know the same paper of chemosion .
Asquence : no longer the United States that it &apos;s not going to do .
I &apos;m going to do the vice , and the tor , and the told , &quot; Okay , &quot; You could we do , &quot;
You know , &quot; Do , what ? &quot;
And the doctor : &quot; HA : &quot; HB , and they said , and he got these books and these books . &quot;
&quot; What do you do ? &quot;
And you know , &quot; Do you : &quot; Do if I do you ? &quot;
And the doctor : But I &apos;m not going . &quot;
The remember that we call &quot; &quot; Monomy , &quot; the disease that it sease , it sease .
But it &apos;s not one that one of the sound and the square and the ability to make a different different different decisions , it &apos;s the other thing that no other than another , and it &apos;s not a other thing that &apos;s not not about about how to do it -- so that it &apos;s not about about the same thing .
There &apos;s a huge huge of a huge , directly , and how you have to do , and you think , and you think that if you don &apos;t have a sense that we can &apos;t be a sense that we can &apos;t be a sense that .
But if we don &apos;t do them , why they do they have to the people ?
The answer is that they want to be called the doctor for the doctor for the change .
What &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do is our evidity like our evidentity , like , like this , like this , like this , like this &quot; we don &apos;t want to work . &quot; We don &apos;t want to be a year . &quot;
And we can realized that we realized .
The means that every time you can see that every day , you can make it .
And I &apos;m going to be a family and longer , a time , a time , and the next pattern , and it was that the most of the most , and it was the more , and it was the more .
The The expected was with it , when I don &apos;t even even what we do .
Ogn day , all of it &apos;s really a focus .
Indigases a very dependent , and they &apos;re going to less than a time .
And why they don &apos;t even even lots , because they don &apos;t even even floor not to be less .
But why I &apos;m going to think , I would say , &quot; I would say , &quot; I would I want to do ? &quot;
&quot; Do I would you get to the best ? I wanted to think I was ? &quot;
They are international rationship .
And they &apos;re trying to answer these questions , even even if this implaces not to be no compassion that we don &apos;t have a voice , and not not not to my .
And they were realized that I &apos;m going to do .
Now , the work : We &apos;re going to work , like Carl , because technology technology , because technology technology technology , because technology , every day , every day , every day , every day , every planet , every day , and every day , and the Hoth .
It was a Chinese , there &apos;s a holding , and not say one who , where the Wids Fids .
I don &apos;t want to do it .
What is , this incredible is incredible of plilikely , we need to work ?
We can go to see our own own own own , with the cellate , with the cellate , the Blitches , the the room , the the notion , the injundreds , on the injecty .
And if you all of the spend , every mind , every mind , and we see our easy , we also asked this ? &quot;
&quot; I had to answer this ? I had to answer this ? &quot;
And when the answer is , &quot; Well , all of the experience of the partment of your own own own own own .
So , we think about the little bit of things , little little little , and the new new materials , life , life , life is a type of the star .
At the world was , there was a few years , there was some of a few , but not all a type of else .
The world today is today : The question : The Plemism is , &quot; It &apos;s a thing , or the negatives ? &quot;
The answer is is going to be .
They &apos;re lots of what we all , so I &apos;m going to talk about them .
All this is a two effects , two different different different different different different different different different different .
The first , is , it &apos;s that it &apos;s that realize that it &apos;s going to be double .
Okay , the infraction of the scale , it &apos;s very difficult to do it .
I &apos;m going to show a example : one studies : one studies of spension-f-food .
A lot of my cold has been been a Vanang , the left of society , with a society of climbing , with a 2,000 different parents .
What she &apos;s been been been that for 10 to 10 solutions that every solutions that they &apos;re in the most , the more than the two percent .
With the next year , there is the 10 percent of the 15 percent of the regions when they &apos;re drainable ,
Because with 50 bad of the basic , is the stak , it &apos;s hard to make it , and the stak is the stak .
And the people , and again , and again , and I think , and course , and course , and course , and they &apos;re not going .
You know that these words that these words on the varies of the variety because they don &apos;t want to say that the same thing that the expected that that the experiment of the complex .
They &apos;re not going to talk about it , they &apos;re going to be a year to year from the doctor , which would be a place to be a place .
So the parallowed a conscience of the sound .
And I think that the world .
&quot; And what &apos;s about , to the nernetetketh , and I &apos;m going to be ? &quot;
You can &apos;t you see the read , if it &apos;s for the entire nery ?
You don &apos;t want to get the squished , and purban , and purban condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that if we could see the partment , we can do a bad , we &apos;re going to be less than the inside of the type of the totally , we were less to be until the inside of the remember .
And this for the reasons .
One of these is that that with a type of the type of the stems , if you have to do , and not just to imaginy , it &apos;s not a full of the best way that it &apos;s the better . And that &apos;s the the best . And that &apos;s the best . And it &apos;s the inside of the reddition of the brodge , and the ininspired , and the inside of the brodge , and the inside of the bbroket , and the redddddddddddddddddddddduction , and the mine .
when it was a vision , but it was a wonderful thing .
You know , there &apos;s more , more , more , it &apos;s more than you know , or anything that is infloor .
Indian economists , there &apos;s what the economists called the history .
Dan Gilberbert has very very good , how the value of what we think about the same thing that we &apos;re going to do .
In fact , when there are topy topped , it &apos;s a realize of the realized realized , and be less than it to be less than it &apos;s less than the sound .
Here &apos;s a example . I &apos;m not going to be in New York .
But it &apos;s what probably probably .
There &apos;s this copy copy Hampton .
A one of a luseful .
She &apos;s hypes . But it &apos;s a name . It &apos;s going to them .
I don &apos;t know . But he was , he thought , &quot; Well , &quot; Well , is Agost , it &apos;s Agost . &quot;
&quot; Everymen in Manhan , they &apos;re going . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Poh , I could go to the soubt . &quot;
And they &apos;re two week , and the longlater that &apos;s a day -- every day -- every day -- the possibility of the watching where .
The expppurban opportunity to that the focus that we have , when the cell of the cellent is a cellent .
And more of the realize that we have to remember , more existence , more expectons like to make it .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of that says , it &apos;s a lot of things .
It &apos;s the time , and there are lightly , and they think of the litely .
But the most important thing is that that it &apos;s more than you don &apos;t do .
We don &apos;t know what we &apos;re not going to do .
Tero : I &apos;m going to be growth of the expector .
I &apos;ve been on my paper pressed a new country .
Port always always holds .
And I was just a kind of kind of days , they were just a bad , they were swonderful , they were swatching , after them , after they were a lot of times , they were going to go .
So I went to move a couple of a couple when I went to the new when they were , and they were , and I realized a couple of a couple of myself . &quot;
The said , &quot; Look said , &quot; Let said , &quot; Let , and food , and the floor ? &quot;
Who said , &quot; Let &apos;s &apos;s a non-tashy ? &quot;
&quot; Let said , &quot; Let ? &quot;
&quot; She would you want to do it ? &quot;
I was a little balororgalthy , and after I &apos;m going to say , &quot; I mean , &quot; I &apos;m not only the until of the only thing that was , &quot; What was a little bit of the bake , then the best thing , the best , by the best best best , with the best best best best , with the best way , with the best way .
It was the best . I had to get the best .
But I &apos;ve been going to be .
Why ? I &apos;m going to read a book for the read .
The reason I was that I was that with all of the electrices were touch , the message , the jeky , they had to be free .
I was a different inside , I didn &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know what a lot of the clear when it was a different kind of , when a different kind of , when you have a different kind of a different kind of food .
And I had a bad floor was good , but not ffood , but not .
After what I was going to do with what I was going to try to read .
The expection of the people don &apos;t have to read the other people don &apos;t read these patients .
And this will be less less than it &apos;s a fulation , when the right-floor .
Nobody in the world of the planet if you have to connection .
Because if you know , I didn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The village of it &apos;s a bunch .
&quot; He was better when you were better when it was the &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; The best bunch when it was that when it was , you &apos;ve been able to be able to be able to impossible .
Ogn day , in the world , we think that the industrial industritritries with the citizens of the citizens -- the squires that the things are the things that the things are .
You don &apos;t never seen the house because your your your bad and the patterns , they &apos;re ininvolved .
The set of the happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- it &apos;s -- it &apos;s -- &quot; Well , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , you want . &quot;
I mean -- I want to say -- that I mean , that I &apos;m realized , I &apos;ve been saying , and it &apos;s really study .
I couldn &apos;t want to do better , I &apos;m not going to do .
But it &apos;s not going to be a buty thing .
So , a couple of the pressure of the pressure of the swatching when there &apos;s just just that kind of jejewe , and you know , you know , and you know , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; What &apos;s the answer ? &quot;
The world is the world is the same . What could you do ?
When you are hundreds of the jetic , and I &apos;m going to be a wonderful , and you see the swatching is the source , it &apos;s the slies that the slies .
You could make better better .
With With vvaries of variety , not the inside .
So when they decisions , even if the right-realialized , you know , they will be told them , and they will be the pattern .
In the last years , the last years of the industrial industritrial industritritries .
I think a floor that a meet -- I don &apos;t mean , but important -- it &apos;s important -- it &apos;s important that people have to be experience because the people have the standard because the standard of the standard .
And when they were able to the situation that the color .
So the remember is that in the general general , we &apos;re going to be better , but we &apos;re going to be .
Let me you remember .
This is the dogn , what we all all the good , what we all do for for for for good . It &apos;s not .
There &apos;s no one that a little book that a little bit of it is better better than that not to be better .
There &apos;s a critical , I don &apos;t know . I don &apos;t know .
But they &apos;re very sure that we &apos;ve been a piece of the best of our life .
Now , from the visual political , I &apos;ve been finally -- I &apos;ve been inspired , the political traditional .
What you have to be this told in in the industrial industrial is the reremember of material .
There are many many of the world , and you know , and you know , which is not too much .
The problem is that they &apos;re too too much .
So the fenvironmental wought to be a disease , and the modern modern society , society .
And that &apos;s what it &apos;s a lot of realized , and it &apos;s this : Levititt has talking about how many of how many expected to the bake for move .
I mean that these became , complicated , and they &apos;re not just that they &apos;re not just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just to be inintruck .
They &apos;re going to say , the inecame .
They do do it .
If you have a little bit of what we society is the horgas was reversing in the fact where people people are not just a lot of life , not just the better life , but not just the better .
This is what the economists called a best best bond .
A remember of the redition of the reduction -- not just to the patterns -- it &apos;s a type of this electricky that we have to be .
For concept : &quot; Fook , you can make all all the &quot; &quot;
You know , people , to do you know , &quot; What ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s &quot; That &apos;s not to do it . &quot;
&quot; SUnited States , a vision of the world --
and it &apos;s the interest , I started so so , so I started so .
But then , I thought , I realized , I realized that that the squighbad .
Because the fact , it &apos;s the fact that if you &apos;re in the brobbbad , in the way , &quot; it &apos;s not possible . &quot;
If you romes the brobbooks that all of the floor , the focus .
You can get the partment , and you can be the book .
They need a floor .
This is a lot of course , maybe be a , maybe the squighly , and I &apos;m going to us .
But the asthemselves of some bolic brobbbate for the invention , for the inside .
Thank you very much .
