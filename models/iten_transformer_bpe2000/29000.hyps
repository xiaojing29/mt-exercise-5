The last year I showed these slidemonstrate that slidemonstrate that calculus almost three million years has had the size of 48 continental United States continental , it &apos;s restriped of 40 percent .
However this subject , the gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice of the ice .
The glacial glacial is , in a sense , the pulsant heart of the global climate .
It expanding around the summer and retreatment .
The next slides is a quickly required on the advice of the last 25 years .
The ice loss are loss are already signed .
As you see , they expand up to blue .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter , which is the summer .
You can see that the cohoiden , of five years or more , it &apos;s like the blood , which is five years , which is five years from the body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been so , in this way .
This is a problem because the interested in the arctic report the ground of the arctic of the arctic of congested carbon congested that , science , and they &apos;re transformed into the methane .
I &apos;m putting at the totality of the atmospheric inquation of global warming , that amount could radical , supered this point of not .
In some of the little bit of deep in Alaska , the metane is already re-on the water .
The professoret-professoret-grand University of Alaska is that there &apos;s a team that &apos;s a team that &apos;s walking out .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : The question is if we &apos;re going to be .
A reason is that this term scale from the Greenland from the north .
This is a figured out of glacial .
The brought didn &apos;t have reached free .
This is the Kangerlush in the South of Greenland in the South of Greenland .
If you want to know how to be the level of the sea level to the sheet of the ice of the ice , here is where it &apos;s reaching the sea .
These running are increasing rapidly .
At the other side of the planet : Antarctica , the biggest block of ice .
The month scientists have seen that the balance of the ice is in negative , and the Antarctica , and that Antarctica , which is about several islanding of some islands , which is particularly in the shake .
Equeeived at six feet of the watching , as in Greenland .
Sull Himalayas , the third biggest block , you see new laghi , and see new laghi , which a few years ago , they &apos;re glagholds .
40 percent of the world population is half of the world &apos;s population can be hachievable to the way .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the fun of the water power of this city .
The led is increased .
But when you diminishes , the same happens to be fairly water .
In California , the Nevada is is demined by 40 percent .
The hyrics are in crisis .
The predictions , as you have read , are graved .
The growing safe fe in the world leads to a remarkable increase .
The environmental disasters are increasing a rhythm out of the normal and without precedent .
four times numerous times more numerous than the previous 75 .
This is an introduced all of the sustainable .
If you look at it in historic context , if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 25 million tons of tons in the ocean in the ocean every day .
Look at the East Pacific area , from American area , and on the American , and on both parts of Indian subcontinent , where there is a radical impoverments of oxygen in the ocean .
Most of global warming , with global warming , with deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossils .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States are one of the two of the most emissions , together at China .
And it was proposed to build a lot of other centers .
But we &apos;re seeing a change of direction .
These are the annulled projects in the last few years and some of the alternative version .
And every way , there &apos;s a political mother in our country .
The carbon industries and oil are spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon clear year to promote the carbon , which is a hosymle .
That picture remember me ,
Natal Verice , in Tennessee , there was a loss of 3.8 billion lboys .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen it about the news .
This is the second biggest flow of scories in America .
It happened around the Natal .
The publishment of one of the carbon industries .
Video : the carbon is a type and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it &apos;s going to grow our economy .
Mross the carbon is more and more and more and more and clear .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and work work machine .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest society on the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I &apos;m going to be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosous , Harry Reid -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Protection of Clima has two campaign .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Ator : At COALergy see the climate change as a serious serious serious change as a tiny minute .
So our priority is to invest a great amount of money in a public effort to make public effort to make public and confuse the truth .
In fact , the carbon isn &apos;t stairs .
We think it &apos;s clean -- it &apos;s also a good profumor .
So you don &apos;t preocupon the climate change .
Let me do .
Video : Ator : Carbone pulippped -- you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
So let &apos;s give you a game in a structure of a clear .
Straordinary ! The car is a little humor , but that &apos;s the sound of the car of the car .
The carbon of carbon is between the major causes of global warming , but the night technology of the paper you see changes everything .
Do a look : this is the carbon clean technology of clean clean .
Al Gore : finally , the positive alternative alternative , the positive alterm and the national security .
Video : Sment America is in crisis ; the economy , national security , national security .
The philo that the all of this : our dependence from fossils , as the fuel and the oil and the oil and oil .
Now , perhaps there is a new , audace solution for circumstances .
Really America : 100 percent of the energy , 10 years .
A plan to put America to work , make us safer , make us safer , and help to stop global warming .
Finally , one solution that &apos;s just to solve our problems .
Really America . You &apos;re reading more .
Al Gore : That &apos;s the last .
Video : That &apos;s about reduction . It &apos;s about energy .
One of the fastest ways to get to dependence dependence from the combustible that kill our planet .
See : The future is here . I &apos;m here . I mean , a new energy .
Some of the number two : Nuild-places investment for places .
Comment : Repower . It &apos;s time to be realists .
Al Gore : A proverbian old proverbio , say , &quot; If you want to go fast , go to the fast .
If you want to go away , you go together . &quot;
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
The year at TED I did an introduction on LHC .
And I promise to return you to get back to how the car .
So , here I figure . And for those who didn &apos;t , the LHC is the biggest experiment ever ever taken -- 27 kilometers of circumstence .
His joined to required the conditions that were less than a billion second from the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
All that &apos;s just environment .
This is the machine underneath Gineveness .
We have these mini-Big Bang Bang in the researchers .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- is 44 feet and it &apos;s a 22 feet behind .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in fact , you can see the proportions .
10 sectle of the last year we accent the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was because of the immense festegs in control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first particle phask that he had done all around the LHC , both collision , with a part of the LHC , and by a part of the LHC , and spread particles in the report .
In other words , when we see that image 10 secember , we understand that image , we understand that machine worked , which is a great vittoria .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to make us exultate more or this , when somebody went on Google and saw that the beginning page was this .
That means we &apos;ve had a cultural impact cultural impact that scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the car , just these days .
These films bring 13,000 frightening when the car works at the most power .
Now , the technicians between you will look at the phils and will say , &quot; That &apos;s not true . They &apos;re too subtle . &quot;
And instead they can do that because when they &apos;re very cold became a superconductor .
So , at less 271 degrees , to a hundred hit to that the space between stars , these files can bring that run .
In one of the younger than the novemile magnets in the LHC , there was a fted fabrical difect .
So the phils survey you have slightly , and 13,000 ampits improvising a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think that these magnets are more than 20 tons , and that are moved about 30 feet , and that are moved about 30 feet .
They &apos;re damn about 50 magnets .
We had to take them , what we did .
We &apos;ve been resisted and traveled them .
Now they &apos;re going back to all the substantial place .
By the end of the LHC is is going to be new integrated .
We &apos;re going to happen , and we expect to get data or playing or pluy , and continuing our adventure to discover what are the morons that are the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these accidents reaccess to make the value of science and engineering in frontier of science and engineering . It &apos;s easy to have .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact of going to be beyond limits , I think that &apos;s the value of things like LHC .
I &apos;d like to end with the words of a Inglese Inglese Davy , which , imagine , I think , in defense in its bael experiments of its pupillo , his pupillo , he can stand was , &quot; Nothing is so dangerous for the progress of the human mind that the ideas of science as the right-to-house ideas of science as that our ideas of the ideas of the ideas of our tributonds , and that we &apos;re not going to be there ,
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to ask you to rethink when , children , playing , you playing , you playing , you playing , you &apos;d play with them .
Whereas you understand them and deal with them , and take them , take them and move them and move them , learned to think and solve problems and mains problems and manipulating problems .
The space is deeply deeply connected to the way that we understand most of the world around us .
So , from information inspired by the uslity of our interaction with physics , together my consult Patist , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to ask me , &quot; And if we use a computer , when we &apos;re going to have a computer , we could only get the mouse as digital policy that you can digital , we could afferate a desktop with a desktop with the hands of the manior , we could actually get my hands ,
and systemate our ployment ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , by building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a great computer interactive computer interactive as a biscoes .
In a few words , a Siftable is a great computer interactive computer interactive as a biscoes .
You can move them with the hand , can see , &quot; you can see , &quot; you can see , &quot; you &apos;re going to be able to be .
But above , I &apos;m physical objects , as the morning , can just move them .
The Siftable is an example of a new ecosystem for manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physical , known about their movement , and other people , and as they become more physical , and they become more physical , of other people , as we can explore new and fun style and fun style of interaction .
I &apos;m going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configurated to show video : if you just incline in a direction , the video will rotate back from the other side back .
These replaces are consciousness .
If you &apos;re in the way , they &apos;re interested in .
If they come circumstates , they noticed it and they can act a little bit .
If they come circumstates , they noticed it and they can act a little bit .
They also true their movement and incclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power to use communicate gestures , &quot; a color as if it was a liquid color as if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable as a center of versor I can use them to versity in the central color in the central , where they missize .
and I can use them to versing them to real color in the central , where you missing .
If we get too , we can put a little place .
There are also beautiful possibilities of learning , as the languages , math and playing logic and games where people can try things things are going to try and see the results of immediately .
Now , I &apos;m --
This is a sequence of Fibonaces I do with a program of equations .
Here &apos;s a word of words that is half in Scarabeo and Boggle .
Pratically , every turn to every turn to a letter on every Siftable on every Siftable , every turn to every turn to every Siftable on every Siftable , and while he &apos;s trying to compose to compose it on a diutionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds are remissing , and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s children came up to the Media Lab , I did so they such them and turned a video .
They &apos;re lived very pleased .
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of education .
You just say , &quot; Compons of the words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s other people who try it .
This is our younger birth , there &apos;s the most young , there .
It really wanted to implane them .
They were only morning .
Now , this is an appliance of an interactive cardboard .
We wanted to build a tool for the languages of languages .
It can make new characters in the scene , soliftable to the Siftable them .
It can make new characters in the scene , soliftable to the Siftable them .
So , he &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : The source is source .
David Merrill : Now he brought a treator in the scene .
Video : The arange treator .
By work ! Yes ! Yes ! !
So schooling Siftable and put them near can interact the personally --
Video : Bau !
by inventing your story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a story with final open , and it can decide him as it &apos;s going to be .
DM : It &apos;s a story with final open , and it can decide him as it &apos;s going to be .
Video : Fly , gets .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , that &apos;s a tool , to sampling and exept music .
It &apos;s a tool , realized by recent , to sampling and exequiet music .
The Siftable here are against sound , based and the battery .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose to use .
You can also put these sound sound in a sequence to comport to your focus .
And modifying it just to touch a &quot; sound &quot; and a sequence . &quot;
These are actually you can control from the alive , as the reverse and the filter .
The acks of a particular sound and then clines to get it .
And then there are the general effects as time and volume , that applicate to interested in sequence .
Let &apos;s look how it works .
Video : We &apos;re going to start with a base in two Siftable , &quot; sequence , we &apos;re doing it , we &apos;re going to be able to be , we extend , we add other basis .
Now I put a based line .
Video : Now I add to the percussion --
Video : And I &apos;m going to put the filter to the battery , so I can control the effect of the view .
Video : DM : I can speed to the whole sequence by inking time by a side or another .
Video : And I &apos;m going to add the bottom to give more expression .
Video : DM : I can reach the sequence . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to planning it before , but I can suddenly make it longer or more cording .
And now , finally , I can make the whole sequence of inking the whole sequence by the Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new man &apos;s interfaces more and more more than it &apos;s going to work our brain and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the results of this loss , and also some possibilities that we &apos;re trying to bring out of the laboratory .
The concept that I want to transmit is that &apos;s coming to this new generation of projects to interact with digital media , that will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time to talk to all you .
I &apos;m a written .
It &apos;s critical books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the fass of my life .
And I don &apos;t expect that it can change .
But , said , this is something that happened recently in my life and in my life and in my career , who bring me to recalize the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called &quot; Manda , &quot; which , &quot; Ama , &quot; which , and different reason , for some reason , for some reason , for some reason , for some reason that was a big , became , wildlife became , interacted .
And the result is that everywhere there is now , people treat me as if you were condanted .
Davoid -- condanned , condanted !
They &apos;re all worried about it and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t fear to do you don &apos;t have to do you don &apos;t have to do you better do ?
You can &apos;t be able to keep write for all life without power to be able to create a book that can important to someone makes somebody &apos;s &apos;s going to somebody ? &quot;
What can you get to somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s rassurant , you know .
But it may go worse , at part of that I remember more than 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a written .
I meet the same reaction is based by the same reaction .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you have successful ?
You don &apos;t have a fear that the umiliation of the ref-you ?
You can &apos;t do this for all life without you make this for all life without any living of it all has ever been out and die on a cumule of all infrankly to love cell care of fallimb ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I &apos;ve got afraid of all those things .
I &apos;ve always had fear .
And I also have fear of many other things that people can &apos;t inate .
As the floor and other things .
But , as much about it write what I thought and ask me , and I ask me , and I ask me , is why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logical that anybody should be expected by being pushed by a work that you feel like you feel to do .
But what is this particular is that particular in the imprised to make us nervous health mental health , as that other careers do not do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and not remember one time in its 40 years of activity that he was asked if he had been asked if he had to be able to be able to be ?
There was never -- that was -- that block of the John engineer , how do it ?
Does not work that , you know ?
Onestly , chemical engineers as don &apos;t have certainly , in the centuries , gled the reputation of being alcolized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized , chemical engineers the reputation of being already , in chemical engineered manized manized manized
We have enough , we have enough this reputation , and not only writers but creative creative of all kinds of things , we have this reputation to be enormous instable mentally .
And it &apos;s not going to look at at the trists of the magnifices of magnifices that are only creative minds , in the 21st century , died young people and often to hand .
And also the ones that have not such such such as well , they &apos;re really dismissed by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before I died , in the last interview said , &quot; Every book kill me a little bit more . &quot; A extraordinary death of a little bit of a little bit more .
But we don &apos;t bad when we heard that because we heard these things so long that somehow we &apos;ve completely interested and accepted the notion that creativity and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering , it will always conduce to the cord .
And the question I want to ask everybody today is : are you agree with this idea ?
It &apos;s good at you -- because it also looks at it from a centimeter to me not well for anything that &apos;s not good for anything .
I think it &apos;s odiosa .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous and I don &apos;t want to see it lost in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our big minds of creative minds to live .
And I know , of course , in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start figing out to get to figure out of the surprising surroundation , surprising the circumstances that are in my career .
That -- you look , look , I &apos;m rather young , I &apos;ve got about 40 years .
I still have about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything I &apos;m going to write about now in the world as the work that &apos;s coming after the world that &apos;s successful ,
I &apos;m going to be holding , because we are all more or less friends here -- likely my biggest success is to my homeless .
Oh , Gesus , who think .
You know , this is the kind of thinking that that &apos;s going to start to be a person to start to broken up the nine of morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I &apos;d stop to keep doing this work that we do .
So , the question becomes , how do you do it ?
And so it seems to me , after many reflessions , that the way to work to continue to write is to create a psychological construct , right ?
I have some way to find a security distance between me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxiety about what reaction is going to get to get up and , as I was looking for all the year , and I &apos;m trying to do it through time , trying to find other society to see if they could have better ideas and more healthy to see if they could have better ideas and more and more healthy the holds and more substantially , it &apos;s going to get a little bit of ideas that I &apos;m going to get to get more than the image .
how to help people make creative to manage the emotions of creativity .
And that research has taken me to the ancient Green and ancient Rome .
Seguiting me because he gets into the circle and then back .
In the ancient Greetes and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity was from the men , OK ?
And it was thinking that creativity was this spirit divine and sell men someone distant and known , for the man who was saying , and unknown , for reasons and known , for reasons and known .
The great-called these divins of the berits of creativity &quot; degree .
Socry , wonderful , it had to have a demon that was a demon that .
The Romans were the same idea , but they called the kind of the spirit without body genius .
which is great , because Romans didn &apos;t really think a genius was a particularly intelligent .
They had a genius was this kind of divine that has been created of literally lived in the walls of a study artist , a little bit like Dobby , and that was going to get out of the work of the argument of the work of the artist and model and model the labels the result of that work .
Here &apos;s what &apos;s going to be -- that &apos;s the distance of which I talk -- that &apos;s the psychological construct you that protect you from your work .
And everybody knew that it was that it worked , right ?
So the anticisnaries were protected by certain things , like the too much narcism , no ?
If your work was exciting , you can &apos;t take all the way to take all of it , everybody knew that you had been helped by this genicorporation .
If your work , it was not all the way , it wasn &apos;t all of your , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a inable .
And so people han concept creativity in the West creativity for a long time .
And then Renasent came up and all changed , and all changed , and nacque this great idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe and no longer and left and no longer to leave the creatures that are written by divinity .
This was the principle of rational humanesimum and people started thinking that creativity was completely from the shared .
And for the first time in history , it started to refer to this or that is as a rather than a genius .
And I have to say , I think it was a big herror .
I think that we allow somebody , a simple person to believe that as a full deep as a full fourth , and the source of all mysters , creative , unknown , and inknown to be a big filter to give the basic philable to the basic human .
It &apos;s how to ask somebody to walking the sun .
Deape and fully the ego and creates all these expectable expectable .
And I think it was this pression to have destroy artists in the past 500 years .
And , if that &apos;s true , and I think that &apos;s the question is , and now ?
Can we do that different ?
Maybe you can go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t sing 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience that there would have a scientific notion , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to be burning people and broken their own projects .
Probably not to convince you all about this .
But the question I &apos;d like to ask is -- why not ?
Why not think that way ?
Because it &apos;s more sense of all the other thing that I &apos;ve ever heard to explain the exasperant impredicbility of creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever ever ever have ever been excited to do something -- so , it &apos;s basically , everybody here -- you know , you don &apos;t get rationally .
And in fact , it can be completely paranormal .
I did this met recently with the extraordinary poetry Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but it was a few of all life and said that during his childhood in Virginia , working out in Virginia , working out in the field , and heard , it &apos;s been doing it , in the landscape .
He said it was like a fragorous fragorous .
And that was coming up to her landscape .
He felt it happened , because he was tremendous under his feet .
He knew he had one thing to do to that point and it was , words , he was worth like a major . &quot;
And so it was correct and it was following from this poetry , and it wouldn &apos;t have to get a piece of card and a faster and a faster , and it &apos;s faster , and it &apos;s page it on the page .
Somce he couldn &apos;t be fast be fast , so it was correced and correced and correct and roled it back to the home and the poetry it and it would continued to get through the landscape , and he &apos;s going to continued to rolate through the landscape , as he said , &quot; another poet . &quot;
Then there were times -- this piece I &apos;m never going to forget -- there were some moments that they were almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and it was looking for card and it was looking for card and it was just a matter in the way , and he was going to go through , and he said , that it was like it allowed with another hand the wind .
He was going to cut the poetry and put it in his body and put it in his body and it turns on the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on perfect and intent , but it &apos;s the contrary , from the last word on the first .
So when I heard it -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly the same thing to my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conducture .
I &apos;m a mulo , and my way to work is ; I &apos;m seeing to go to the same horarian every day and work and go on and work and go on it .
But even I , in my test , I &apos;ve stripped against that thing , sometimes .
And I think a lot of you have a lot of you &apos;ve done .
You know , even though the work and ideas were giving me a certain fundamental source I can &apos;t be honestly known .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relationarm it to do us to do us not lose head , but rather , rather , what do you do you get healthy ?
For what I think about , the best example that I have is the Tom Waits , which I &apos;ve been interviewed by the musician musician .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life has been the incarnation of the expensive artist of the contemporary artist , trying to control , to try to control , to date these species of creative impulses .
But then he was driving , and he stood up , and one day as he was driving on a laughter in Los Angeles , it changed everything .
He was going to fast and all of a sent tract this little basic melody , which comes into its head as it does inspiration , elusive , elusive , elusive , and the various , and the various , and it &apos;s not known as to take it .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a cut .
So he starts to feel this kind of old old old old old old old old , &quot; I &apos;m losing to lose , and I &apos;ll remained obsessed by this personal song .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to the panic , he stops .
And it was going to be the whole mental process and made something completely new .
Would I just look at the sky and said , &quot; Scause , not see that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Do you seems to write a song right now ?
If you really want to be , you know , you get to a more than you can take care of you .
Although , you go to important something else today .
You know , Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his process has worked changed after this .
Not work , the work was still hoscure as always .
But the process , and the anxy that was that attack it was released when he pressed the genius , the genius that was causing nothing else and liberry it back from it came back to where it was going to be , made that it didn &apos;t have to be an interior .
but it was wonderful , wonderful , wonderful collaboration between Tom and this strange thing that &apos;s external and this strange thing that was not Tom .
So how much I heard that story started changing a little bit , and he save me one time .
This idea , he saved when I was writing , &quot; Prua , &quot; Ama , and fadds in one of those CEO of the despair that we all have been working on and we can &apos;t start to think that it &apos;s going to be a disaster , that &apos;s going to be a disaster , that &apos;s going to be the worse book or never written .
not just bad , just just the worse book wrote .
And I started thinking about throw this project .
But then I remember Tom who talked to the air and I tried to the air and I tried to it .
So I just just go back to my face in my face and I &apos;ve got my comments to a huge angle of the room .
And I said to be high voices , you know , both , what we know that if this is not shbrilliant is not going to be interested in my , no ?
Because as I see here , I &apos;m going to put all that I &apos;ve got , I don &apos;t have this .
So if you want to be better , you have to tell you and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do that , you know , you don &apos;t do that .
I &apos;m going to slide the same because it is my work .
And I &apos;d like to do it that was recorded that I &apos;ve been doing today for my part , because it &apos;s so , OK -- in the end of Africa &apos;s deserts of Africa , the North Africa , people would have gotten saying to the wait of dance , dance and sacred music and sacred music that they went on for hours and until the alba .
And they always had magnific , because the balls were professional and they were great .
But every once , it was rarely , something happened , and one of these artists actually become it .
And I know what I talk about , because I know you &apos;ve all got you , a performance , a performance .
It was like the time you stop , and the walking walk through a kind of left and it walks not doing anything at different from the usual , as 1,000 notes before , but it all was all halling .
And I suddenly don &apos;t just as a human .
But it turns out from the ded-inside and under illuminated in the fire of divinity .
And when this happened , to the time , people knew what was , they called it .
They were conguns and started sing , &quot; Allah , God , Allah , God , Allah , God , God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curiosa night storyteller -- when More invass the Spain , I was this habits with them and pronounce changed in the centuries of &quot; Allah , Allah , &quot; Allah , &quot; Okay , &quot; which you can still hear in the flow .
In Spain , when an artist did something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , &quot; Allah , magnific , burn , &quot; I can understand , &quot; I can understand -- a God of it .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes the day after , for the same , when you wake up and it turns out that they &apos;re saying , and it turns out that they &apos;re about 11 of Martednice , and I &apos;m going to look .
It &apos;s just a death with a bad bad bad to the ginocky , maybe never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever to get to that altitude .
And maybe no one of God still while I play , and so what it has to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most painful recognizing to make a creative life .
But maybe not to be that angosciant if you can &apos;t believe , if you can &apos;t believe , anzyutterly than your own own being being come from you .
But it just believable that they &apos;re going to get you from a unimaginable source of this source of your life that you have to have to go to something else when you &apos;ve finished .
And , you know , if we think it &apos;s all changing .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s certainly , as I thought it for different months in the book that I &apos;m going to do it , dangerous , spavently , spaveling , so I &apos;ve been doing my great successful .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I &apos;m electrzed by this is , not afraid .
Don &apos;t travel . It &apos;s just your work .
It &apos;s going to be involved for your part , any one can be .
If your work is baling , bat .
If the divine , absurd you assigned to leave some kind of wonderful kind of wonderful , for only through your efforts , for only through your efforts , &quot; then , &quot; I ! &quot;
Although , you &apos;re going to be your dance .
And &quot; Okay ! &quot; Sime ! &quot;
I think , you know , I think you have to teach it .
&quot; You know , &quot; at you , just for you have human love and test table tape and test tals tals that you &apos;re going to be in you continually .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : June !
As you know , I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can meant and the discovery of new genes .
Now we &apos;re starting a new perspective . We &apos;ve started digitalize biology and now to start with that digital code we &apos;re in a new biology , designing and synthesizing and synthesizing .
We &apos;ve always been trying to make big questions .
&quot; What life is that life ? &quot; is something that many biologists I think they &apos;re trying to understand various levels .
We tried different approaches , reducing it to the minimes .
We &apos;re digitalizing almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was to be treated to go from the analogical world &apos;s digital world &apos;s digital world .
Now , we ask , can we regenerate life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smaller genome of those that can authority to be in lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little more smaller .
We &apos;re able to eliminate a hundred genes about 500 genes that are here .
But when we &apos;re looking at its metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our .
Credeters , this is simple .
But when we look at all that we can eliminate , one at the time , it &apos;s very iminate that this can get to a living cell .
So we decided that the only way that the only way to synthesize this chromosome in a way to be able to modify the components to bring some of these broads of these best questions .
And so we started the adventure of the &quot; Can we synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Can chemistry to make these big molecules that we &apos;ve never done before we &apos;ve never done before we &apos;ve done before we have to create before ?
And in case , we can make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemical material chemical material .
The speed that we are able to digitalize life is growing up to life is growing up to the exponential .
Our capacity to write the genetic code , rather , rather slowly , but it &apos;s improving .
And our most recent recent results the bringing on an exponential curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process has required a lot of pass , starting with a bioethical review before the first experiments .
But we found that DNA is very difficult . It &apos;s very difficult .
There are deces of thousands of machines in the world producing little little drive segments of DNA , longer &apos;s letters , and it &apos;s a process , more errors there are longer , more errors there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these fragments and running the mistakes .
And that was our first attempt to do , to start from digital information of the Phi &apos;s genome of Phi &apos;s genome of Phi &apos;s genome .
It &apos;s a little virus that kill bacteria .
We designed the fragments , actually designed the runs and get a molecule of DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material chemical material chemical material , and we &apos;ve got to read this genetic code and produced the particles .
The viral particles are then you &apos;re released by cells , are come back and they destroy and they destroy the E.
I &apos;ve talked about recent with members of the oil industry and make it of them that they have certainly compress this model .
They review more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build its same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things biggest things .
We wanted to build the whole battery of the bacteria .
They &apos;re more than 580 mile of genetic code .
So we thought we &apos;ve been built in the cassette of virus , so that we can change the cassette of the virus that are components of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accurity was a mile for every 10 mile base .
We found it , requency , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence we never would be able to do that work .
One part of the process is to design sector segments that are overwhelments are going to be able to be able to build a little bit more smaller subtle to build smaller smaller subjects that work together .
We can see unique elements here .
You probably have read that we read that we do the file .
So , think that we have a genetic code based on four letters : A , C , C , G and T.
Three of those letters together about 20 hammine , and there &apos;s a specific order of letters for every ammind of letters .
So we can use genetic code to write words , frasmost , thoughts .
What we did the beginning is self-doing .
Some of them have been delused by the fact that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
We designed these segments to make them just under the environment .
There are full full them and put them up .
And we started to assemble parts , starting with segments from five to seven mile , at a five to seven ments of 24 mile letters of 24 mile letters to get to 72 mile .
We have produced these segments in abundance so we can segments them sequenced that we &apos;re trying to create a very robustoes -- as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems to be a basket of baet .
When we get to these very long segments , more than 100 middle , more than 100 middle , they will not grow more directly in E.
It comes to the limit of modern tools of molecular biology .
So we consider other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called homology , which is a homology , which is using to reply the DNA can be able to get segments .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism called Deinoccurs in the diodurans , it can absorb three million radiation .
You can see in the fall-high required as his chromosome is destroy .
In 12 , it &apos;s been seeing exactly as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can do completely .
They can live under vacuum .
They &apos;re absolutely sure that life is in space , and you can find new environment of water .
Actually , NASA showed that this happens .
This is a picture of molecule that we &apos;ve done using these processes , just using the literally using the design appropriate segments to put .
The flies them automatically .
This image was not taken with a electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a lot of task that we can see it with a microscope .
These are photo who have a period of about six seconds .
This is the publishing we &apos;ve done little time ago .
They &apos;re more than 580,000 genetic code .
It &apos;s the biggest molecule of a definitely ever created by man .
It &apos;s a lot of weight spring to 300 million .
If we stay it with a cart 10 without spaces , it would take 142 pages to get this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ? How can we do that ?
Of course , you can have a virus is a game from a little girls .
It &apos;s a little more complicated when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s more simple as well as it is about cells as our eucarian : you can just extreme nucleo and put another , which is practically the nucleo and put another , which is pratically the process of clonely clonically clonely clonely clonely clonely clonely clonically the process of cloning .
In the landing the archaea &apos;s broading is instead of the cell , but we &apos;ve been shown that we &apos;re able to do a complete trape of a cell to another and a complete trape of a cell to another and to another and to activity .
We &apos;ve got a chromosome of microbial species .
The two are different as the men from the topes .
We &apos;ve added some gene in a way we can decide what you &apos;re going to chromosome .
And then it &apos;s science with the full full the whole proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was just -- and you &apos;ll be study our graph graph -- and you &apos;ll be a whole new cell -- the new croma was gone in the cell .
And we started thinking that we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to be anyway to spin more there .
This is one of the major mechanisms .
We found that many of me species have added a second or a third or third chromosome somewhere , add in a second thousands of new hands of new holding to that species .
So who &apos;s thinking about evolution as a gene at the time that you have not understand a lot of biology .
There &apos;s full full full full full full DNA .
The chromosome that it was in cells not one .
The cell phone that we have a cromosome that we &apos;ve got it .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other croms as a extraneous material , and we found it , and we found it with only cells and the new cell and the new cell .
it became blue because of the genes that we &apos;ve been inserious .
And in a short lassigned , all the characteristics of a species have been lost , and it turned around the new area that we &apos;ve been inserted in the cell .
All the proteins are changed , membrane membrane , and when we read the genetic code on what we &apos;ve turned you .
Now , this may seemy genetics , but altering the DNA software we going to change things in a lot of thing about sustaining .
Now , I &apos;ve been explained that here is not talking about genesius -- but to progress from three million years and a half million years evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the Camborian explosion , in which which is going to create new special species on this .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty obvious when we think about our need .
We &apos;re going to get six billion and a half billion people at the next 40 years .
Right to give you an example : I &apos;m born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one in 1946 ; there &apos;s four years , there are four years .
We &apos;re having problems now to find fresh fresh water , medicinal and clean , medicinal and gas for six billion people .
It &apos;s still going to be more dare to do it for nine billion .
We &apos;re going to use more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion barrasses , more than 30 billion barrasses .
That means millions of barrels a day .
When we &apos;re trying to find biological processes , or whatever we &apos;re going to get them , it &apos;s a huge challenge .
We have to have to cont of the CO2 emission of CO2 from these materials that end in the atmosphere .
And the day today , because of the scientific discoveries in all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they are the design components for the future .
The electronic industry can only have a dozen about about components , and think about how many different things come out .
Our limits here are principlally by biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have some techniques , for these synthesids of synthesization , able to create what we call combinatory .
We &apos;re able to build a big robots that can make a billion chromosomes a million chromosomes a day .
Think of these 20 million genes or try to get to optimize the processes to get the processes to make a very good drugs , new vaccines , we can change , through a little team , and create more biology , and create more biology than the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for possibilities of survival , or chemistry , chemistry or carbon , production of vaccines .
This is an instantly of some software programmed on that we &apos;re working to be able to sit us and design species on the computer species .
Well , we don &apos;t know necessarily how they will be .
We know exactly what &apos;s their genetic code .
Now we &apos;re focus on how quarter generation .
You &apos;ve seen ethanol from the grain of was a bad experiment .
We have carbons of second and third generation that are going to have enough to be a carbon for a carburananants of butankle .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increasingly increasing more than the cont of food and limitarian avy deality would be transform CO2 in matter , which we &apos;re working to design cells that can get to design this scale , and we can think we can have the first carbons of these are quarter quarter quarter as in about 18 months .
The light solar solar combined with CO2 is a methods -- but in our discoveries in the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , at about 2500 feet of deeply depth of water .
They can actually put from CO2 by using hydrogen molecular as a source of energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can put the CO2 , which can easily be transported through your books , converting that CO2 in carburn , to drive this process .
So we think we can think we can be able to increase what we can increase what the question of the basis that life is &quot; is &quot; Noil , &quot; we have the goal to replace the whole oil industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do that by TED , where can you do it ?
It would be a main further than energy .
And also , we &apos;re working to use the same methods to create vaccines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with influence , we &apos;re always behind a year and with a dollar when it &apos;s right .
I think that &apos;s changing vaccines to make vaccines in anticipated vaccines .
That &apos;s how the future could start to look at changing , right now , the tree of evolution , accelerating the evolution with synthetic bacteria , and finally cells .
We &apos;re so much on the improving people .
Our purpose is to make a long enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the most of the world &apos;s technology that we &apos;ve taken to the new technology that we &apos;ve taken to a very much year ago , as a year ago , as a year ago . This is Seady .
It &apos;s a environment that you can interact with a local amount of data that remote with a huge amount of data .
And we &apos;re seeing a lot of digabyte gigabyte , with a kind of digital arm , and I continued , for a quick bread , and I continued , to images the images as we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big it is the amount of information that we see , how big these data or these data or images .
Most of digital photographs , but this is a provient scansion from Bilioteca provence from the Bilioteca , and it &apos;s in the gama of 300 megapixel .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that it &apos;s the number of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen in any time . It &apos;s also a very flexeless .
This is a whole book , you know , not about data .
This is Dickens of Dickens . Every column . Every column .
To show you that it &apos;s about heads and not images , we can do something that &apos;s really about that , to see that &apos;s a real represent of the text , not a photo .
It could be a little bit artificial to read a book book .
I don &apos;t have it .
This is a more realistic example . This is a number of the Guardian .
Every big image is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure of the landing of the real version of a newspaper of a newspaper or a daily draft , which is nature of a lot of medium .
We also did something with the angle of this number in the Guardian .
We created a higher published higher solutions -- much higher than that you use in a normal published -- and we &apos;ve been contained you the extra .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even though specific techniques .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that this means to get pop-up and other similar similar similar , they should not be necessarily .
Of course , map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don &apos;t want to lose time , if we don &apos;t have contributed to give you a contributes to this camp .
These are all the streets in the United States , there &apos;s geospatial images of the NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually from the view of the view of the Web ; you can go to see .
This is a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragonfon and the other is a very interesting searches of the computer very interesting computer . It &apos;s a student of the University of Washington , with the help of Steve Sez Seady of Microsoft Rick Seliski &apos;s Research . It &apos;s optioned .
And it &apos;s from the view of the web , drive by Seadragon .
You can see that when we do this kind of pattern , where we can go from one picture to another image and have this kind of experience and have this kind of experience .
But the space of images here has actually a significance of the images here has a significance .
So , the algorithms of the computer have recorded these images together , so that they &apos;re going to have these pictures together , that corresponds to the reals that imaging the near sea , Grass Grasks the Grasks the BGrasssy Montne Roccial Montagne Roccial Montne Roccial show -- and that &apos;s homeless stake all the space of panomoms , and these things have been gone level .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some much more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data from Noah-hot-hot-hot-hot--prototype Photosynth that we &apos;ve done in the first time , the first time the summer extent the key behind this technology , Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily watching behind this technology , Photosynth .
We had to have to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a rebuildings of Noththin Dothers , Do images Flickr . Bastian Do in Flickr and you can get images of types in magic magic and so on . Each of these things and so on . Each one of these arcies represents a picture that &apos;s discovered a picture that &apos;s discovered .
So I &apos;m all images from Flickr and have been related to space in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate so we can see .
You know , I &apos;d never thought I &apos;d ever think about working for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratificant to receiving this kind of access here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different kinds of different kinds of different kinds of different kinds of focus to those professional cellphone to those professional cellphone , in this environment .
And if I can , try to try to get those more strange .
Most are block by faces , etc .
Some of some of here is a series of photographs -- etc .
This is a Noththree Dame recorded .
We can go from the poster to the view of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from a beautiful , from the entire holding of how to applied the land , from vision point of view -- and all those data together .
All those photograph become related , more than the parts .
You have a model of the land that emerging .
Think about this as a prolling prolament proling on Earth &apos;s work .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as well as people use it , and the advantages that are using it .
Their photographed with metadhert by other people .
If someone comes to contrast to each of these saying the name , my photo of all these saying the name , my photo of Nthree Dimprovises , you get to get out of all those data , and I can use some of the data , and I can use the photo be in that space , using the photo the photo anyone else , and have a social experience of the choose and the cross-mophoto be .
Of course , a consequence of all of that are extremely elaborate , extremely elaborate els of the land , you can &apos;t just achieve aereas and slide and slide and slide , but from the collective memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand what your software is going to have us to do is that that &apos;s going to have to do is that somewhere in the next few years , all the photographs shared by anyone in the world are going to be ready in the world will be practically connected together ?
BAA : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is basically to be discovered .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , in images , in images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the pictures .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of simanti-shared information that many of these images are possible .
As when you do a research of images on the web , you get a lot of information about web page has a lot of information about the picture of the picture .
Now , what happens if that photograph you connect all your photograph ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of interconnection that &apos;s really huge is really huge . It &apos;s a classical effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the main pleases when you travel and one of the research ethnographic research is the power to live between the ancient who didn &apos;t forget the antic traditions , in the wind , the past in the wind , it &apos;s going to be in the float to float it .
Basti thinking that the Jaguar Jaguar travel still over the Via Lattea , or that the Milky of Inuit are still meaning , or that in Himalayas , the budddddisters , the budddddholds , to remember the importance of the central anthral , and the idea that the world we live in no sense , but it &apos;s only a model of reality , but it &apos;s only a model of reality , but it &apos;s just a reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stirs has done , well , or a lot of generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential .
All you do . We all do . We all do .
We are subjects of beginning .
We have to death the inexorability of death , so we don &apos;t surprising it if we stay and ballie --
We all have art .
What it &apos;s about the song is the particular song , the dance of the dance of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that they are the Penan forests of Borneo , or the following Voodoo , or the following Kaisut , or the Kaisut in Sepentrive , the Curandero , or a cameleras in the Sahara .
He was my journey of a journey ago , or a hallevator of yak in the valley of a Tomolanglma , on the Everest , the mother of the world .
All of these people teaching us that there are other ways to think , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And , if you reflect a moment , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
Because , together , the cultures of the world &apos;s cultures create a spiritual life and cultural life that &apos;s been flies of the planet and is important for the planet as a biosphere as a biological biological girl note as a biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural nature as a nosphering and you can call the ethnosphere , the whole thing , though , ideas , hyrations , ideas , inspirations , inspirations , inspirations , inspirations , inspirations , from the human imagination from the already of the knowledge .
The ethnosphere is the great patrimony of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how quisitive species .
And because the biosphere was graved by the way , it &apos;s been consumed by ethnosphere and much faster .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all the species is on the horse of the extinction of the extinction of the most apocalitty -- in the most apocalitty -- in the field of diversity -- and it &apos;s not also about the most mystic diversity -- that &apos;s the optimistic diversity -- that &apos;s the different cultural diversity .
The whole thing is , of course , the loss of course , loss of the linguistic .
When you were born there 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not only composed by a vocabulary or a series of rules .
One language is the basic of human spirit .
It &apos;s the medium with the animals that &apos;s animal is going to be in the material world .
Every language is a forest , a strong book , a bind , a spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re here sitting in Monterey , at least half no longer in the ears of children .
They don &apos;t come to children , which means , which means , unless you won &apos;t walk , something that they &apos;re already died .
What is more sad of being available to be available to be the last one , to be the last to talk a language , not having a linguishing the wisdom of the children ?
This is a physical language in some of the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks , and it brings with it in the tomb of a ancient language .
And I know that somebody who will say , &quot; Is it doesn &apos;t be ?
The world wouldn &apos;t it be a better place if we &apos;re talking all the same language ? &quot; We all talk all the same language . We all talk to the chance .
We talk to kogi .
You &apos;ll be a tract thing you &apos;re going to have no way to talk about your language .
Now , I &apos;d like to do you have a journey through ethnosphere --
a little journey in the ethnosphere to give you a lot of what we &apos;re losing .
Most of us forget that when I say , &quot; different ways of life , I mean , &quot; I really mean , &quot; I really mean , &quot; I mean , &quot; I mean , &quot; I think , &quot; there &apos;s a lot of us exists of us forgotten , &quot; I think , &quot; diversity , &quot; I really mean , &quot; I mean , &quot; I really mean , &quot; I mean , &quot; I really mean , &quot; I mean , &quot; I mean , &quot; I mean
We take for example this Barasana Barasana , in Amazon , Amazon , the population of anaconda , which creates to be trying to stay from the fighter of hest high holds .
It &apos;s a population that &apos;s not able to distinguished the blue color blue color , because the celested celested in the forest , which depends the population .
They have a strange language and a major rules , &quot; deal exogamia , &quot; you have to move a person who talk about a person who talk about a different language .
All of this has gone in the mythological past , though the particularity is that in these extincluding extinct or seven languages to be talking about or seven languages no one practice .
They limited to listening and then they start to talk .
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived , the Waorans of Eastern Ecuador , an incredible population , an incredible population that has had the first contact in 1958 .
In 1957 meassionaries have taken a commercial contact .
They &apos;ve done from the highly photographs that retrading them in poses that they had been address , forest that this population forest had never seen bi-dimensional bi-dimensional forest .
They collected the photos from the ground , and they turn it to the shape or a figure , they have concled that it was direct disease , and they kill the five missionaries with the liance .
But Waorans didn &apos;t just kill the straniests .
They kill them .
54 percent of mortality was caused by them .
We &apos;ve been up at eight generations and we found two natural death cases and we found two houses of them , they have seen that one of them was invected , and then they kill it up , and then they kill it at the same .
The accident of the hunters of re-hundred animal from 40 steps and recognizing the species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned a really interesting bad compiece when my professor of Harvard asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to be intrue to be intrue to be able to be in the bottom of Duvalier and Tonton Maces , and imposed me to the fast arm for the zombie to do the zombie to do the zombies .
And to give a sense of miraculous , I should have to understand Vodoun culture and the Voodoo &apos;s culture .
It &apos;s pretty much of a complex meth-physics of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to tell me about the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Budddsm , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has no religious feeling . And he did not feel . And he &apos;s not other than the distilled of these very deeper religious concepts in the tragic tragic disease dience dilpores .
What makes interesting is the intense is the intense is the intense report between life and death .
So the vive are doing the spirits .
The spirits can be invoyed by Great Aca , they answer to the dance of dance and replace temporary animates at the anima very short of the anima very short active anima short , which is the next next .
So , the voodooists love to say , &quot; God go to the wonderful God &apos;s talking about God .
We give in the temple and become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re playing , is the spirit that you , how can you do you do the bad of the bad ?
So you &apos;re assist these incredible events : following voodoo in state of trance that touches are ined a rather stripped a rather strong demonstration of the power on the body when it &apos;s catalyzed in a state of exciting extremely force .
I &apos;ve all the people with what I lived the most extraordinary people are the Kogi of Sierra Nevada Marta , in the Santa Marta , in Colombia .
She turns out of the ancivilization that once live on the carcars on planplanning of the Colombia , the population , the population was roughly roughly on the vulage , which is the population that &apos;s gone on planture .
In a continent of blood continent , this population never never been conquisted by the spagners .
And so , I &apos;m governed today , by a cler , but their formation is really extraordinary .
The young people following away from the families to three or four years , and they live secrets in a bady world and bombers live in a huge world &apos;s basic and bumbs in the ice for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years choose to make the nine months of gestation that transcorn to the mother of mother , now are metaphor , I &apos;m metaphorically in the Great Mther . .
So , that &apos;s acculated by the values of their society , values that they predicted their prayers and only eat their prayers are stained to balance -- or to say the balance equilibrio .
At the term of this incredible initiation , they &apos;re improvising up and for the first time in life , at 18 years , they see an alba . And in that actim of the first burance of the first bullering bage , when the sun burning ban ag , all that they &apos;ve learned in theorety , all of what they &apos;ve learned in theoreteteted , and he says , &quot; The pret a passit behind a back and says , &quot; The precient boly a and says , &quot; The pret a wonderful wonderful time ,
&quot; I &apos;m going to say , I &apos;m going to you .
It &apos;s just just a lot of it is now . It &apos;s going to protect it .
They &apos;re called the greatest frree and say that we , frachieve brothers , we are the destruction of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about Indigene and the environment , we invoking Rseau and the old story of the old history of the burning of the nice , which is a razy concept in its simplicity or maybe we invoded Thoreau and say that these people are more close to the Earth of us .
Indigenes are not nor sentimate sentimate by nostales from the nostales .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the disease of the Afat or in the winds of Tbet , but thank you , thank you , they created a mystic of the Earth , they created a mystic of the Earth is not about the concept of it , but on a bunch of the world can only live because it &apos;s infected by human consciousness .
What does it mean ?
That means that a little girls who grow up the Ande who grows in the mountain is a spirit of the Arit , which is a deeply different human being depwith a different human being depwith a bunch of that place to be a different mountain or that place to be a mountain , which a mountain is a mountain is a mountain in in in which a mountain is a rocy of rocky is a bunder of a mountain or that mountain .
That is the dimall of a mineral or a mineral cave is irrievant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that &apos;s interesting is the measure of the individual world .
I grew up in the forest in the forest Columbia credating that forests to be cut .
And that made me a different human being different human being different from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the Hukuk &apos;s dimall and the history of paradise and the paradise that live in the world , we &apos;re going to have to be northern extreme of the Hamatsa .
If you start to consider that these cultures can actually actually actually make different reality , you can start to understand some of their sensational discoveries .
I &apos;ve taken this picture to open them in the West Amazon .
Mayahuge some of you have heard about the Euask , the most powerful suspsychoacken of the repertory .
What makes the eyahuge is not the drug is not the drug of substance , but it &apos;s his elements . It &apos;s composed by two elements .
From one side , this lian league that &apos;s a series of V-carboline , harmin and harmin , harmin and harming , slightly hallucinogens .
And by making the way , you have a bluef burning ban burning , but it &apos;s mixed with the leaves of a house bt burning arbusiness of the coffee family of the coffee Psychotry .
This plants mains powerful triptams , very similar to the serotonin , methoxyltryptamines five , methoxyltryptamine .
If you ever see Yanomami type on the nose the substance that make a different species of species , which is methoxyltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryptels .
Tiring that policy on the nose is a little bit like being disappeared by a file of paper and landing on a mess of electricity . You don &apos;t believe a distortion of reality .
I was often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who went the psychedelic , with his discovery of the workers in &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in Mexico .
And I think , my tese themselves can &apos;t care these triptams as hallucinogens because if you &apos;re doing not telling any of being kinated .
It &apos;s possible absolutely only if you make other chemicals that denial chemicals deniate the MAO .
Now , the beautiful : the carbbbble thing that are inhibitors of MAO , the same kind of needs to be able to be the triptams . The question of spontaneous triptams . The question of spontaneous , in 80,000 species of plants , like these two dies , but if you combine died in this way , they create a real biochemical version that &apos;s a chemical version that &apos;s just sus on the parts ?
We use the great euphemism of the provide of the test , that can reveal ins .
But if you ask the Indians , they will say , &quot; We &apos;re talking about . &quot;
What does it mean ?
This tribes , Cofan , 17 variety of Ehuge , which distinguished nets in the forest , and that our eyes would be in the same species .
If we ask him how stabilish their tasonomy will tell us , &quot; I was able to think of it , I realized , you don &apos;t know it ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you get 17 variety in a night of the full and each one will song with a different tone .
With that you can &apos;t have aure-degree , but it &apos;s much more interesting than contate the press .
Now , , the problem is that the problem is that also the problem is that even those who have heart people have heart of the high people find paths , but somehow reduction to our history world &apos;s history , and pass .
In fact , the 19th century , 300 years , it &apos;s not remember its wars or remember its wars innovations , but rather as we stopped and we baby or actively actively or accepted actively , or accepted by the way or masses of diversity and cultural of the planet . Now the problem isn &apos;t change .
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibilities .
And the problem isn &apos;t technology .
The Indians Sioux don &apos;t stop being Sioux when they put up up and fully , they have no stopped to be American when they put out of horse and health .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that mines that are mind-integrity . It &apos;s the power .
The flight of the domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you will find that these are not cultures are not destinate cultures .
They are living behind living and dynamic dynamic existence that they go beyond their ability of adaptation .
And that &apos;s disboss disbosing in the patria of Penan --
a population of Sarawak , in the Sarawak , a population , a population of the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to a generation ago , and now reduction on the reduced of the figures , where you can see the river from the living , that seems to be bring away from the light-horizing to the Borneo in the Numes , where the Japanese navel Japanese , where the navels Japanese naves the Nums , which is that the way , the Chridge of the way , the blame of the Japhols of the Rewels of the Greddddge of the Ghan
prints to repeat the stive with the thin the forest .
Or in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that have been with the discovery of those .
If we move on the Tibet mountains , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the right right drop .
As you know the genocide , the physics of a population , is condanted at universal level , but the ethnife , the destruction of living population , not only is condanted , but it &apos;s also celebrated in certain environment , because it makes part of the development .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of Tibet until you get from the beginning .
I &apos;ve got the West 6,000 miles from Chengu desian in China in Western Tibet , coming in Lhasa with a young colleagues , but only came to Lhasa , I understand what &apos;s behind the statistics that we &apos;ve heart .
6,000 feet tools reducts in policies and cens .
1.2 million people killed from the military Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascrited to Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed to the days of Chinese invasion .
Sought with Santity in Santity during the diaspora that has taken the population in Nepal .
Soum was imprisoned and his colpa was to be rich .
It &apos;s been taking naked by the age of two nasking a year in the age of two nasking under his glady because he couldn &apos;t have living without him .
The sister , who did the same , it was put in in reeducation .
One day he &apos;s unavoid a fashion Mao and , for this transgression , and , for this transgression , was put forced in the labor for seven years .
The Tbet can be insure , it can be insatisopy , but it &apos;s reductable .
At the end , it &apos;s all it &apos;s reduces .
We want to live in the world world &apos;s world &apos;s homatic of the monotony or we want to collect the policromatically diversity ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before we have said that its biggest fear was that , in our own living love to this amorous amority of the world , we &apos;re going to see the whole ama of human imagination is going to get us from a depensive modality , but one day a day we &apos;re seeing from a dimented sleep , but one day we &apos;re possibilities .
And it &apos;s umiliant to remember that our species is there for 600,000 years .
The Revolution , which has given us the agriculture , which has done us to have the cult of the seed , by by the seed of the seed , by by the way , by putting the next closer , creating the gerarchy of specialization , and we &apos;re talking about 10,000 years ago .
The industrialized world in the industrialized world at the 300 years .
That sharks not suggested me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to be deal with the challenges that we have to come .
When these cultures of the world &apos;s cultures are asked what it is to say to be human , they say , &quot; they have 10,000 different voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all records to be what we &apos;re going to be what we are : a kind of consciousness , that &apos;s to make all the people can fiord . And there are great moments of all the people can fiord .
I took this picture on the north extremity of Baffin , when I went to hundred of bales with the Inuit , and this guy , and this guy , and this guy , Olaya , and he told me the wonderful story of his non-grandfather .
The government isn &apos;t always gentile with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to stabilie our premise , we &apos;ve got them in colonies .
The grandfather was this man has refused to go .
The family , themselves for his life , brought all the arms , and all its actols .
You have to know that the Inuit isn &apos;t feel the cold , they are under it .
The pacins of the origins were made of fish have flown on the skin of pins .
The nonther of this guy has not done by the arctimiddle or the blizard , or the blizy that &apos;s gone .
It &apos;s gone out , you &apos;ve got gone out of the focus in your hand . And it &apos;s taken in their hand . When I did I made them , it &apos;s worked , it , it &apos;s working a moan .
It &apos;s until it was on the war of this crop of holds , and when it became solid , he kill a dog .
He schools the dog and created a bridge , with the hactical casses has created a sleep , and it &apos;s bright on the banchisa , and it &apos;s broken on the banchisa , and it &apos;s broken broken on the rest .
We want to talk about cavar with nothing ?
In 1999 , the canadvice of the government has gone to the total control of a territory of the California and Texas I together .
It &apos;s their new patries . It &apos;s named .
It &apos;s a territory of independent . They &apos;re all the mineral resources .
One splendigit of how a natione-state can recognize with its population .
And , finally , I think it &apos;s rather obvious , at least at least to the planet , make it not the remote of the planet , make they don &apos;t have remote .
For somebody &apos;s home .
They are represented sections of human imagination that are rising to the other days . And for all these kids , as the dreams of our children , as the dreams of our children , become part of swim .
For finally , us National Geographic is convinced that political political never will be anything that &apos;s going to be nothing .
We believe that polemy --
&#91; Ausi &#93; , &#93; not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the best institution to tell stories about the world . Every month our site of the world . Every month our site of the world .
156 countries our television .
Our reviews are several millions of people .
Our work is to travel in the ethnosphere to bring our public in places that are going to be basic wondered by how they &apos;ve seen and hope , they will be able to get away from the central reveal of anthropology : the market of the world &apos;s lives , and we have to find a lives in a living world of the lives in a pluralistic world and multicultural living in a and multicultural lives , and we have to find a living living in a living in a living pluralists of life in a
where the wisdom of all the population can contribute to our well-being contribute .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope is already other than you &apos;ve heard and I &apos;m going to try to evidence some colleagues , in case not notice .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the dogma officer . &quot;
The dogma officer of what ?
The dogma officer of all of the Western industrial society . The dogma officer : &quot; If we want to male the benefits of our citizens &quot; The way to do it is to massy the individual liberty . &quot;
The reason is , from a side , in fact that freedom is in the fact that freedom is the value , is , useful , for human beings .
On the other is that if we &apos;re free , each of us can act to do all that maximate to do everything that maximizing our well-being , without any one that decide to name .
The way to masses liberty is to be to massy the choice .
More people have , more people are libers , and greater is their liberty , greater is their liberty , greater is their well-being .
This is so deeply radical in the society that no one would be dreamed to put it in the society that no one would be able to the doubt .
And it &apos;s also deeply radical in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress can .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly great .
I &apos;m allowed a simple note on conditions .
In my supermarket there are 175 conditions , without contate 10 variety of oil , and 12 acres of oil and 12 acets that you can buy to make you a huge number of conditions that you can buy to make a huge number of the 175 pronce that nobody already is to your deadent .
That &apos;s the supermarket .
And then you go to the electronic to buy a stereo : case , if you can get a stereo , plastra , amplifer , plastra .
And in this single negotiate of electronic , there &apos;s a big number of audio .
We can do six and a half million different combinations using the components that there are only one negotiate .
We have to admit that there &apos;s a lot of choice .
Other fields : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the serve services , they could get all the phone of the mom , at the top of the Bell .
It was born the phone , it didn &apos;t buy it .
One of that , in the other , it was that the phone was never going to hit .
These days are gone .
Now we have a variety almost limited phones , specially between cellular phones .
Here &apos;s cellphone of the future .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , cut apels of the nose , and shapels for the critical climbroken .
If you don &apos;t have seen it in the house you have seen in the house , you &apos;re going to get to be .
And what &apos;s the end is that people are going to come into the news and does this question . And you know what &apos;s answer is &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cellphone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the busts , you can true the same explosion of choices .
Assistence : not happens in the United States that you go to the doctor and doctor doctor doctor what you have to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do it , or B , &quot; As &quot; A , &quot; As these well-holds and these benefits . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Dr. &quot; What should I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A these benefits and these benefits , and B has these benefits and these lots . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebed , &quot; Dr. if you &apos;re doing me , what would it do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result we call it &quot; autonomy of malsees , &quot; expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But actually it &apos;s not a lot of fishing the responsibility to make a light-up decisions , which is the doctor , someone else you don &apos;t know -- and almost certainly it &apos;s not -- and so it &apos;s not not in condition .
There &apos;s a huge marketing products , drugs to people like me and you , that if you think there &apos;s no sense , that if you think there &apos;s no sense , I &apos;m not going to buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why do you do them ?
The answer is that they want to be that we call the doctor to change it .
Something so fundamental as it &apos;s our hyentity is a question of choice , as you see in this judge , &quot; We don &apos;t want to force children . They &apos;re going to hold their . We &apos;re going to standard to be right now .
And we can reinvent how many times us .
That means that every morning , to be saying , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I &apos;m standing at the family and mathemselves , a time time common common , almost anyone , it was that you can get the most soon as possible , and it started to get the most soon possible possible .
The only choice was with who , not when , and not even what to do after .
That &apos;s really to play .
I teach to a very smart students , and I do 20 percent work in less than a time .
And not because they &apos;re not not not brilliant , because they &apos;re not not not not because they are .
but because I &apos;m impensieritital , I mean , &quot; I &apos;m going to move or not ? I &apos;m going to do it now ? &quot;
&quot; Do I must must be able to be able to think before the children or career ? &quot;
They &apos;re logorant interrogorant .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this implement not the companies that you don &apos;t get a beautiful vote to my exture .
And they have to do that . They have important questions .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , as Carl Soolineant , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from Hotel Randolph .
And it &apos;s a angolin , there &apos;s a angolin , and I &apos;m not going to tell anybody , where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t say , because I want to use it .
What does , this mean is , this incredible freedom of choice that we have to continually on every moment , if we have to work or not .
We can go to our son to play calcium , with the cellphone in a task , Blackberry in the other , and the night , and the night , on the ginockberry .
And even though they &apos;re all spended , every minute that we see our son , we also see our son , we &apos;re also asking , we &apos;re also asking this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? I have to make this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is &quot; no , &quot; that makes the experience of your son &apos;s own son &apos;s experience of your son &apos;s gone to other conditions .
So , as anywhere we look , little and big , little and big , materials and life , life is a choices , life is a choices .
Once the world was this : Well , there were some possibilities , but it was not a question of choice .
The world today &apos;s world &apos;s like this : The dilemma is , &quot; Is it &apos;s a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Shot .
So , the positive lots of knows them about that negative .
All this choice composed two effects of those negative effects on people .
The first , paradoxized , is that it &apos;s produced to liberation .
And so many options that you choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
You offer an example , meaning example : a study example of volunteer .
A colleagues had access to the data of Vanserved , the gigantic society of sources , with about a million of climents in 2000 different companies .
What she found out of two percent of them are offered in more , the percentage solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of the adesion is two percent .
With 50 sources , there &apos;s 10 percent of the adesions that are available to when I &apos;m available to only five . Why ?
Because with 50 sources that you choose , is maleaped to decide , and the choice is is sent to decide , and the choice is remained to the indomority .
And at domain , and again , domain , domain , domain , and of course , domain , and of course , domain , and of course , domain , and domain , of course , domain , and domain , of course , domain , and domain , and of course , domorances , and of course , domain , and of course , domories , and of course , domain , and of course , domain
You can &apos;t just mean , that these works from old , because these works from old food because they don &apos;t have enough money , it &apos;s also to say that the decision is so obstic that decision is so obstic that they also have the complementary of the loser of work .
Not teaching , they &apos;re losing , they &apos;re losing until I &apos;m going to be going to be going to be going to be them .
So the paralysis a consequence of the way .
And I think that it makes the world .
&quot; And finally , for the ethernity : ketchup , or maybe it ? &quot;
Would you like to take the right decision , if it &apos;s for ethernity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the bottom , and nepurches the wrong conditions .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even though we can avoid the paralysis , and we &apos;re less satisfying out of the result of how we would be with less options that we were less options with less options .
And that &apos;s for different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of conditions that you choose , if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us to date the crap , and the replant sweat , and the replant saving the sodgs that you can have the record , and the software that you can have the decision ,
even when it was a good decision .
More choices there are , more it &apos;s easy than you said , that it &apos;s insoften insoften .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert asked very well as the value that we &apos;re going to depend on what we are the things we are going to be .
In the rest , when there are lots of options , it &apos;s easy to represent the characteristics of alternative alternative and be less satisfying than it is choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m taking all that I &apos;m not in New York .
But that &apos;s what you probably would be thinking .
There &apos;s this coppia of Hamptons .
A place of light .
It &apos;s bad . Otyma days . It &apos;s all for them .
It doesn &apos;t lose anything . But what he thinks it &apos;s , &quot; Well , maledition , is August . &quot;
&quot; All my neighbors in Manhattan are away . &quot;
&quot; I could talk about home . &quot;
And it &apos;s two weeks and assiled by the idea that &apos;s losing -- every day -- the possibility of them .
The costo-opportunity is declining the satisfaction for that we have , even when choice was .
And the most of the options that we have to consider , the more activity , you will return up to us as a cost-opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This vision is saying a lot of things .
We talk about the living time , and maybe it &apos;s maybe of living .
But the most important thing is that anything you choose , you choose to do other .
The things we don &apos;t choose have a lot of attractive activity that can make less attractive what we do .
Tirst : spiral growing of expectations .
I tried it on my skin bought a new jeans .
I &apos;m going to almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were one of the guy , buying them and bought up , they were scomfortable , they were scomfortable , only after they took a living and washing a lot of washing , they start to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple when that old them , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , I need a couple jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Who wants slim , fit &apos;s fit , relaxy and fit ? &quot;
She wants to them to do it or broken ? &quot; Stonewashed &quot; or &quot; acidwashed &quot; ?
&quot; Would you have straight ? &quot;
&quot; Sow the basic or street ? Bol bble basic -- &quot; Continured to elency .
I was broken , and after a little bit I &apos;ve managed to say , &quot; I want the kind of -- that was the only guy that was , &quot; I had no idea what I was , so for a hour , and then I tried out of the best jeans , then came out of the best jeans I &apos;ve ever had .
It was the big . I had got the best . I had got the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a book of book to understand it .
The reason I was worse for worse is that with all the choice , the jethers had to be perfect , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was a little bit of minime . I didn &apos;t expected anything that was there was only one , but when there was only a kind of 100 different , lacks , at least a kind of fully , at least a guy had to be perfect .
What I had bued was good , but not perfect .
After I talked to that choose that I was trying to confront of the expectations .
The addition of the people don &apos;t make people than these are the expectations that these have respect to the eccellence .
And that &apos;s going to make less satisfying , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing if it makes it .
Because if they knew it , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more about this .
&quot; You know , it was better when you were worse , &quot; The reason that you had better when you were worse , it &apos;s better when you were worse , it &apos;s still possible to meet .
And the day , in the world that we live -- opulents , industrialized citizens with expectations of perfection -- the most of the things are about the heith of the height of the expectations .
You never spred pleased pleasant because your expectations , you know , I &apos;m ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Well , you know , &quot; You want to be expectations . &quot;
I mean , little self-obiographic moment -- which I &apos;m really moved and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn &apos;t have better , I didn &apos;t have to do it .
But to not always is a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of buying a couple of jeans scomfortable when there &apos;s only that you &apos;re not saying , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot; And the answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What could I do you do you do you do it ?
When you have hundreds of types of jeans , and buy a disastastonishing you , and you ask you who are the responsible , it &apos;s as clear that you are .
You could have better .
With hundreds of variety , there are no excuse for the insuccess .
So when people are decisions , even though the result is valid , they feel unexpected and they &apos;re going to give them them them .
In the last few depression is exploss in the industrialized world .
I think a meaning factor -- not the only important -- not the only important -- of this depression is that people have experiences of the people &apos;s experiences because the standard of the standard because standard are too .
And when they have to explain this situation they think the color is they .
So the end result is that we &apos;re better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely fake . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than it &apos;s not not affected , but it doesn &apos;t have that it &apos;s better than a little bit .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m pretty sure we &apos;ve been on a piece of the level that choices our life .
Now , from political point -- I &apos;ve almost finished -- from political point , the nocle is the following .
What allows all this choice in industrial society is the material wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know about it , where the problem is not that they have a lot of choice .
The problem is they have too little .
So the factory that I &apos;m talking about is a malbeing malbeing died with modern , recidly society .
And what &apos;s does it make and arrand is this : Steve Levitt has talked about how those expensive and seats seats seats for books are useling . It &apos;s a waste waste of money .
I mean , these choices , complicated and dispendependent , it &apos;s not just useless .
They &apos;re address of the eeteries .
They do worse .
If a little bit of what our society allows , it &apos;s allows to those where people have too few possibilities , it would not only be their lives , it would not only be their lives , but also our life .
This is what economists call a improvement improvement .
A distribution reduction is good for everybody -- not only because of the poor -- because of this choice that &apos;s going to us .
So , you can become everything you want to become everything you want &quot; --
You , people of culture , you think , &quot; What does that believe that weight ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious you can &apos;t make it in a glass . &quot;
&quot; An inside , a limited vision of the world --
and I interpret it as I interpret , and I interpret .
But then , I think about it , I realized that that fish the long known .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you eat in the broke , so that &quot; everything you can &apos;t get the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you romot the drop in a way that all possible possible declining .
Accentuate the paralysis , and you reduck the well-being .
All they need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too much , maybe even strike for us , and certainly for us .
But the axide with some simbolic symbolic symbolic , I &apos;m not going to rhind .
Thank you very heart .
