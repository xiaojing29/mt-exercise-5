The year I showed these slidemonstrated to demonstrate that the artica glacial glacial , which for almost three million years has been the size of 40 percent .
But this sub-up sub-gravity , because it doesn &apos;t show the gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice of the ice .
The arctic heat is , in a sense , the pull of the pulsing heart of the global climate system .
It &apos;s expanded inverter and retreatment .
The next slide slide is going to be a quick careful on the last 25 years .
The ice losenian perennia are signed .
As you see , they expand they &apos;re wish to blue .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter , which is the glacier .
You can see that the ice cosidly , the cosidly dle of five years or , it &apos;s like the blood , which is how the blood , which is here field from the body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been saying that .
This is a problem because the retained full interested in the ocean , where there are enormous amount of carbon congets , where there are enormous amount of carbon , and they &apos;re transformed into metane from the microbes .
The totality of the totality of the atmospheric inquency , that amount could radical , super-hand-hand-hand-up , super-hand-up , super-hand-up , super-handing , super-hand-house , super-atmospheres to the totality of the atmospheres of the atmospheres of the atmospheres of the atmospher
In some some little laghi little deep in Alaska , the metane is already rebecting from the water .
The professorehistory of the University of Alaska is recky with a team that &apos;s received a team that winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You &apos;re good . The question is if we &apos;re going to be .
One reason is that this termal scale from the Greenland from the north .
This is a figured out .
The led had never reached levels .
This is the Kangerlush &apos;s Kangerlush in the southwest of Greenland .
If you want to know how a sal level for the sea level for the ice of the ice to the ice the sea , here &apos;s where it reaches the sea .
These running are increasing rapidly .
At the other part of the planet : Antartiica , the biggest block of ice ice ice planet .
The month the month scientists have diclose that the balance of the ice is in negative , and Antartarctica , which is the Antarctars on some subtle islands , is particularly quid .
Equeeer at six feet of the watching across the Greenland .
Sull Himalaya , the third biggest block of ice , you see new laghi , that a few years ago , and they were glacier .
40 percent of the world population has been half-water power power from that he &apos;s powerful water from that short .
Sulle Ande : this ice is the source of the power of the power of this city .
The led is increased .
But when it dimines , the same thing happens to be potable able .
In California , the snow on the Sierra Nevada is demining .
The hydrogen is in the crisis .
The predictions , as you &apos;ve read , I &apos;m graveating .
The growing growing in the world &apos;s downdrop to a remarkable increase .
The environmental disasters are increasing a rhythm out of the normal and without precedenting .
Four numerous times over the last 30 years from the precedented 75 .
This is a whole thing that &apos;s an unsustainable to it .
If you look at it in history , you can see the consequences .
In the last five years we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 tonnels -- 25 million tons of tons of tons in the oceans every day .
Look at the time of the Pacific Pacific , from American , and the American , and on both the bottom of the Indian subcontinent , where there &apos;s a radical pattern of oxygen in the oceans .
Most of global warming , together to the deforestation , which is 20 percent of it , is the use of fossil combustible combustible .
The oil is a problem , and the paper is even worst .
The United States are one of the two more emissions , together at China .
And he was proposing to build a lot of other carbon .
But we &apos;re assisting to a change of direction .
These are the annuled projects in the last few years and some of the alternative versus alternative versus .
At every way , there &apos;s a political lotta in our country .
The carbon industries and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the paper , which is a hosysimult , which is a hosysimult .
That picture me remember something --
Natal , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a perfect 3.8 billion pounds of paper scories .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the second biggest of scories in America .
It was around Natal .
The natalized public audience of one of the carbon industries .
Video : I mean , the carbon is a carbon and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it &apos;s growing our economy .
It &apos;s a carbon is more and more clean .
It &apos;s good price , it &apos;s a good thing , adorable and work makes the stipendent .
Al Gore : For here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest society in the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his amministrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : Sarke clark -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosis , Harry Reid -- don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima Protection of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is one of them , one .
Video : ALergy COALergy , we see the climate change as a sery sery to our business .
So our priority is invest a big amount of money in a hard effort to make public effort and confused the truth .
In fact , the carbon is not sporting .
We think it &apos;s clean -- it &apos;s also a good profuman .
So not preoctor of climate change .
Let me do .
Video : Ator : Ator : Carbone -- you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
So let &apos;s go into a hyrate in a struggle to address as a pulit .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little rumor , but this is the sound of the pulit technology .
The carbon of carbon is between the main causes of global warming , but the night-clear plit paper you see change everything .
You have a look at this : this is the hate watching plikely .
Al Gore : Inally , the positive alternative altery , the positive altery and national security .
Video : System . The America is in cription ; the economy , national security , national climate crisis .
The philos that connects all : our hoil dependence from fossil combustible and oil .
Now , it &apos;s a new , audacy solution for using solution for using it .
Repower America : 100 percent of full energy , 10 years .
A plan to repect America to work , make us sure more safety , and help to stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that &apos;s a solution that &apos;s a solution that &apos;s problems .
Repower power . Scop of America .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : System energy . It &apos;s about red-energy energy .
One of the faster ways of spores to the dependence from the combustible that kills kill our planet .
Computing : The future is here . I feel , just a new energy netics .
She &apos;s got two : Novi investment for places of a hard job .
Commove : Sholds America . It &apos;s time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A proverbian old old a proverbian says , &quot; If you want to go fast , go .
If you want to go away , you go together . &quot;
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
The year at TED I did a feckle on the LHC .
And I promise to return you to get back to how the machine works .
So here I fix . And the ones that the other time , there was no , the LHC is the biggest experiment ever ever tenth -- 27 miles of circonference .
Her task is to receive the conditions that were less than a billion-second of the universe -- until the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
All this is simply environment .
This is the spot in Gineveness .
We &apos;re going to pick these mini-Bang Bang inside the resevators .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- it &apos;s 44 feet , it &apos;s a behind 22 feet .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in buildings so you can see the proportions .
Ten of the last year we have access the car year we have access the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was causing immense of festegamming in control room .
It &apos;s a first picture of the particles that had done all around the LHC , walking into collision , and by a collision , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles in the respecer .
In other words , when we see that picture of the 10 secember , we realized that the machine worked , which is a big vittoria .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to do us exultate more or this , when somebody went on Google and saw that the beginning was this .
That means we have had a cultural impact to the scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had just to these films here -- these dored dored .
These films are 13,000 ampers when the machine works at the very powerful of power .
Now , the technical technical technical , and they &apos;ll be watching , &quot; It &apos;s not true . &quot;
And they can do it because when they &apos;re very cold became the superconducts .
So , at less 271 degrees , at a inferior temperature for the stars , these philos can bring that run .
In one of the young novemisle in the LHC , there was a fest of fabric .
So the philos wasting slightly , and 13,000 ampits improvising a suddenly electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think these magnets are about 20 tons , and that are moving over the slate , and that have moved about 30 feet .
They &apos;re damaged about 50 magnets .
We had to take them , what we did .
We &apos;ve been repristined and traveled .
Now they &apos;re coming back all the sub-place .
By the end of marzo LHC is will be new integrate .
We &apos;ll accenate it , and we expect data to get the right data or players , and continuing our adventure to discover what the morning is the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these accidents are retaining the dibate on the value of science and engineering . It &apos;s easy to confuture .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact of going to go beyond the value of things like LHC .
I want to conclude with a words of a Inglese scientist , Humphry Davy , which , I think , in the defense of his ppillo , his pupillo , his pupildle was Michael Faraday , said , &quot; Nothing is so dangerous for the progress of human mind as the rest of human mind as the science of human mind that ideas of science , that our trifour-definitely conquered tric monkey . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to rethink when , from children , played , played cyaves .
While you get them and rare them , take them and take them and get them and moving them , learning , and they &apos;re going to think and solve problems capacing capacing problems .
The reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , from the information of the user usual of our interaction with physical objects , together at my consultor , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to ask , &quot; If we use a computer , instead of the mouse as die as a dig dig die that &apos;s moving a mouse , we could confidence to a desktop with a wish information , we could fall ,
and systemate it to our placement ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , and build the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a whole active computer interactive as a biscoom .
In a few words , a Siftable is a whole active computer interactive as a biscoom .
You can move them with the hand , they can see , &quot; you can see , &quot; among them , and they have a scream and a radio .
But above , they &apos;re physical objects , like the morning , you can move simply standing them .
The Siftable is an example of a new ecosystems to manipulate the digital information .
And as a hand that become more physical , consciousness of other , and as a lot of other people , and as become more physical , of other , how we can explore new movement , of the other , how we can explore new style and fun interaction .
I &apos;m going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configurated to show the video : if I cline in a direction , video will rotate , it will rotate from the other hand .
These are interactive , are consciousness .
If you go , you know , you &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re going around .
If they &apos;re circonducting , they can get a little bit .
If they &apos;re circonducting , they can get a little bit .
They &apos;re going to go and inclination .
We &apos;ve realized that one of the interesting interesting implications of the interaction was the power to use communicate gesture , &quot; a color like , &quot; a color like , &quot; a color like a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable , as a configurated century and I can use them to grew color in the central of color in that central , where they misx .
and I can use them to grew them to grew color in the central , where they misx .
If we &apos;re going to be too much , we can put a little place .
They &apos;re also beautiful possibilities of learning , like languages , math and logic games where people can try and logic and logical results of them .
Now , I &apos;m --
This is a sequence of Fibonacks I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a game of words that &apos;s half between Scarabeum and Boggle .
Pratically , every turn to a letter on every Siftable on every Siftable , Pratically , every turn on every Siftable on every Sift-fulletter , and while cers of them comport .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s a children came to the Media Lab , I did , so I did them and turned a video .
They &apos;re very placeased .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people many instructions .
You just say , &quot; Compons of words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s what other people who try it .
This is our young biggest goes , there on the right .
It really wanted to implemn them .
They were only morning .
Now , this is an interactive application of a cardboard .
We wanted to build a device for the learning of languages .
It can indeed with their own drawing in the scene , soliftable .
It can indeed with their own drawing in the scene , soliftable .
So , he &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : The sun is source .
David Merrill : Now he has a treatment in the scene .
Video : The tor : The target .
By job ! Yes ! Yes !
So schooling Siftable and put them nearby can interact the personally ,
Video : Bau !
And by inventing their history .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a story with an open final , and it can decide him as you &apos;re wish .
DM : It &apos;s a story with an open final , and it can decide him as you &apos;re wish .
Video : Voly type .
DM : The last example I have the time to show you is a device , realized by the way , to sampling and exequeen music .
It &apos;s a tool , realized by recently , to walk and exequish music .
The Siftable is sound , base and battery .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose what use .
You can start to put these sound in a sequence sequence to comport your placement .
And modificate it just to touch a sound . &quot;
These are effects that you can control from the vive , like the reverse and filter .
The acres at a particular sound and then clins to get it .
And then there are general effects as time and volume , that they applying to the whole sequence .
Let &apos;s look at how it works .
Video : We &apos;re going to start putting a base in two Siftable . &quot; sequence , we &apos;re doing it , we &apos;re going to add the basic , we add other lower .
Now , I put a basis of the bottom .
Video : DM add now : I add of percussions --
Video : DM : And I &apos;m going to put the philter to the bacteria , so I can control the effect from the face .
Video : DM : I can speak the whole sequence by a hand ,
Video : And I &apos;m going to add the bottom to give the longer more expression .
Video : DM : I can reombing the sequence . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to plan it first , but I can improving it , make it longer or the cordly .
And now , finally , I can smoking the whole sequence at the left sequence to the left the Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new man &apos;s interfaces of the machine and more like our brain works and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the results of this percorrect , and also some possibilities that we &apos;re looking for bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that it &apos;s coming to this new generation of designs to interact with digital media objects , that will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time to talk to all of you .
I &apos;m a writer .
By books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also the love and the fashion of my life .
And I don &apos;t expect that it can change .
But , said , this , something was recently successful in my life and in my career , and in my career , who bring me to this work .
The particular thing is I recently wrote this book , this whography called &quot; Mangia , Prua , Prua , Prua , Ama , &quot; which , a few reason I &apos;m going to have a few reason that , in some reason that , in the world and become a big feeling , baestseller .
And the result is that everywhere going to go , people , people treat me as if I were condanned .
I mean , condanned , condanned .
They are having all worried and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t fear of the fear that you can &apos;t do any fear more ?
You don &apos;t have fear of continuing to write all the lifetime without power , you can &apos;t be able to make a book that it can important to someone ? &quot;
what can you important to someone ? &quot;
It &apos;s rassuring , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember that I remember more than 20 years ago , when I was a adolescent -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a writer .
I &apos;m going to meet the same as a crazy reaction .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t feel that I couldn &apos;t you have succeded ?
You don &apos;t have fear that the billion killing you ?
You don &apos;t have to do this for all of the whole life without any lifetime without any nothing is going to die on a cumulo of dreams of unleft to love cumule ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I have a couple of all the things .
I &apos;ve always had a couple .
And I have a lot of other things that people could not inate .
As the floor and other things are spaving .
But , how much much about the write what I thought and I was wonderful , because ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logical that anybody who has been waiting for being spending by a job that you feel hard to do .
But what &apos;s so particular in the way to make us nervous about creative health is about the way that other careful .
How my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer , and I don &apos;t remember one once in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if he had a couple of engineer ?
It was never -- that block of the John engineer , how does it go ?
It didn &apos;t work that , you know ?
Onestly , chemical engineers as a group have not certainly , in the secuity , dadagnered manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manivers .
We have enough , we have enough this reputation , and not just writers , but creative of every kind of a kind , we have this reputation of being enormous instailable .
And it &apos;s not about the other that look at the connections of the magnific ments that only creative in the last century , just in the 21st century , they die young people ,
And even the ones that don &apos;t have suicidated to be really disdismanded by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , &quot; Each my book killed me a little bit of more . &quot; A extraordinary business of life .
But we don &apos;t bad when we heard this because we &apos;ve heard these things so long that somehow we have completely interior interior and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are in some way , and the art , it &apos;s going to conduce the end .
And the question I want to ask all of the today is : Did you agree with this idea ?
You know this thing -- because you &apos;re looking at a centimeter of a distance , I don &apos;t really well for anything that suppose .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous , and I don &apos;t want to see it perpetuate in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our big teachers of our teachers of living .
And I &apos;m sure that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start figing that I was in my hearing hoscure , above the circumstances where I &apos;m in my career .
I mean , I &apos;m a look , I &apos;m quite a young , I &apos;ve about 40 years .
I have still about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that any thing write about the time , then it &apos;s going to be right from the world as the job that it &apos;s after the world that I &apos;m going to be a lot of my last book .
I &apos;m going to be slumping , because we &apos;re all the most friends here -- is probable my biggest success is to my bigger .
Oh , Gesus , who think .
You know this is the kind of thinking that that &apos;s a kind of thinking that it &apos;s going to start bing gin the morning nine and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would stop doing this work that we love .
So , the question is , how do you do ?
And so it seems to me , after a lot of reflection , which the way to writing is to create a psychological costrict , OK ?
I have a few way to find a security of safety between me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxy on what reaction is going to be written , and as I was looking at all year , and I was looking at the time , trying to find other society to see if they could have better ideas and more under societies to see if they could have better ideas and more more sane and more sane sane and more sane several ideas to see if they could have the better ideas and better ideas . And as I &apos;m looking at the time , and more
how to help people to manage the emotional inerents risks emotional inerents of creativity .
And that research has taken me to the ancient Green and ancient Rome .
I sept me because it &apos;s a circle and then go back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seemed to believe that creativity to human human beings , OK ?
It was thinking that creativity was this spirit of the divine , and that came to a few different different different disdish and known , for distant reasons and known , for distant reasons and known .
The greatest called these &quot; spirits of creativity &quot; Dians . &quot;
You know , wonderful , it was created to have a demon that was wisdom .
The Roman were the same idea , but they call that spirit without a body genius .
which is great , because the Romans didn &apos;t really think that a genius was someone particularly intelligent .
They believed that a genius was this kind of entity divine that created literally created literally in the walls of a study of an artist , and that came out of a little bit like Dobby , and that &apos;s a model of the work of the artist and model the result of that work .
Here &apos;s a way -- here is , that &apos;s the distance of which talking about -- that psychological costrucks that you get you from your work .
And everybody knew that was so that it worked , right ?
So the anticism were protected by certain things , like the too much narcism , right ?
If your job was that you couldn &apos;t take all the market , you couldn &apos;t take all of it , they all knew that you could help from this genior .
If your job , it was not all the fallies , it wasn &apos;t all college , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be an incapable .
And so people han concept creativity in the West for a lot of time .
Then Renascies came and all changed , and nacque this big idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe &apos;s universe &apos;s the misteries and later to make mitic creatures that write detail from the divinity .
This was the principle of rational humanesimum , and people began to think that creativity was completely from the idividle .
And for the first time in history , he began to refer to this or the artist as a rather than a genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big herror .
I think that to allow someone , a simple person to believe that a non-in-ground , the essence and the source of all mysters , creative , unknowledge , creative , and we have a lot of psyched to be a very big philty to the psychroll of human .
It &apos;s like to ask someone to inrow the sun .
Dead shape and full all these ingentips on the performance .
And I think it was this pression to destroyed artists in the past 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think that &apos;s the question is , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe you go back to a relationship of relationship between humans and creative .
Or perhaps not .
Maybe we can &apos;t sing 500 years of rational thinking about a rational psychlorse .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience that soldiers would have a lot of scientific notes on , injugging , and you &apos;re following people , and they &apos;re going to be a lot of fairs .
I &apos;m not going to convince you all about this .
But the question I want to ask is -- why not ?
Why don &apos;t it to think that way ?
Because it &apos;s more sense than any other thing that has ever heard to explain the exasperant exasperant of creative process .
A process that , as anybody ever ever ever told about doing something -- so , basically , all here -- you know , you don &apos;t comport rationally .
And , in fact , it can be completely paranormal .
I did this recently meet with the extraordinary poetry , Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but it &apos;s been a poetry for all of life and said that during his infants in Virginia , working out in the Virginia , and feel it was , in the waiting , when a poem was coming from the landscape .
He said that it was like a train of air .
And that was coming up to her landscape from the landscape .
It was going to hear it , because he was tremendous land under his feet .
She knew to have one thing to do to that point and it was , words , &quot; run like a math . &quot;
And so it was correct to the house and he was following from this poetry , and it wouldn &apos;t have to get a piece of card and a faster , while he was trapplying it , and they &apos;re going to raise it on the page .
Sometimes not could be able to be fast , so correct and correct and correct and correct poetry and roled poetry and poetry to get it through the landscape , and he would continue to rolate through the landscape , trying , how he said , &quot; one poet . &quot;
Then there were times -- this piece , I &apos;ll never forget it -- there were some moments where the statement was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and was looking for paper and poetry it was looking for card and poetry to a math in while he was walking , and then he said , that it was like you walk up with the other hand the ot hand .
He was going to cut the poetry from the tail and repage in his body and page it was page .
And in these cases , the poetry was presented on the perfect page and intact , but at the last one .
So when I heard it &apos;s crazy to my creative process to my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conduction !
I &apos;m a mouse , and my way of work is , and wake up to the same orary every day and work and sweat and work and go on and go over the watching .
But even I , in my test , I was later , I was led against that thing , sometimes .
And I &apos;m also imagine that many of you did .
You know , even though the work and ideas came from a certain source , I could not honestly know it .
And what is this ?
And how can we relationship us to do it , but , rather , rather , rather , what do you remains us ?
For how much I about , the best example of the best contemporary , I have is musician musician , which I interviewed several years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of the life has been the incarnation of artist , trying to control , trying to control , trying to control , to manage , dying these kind of totally inter-in-inter-in-interested in the totally inter-in-interested .
But then he investigate , and one day , and one day as he was driving on a &quot; selling select to Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
She was going to go quick and all of a sent , this little sent , that comes into his head like ispiration , which comes into his head as it does , elusive , elusive , and the want , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the desidery , but you know , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , but you don &apos;t know how to take it .
It &apos;s not a piece of card , it doesn &apos;t have a math , it &apos;s not a recorer .
So , he began to hear this species of old old old anxioned , &quot; the song to lose , and I &apos;m told to lose , and I &apos;ll remark obsessed by this persemployees .
I &apos;m not good enough , and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to go into the panic , he stopped .
He must mate the whole mental process and did something completely new .
And he just look at the sky and said , &quot; Scause , not see that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Do you look like that it &apos;s written a song now ?
If you really want to exist , you go back to a bit more of a time when I can take care of you .
You go to important something else today .
You know , Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his process has worked changed after this .
Not work , the job was still hoscure as always .
But the process , and the anxy that was reef when he was prised when he was prised , the genius that was causing nothing else and liberry it will be able to remandle back where it came from , realized that it didn &apos;t have to be a whole thing that was not to be a interior .
but it was wonderful , wonderful , wonderful collaboration between Tom and this loss a conversation between Tom and this lan-tern-Tom .
So , how much I heard that story about changing a little bit even the way I worked , and already once I was once .
This idea , he saved when I was writing , &quot; Ama , Prua , Ama , &quot; and fall in one of those falls of the despair that we &apos;re working on something and we can &apos;t start to be a disaster , which is the worst book is going to be a disaster , which is going to be the worst book or never written .
Not just the worst book , just the worst book .
And I started thinking about geping this project .
But then I remember Tom who talked to the air and I tried to the air and I tried .
So I went up to my face in the manoscritism and I &apos;ve got my comments to a vacuum of the room .
And I said to a voices , &quot; Sences , what , we know , if this book not going to be bright , not going to be very college won &apos;t that much , no ?
Because as I &apos;m looking at us , I &apos;m going to put it all I &apos;m not going to this .
So , you want you to have to be better , you have to present you and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , I don &apos;t do anything .
I &apos;ll move to write the same because it &apos;s my job .
And I want to favor that was recorded that I was presented to me to do my part , &quot; Because , at the end , OK -- at the end of North Africa , the people were going to be radunted to the wonderful , dancing and hours to the hours of hours , dancing and hours to the hours to the treat .
And they were always magnificent , because the balleres were professionals and were fantastic .
But every time , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists actually become transcending .
And I know you &apos;re all about , because I know you &apos;ve all got you , at some point , a performance so .
It was like the time , you stop , and the ballerin the walking through a kind of land-up and wasn &apos;t doing anything different from the usual , and it was just like 1,000 nights , but all it was going .
And as a sudden not appeared just like a human .
But it turns out from the divinside and under illlights in the fire of divinity .
And when this happened , to the time , people knew what was , they were called it with it .
They were conged to draw up , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , God , Allah , God , God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curious storical -- when the More invasero , they were the south of Spain , they took this habits and pronounts changed in the centuries from &quot; Allah , Allah , &quot; Over , &quot; Ole , &quot; Ole , &quot; Ole , &quot; Over , &quot; Over , &quot; Over , the flow .
In Spain , when an artist has done something impossible and magical , &quot; Allah , the Allah , magnificent , burning , etching , etching , etching , etching , etching , etching God .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes the day , the problem comes from the dancing itself , when you wake up and discovering that are the 11 of Martednership , and I &apos;m going to talk about God doesn &apos;t have any longer .
It &apos;s simply a dead with a lot of bad to ginocy ginocy , and maybe not to be able to get to the treat that .
And maybe no one of God still still while I play , and what does it have to do with rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most sweat several recognizes to make a creative life .
But maybe not to be so angosciant if you can &apos;t believe , anzythemselves , which the most expects you can &apos;t believe , the most amazing expects of your being come from you .
But you know , I just think that you &apos;re taking from a unimaginable unimaginable source of this squish of your life that you have to go to something else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think that it &apos;s in this way .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s sure as I thought for different for different months in the workers that I &apos;m going to think about the book , the dangerous success .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I &apos;m electrized by this is , not achieving .
You don &apos;t travel . It &apos;s your job .
It &apos;s a lot of the way to present you &apos;re in your part , any of whatever it can be .
If your job is ballowing ,
If the wine , aburd , absurd you decided to leave some kind of wondering some kind of wonderful , for just through your efforts , then , &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Although , you do the same dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot; You ! &quot;
I think I think you have to teach it .
&quot; You ! &quot; Simming the same , even for having had a human hold , and test tals tactal tals that you &apos;re going to present .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can meaning and discovery of new genes of genes .
We &apos;re starting a new percoral : we started to digitalize biology and now to go from that digital code we &apos;re going to go into a new biology , designing and synthesized life .
We &apos;ve always been trying to ask a lot of questions .
&quot; What &apos;s the life ? &quot; is that many biologists I think they have attempt to understand various levels .
We tried different approaches , reducing it to the minimes .
We &apos;re digitizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequencentist genome was a human genome was treating genome of the analogy world &apos;s digital world .
Now , let &apos;s ask , we can regenerate life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the smaller species between the tiny genome that they can authoring into laboratory .
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome for creating a little bit more .
We &apos;re able to eliminate a hundred of genes about 500 genes that are here .
But when we &apos;re looking at his metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our own .
Creden themselves , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it &apos;s very improbable that this can take a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to design was synthesize this croms so we could modify components to take some of these questions of the things .
So we started the adventure of the &quot; Pan &quot; we can synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Can chemical to contains these great molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create before ?
And , in case , we can make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is simply a chemical material chemical material .
The speed that we &apos;re able to digitalize life is growing up to the lives of the exponential rhythm .
Our capacity to write the genetic code , rather , rather slowly , but it &apos;s better .
And our recent recent lences are taking up on a exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process has requires a lot of past , beginning with a bioethic reatening before we begin the first experiments .
But we found that DNA , we found that DNA is very difficult .
There are decauses of thousands of machines in the world that produce small segments of DNA , the longer &apos;s longer , and it &apos;s a process of a longer , the most errors there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments and correct to correct the errors and correct .
And this was our first attempt , to start to start from the digital information of Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
We have designed the fragments , actually , the recorrection of the errors and a molecule of DNA lot of DNA .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material chemical material chemical material , bacteria have beginning to read this genetic code and producing the particles .
The viral particles have been released by cells , they &apos;re come back and destroyed the Evi . There are . There .
I talked about recently with the oil members of oil industry and they have been saying them that they &apos;re certainly compress this model .
They &apos;ve review .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build his hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in larger .
We wanted to build the whole cromosome of the bacteria .
They &apos;re over 580 midle of genetic code .
So we thought we &apos;ve been built it in the size of the virus of the virus , so we could change the casses components of a living cells .
The progressing is crucial , and if we start with digital information , they have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard accuratetion was a mile for every 10 mile basis .
We found it , resequencencing , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence , we would never be able to do that works .
One part of the process is to design segments long , you know , a little bit of the letters of 50 letters to build a smaller subtle segments that work together .
We &apos;re going to look at the single elements here .
You probably have read that we read a broads .
Think about it : we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , Good and T.
Three of those letters codified together about 20 amminacids , and there &apos;s a specific order of letters for every ammind .
So we can use genetic code to write words , frasuit , sentences .
What we &apos;ve done in the beginning was self-doing .
Some of them were deluses from the fact that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
We have designed these segments to be able to simply them to get them with enzymes .
There are enzymes that they repect them .
And we started to assembling parts , beginning with segments from five to seven to seven miling , and they were a swimming 24 ments a leter letters to come to 72 mile letters .
Each step we have made these segments in abundance so we could sequencencing them , we &apos;re trying to create a very robustot process -- how you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re looking for selling the process .
So , this seems to be a basket of a basket .
When we get to these very long segments , more than 100 midle , they &apos;re not going to be directly in E. coli .
It comes to the limit of the modern modern tools of molecular biology .
So we have seen other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called homology recognizes , which is usually usually usually to repect DNA degree to repins .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinocus called Deinocus , can make three million rad of radiation .
You can see in the spring of the high romous , as a croma destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s reassembled exactly like it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can do completely .
They can live under vacuum .
They &apos;re absolutely sure that life in space , and you can find new life in space , and you can find new environments of water .
ASA , NASA showed that this is .
This is a molecule that we built these processes , just using these processes , simply using the segments to put segments to put .
The labor assembly .
This image was not taken with a electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a tough molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that cover a second six seconds .
This is the publishing we &apos;ve done a little time ago .
They &apos;re over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the biggest molecule of a definitely ever created by man .
It &apos;s a lot of spring spring to 300 million .
If we stamming it with a paper 10 without spaces , they would like 142 pages to transcriter this genetic code .
Now , how do we do it work ? How do we activity it ?
Of course , you can see a virus is a virus is a game from kids .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s simpler as well as it &apos;s cells as well as our euulies , you can just extract nucleo the nucleo and insers another , which is practically the cloning process of clonation .
In the bacteria , the archaea , it &apos;s inviting inside the cell , but we &apos;ve recently demonstrated that we &apos;re able to do a complete trape of a croma cell to another and activity .
We have a cromossing chomosome from a microbial species .
The two are different of men from topes .
We have added some gene in a way to decide what he choose for this croma .
The slide with the full enzymes in a way to kill all proteins .
And when we put it in the cells was studies -- and you &apos;ll opening our software -- and we &apos;re going to get into the cells .
And we were beginning to think we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we have tried to spin it .
This is one of evolution .
We found that a lot of species have added a second or a third chromosome somewhere , adding in a second thousands of new holds , adding into a second new , and that species .
So who think evolution as a gene gene at the time that it has not understood a lot of biology .
There &apos;s a enzymmmmmyself called the DNA .
The croms that was in the cell in cell not a chance .
The cellula-cromous cellphones that we have insert .
It &apos;s expressed , and it recognized the other croms as a extraneous material , and we &apos;ve been sticated , and we &apos;ve only found it with just cells and the new croma .
it &apos;s become blue because of the genes we have insert .
And in a short lass of time , all the characteristics of a species have been lost , and it turned around the new software that we have insert in the cells .
All the proteins have changed , the membraning has changed , and when we &apos;re reading the genetic code that &apos;s transfer exactly what we &apos;ve spent you .
Now , this could look like this , but altering the software DNA software , we can change things in a way we can change things in a way .
Now , I &apos;ve got explained that here is not talking about genesis -- but progress to go from three million years and a half million years evolution , and I &apos;ve already said that maybe to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s enough to be obvious when we think about our need to be .
We &apos;re going to go from six and a half billion people at nine billions in the next 40 years .
Just to give you an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one in 1946 , there &apos;s 40 years , they &apos;ll be four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medicinals and gas for six and a half billion people .
It &apos;s going to be even more dare about nine billions .
We use more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion pounds of oil .
That means millions of barrassing a day .
When we &apos;re looking for biological processes , or any kind of process to replaces , it &apos;s a huge challenge .
We have to have a lot of the whole emission of CO2 from these materials that ends up in the atmosphere .
In the day of the world , thanks to scientific discoveries all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that they are the design components for the future .
The electronics is only a dozen dozen about components , and think about how many different things are out .
Our limits here are principles from biological and our imagination .
Now we have the techniques , because of these synthetization of synthesization , able to create what we call a combinatory .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can produce a billion chromosomes a million chromosomes a day .
Think of these 20 million different genes or try or try to get to optimize the processes to produce optimize the processes to produce optimize , we can change , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology that in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for a possibility of survival , production or carbon , chemical vaccines or carbon , production vaccines .
This is an instantly of some software program that we &apos;re working for being able to sit and design species on the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know necessarily how they &apos;re going to be .
We know exactly what they &apos;re their genetic code .
Now we &apos;re now focus on the carbons of how quarter generation .
You &apos;ve seen you extract ethanol from the grain was a very finished experiment .
We have a second third generation that will use enough from a second soon from the sugar to carbons of the higher value as opposed or different types of butankle .
But the only way biology can have a big impact without increasing a big impact of food and limiting it the cost of food and limiting it to be transform CO2 in matter , which we &apos;re working to design that can reach to design this purpose that can reach this purpose , and we think we could have the first carbon how much of 18 months .
The light solar combined with CO2 is a methodom -- but in our discoveries all over the world , we found different metodds .
This is an organism that we have described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , about 2500 feet of depth of the water temperature of the water temperature of the water .
It &apos;s by CO2 by using hydrogen molecular hydrogen as as a source of energy .
We &apos;re looking for us to understand if we can incanalate CO2 , which can easily be transported through the toubt , converting that CO2 in carburing , to drive this process .
So we think we can think that we could think we could be able to increase what the question of the base that question of the base that &apos;s life is Nes , we have the goal to replacing the oil industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can you do it ?
It was a main the main of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working on using the same metods to create vaccines to create vaccines .
You saw this year with influence , we &apos;re always always back a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s going to find the right vaccine .
I think that you can change building vaccines .
Here &apos;s how the future could start to be changing , now , the tree now , accellering evolution with synthetic bacteria , I was , archachieving , I was , arching , and finally cells .
We &apos;re so much from the improving people .
Our purpose is to make a long enough to try to try to try to make them . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the most quickly possible , some new work that we have taken to Microsoft at a quickly year ago . This is Seady . This is Seady .
It &apos;s a environment that you can interact with a lot of local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data .
Here we &apos;re seeing a lot of digabyte of digital pictures with a kind of costant slandscape , and I continue to a panoramic quick , I &apos;m saying the images , and I &apos;m going to see images , as we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these data colraces or these data .
Most of these digital photographs , but this is for example is a trial scanning from the Bibliotecame from the Bibliotecame 300 megapiel .
It doesn &apos;t do any difference because the only thing that &apos;s the only thing that &apos;s the number of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time . It &apos;s a very fledable architecture .
This is a whole book , you don &apos;t images .
This is the Casa desolate of Dickens . Each column represents a capital .
To show you that it &apos;s about the text and not images , we can do something like this , to see really see that it &apos;s a real thing , to see , not a picture of a photos .
It could be a little bit artificial to read a little artificial electronic book .
You don &apos;t recommend it .
This is a more realistic example . This is a number of the Guardian .
Each big image is the beginning of a setion .
And it really gives you the pleasure of a date of a daily review of a daily revision or a daily d-income , which is for nature a lot of medium .
We also have something with the corner of this number in the corner of the Guardian .
We &apos;ve created a higher published -- much more high than that usual contains in a normal publisher -- and we &apos;ve insert you .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even techniques , or even techniques .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hopefully that means to get to the people to the people and other similar cheries , they should not be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say that we have contributed to date in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. .
So , we &apos;re going to go to something else .
This is actually , it &apos;s effectively . You can go to the web .
This is a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seady , and the other is a very interesting search for a very interesting computer very interesting , in Noah , a student of University Washington , with the help of Seading Seader , with the help of Microsoft Research .
And it &apos;s from the live , the web , hested Seady .
You can see this when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from a picture to a picture of the other and have this kind of experience to multiply solution .
But the space of the space of images here has actually a significance .
The algorithms of the computer visualization have these imaging pictures together , so that they corresponds to the real place -- all the close to the reals that imaging the watching laghot -- all the close to the Montne Roccies -- have been taken . So you see the elements of a slides of a slides of a slide-stable .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some much more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data of Noahert -- and this is from a precedent pressing of Photosynth that we have done for Photosynth -- to show you what I think is really the key behind this technology , Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily the key behind this technology , the site .
We had to worry about legal things and so on .
This is a rebuild-up of Noththree Do images from Flickr . Bauckr . Bay &apos;s a Nothers , and you get images of typing and you images of types and so on . Each of these types and on the saying . Each of these argument area that &apos;s discovered .
So , I &apos;m all images from Flickr and were all connected to space .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this way we can navigate this .
You know , I wouldn &apos;t have thought of finish working for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratificant to receiving this kind of access here .
I think you can see that this is a lot of different kinds of different kinds of different kinds of phones of phones that are cellular cellular cellular , the number of the ground in this environment .
And if I can try to try and look for the most strange .
Many are block , it &apos;s a lot of faces , etc .
Somewhere you have a photographs -- etchcolums .
This is a Noththtrial poster .
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with the social environment . This is now taking data from yet , and the inter-memory of how to apply the ground , from the inter-powered visual point -- and connecting all those data together .
All these pictures become connected , more than the set of the parts .
You have a model of the whole enterprising .
Think of this as a prolder proling of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as people uses uses that are uses , and the advantages that are using it .
Their pictures are marry with other people .
If someone comes to the idea of contrast all these saying the name , my picture of Nothers , my picture of Nothtrial of all those data , and I can use the way of all the data , and I can use the way of indeed indeed in the space , in that space , using the universe , using the pictures of all these things , and have a social experience of cross-mod-cattle cross-mod-catty ,
Of course , a consequence of all of this is extremely elaborate models of every interesting part of the Earth , colleagues not only from airplanes and satellitariarian images and satellitariariariarian images , but from the collective memory .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What your software is going to be doing is that , in the next few years , all the photographs shared by anyone in the world are going to be reading all over the world will be reading to anybody in the world will be practical .
BA : Yeah . The one that &apos;s doing is basically discovering .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the basis of the pictures .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the recknife information to simanti-indeed information that many of these images .
As when you &apos;re doing a research of images on the web , you get a sentence and the head on the web has a lot of information about the pictures of the pictures of pictures .
Now , what happens if that pictures you connect to all your picture ?
So , the amount of simantly interconnection and the amount of wealth that &apos;s really huge is a classical classical effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible . Computers .
BA : You &apos;re very rind .
One of the main pleases when you travel and one of the etnographic research is the power of the power of the people who have not fordipputs , between who has not forget the past in the wind , the touch of the touch , and it &apos;s a touch is in the frow .
Bastes thinking that the Jaguar &apos;s still beyond the Via Lattea , or that the My Milky ancient , or that the Inuit &apos;s still the column of the Dharm , the budging the frespile of Dharm , to remember the Dharm of the Dharm , to remember the central importance of the central anthroughout of the world , but it &apos;s only a model of fact , but it &apos;s just a model of reality , but it &apos;s just a model of reality , but it &apos;s just a model ,
the consequence of a particular choices that our stirs has done , well or a lot of generations that our stirts has done , well , or a lot of generations that our stirts has been doing .
And of course , we all share the essential thing .
All nask . We all procreating .
We are subjects in the beginning .
We have to deal with the inexority of death , so it doesn &apos;t surprising and ballim --
We have a lot of art .
What hit is the particular is the rhythm of song , the dance of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that they are the Penan forests of the Borneo , or the following of Haiti , or the Haiti , or the Kaids of Sahars , Curt Curt Sahars , the Curthern of Any , or a soul in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my company was my journey of a month ago , or a month ago , or a hallevator of yak in the values of Qomolangma , the mother of the world .
All of these people teachers taught us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , and other ways of thinking , moving in the world .
And , if you reflection a moment , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
Insit , the cultures of the world are creating a girl nature and cultural life that it &apos;s important for the planet and cultural life that &apos;s important for the planet as a biosphere as a biology biological girl .
And you can think of this cultural girl as a nosphere , and you can call the etnosphere , and you can call the etnosphere of all the concepts , inspirations , inspirations , inspirations , inspirations , inspirations , intuitions , inspirations ,
The ethnosphere is the fantastic patrimony of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how inquisitive species .
And because the biosphere was graved as a lot of the biosphere , and it was too much quickly , and unfortunately .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species was on the hard summit &apos;s been on the hard extinction because it &apos;s falitty , or in the most apocalytic diversity -- and not even nearly , you don &apos;t have close even nearly short of the typothest countries -- that the different cultural of it .
The injury of all is , of course , the lost lost .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not only composed by a vocabulary or a series of grammicals .
One language is the human beautiful of human spirit .
It &apos;s the midle with any culture is going to be in the material world .
Each language is a forest of the mind , a backen , a thought , a backin a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re sitting here in Monterey , at least half the old of children .
They don &apos;t come to teach children , the people that means , unless than not waving something , which is already died .
What &apos;s more sad of being avavaved from the silence , of being the last one , the last to talk a language , not have a way to be a linguity , or to anticipate the wish of the children ?
This horring is the state of somewhere in the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks . And it &apos;s a drop , and it &apos;s a ancient language .
And I know that someone will say , &quot; Is it &apos;s not that ?
The world wouldn &apos;t it be a better place if we &apos;re talking all the same language ? &quot; Benish , so we &apos;re talking all . We &apos;re talking all .
We talk to kogi .
You &apos;ll see a tract of a sudden , you can &apos;t talk about your language .
I &apos;d like to do a journey through ethnosphere --
a little journey in ethnosphere to give you a massive of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , &quot; different ways of existing ways of existing .
Let &apos;s take for example , this bimmbe in Amazon , Amazon , the population of anaconda , who creates the myth of the latts of the latest latte of sacred waters .
It &apos;s a population that &apos;s not able to distinguish color blue color from the green color because the best cell color , which depends the population , which depends the population .
They have a strange language and a major rules , detail , &quot; She said , &quot; You have to move a person that &apos;s a different language .
All this has radical past , in the mythological past , is that in these families that are talking or seven , where you &apos;re talking or seven languages .
They &apos;re limited to listening and then beginning to talk .
We take one of the most interesting tribe with which I &apos;ve been lived , the Waoran of Ecuador , an incredible people , an incredible population that has had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 meaning missionaries have attempt a compared concerned .
They &apos;ve been to turn from the photographs that they were in a pose pose that they had a friendly amiching that this population of pluge pluge pluge plugment .
They &apos;ve been collected pictures , they turned it to the research of a form or a figure , and not find nothing , they have conclosed the direction , and they killed the five missionaries .
But Waorans don &apos;t just kill the straniests .
They kill them . They kill them .
54 percent of mortality was caused by them .
We &apos;re sitting at eight generations and we found two of natural death , and when we &apos;ve been insisted to know , they have a lot of them was so much investied that one of them . And then they kill it up , and then they kill it . &#91; Rised &#93; every way , they had a incredible way , they had a incredible forest .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal that &apos;s 40 steps and recognize species .
In the first &apos; 80s , I was assigned a very interesting compiece when my professor of Harvard was asked if I wanted to go to Harvard to intrue between the basis of the power of Duvalier and Tonton Macouver &apos;s power and Tonton Macoubling , and I was a very hard use of using the zombies .
To give a sense of a medical , I should have to understand Vodoun culture . And that Voodoo culture .
It &apos;s a pretty complex of a me-physical vision of the world .
Very interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan has no religious fefeeding . And it &apos;s not religious feeding . And it &apos;s not the distillitation of these religious conceptions of these religious conceptions of nailing .
What makes interesting is the voodoo is the intense report between life and death .
So , you &apos;re going to make the spirits .
The spirits can be invoccurred by the Great Aca , they answer to the dance of dance and replaces are replaceased animates at the soul of the dance of the way that for a short actim .
So , the voodooists love to say , &quot; You &apos;re going to go to church about God .
We &apos;re saying in the temple and become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re playing , is the spirit that you drives you , how can you do it ?
So , you &apos;re assists to these incredible events : following voodoo , the voodoo touch a rather straight demonstration rather than the power of the power of mind on the body when it &apos;s catalyzed in a very exciting state .
And as a lot of the people with which I have lived the most extraordinary people are the Kogi of Sierra Nevada Marta , in Colombia .
She &apos;s gotten civilization that once they live on the carbairplanes of Colombia , the population of the Colombia , the population of the massicle that you ern the carbon the massicult planture .
In a continent of blood , this population has never been conquered by the spagners .
And so , I &apos;m governmental today , but their formation is really extraordinary .
The young people following away from the families to three or four years , and they live secrets in a world made of a good hombers and hombers in a hairs of the ice for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years choose to reproduce the nine months of gestation that transrate into the user of the mother , now are metaphorically in the Great Mther .
For all this time , they are acculated to the values of their society , values that their prayers are predicting that their prayers are being the balance , or to say the cosmic balance -- or to say the balance .
At term of this incredible initiation , they &apos;re improving a sudden , and for the first time , 18 years , they see a lot of things . And in that actimidle of the first bad bad , when the sunks the sun , the values of the beauty , all the things that they learned in theories , all the things that have learned in the heads . The prey a passionate . The pret a passit a past past a past past . And the land-plending .
&quot; I mean , I &apos;m going to tell you .
It &apos;s just a lot of it . Now it &apos;s going to protect it . &quot;
They &apos;re called the most major frars and say that we , the brothers , we are the destruction of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think of Indigenes and environment , we invochieve Rousu and old the old history of the noble non-history , which is a rocket in his simplicity or perhaps we say , these people are close to the Earth .
The Indigenes are not not not sentimental sentimental nor indebolites .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the paludium of Amall or in the gelids of Tibet , but thanks to the time and rhythemselves , created a mystic of the Earth , but on a best intuition of the maintain , the concept of human consciousness .
What does it mean ?
It &apos;s like a little bit of the Ande of the Ande who grows that the mountain is a spirit of a pu , which is a deep human being depped , and it &apos;s going to be a different human report , and it &apos;s going to be a different place to be able to a different mountain , and it &apos;s going to be scale .
which is a mineral dimall of a spirit or a thineral cow is irrievant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia creating that the forests serve forests serve to be cut .
And that &apos;s made me a different human being different from my friends from my friends that believe that the forests are the forests are the Hukuk &apos;s dimall of the paradising of the paradising , and the cannery that live in the northern extreme of the world , the Hamatsite .
If you start to look at that these cultures can actually create realities , you can start to understand some of them , and you can understand some of them sensational discoveries .
I &apos;ve taken this picture to open in the Western Amazon .
Mayahuge of you have heard about the more powerful suspsychoactive suspsychoactive repertory of the repertory .
What makes the eye eyahuge is not the potential pharmacological potential of suscity , but it &apos;s a two elements . It &apos;s two elements .
From a hydle , this lian lady of carboline that &apos;s a series of a carboline , harmful harmful hallucinogens .
Taking the only plants , you have a bluaster that altery a little bit of a conscience , but it &apos;s mmeans , and it &apos;s a frozen business of the family of the caffee .
This plants powerful plant powerful , very similar to serotonin , didyltryptamines , methoxyltryltryptamine .
If you ever see Yanomami rare on for the suspance that they &apos;re doing from a different species , which are contains it contains a different species , it &apos;s containing .
Tiring that policy on for nose is a little bit like to be a little bit like a file pints and landing on a file of electricity . &#91; R&#93; &#93; &#93; &#91; Rear &#93; . Take it . You don &apos;t believe a distortion of reality .
I was often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who wrote the best was psychedelical , with his discovery of the sourcing fungi in the &apos; 30 in Mexico .
And in the tese , you can &apos;t classified these triptags like hallucinogens because if you can &apos;t tell any of being killed . &#91; One &#93; &#91; Rish &#93; &#91; Rish &#93; &#91; Retriptams can &apos;t be absolutely because they &apos;re money because they &apos;re money in the test , deal with a encisy , deal with the ine-full , dead moynases .
It &apos;s possible to absolutely hard with other chemical chemical suspect with other chemical chemical suspect MAO .
Now , it &apos;s beautiful , the carboline that are inibitors are inhibited of MAO , the same kind of the MAO , the same kind of triptams . The question of sourcing . The question of spontaneous species of plants , how these people are until two dies of plants , how these are two dia-like , but if you get in this way , create a chemical way , creating a little bit of parts , but of parts ?
We use the great euphemism of the providing herror , which can reveal .
But if we ask the Indians , they &apos;ll say , &quot; Phts are talking about . &quot;
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 varieties of Ehuam , who distingue netically in the forest , and that our eyes would come into the same species .
If we ask them how they staff their tasonomy will tell us , &quot; I thought , &quot; I was going to say , &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you get 17 varieties in a notice of lots and each one will song with a different tants .
With this is not laurea lot to Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than contate pressing the prints .
Now , &#91; applying &#93; the problem is that even the problem of us that have the people who have to the history of the history , but somehow reducing the history of the history of the history of our history of the real world , and pass .
In fact , the XX century , between 300 years , not will be remember for his writing wars or technological innovations , but rather as the one where we stopped and we have abled active , or the passively degree of mass diversity and cultural distraction of masses diversity and cultural cultural distriction . Now the problem is not change .
All cultures through centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibilities of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux have not stopped to be Sioux when they put up and frecess like as Americans don &apos;t stop being American when they put from the horse .
It &apos;s not the change or the technology that threatening the integrity of ethnosphere . It &apos;s power .
The wall of the domination of the domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you &apos;ll discover that these are not destinated cultures .
They are creatures and dynamics out of identifiable forces that go out of identifiable forces that go beyond their abilities of adaptment .
And it &apos;s disboss of wasting in the patria of Penan --
a population of Sarawak , in the Sarawak , a population that has been lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now reducing the remarkable reen , where you can see the physical file of the rid-clue , where you can see the physical figures , where you can see the physical figures that seems to be able to the environment , where the Japanese , where the Japanisor the horizonest , where the torizon-horizon-horizon-h-h-house ,
You have a lot of stives with the stives with the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that have come with the discovery of the gold .
If we move on the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the volt of political domination .
You know , you know the genocide , physics of a population , is condanned at the universal level , but the etnural of lifestyle , is not only condanted , but it &apos;s not condanted , but to celebrate in the environment , because it &apos;s a part of development .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of Tibet until you can &apos;t go from the beginning .
I spent 6,000 miles from Chenger in the Western Chengineer in the Western Chengineer , coming to Lhasa with a young colleagues , but only came to Lhasa , I &apos;ve realized what &apos;s behind the statistics that we &apos;re talking about .
6,000 sacres sacrates in policy and centers .
1.2 million people killed from the military revolution from the military Rivolution .
The father of this guy was absolutely to Panchen Lama .
which means that it &apos;s been killed to be killed to the Chinese invasion .
Suo uncrazy with Santity during the diaspora that has taken the people in Nepal .
South mother was imprisoned and his colpa was reciped .
It was taken to hidden in the age of two nasde switching under his gonna because he couldn &apos;t have living without .
The sister , who did the same , it was put in a respective reeducation .
One day has been inavverted a day has been hot a fashion Mao and , for this transgression , was put forced to seven years .
The Tibet of the TIbet can be insatitaken , but it &apos;s redenter of the population is from ttener .
And then , it &apos;s reduces a choice .
We want to live in the world world world &apos;s world , we want to collect the policromatical world or we want to collect the policromatical world ?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead , before we die said that his biggest fear was that , in our own own vision of the world , we &apos;re not just going to see the whole amorous of human imagination is that we &apos;re going to see the whole amorous of human imagination , but one day we &apos;re able to see it from a sleep , but one day we &apos;re able to be able .
And it &apos;s humiliating that our species is existed for 60,000 years .
The Rivolution , Neolitics , which has given us the agriculture that has done us to the cult of the sea , and they &apos;re going to look at the cult of the closer , creating the herarcharchy of specialization , and we &apos;re talking about 10,000 years ago .
The industrialized world has been on a stent in the stent .
That slands you don &apos;t suggest me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we &apos;re going to deal with the millennia to come .
When these cultures of the world &apos;s cultures are asked what it is to say to being human , they say , &quot; Do be answered with 10,000 different voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we &apos;re all going to be what we &apos;re going to be what we are : a consciousness , that it has to be what we &apos;re in the way that all the people and all the gardens can floor . And there are great moments of optimistic times .
I took this picture on the north of Baffin the north island of Baffin , when I went to the hunting of the bunch of the wonderful story of his non-man , Olaya story of his non-non-history .
The canaddle has been not always gentile with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to stabilie our prematia company , we &apos;ve reink them in colonies .
The non-man of this man was refuse to go .
The family , themselves for his life , he brought all the arms , and all of his attractioned .
You have to know that Inuit doesn &apos;t feel the cold , they &apos;re not putting it .
The batts of the slites were made of fish were made of fish .
The non-hand-house non-saying non-night , or from the blizard , or the blizard that was suffior .
It &apos;s bairuled away , it &apos;s calculated the balance in the focus of focus and defecated into your hand . When I did them create a lama lama .
It &apos;s spring spring on the dots of this caccess of caccess and when it came up , he &apos;s killed a dog .
She &apos;s schools and created a bridge , with the tory casses has created a sliter , he &apos;s short another dog , and it &apos;s slate on the banchisa banchisa , column clear tells .
We want to talk about having with nothing ? &#91; Risan &#93; . &#93; And this , in different ways , &#91; Applauses &#93; is the symbol of the Inuit and all the world &apos;s population and all the world .
In 1999 , the sanks in 1999 , the sanks has been reduced to a total control of a territory of California and Texas I put together .
It &apos;s their new patries . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a territory territory . They &apos;re contricting all the minerary resources .
One splendid-like example national sprences can recognize with his population .
And , finally , I think it &apos;s quite a very obvious to the one of us was in these snone remote of the planet , make it connects that don &apos;t have a remote .
For someone &apos;s home .
They know , they &apos;re sitting setions of human imagination that risallow the dawn . And for all these children , like the dreams of these children , become part of our children , become part of the hope .
Finally , we National Geographic Geographic is that politicians will never come to anything .
We believe that polemy --
&#91; Ausi &#93; &#93; &#91; Asian &#93; &#91; Asian &#93; &#91; Asive &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#91; Asian &#93; &#91; &#91; Actually , we &apos;re the best institution to tell stories of the world . Each month our site receive million visit . Each month our site . Each month our site .
156 countries have our television of our television .
Our revisters are slets from millions of people .
Our work is to travel in the ethnosphere to bring our public to beautiful places that go away from how they saw and hopes , they &apos;ll go away from how they saw and hopefully , they &apos;ll get a fairs of anthropology of anthropology in the diversity , and we have to find a lifairs of life in a pluralisting world and multicultural reveal of multural reveal life .
where the wisdom of all the people can contribute to our own well-being .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope requires you &apos;ve heard and I &apos;m going to try and evidence some colleges , in case , not note them .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the official official . &quot;
The dogram official ?
The dogram official of all the Western industrial industrial society . The dogma official official fits , &quot; The way to be the benefits of our citizens &quot; &quot; The way to do it is to male the individual to the individual bends . &quot;
The reason is , from one hand , in fact that freedom is in the fact that freedom is precious , useful , essential , for human beings .
At the other is that if we &apos;re free , each of us can act to do all that that &apos;s connecting our benefit to do all that that maximum is , without any any one that decided in nambody .
The way to masses liberty is to male freedom .
More choices people have , more libers are free , and greater is their liberty , most of them is their well-being .
I think , I think , it &apos;s so depth , in the society that nobody would dream to put it in the society .
And it &apos;s also depth , it &apos;s also depth in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I lost a simple note on conditions for insalate .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without contact ot 10 varieties of oil olies and 12 acets acectures that you can buy a huge number of conduction in the result of conducting in the result of the indeed ins that no one of 175 consuming is of your degrees .
Here &apos;s the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronics to buy a stereous stereo : CD leter , CD leter , radio , radio , plastra , amplifer .
And in this single negotial store , there &apos;s a big number of audio components .
We can do six and a half million different and a half million combinations that there are in a negotiate .
You have to admit that there &apos;s a lot of choice .
Other fips : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all the serve services , the basic services , unlike , a little bit , Bell .
It was born the phone , it was not buy it .
One of that , one was the other one was that the phone was never saying .
These storytelling .
Now we have a variety of phones , especially illimited phones , especially between cells .
Here &apos;s cellular cellphones .
My favorite is in middle , MP3 , MP3 , cut forts of nose , and forts for the cruel .
If you don &apos;t have seen you &apos;ve seen in the house , you &apos;re certain that it will be able to get .
And what happens is that the end of people are going to go into the store and does this question . And you know what the answer is ? The answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phones that doesn &apos;t do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important busters of the budget of choices , the same explosion of choices .
Sanitarian health sanitarian has no longer in the United States that you go from the doctor and doctor what you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do it , or B , &quot; As these benefits risks . &quot; As these benefits . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Doctor , what should I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A has these benefits , and the risks , and B has these benefits . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebat , &quot; Doctor , what would it do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result of the result called the &quot; autonomy of malseems , expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But it &apos;s actually not that a lot of patient and responsibility to decisions from someone who knows something , which is the doctor , someone else who doesn &apos;t know -- and most of course , it &apos;s not a certain decisions , and so not in the ideal condition to make decisions of the patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing products , direct to people like me and you , that if you think about it doesn &apos;t have any sense , but you think about it doesn &apos;t understand them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why are they publiicized ?
The answer is that they want to ask them to be called the doctor to change it .
Something so important as our identity is our identity is a question of choice , how you see in this jet . &quot; We don &apos;t want to force children children . Scear their sex . We &apos;re going to go to the right now . &quot; We don &apos;t want to be an identity : we have to invent .
And we can reinvent how many times we can reinvent us .
which means that every morning , to be decided that kind of person want to be .
I suspect to family and makes , a time the perspective , source , square connected , and it was that it was that you get the most most of possible , and it started to make the most of possible .
The only real choice was with who , not even when , and not even , and even even what to do after .
It &apos;s really to play .
I teach in a very intelligent students , and I do 20 percent in less work than a time .
And not because they &apos;re not smart , not because they &apos;re not not because they &apos;re fewer diligent .
but why are it impensierites , I mean , I &apos;m going to spose , &quot; I would have to do it now ? &quot;
&quot; I would I go to the later ? I have to think before children or career ? &quot;
They &apos;re slogorant slogorant .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this implement not the company that you don &apos;t get a beautiful company and not to get a good vote to my exercise .
And they have to do it . They have to do it . They have to do it .
Now , the job : we &apos;re lucky , as Carl Sought , because the technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from Hotel Randolph .
It &apos;s a running , there &apos;s a anglin , and I &apos;m not going to anybody , where , WiFi works .
I don &apos;t say that , because I want to use it .
What does this mean is , this incredible freedom of choice we have to continue , and we have to continue , and we have to continue , and we have to work or not .
We can go to the switch , with the cell phones in a task , Blackberry , Blackberry , the Blackberry , and the night , typically , on the ginockynicky .
And even though they &apos;re all spended , every minute that we see our son , we &apos;re also looking at this , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; Do I say , &quot; I have to answer this ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? I have to go to the letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , &quot; all this makes the experience of your son &apos;s very different than what it would be in other conditions .
So , from any of all we look at , small things , small things and big things , and life is a choices of choices , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : Over , there were some possibilities , but it was not a choice .
The world today &apos;s like this : The dilemma is , &quot; Is it &apos;s a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Short .
The positive lacks we all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about that negative ones .
And this choice , two negative effects two negative effects on people .
The first one , paradoxide is that it produces paralysis that liberation .
And many of the options that choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I offer an offer example , you know , a study convict of volunary thinking .
A colleagues had access to the Vantual data , the giant giant society of the Sourcyclimbing companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that for every 10 solutions that are offered in the most , percentage of adjual adesion full two percent .
With 50 sources , there &apos;s 10 percent of the under adhesions that are available to when they &apos;re available only five . Why ?
Because with 50 sources that choose choose , it &apos;s maleating , and the choice is is remanding to the indomorders .
And by domain , and again , domain , domain , domain , domain , and of course , domain , of course , domain , and of course , domain , of course , domain , and of course , domain , domain , and of course , domain , and of course , of course , domain , and of course , domain , and of course , domorances , domain , and of course , domain ,
You know , it doesn &apos;t only mean that these workers are going to eat for cans because they don &apos;t have enough money , it also , it &apos;s so hospitor , it also means that they lose the complementary of the job .
Don &apos;t participating , they &apos;re losing until five dollars per year from work , which would be disposed to be being them .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too much choices .
And I think that makes the world .
&quot; And finally , to the ethernity : ketchup , or mayonese ? &quot;
You would like to take the right decision , if it &apos;s for ethernity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and nepurpure the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even though we can avoid paralysis , and we &apos;re less satisfed by the result of how we would be with less satisssing .
And that &apos;s a different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of conditions that you choice , if you buy one and not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have a different choice . And what happens is that it &apos;s been better . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us to paper , and the repipipipipipient remains the squid , and the repieces of the choice , and the repieces of the decision ,
even when it was a good decision .
More choices , it &apos;s easy to displaying that it &apos;s inso-full of choice that it &apos;s inso-pound choice .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call cost cost .
Dan Gilbert asks very well , promising the value that we have to depend things from what we &apos;re confronted .
In the rest , when there are a lot of options , it &apos;s easy to represent the characteristics of alternative alternative of the option that you have choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m taking all of the ones that are not in New York .
But that &apos;s what you &apos;d probably think you &apos;d think .
There &apos;s this copy from Hamptons .
A place of light .
It &apos;s beach to be a lot of day . It &apos;s all for them . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not not eat anything . But what he thinks , &quot; Well , maledition , is Agust . &quot;
&quot; All my nearby to Manhattan are away . &quot;
&quot; I could talk about the home of front home . &quot;
And it &apos;s two weeks that it &apos;s led from the idea that it &apos;s losing -- every day -- the chance of parking where it wants .
The cost-opportunity is depth opportunity to defation for what we have , even when choice was .
And the most of the options that we have to look at , the more active characteristics , you &apos;ll return to it as a conconsciousness .
Here &apos;s another example .
This jet saying a lot of things .
It &apos;s about living the time , and maybe a living slowly .
But the most important point is that any thing you choose , you &apos;re choose to not do other .
The things we don &apos;t choose have a tactive activity that can make less attractive what we do .
Tirst point : the ral growth of the expectations .
I tried it on my skin field , and I buying a new jeans .
I &apos;m going to almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were one of a guy , compraved them and dress wrespected , they were scomfortable , only after they took a lot of time , they started to go well .
So I went to buy a couple again when the old old old people were gone , and I said , &quot; I &apos;m going to have a couple of jeans , this is my tut . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Ley wants slifit , fetches , relaxy and fait ? &quot;
Washed them with cerniera or with the sonewashed ? &quot; Stonewashed ? &quot;
&quot; Who want to be straight ? &quot;
&quot; Sow the bluef or stretches ? Bla bla basic -- &quot; he was going to elency .
I was switched , and after a little bit I was able to say , &quot; I want the guy that was the only guy , &quot; I didn &apos;t know what it was , so I had all the malef stands , and then I went out of the store , and then used to get out of the best , I &apos;m going to go , I &apos;ve ever had .
It was the very big . I had the whole choice I had the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand it .
The reason I was that with all the worst of the things that choice were altissit , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was a little bit of it was themselves . I didn &apos;t expect anything when it was only a guy , but when it &apos;s visual 100 different , lacks , at least a guy had to be perfect .
What I had busted was good , but not perfect .
After I talked to the choose with what I was trying to get to the expectations .
The advice of options in life of people don &apos;t do that they &apos;re going to increase the expectations that these have respect of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options that these have respectations that these have respectations of the people don &apos;t do the expectations of people don
And this is going to produce less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
No one in the marketing world , if it makes it .
Because if they know , you won &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is a lot of the most of this .
&quot; It was better when you were worse , &quot; The reason why it was better when you were worse , when you were worse , when it was worse , when he was worse , you could still meet of the spring of the player .
Egyday , in the world we live -- opulents , citizens industrialized citizens with the perfection of perfection -- the major we can hope is that things are the things to the height of expectations .
You never have places places because your expectations , the expectations , they &apos;re ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- it &apos;s , &quot; Basse waiting . &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , &quot; Basse , &quot; You want . &quot;
I mean , small moment , a little self-time time -- which I &apos;m really moving , and it &apos;s really study .
I couldn &apos;t have done , I couldn &apos;t have to be able .
But to be not always a good thing .
Finally , a consequence of buying a couple of jeans switching when there &apos;s only that when you &apos;re not satisfied , and say , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot; And it &apos;s clear .
The world is responsible . What could I do you do ?
When there are hundreds of types of jeans , and you buy a inso-, and you ask , who &apos;s responsible , it &apos;s just as clear that you are .
You &apos;d have done better .
With hundreds of varieties , there &apos;s no scratches .
So when people are decisions , even though the result is wonderful , they &apos;re hearing and they &apos;re damaged and they give the college .
In the last few years of depression is exploss in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only one , but the important -- of this depression is just that people have experiences of the people are too much high .
And when they need to explain this situation think that the college is their own .
So the final result is that in general , we &apos;re better , but we &apos;re feeling worst .
Let me remember you .
This is the office , what we all take for good , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely falong . It &apos;s not truly .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than it &apos;s not about it , but it doesn &apos;t get it to be a lot of choice .
There &apos;s a critical value , magical value . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we have super-one piece the level where the choices are improving our life .
Now , from political point , I &apos;ve almost finished -- at the nocle point of policy , the nocle is the following .
What allows is the whole choice in industrial society is the material wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know it &apos;s talking , where the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too much little .
So the facing facing of modern I &apos;m talking about is a malesclusive of modern , recidental society .
And what it does depressing and arrand is this : Steve Levitt has talked about how those costable and sattaches of the men are useful . It &apos;s a waste of money .
I mean , these choices and dispendious and dispendious , it &apos;s not that they &apos;re just useful .
They &apos;re going to be additional .
They &apos;re doing worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows a little bit of choice was revered in those where people have too few possibilities , not just their lives , but also our life to better , but also our life to better , but also our life .
This is what economists call a better pareye .
A redistribution of the redduction is good at all -- not only to poor -- because of this choice that &apos;s record us .
To conclude : you can become all you want to become all you want . &quot;
You , you know , people of culture , you think , &quot; What does that fishing ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious you can &apos;t get anything in a glass . &quot;
&quot; An ination imagination , a limited vision of the world -- &quot;
And I &apos;m interpret that , I &apos;ve interpret , at the beginning .
But then , I think about , I realized , I realized that that weight the long knows .
Because the fact of the fact of the fact that if you eat in the bouth , so that , &quot; all you can &apos;t get freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you &apos;re broads to the slide in a way that all of the full satisfaction .
You know , you &apos;re going to reduced , and reduced the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too much , perhaps even for the fish , and of course for us .
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic symbolic and , themselves , for roughly roverl .
Thank you very much .
