The last year I showed these slide to demonstrate that the artic glacial glacial , which for almost three million years had the size of the 48 United States , has restriped 40 percent .
But this suburbing the gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the spexpectation .
The arcycle glacial is , in a sense , the heart heart of the global climate system .
You &apos;re winter and winter and the summer .
The next slide will be a quick carried on the next 25 years .
The ice perenn gets have signed in red .
As you see , you expand down to the blue blue .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter , which is the summer of summer .
You can see that the ice cosid-year-or more , it &apos;s like five years or more , it &apos;s like the blood , which is like the blood , which is like the body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been like this .
This is a problem because the rescale of the win-terrain the ocean , where there are enormous amount of congested carbon conger that , microbes , are transformed into metane from microbes .
Rest to the totality of the atmosphpheric inquening , global warming , that amount could radical , super-h-hand-up point point point point .
In some short laghi in Alaska , the metane is already rebecting from the water .
The professorehimself Katey Walter of the University of Alaska was based with a team who was based last winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : She &apos;s good . The question is if we &apos;re going to be .
A reason this is that this term scading the Greenland from the north .
This is a glacial fier .
The carported didn &apos;t achieve levels .
This is the Kangerlusuathetisod-west , in the South of Greenland .
If you want to know how the sea level of sea level for the sea shelter of the sea squeeer here is where it &apos;s reaching the sea .
These corrings are increasing quickly .
At the other side of the planet : Antarctica , the greatest block of ice ice the planet .
The month , the scientists have declared that the ice of the ice is in negative , and the Antica Antica , which is particularly in the Western Solar , which is particularly in the western .
Equival Suve , six feet like the wild , like in Greenland .
Sull Himalaya , the third greater block of ice , you see new laghot lages , which a few years ago were glacier .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population has been half of water from that shape .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the water power of this city .
The carried is increased .
But when it goes , it &apos;s the same accounts on the water .
In California , the snow on Sierra Nevada is decreated 40 percent .
The holds are in crisis .
The predictions , as you read , are graved .
The growth security in the world &apos;s door to a remarkable increase .
The environmental disasters are increasing a rhythm outside the normal and without previous .
Four times more numerous in the last 30 years from the previous 75 .
This is an insustainable garbage .
If you look at it in the historical context , if you can see the consequences .
We &apos;ve added 70 years , we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 25 million tons in the ocean .
Look at the East Pacific &apos;s area , from Americas , from Americas , and west , and on both the Indian subcontinent , where there &apos;s a radical impoverments of oxygen in the ocean .
Most of the global warming , together at deforestation , which is the 20 percent of it , is the use of fossil fuel .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worst .
The United States are one of the two more emissions , together at China .
And he was proposed to build a lot of other central central .
But we &apos;re assisting to a change .
These are the annulled in the last years and some of the high-green alternative .
At every way , there &apos;s a political laptop in our country .
The carbon industries and oil are spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting the carbon car year to promote the carbon , which is a hosystore .
That picture me up to something --
Vertue Natal , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion lons of carbon .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the second greatest fleximum in America .
It happened around Natal .
The natalization of one of the carbon industries .
Video : Micross the carbon is a kind of happy and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and we grow our economy .
My carbon is more and more clean is more and more and more clean .
It &apos;s good , adorable and the work machines are kept .
Al Gore : From here &apos;s a lot of the West Virginia .
The greatest society on the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I &apos;m going to be clared -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelososis , Harry Reid -- don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Protection of Clima Clima has two campaign .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : At COALergy : At COALergy , we see the climate change as a serious tiny .
So , that &apos;s why we priority is invest a big amount of money in a public effort to make public and confused the truth .
Actually , the carbon isn &apos;t .
We think it &apos;s clean -- it &apos;s also a good profumo .
So you don &apos;t preocateful for climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Ator : Carbone .
So let &apos;s do a look at a struggle to a clean of the clean of the clean .
Strtraordinary ! Maches are a little bit of noory , but this is the sound of the car technology .
The coal coal is between the major causal causal , but the remarkable technology , but the remarkable carbs that you see changes everything .
You have a look at this : This is the hate hate hate technology .
Al Gore : Inally , the positive alternative positive alternative issues .
Video : Sot is : America is in crisis ; the economy , national security , the national security .
The philos that connects : our dependence from fossil fuels , like the spork and the oil .
Now , though , there &apos;s a new , audace solution for it .
Repower America : 100 percent of clean energy in 10 years .
A plan for requires , make us safer security , and helping the global warming .
Finally , a solution that &apos;s solution to solve our problems .
Repower America . You &apos;re reading more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It &apos;s a huge of energy .
One of the fastest ways to get the dependence of the combustible that kills our planet .
She &apos;s the future is here . Vink , sun , a new energy netical network .
She &apos;s got two : Noves investments for places of work broads .
She &apos;s a : Repower America . It &apos;s time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old old old old an old proverbial proverbiged , you go to it .
If you want to go away , go together . &quot;
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED I did an introduction on LHC .
And I promise to return you about how the machine works .
So , here I did . And for those who was not , the other time , the LHC is the greatest experiment who had ever been trying -- 27 kilometers of circumference .
His joke the conditions that were present less than a second billion second from the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
So this is simply environment .
This is the machine under Ginevenra .
We photographs these mini-Bang in the revarious .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- is 44 feet .
This is an ATLAS spectacular image in build-building .
Ten , 10 of the last year , we accent the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was causing immense festegamments in control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first particle of particle who had done all around the LHC , walking into collision , with a part of the LHC , and by a part of the LHC , and by by by by the way .
In other words , when we see that picture of the picture , we realize that the machine worked , which is a big vicicycle .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to do us exultate more or this , when somebody went to Google and saw that the beginning was this .
That means we had a cultural impact over to the scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had to these files here -- these dored files .
These files are 13,000 ampers when the machine works at the very much of the power .
Now , the technicians are going to look at the files and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . They &apos;re too untrue . &quot;
And they can do it because when they &apos;re very cold to become the cosmi-called superconductors .
So , at less 271 degrees , at a inferior temperature at the space between the stars , these files can bring that running that running .
In one of the young of the young novemisle in LHC , there was a factory difect of factors .
So the files that wonderful phils , and 13,000 ampers improvisionally met a resistance resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressionating if you think that these magnets weight more than 20 tons .
They &apos;re damaged about 50 magnetes .
We had to take them , what we did .
We restraveled them and traveled .
They &apos;re now coming back all the sub-place place .
By the end of the marzo LHC will be new integrate .
We &apos;re going to accend it , and we expect the data or slightly , and we continue our adventure to find out what the morning is the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these crashing the debate on the value of science and engineering in frontier . It &apos;s easy to confuture .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact of going to beyond the limits , I think this is the value of things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , I guess , I guess , in the advocate useful experiments of his pupillo , his pupillo was Michael Faraday , he said , &quot; Nothing is so dangerous for the progress of the human mind that the ideas of the human mind that the ideas of science are , which we &apos;re not going to be mistake . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start asking , to ask you when , as children , played with children , played .
And as you reach them and to go and get them , take them , take them and moving them , learned actually and to think and solve problems and solve problems and manipulating problems and manipulating problems .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , by information from the user uslity of our interaction with physical objects , together my consult Patti , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking me , &quot; And if we &apos;re using a computer , instead of having the mouse as a disease that dig die that moves on a desktop , we could have a desktop with a desktop with the hands , we could have a information with physically an information ,
and systemate our ployment ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , by building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big computer interactive computer like a biscookies .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big computer interactive computer like a biscookies .
You can move them with the hand , can see them , &quot; You can see them , &quot; you can see their movement and a radio and a radio wireless .
But above , they &apos;re physical objects , like the wins , can move simply .
Siftable is an example of a new ecosystem of a new ecosystem for manipulate the digital information .
And as as they become physical , conscious , of the other people , and and other people who are more physical , of other people , and how we can explore the movement , of other , how we can explore new and different stils of interaction .
I &apos;m going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configurated to show the video : if you incline , the video , it will rotate like this , if you cline , if you close the other hand back .
These are interactive of other people have other people who are awful other people .
If you go with them , they &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re around .
If they come surrounded , and they can get a little bit .
If they come surrounded , and they can get a little bit .
They &apos;re going to get their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the poter to use communicate gestures , &quot; a color as if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable , as a century of the versity and I can use them to real color in the central , where they &apos;re misquiet .
and I can use them to be color in the central , where they &apos;re missing .
It &apos;s too much , we can put a little bit of it .
There are also good possibility of learning , like languages , like the languages , the mathematics and logic where people can try things fast , and see the results of immediately .
I &apos;m now --
This is a Fibonacci that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a word of words that &apos;s half in Scarabeo and Boggle .
Pratically , at every turn to every Siftable , in a case on every Siftable , Pratically , every turn to every Siftable , and you can get words on every Siftable , and you can get words on a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds remissing , and you have a new clear and new possibilities to try to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the children came up to the Media Lab , I made them so they were trying to do it and I spent them and turned a video .
They &apos;re very love very , very , very , very ,
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people many instructions .
You have to say , &quot; Compons of words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s some other people who try it .
This is our younger Tester , there on the right .
It actually took only implement them .
They were just morning .
Now , this is an interactive application .
We wanted to build a device for learning of languages , Lui is Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , suncable Siftable them .
It can put new characters in the scene , suncable Siftable them .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : Sun is sun .
David Merrill : Now he took a tractor in the scenes .
Video : The arange tractor .
Bel work ! Yeah !
So , schooling the Siftable and put them neighbors can interact the personally --
Video : Bau !
To inventing their story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide him as it &apos;s a story .
DM : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide him as it &apos;s a story .
Vintegrate : Get .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , that &apos;s a recently , to wait and executive music .
it &apos;s a tool , realized recently , to sample and execquiet .
The Siftable is sound like base , based and battery .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose what we can use .
You can also put these sound in a sequence to a sequence to compose sequence .
And modificate it just to touch a sound . &quot;
These are effects that you can control from the vive , like the filter and the filter .
The drive at a particular sound and then inclins to be walking it .
And then there are general effects like time and volume , and that are applying the whole sequence .
Let &apos;s look at how it works .
Video : DM : We &apos;re going to start putting a base in two Siftable , &quot; sequence , &quot; we &apos;re extended , we extend base .
I &apos;m going to put a basse line .
Video : Now add of percussions --
Video : And I &apos;m going to put the filter to the bacteria , so I can control the effect of the living effect .
Video : I can speed to the whole sequence the whole sequence , by by one hand or another .
Video : And I &apos;m going to add the filter to the basse to give more expression .
Video : DM : I can recognize the sequence &quot; to fly . &quot;
So I didn &apos;t have to plan it before , but I can suddenly , making it longer or .
And now , finally , I can smoking the whole sequence inting sequence inting the Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new man interface , and more and more like our brain and body &apos;s kind of a little bit of how our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some possibilities that we &apos;re trying to take out of the lab .
The concept that I want to transmit is that &apos;s coming to this new generation of designed to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the hour of speak with all of you .
I &apos;m a writer .
Books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also the love and the fasck of my life .
And I don &apos;t expect that it can change .
But , said , something about this particular thing happened in my life and in my career , who took me me me me to realibrate the whole relationship with this work .
The particularly thing is I recently written this book , this biography called &quot; Mangia , Prega , Ama , &quot; which , for some reason I &apos;m going to be a few reason that I was in the world and became a big , sensational , wild , wild sensational .
And the result is that everywhere &apos;s going to be condantly , people treating me as if I was condanted .
Davy , condanned , condanned .
They &apos;re all right now , and they &apos;re saying , &quot; You don &apos;t feel more ?
You don &apos;t fear to continue to write all the life without any lifetime to create a book that can important somebody ? &quot;
What can you care someone ? &quot;
It &apos;s rassuring , you know .
But I could go worse , part of that I remember more than 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was a adolescent -- I was a cent classic -- that I wanted to be a critical .
I was in the same reaction based by the same reaction .
And people said , &quot; Do you can &apos;t get successful ?
You don &apos;t fear that the humiliation of the refuse ?
You don &apos;t fear to do this for all life without any living in the whole life that &apos;s never out and die on a snake of every infrants with the mouths of loving and dumual failure ? &quot;
Cose things like this , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I have afraid of all those things .
I &apos;ve had afraid .
And I have a lot of other things that people can &apos;t inate .
As the food and other things are frightening .
But , as much about the write what I thought and asked me and ask me , and I would ask me , and I would ask me , and I would ask me , and I would ask it , and I would ask it , and I would ask it , and I would ask it , and I would ask it , and I would ask me , and I would ask me , and I would ask me , and I would ask me , and I would ask me , and I would ask me , and I would
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logical that anyone who have to have to be frightened by a job that you feel to do .
But what &apos;s so particular in the creative imprising creative to us nervous health about the mental health in a way that other careers do not ?
As my father , for example , he was a chemist and I don &apos;t remember a once in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if he had been asked if he were afraid to be engineer ?
It never -- that &apos;s that block of the John engineer , how it &apos;s it ?
Not worked , you know ?
Onestly , chemicals like group have not , in the centuries , in the centuries , they have a depressed manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manivers .
We have enough , we have enough this reputation , and not just writers , but creative of every gender , we have this reputation of being enormous instabsolutation .
And it &apos;s not going to look at the contegrated trists of the magnificent ments that only creative , in the 20th century , died young people died young and they were often .
And also the ones that didn &apos;t have suicidated suicidated to be really disfaced by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before I die , in the last interview said , &quot; Every book killed me a little bit more . &quot; A extraordinary affirmation about their life .
But we don &apos;t bad when we heard this because we &apos;ve heard these things that in some way we have completely interior and accepted the notiorized that creativity and the notion that creativity and suffering , and it &apos;s going to be in some way that we &apos;re in some way that we &apos;ve heard of it , at the end .
And the question I want to ask all over here is : Did you agree with this idea ?
That &apos;s good -- because you look at it from a centimeter of distance to me not good for anything .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s also pericangerous and I don &apos;t want to see perpetuate in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our big creative minds to live .
And I know , in my case -- in my case -- in my situation -- would be very dangerous to start figure out the sent host of suppositions , absolutely , above the circumstances where I &apos;m in my career .
So , you look , I &apos;m quite a young , I &apos;ve been a 40 years .
I have still about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything I &apos;m going to write in now , and it &apos;s going to be judged by the world as the work that was coming from my last book .
I &apos;m going to be huge , because we &apos;re all about the most friends here -- is likely that my greatest success to my homes .
Oh , Gesus , who thought .
You know this is the kind of thinking that &apos;s a person to start broken a person starting to start broken in the nine and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would keep doing this work that we do this work that we do .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it looks like , after many reflection , which is to work to keep write is to create a psychological construct , okay ?
I have to find a few way of safety distance between me , who I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxiety of what reaction is going to get out of the year , looking for all last year , looking for all the last year , looking at how to do it , looking to find out if they could have the ideas and more under societies to have better ideas and more under societies more under ideas and more unsane healthy and more unsqueered . And as I was writing , and I was looking at the reacross the last
about how to help people to report the emotional inerset inerent risks of creativity .
And that research has taken me to the ancient Green and ancient Rome .
Seguitems because I play in a circle and then back .
In the ancient Grecise and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t look like creativity , OK ?
He thought creativity was this spirit of the wind divine and sell man someone who was several distant and sure , for distances and unknown reasons .
The greatest of these wins of the great-creativity &quot; demands . &quot;
Socry , wonderful , believed they had a demon wisdom .
Romans were the same idea , but they called the kind of spirit , but they were called the spirit a genius .
which is great , because Romans didn &apos;t think that a genius was someone particularly intelligent .
They believed that a genius was this kind of divine that was created in the walls of a study of an artist , a little bit like Dobby , and that came out of the Dobby , and that came out to assisted to hidden the work of the artist and model of that work .
Here &apos;s the way -- this is the distance of which is the distance of which is the psychological construct that protected from from your work .
And everybody knew that was what was worked , right ?
So the anticient artists were protected by certain things , like the narcism , right ?
If your job was except for your job , you could not take all the market , everybody knew that you had helped by this genioral geniorporeum .
If your job your job , it wasn &apos;t all the basic , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be an inable .
And so people han concept creativity in the West for a long time .
Then the Rinaxent came and everything changed , and nactic this big idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe , and the mysteries and leaving more and leaving mitions and leaving the mitions that write from the divinity .
This was the rational principle and people began to think that creativity was completely from hyd-hy-hy-short .
And for the first time in history , he started to reference this or the artist as a rather kind of a rather kind of a person with genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big herror .
I think that allowing somebody , a simple person to believe that a source , like the source , the essence and the surprising of all mysteries , creative , unknowledge and the holds of a lot of people to give the psychc fragile to give the psychs .
It &apos;s like somebody to ask somebody hit .
Deform and completely distores the ego and create all these expectations on performance .
And I think it was this pression to destroy artists in the past 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think it &apos;s the question is , and now ?
Can we do it diversly ?
Maybe you can go back to a more older than the relationship between humans and creative .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t sing 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people between the audience who would have a scientific suspects on the notion of the notion , instead , do that following people , and they follow the next projects .
Probably not convince you all about this .
But the question I &apos;d like to ask is -- why not ?
Why don &apos;t you think that way ?
Because it &apos;s more sense than anything that ever ever ever heard to explain the exasperant impredicbility of creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever have been trying to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- knows , you know , it doesn &apos;t care .
And in fact , it can sometimes look completely paranormal anormal .
I did this meet recently with the extraordinary poetching Page , who &apos;s now 90 , but it &apos;s a poetic for all life and said that she &apos;s during his childhood in Virginia , worked out in the field Virginia , and he heard , in if a poetry came from the landscape .
He said he was like a fragorous trains .
And she was rolating towards her the landscape .
He heard it , because he was tremendous , because he was tremendous to his feet .
She knew he had one thing to do at that point and was , words , &quot; running like a matx . &quot;
And so he was running up to home and he was followed by this poetry , and he had to take a piece of paper and a fairly faster , and it &apos;s a faster , and they were page it up , and run it on the page .
Sometimes he couldn &apos;t be faster , so corrected and correct and correct and correct them and the poetry and get the poetry and then lost her , and she would continued to roll through the landscape , looking , like her , looking , as he said , &quot; one other poet . &quot;
Then there were those times -- this piece I &apos;ll never forget this -- there were any moments where they were almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was looking for the home and the paper through , and he would go through , and he was a writing walking , and he was like if he &apos;s spring with the other hand and and the step and hand the step .
He had the poetry from the tail and put it in his body and put it in his body and page her body and transcoil on the page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be presented on the perfect and intatta , but the option in the last word to the first .
So when I heard it -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly equal to my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conducture !
I &apos;m a mulo , and my way of work is ; I &apos;m waking up the same horarian every day and to work and go on and work and go on us .
But I even , in my test , I &apos;ve been striped against that thing , sometimes .
And I guess many of you have han done .
You know , even if the work and ideas came to me , and ideas came from a source source I could not be honestly known .
And what is this ?
And how can we relate it in a way that we don &apos;t lose the head , but rather , what do you can do you remaining healthy ?
For what I &apos;ve been about , the best example , I have the musician that I have musician musician , which I interviewed a different year ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of the life has been the incarnation of the artist came up with contemporary , looking for controlling , to look at these kind of totally interested in the whole thing .
But then he did investiged , and one day , and one day as he was driving on a &quot; highway in L.A. Tales , changed everything .
He was going to be fast and all of a sent tract this little sent , that &apos;s a little bit of melody , which comes into its head as inspiration , elusive , and the vulnery , and the vulous , and the desiderve , and the desiderve , but it &apos;s not known how to take it .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a club .
So , he starts to feel this kind of old anxophistory , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;ll stay obsessed by this persect song .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to the panic , he stopped .
He was going to move the whole process and made something completely new .
And he just watched the sky and said , &quot; Scuscause , not see I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Do you look like a song now ?
If you really want to exist , I go back to a care of you , when I can take care of you .
Although , you have to get another today .
You know , Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his process has been working on this .
Not the work , the work was still hoscure as the time .
But the process , and the anxiety that was left when he took the genius , the genius that was caused to anything else and liberated it back where it came out of the problems and liberated it back from the back where it came from , realizing that had to be a interiorized thing and tomented .
but I was wonderful , wonderful , wonderful cooking a conversation between Tom and this external thing that &apos;s and external thing that &apos;s not Tom .
So , how I heard that story about changing a little bit even the way I was working and already and save me .
This idea , this idea , when I was writing , &quot; Manway , &quot; and Prega , Ama , &quot; and fall into one of those dispersed as we all work on something and we can &apos;t start thinking that it &apos;s going to be a disaster , which is going to be the worst ever written .
Not just book , just the worst book or written .
And I started thinking about to throw this project .
But then I remember of Tom who was talked to the air and try .
So I ran up my face in the manoscrits and I made my comments to a corner of the room .
And I said to the high , &quot; Sent , what , both of them , both , both of course , it &apos;s not going to be bright .
Because as I &apos;m going to put everything I have , I have no more than that I have , not more than that .
So if you want to be better , you have to give you , and you have to do your part .
Okay . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , I don &apos;t do anything .
I &apos;m going to get the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I want to favor for me that was recorded that I today to do my part part , &quot; Because , &quot; finally , &quot; Why is , OK -- in the deserts of the North Africa in North Africa &apos;s deserts , and sacred music and hours to the sacred of sacred , sacred music and until the dancing .
And they were always magnific , because the dancy balls were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every once of a lot , of something happened , and one of these artists had actually transnated .
And I know you &apos;ve all know what I &apos;m talking , because I know you &apos;ve all seen it , a performance .
It was like if the time , and the dance balls , and the dance wallows through a kind of cool and wasn &apos;t doing anything different from the usual , like the 1,000 nights before , but it was all .
And suddenly , I know not just like a human .
But it turns out from the dedside and under the divinity .
And when this happened to the time , people knew what was , they were called him .
They were broken their hands and began to sing , &quot; Allah , God , Allah , God , &quot; God , God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curious night -- when the Momorrow &apos;s south of Spain , they took this habits and the broad changed in the centuries of &quot; Allah , Allah , &quot; Alah , Allah , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; &quot; Okay , &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; Okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Okay , &quot; to be able to be in the wild . &quot; Alah , Allah , Allah , &quot; to , &quot; &quot;
In Spain , when an artist did something impossible and magical , &quot; Allah , &quot; Allah , &quot; broke , &quot; broke , &quot; burning , &quot; God . &quot;
And that &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes the day after , for the dance himself , when you wake up and find that are the 11 in the morning of Martedesday and I &apos;m going to look at God , there &apos;s no longer .
It &apos;s just a bad with a lot of bad to the kinocky , and perhaps never ever ever ever more lightly to get the height .
And maybe no one of God &apos;s still while he &apos;s going to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most sweatest recognciliations to make a creative life .
But maybe not to be so angoscial if you can &apos;t believe , anzyutt , which is the most extraordinary expected from you .
But I just believe that you &apos;re just giving you data in a unimaginable unimaginable source of this source of your life that you have to have to go to something else when you &apos;ve finished .
And , you know , if we think it all changes .
And so I started thinking , and it &apos;s certainly how I thought for several months in the book that I &apos;m going to public , spaventy , spaventy , spaveful , spaventy , we were followed by my graduate success .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I &apos;m electrated by this is , not afraid .
Don &apos;t go down . It just your job .
Continuates to present you for your part , any one can be .
If your job is bought , bbank .
If the wine , absurd genius , assigned decided to leave some kind of wonderful wonder , for a moment through your efforts , then , &quot; Okay ! &quot;
She &apos;s got your dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot;
I believe it &apos;s got to us to teach us .
&quot; You know , &quot; at you , even for you had human love and test love and test and test that you &apos;re going to present you continually .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I &apos;ve already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what it can mean and discovery of new genes .
Now we &apos;re starting a new course , we started digitalize biology and now to go from that digital code we &apos;re in a new phase of biology , designing and synthesizing and synthesizing life .
We &apos;ve always been trying to ask big questions .
&quot; What &apos;s life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists I think they &apos;re trying to understand various levels .
We tried different approaches , reducing it to the minimal terms .
We &apos;re digitalizing for almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was going to go from the analog of the digital biology in the digital world .
Now we can regenerate life , or can we regenerate life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome of those who can authorium in lab .
And we tried to reduce the ulteriorbly the genome to create a more smaller .
We &apos;re able to eliminate a hundred of genes about 500 that are here .
But when we look at a look at his map metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple respect to our .
Credetemes , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at a time , it &apos;s very improbable that this can bring to a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to program was to synthesize this croms in a way that we could modify the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of the &quot; Pan we can synthesize a croma ? &quot;
Can the chemistry to produce these big molecules that we never could create before ?
And in case , we can make a crowd , we can make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a chemical piece of inert material chemical material .
The speed that we can digitalize life is growing up to exponential life is growing to exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , progress rather than it , but it &apos;s improving .
And our recent recent retaken the most recent curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process has requesed for many passioned , beginning with a biothical review before the experiments .
But we found that DNA is very hard .
There are thousands of thousands of machines in the world that make small sector of DNA , of the long , of the longer and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the most errors there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments and correct .
And this was our first attempt , to start , to start to go from digital information of Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a small virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , actually the correction of the errors and got a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material chemical material and we put it in the bacteria , the bacteria , the bacteria , the bacteria , the bacteria , the bacteria particles .
The viral particles have been left from cells , they were back and destroy and they destroy the E.
I &apos;ve been talking to recent with members of the oil industry and they have a lot of them who have certainly compress this model .
They &apos;re slater than you .
We believe that this is a situation where software can actually build his hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the biggest things .
We wanted to build the whole broken of the bacteria .
They &apos;re over 580 midle of genetic code .
So we thought we could build it in the size of the virus of the virus , so that we could change the cassette components to understand what the components are the components of a living cell living classic .
The progress is crucial , and if we start digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard accurately was a mile for every 10 mile .
We found out , we had that , 30 errors . If we had that original sequence , we would never be able to do this work .
One part of the process is to design segments that have been design in the 50 letterters that they are overlapping with all the other square litered switness to build under smaller suburban sub-literate security that work together .
We &apos;re going to try under unique elements here .
You probably have read that we read that we &apos;re going to put the craft .
Think of it like this : we have a genetic code based on four letters : As , C , Good and T.
Three of those letters code together , and there &apos;s a specific admind , and there &apos;s a specific order of letters for every ammine .
So we can use genetic code to write words , frastion , thoughts .
What we did the begin was allowed to do it .
Some were delivered by the fact that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
We designed these signs to be just able to join them .
There are a enzymes that they &apos;re standing them .
And we started assembly assembly , starting with segments from five to seven thousand seven thousand sand swallows them until of 2,000 letters .
At every step we made these segments in abundance so that we could sequencing that we &apos;re trying to create a very robust .
We &apos;re looking for automatize process .
So , this seems the tabellone of a basket play-basket play-basket .
When we get these very long segments , more than 100 middle , more than 100 midle in E.
It comes to the limit of modern molecular biology .
So we &apos;ve been considered other mechanisms .
We knew of another mechanism called the homologist , which is a homology that in biology to repect DNA can get segments .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodus , can absorbing three million rad of radiation .
You can see in the high quads as his chromosome is destroy .
In 12 -- 24 hours , exactly like before .
There are thousands of organisms that have been able to do it .
These organisms can be completely .
They can live under vacuum .
They &apos;re absolutely sure that life in space , and you can find new environments .
Actually , NASA showed that this happens .
This is a picture of the molecule we built by using these processes , simply using the appropriate with appropriate design .
The lievitually assembly .
This image not been taken with a electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a very big molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that have a time of about six seconds .
This is the published that we did a little time ago .
They &apos;re over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the biggest molecule of a definitely definitely created by man .
It &apos;s a molecular molecular hours .
If we stop it with a 10 without spaces , they would like 142 pages , they would just like 142 pages to transcriter .
Now , how do we do it ? How can we make it ?
Of course , you know , you have a virus is a little girls .
It &apos;s a bit more complicated when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s a simplest when it &apos;s of the eucariots as our : You can simply extract the nucleo and insert another , which is practically the clonically process .
In the archaea , the chromosome is integrated inside the cells , but we &apos;ve been shown that we can do a cell traphic traphic of a cell cell from one cell to another and activating it .
We got a crowded chromosome from a microbial species .
The two are what men from topes .
We &apos;ve added some gene in more way that we could decide what chooms for this croms .
The stake it with the enzymes in a way to kill all protein .
And when we put it in the cells was study -- and you &apos;re going to be a graphic -- and you &apos;re going to go to the cell .
And we were actually thought we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to do it in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms .
We found that many of the species add species add a second or third chromosome somewhere , add in a second thousands of new , add in a second thousands of new species .
So who thinks about evolution as a only gene at the evolution that has not understood most of the biology .
There &apos;s a enzymes that they call DNA restrict enzymes that DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cells had not one .
The cell phone that we have a cell phone that we have insert .
It expressed , and he recognized the other croms like extraneous material , and we found it with just the cell and the new croms .
it became blue because of the genes we &apos;ve inserted .
And in a short of time , all the characteristic of a species have gone lost , and it turned around a new species , based on the new software that we have inserted in cells .
All protein , membranes have changed , and when we read the genetical code , exactly what we &apos;ve transfer you .
Now , this could look like genetics , but altering the DNA software , we can change things in a pretty much substantial .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that here &apos;s not talking about this -- but of progress to go from three million years and a half million years of evolution , and I &apos;ve already told that maybe we &apos;re going to create new version of the Cambrian explosion this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty obvious when we think about our needs .
We &apos;re going to pass six billion people to nine billion in the next 40 years .
Gust for an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one in 1946 ; there &apos;s a 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find food , fresh fresh water and clean , medicinal and gas for six and a half of people .
It &apos;s going to be more hard to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion barrel , more than 30 billion barrel .
That means millions of barrels a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replaced them , it will be a huge challenge .
In more we have to convey of all the emission of CO2 from these materials that &apos;s enters .
At the day , thanks to scientific discoveries all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that they are the design for the future .
The electronics can only a dozen about a dozen about a dozen of components , and think about how many different things come out .
Our limits here are principlally from biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , thanks to these synthesization of synthesization , able to create what we call combinatory combinatory .
We &apos;re able to build a big robots that can produce a million of cromosomes a day .
Think of these 20 million different genes or try to try to get the processes to get the processes to produce the processes to produce the processes to produce a small team , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology that in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemistry or carburn , production or carburn , production of vaccines .
This is an instantly of some software program that we &apos;re working on for being able to sitting and design species and design species and design species species .
Well , we don &apos;t know necessarily how they &apos;re going to be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
Now we &apos;re focused on the carbons of how much generation .
You &apos;ve seen that extracted ethanol from the grain was a bad experiment .
We have second and third generation that will come to out of sugar carburanants in sugar carburananants as the eight and different kinds of butanker .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without more more than the cost of food and limiting the cost of food and limitarily the CO2 in matter , and we &apos;re working for design cells that we &apos;re working to design cells that can achieve this purpose , and we think we could have the first carbons of how quarters generation in about 18 months .
The sunlight combined with CO2 is a methodownload -- but in our discoveries in the world , we found different metothers .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , at about 2500 feet depth of the water temperature of the water .
CO2 using CO2 using hydrogen by CO2 ,
We &apos;re trying to figure out if we can sing CO2 , which can easily be transported through the touch , convert that CO2 in carburn , to drive this process .
So we think we could be able to move the whole thing that the question of what the base question of what the base is that life is Noe , &quot; we have the goal , we have the goal to replace the whole obial industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do it by TED , where can you do it ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working to use the same methods to create vaccines .
You saw this year with the influence , we &apos;re always back a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s finding vaccine .
I think that this can change by building vaccines , and you can change combinable in anticipate .
That &apos;s how the future could start to look like changing , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria , and eventually cells .
We &apos;re so much like that we improve people .
Our purpose is to do enough to try to try to try to try to try to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the most quickly possible , some fundamental work , the new technology that we took to Microsoft in a following nearly pursue . This is Seadragon . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s a local environment where you can interact is at the local level that remote with an enormous amount of data .
Here we &apos;re seeing a lot of gigabyte photos that &apos;s a lot of constant and continuous , for a bread , and a bread , for a bread bread , and it &apos;s a bread , and we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these data or images or images .
Most of digital photographs , but this for example is a scanning scanning from the Bibliote-congressed scanning , and reentrs in the gamm of the Congress .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that &apos;s just the one thing that &apos;s the number of a system like this is the number of plxel on any moment . It &apos;s also an architecture .
This is a whole book , you don &apos;t have imagery .
This is Casolate Dickens . Every colonn . Every colonn .
To show you that it &apos;s about text and not images , we can do something like this , to see really that &apos;s a real , to see that it &apos;s a real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little bit artificial to read a book to read a book electronic book .
I don &apos;t realize it .
This is a more realistic example . This is a more realistic example of the Guardian .
Every big image is the beginning of a set .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beauty of the read verse version of a journey or a daily journey , which is for a lot of medium .
We also made something with the corner of this particular number of the Guardian .
We made a higher high-resolutic advertising -- much higher than that you use in a published normal -- and we put you on extra normal content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see it .
Or other models , or even specific specific .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that this means to put pop-up and other cheries and other challenge , and they wouldn &apos;t be necessary .
And of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not , if you don &apos;t want to lose time , if we don &apos;t have contributed to this field .
These are all the streets in the USA to overcome on a geospatial image of NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually from the view of the view of the website ; you can go to see .
This is a project called Photosynth , which is two different technologies .
One is Seadragonflies and the other is a very interesting searching in the computer very interesting computer . Noah Snavely , a student of the University of the University of the Seitz of UW and Rick Seliski UW and Rick Seliski &apos;s Research . It &apos;s a hottim .
And it &apos;s from the view , the Seadragon .
You can see when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from an image to another picture and have this kind of experience to the other and have this kind of experience .
But the location of the images here has actually a meaning .
The size of the computer visualization of the computer visualization , and they &apos;re all these imaging , so that they &apos;re all taking up the real pictures -- all the same -- all the closer to the Roccial Montanne Roccious Montanning Roccious Montagne Roccial Montagne Roccial Tshow or of a slide-stable show or of a slides of a slides of a slide of a slandagainst of a slamp .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some much more space .
I want to go to one of the original data from Noah-data -- and this is from a previous prototype of Photosynth , that we &apos;ve done in Photosynth , we have been doing this technology , Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily the key behind this technology , the Potosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily about the website .
We had to worry about legal and so on .
This is a rebuild-up of Nothtrial . Nothtrial images from Flickr . Bat &apos;s digitar , and you get images of typing and out images of types and out of saying .
So , I &apos;m all images that Flickr , and they were all connected to the space .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this very simplication .
You know , I would never have thought I would be able to work for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifying to receive this kind of accurate here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of different types : from those of the cellphone to those professional cellphone , put together in this environment .
And if I can , try to try to look at those more strange .
Many are blocked by faces , etc .
Some of here is a few photographs -- etchcols .
This is a Nothree poster Dame recorded .
We can go from the poster to the poster of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the bear , the collective interior of how the land , the collective point of view -- and connected all those data together .
All those pictures become connected , greater than the size of the parts .
You have a model of the entire terth model that emerges .
Think of this as a Hungarium prolarming Lawler on Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as people use it , and the people who are using it , and the people who use for people who use it .
Their pictures are married by other people .
If somebody comes to contrassigning all these several several , my picture of Nothtrial to be a Nothtrial to get up of all the data , and I can use as a point of ingraveing point to the whole thing to get in space , and I can use the photos of anyone else , and have a social experience of anyone else , and have a social experience of anyone else , and have a social experience of anyone else , and have a high social experience of anyone else , and I can &apos;t , and I can use like that .
Of course , a consequence of all of this is extremely elaborated virtual models of every interesting part of the Earth , and you don &apos;t just achieving by satellite and images and satellite images and satellite images and satellite .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What your software will contain us to do is that at some point in the next years , all the photographs shared by anyone in the world will be going to be practically connected ?
BA : Yeah . What &apos;s basically what &apos;s doing is basically .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of seeing information that many of these images can be .
As when you do a research of images , you get a sentence and the web page has a lot of information about the websentence of the picture .
Now , what if that happens , if that picture connects all your pictures ?
So the amount of simantly interconnection and the amount of wealth that &apos;s really huge . It &apos;s a huge effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible . Compliments .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure , when you travel and one of the ethography research is the power power power of the people who have not forget the antic antic traditions , between who have the past in the wind , the wind of the wind , the wind of the gathering .
Basti thinking that the Jaguar , they still traveling over the Via Lattea , or mythtea , or the myths of Inuit &apos;s still more memeaning , or that in Himalaya , to remember the respire of Dharm , to remember the world we live in the central important anthroughout of the central anthropology , and the idea that the world we live in the world we live we live not exist , but it &apos;s just a model of reality , but it &apos;s just a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of adaptative that our stirs did , well or a bad , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share the essential .
Everybody &apos;s really really procreating .
We &apos;re subjects in the beginning .
We have to go to the inexorability of mortgage , so not surprising us if we save and ballie .
We all have a art .
What hit is the particular rate of the song , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that they &apos;re the Penan forests of Borneo , or the follow-Voodoo , or the Saharan Green , the Kaisut Kaisut , the Curander Sahara , the Curander of Ande , or a cameler in the Sahara .
He was my journey in the desert a month ago , or a hallevator of yak in the valley of the Everest , the mother of Everest , the mother of the world .
All these people teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And , if you reflection , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
Insive , the myridge of the world create a girl nature of spiritual life and cultural life that has the planet and it &apos;s important for the well-being of the planet as a biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural girl as a nosphere , and you can define the etnosphere , the nosphere , sites , sites , ideas , inspirations , inspirations , intuitions , inspirations , intuitions , inspirations ,
The etnosphere is the fantastic patrimony of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how inquisitive .
And because the biosphere was graveled by as well as it was as slightly as etnosphere and unfortunately .
No biologist , for example , would say , that 50 percent of all species was on the extinction of simply , because it &apos;s a fake , or in the most apocalytic ipothesis -- in the most optimistic ipothesis , in the most optimistic hypothesic , the most timistic ening .
The injury of all that is , of course , the language .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only a vocabolarian vocabolarial or by a series of rules .
A language is the spray of human spirit .
It &apos;s the medium with which the animal of every culture comes into the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a bind , a thought-and-chance of spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , while we &apos;re sitting in Monterey , at least the midle of the children .
They don &apos;t come out of the children , which means , unless than not wonder that wasn &apos;t wonderful anything , which is not dead .
What is the sad of being taken from the silence , of being the last one language , the last one language , not have a way to be the wisdom of the wisdom or to anticipate the promise of the children ?
This is a slums of somebody in some part of the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks : every square of a ancient language .
And I know somebody who will say , &quot; Isn &apos;t it ?
The world wouldn &apos;t it be a better place if we &apos;re talking to everybody &apos;s the same language ? &quot; We &apos;re all talking to yoruba . We talk to all of the same .
Let &apos;s talk to kogi .
You &apos;ll buy a sudden thing you can &apos;t talk your language .
Today , I &apos;d like to do you a trip through ethnosphere --
a little trip in the etnosphere to give you a massive of what we &apos;re losing .
Most of us forget that when I say , &quot; different ways of existing ways of existing .
Take for example this birth babana , in Amazon , Amazon , the anaconda , which creates the myth of the hest sthemselves of the hest sats in the hest of the square of several slats .
It &apos;s a population that &apos;s not able to distinguished the blue color , because the blue color is identified in the time of forest , which depends the population .
They have a strange language and a marriage , called &quot; Least , &quot; Law language , &quot; : you have to move a person who &apos;s talking a different language .
So all of this roots in the mythological past , but though the particularity is that in these extended six or seven languages that no one &apos;s practices no one &apos;s practical masters .
They &apos;re limited to listen and then they start to talk .
Take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived , the Waoran of Ecuador , an incredible population , an incredible population , an incredible population that had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 mesionaries have tried a commercial contact .
They did come up with photographs that were sitting them in poses that they were amichevolved , forget that this population of pluvial forest had never seen anything .
They took the slide from the land , they turned them to the research of a shape or a figure and , not find anything , they concled it that the disease , and they killed the full of the slums .
But the Waoran doesn &apos;t just kill the stranieters .
They were killing between them .
54 percent of mortality was caused by them .
We &apos;re slow-generations and we found two of natural death , and when we &apos;ve been insisted , they admit that one of them was aging , and then they killed that one of them was aging , and then they killed it .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine , and you can recognize the species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned a very interesting compiece when my professor of Harvard was assigned to me , if I wanted to go to Haiti in the swake of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutside of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutout-After Macout-After bome I used to use to the bome .
To give a sense of miraculous , I should have to understand the Vodoun culture Vodoun and that the Vodoun doesn &apos;t nack .
It &apos;s rather than a complex metaphysics of the world .
Many interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Budddism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has no religious . And instead and the Voodoo is not religious that the distillation of these religious concepts of naked up the tragic drive deep tragic diaspora .
What makes the voodoo is the intense intense is the intense between life and death .
So , the alive you have to get the spirits .
And the spirits can be invoded by the Great Aqua , they respond to the dance of the dance and replace temporary the animal in the living anima very short that &apos;s a short .
So , the voodoohists love to say , you white God , you go to wait of God .
We say , we say in the temple and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re possitting , is the spirit that you , how can you do the bad ?
So you &apos;re assists to these incredible events : follow voodoo in state of trance that touch impowered dion a rather stripped direction of the mind on the body &apos;s mind when it &apos;s catalyzed in a state of extremely exciting .
In all the people with the people who lived the most extraordinary people are the Kogi of Sierra Nevada Marta , in Colombia , in Colombia .
Tell us us the ancient civilization that once the caraibon caraibic planure in the conquist , the population was willing , the population was going to be the massure that you herd on the caraibage carbon .
In a short continent of blood , this population never been conquered by the spagners .
And so , I &apos;m governments are governed by a craft , but their formation is really extraordinary .
The young people are taken away from the families to three or four , and they live in a good hombers and hombers in a hombers of standard and hombers in the bake of the glacier for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years of the nine months of the nine months that trans-to-to-trans-to-to-user , now are metaphor , they &apos;re metaphor in the Great Mther .
So , this is acculated by the values of their society , values that they &apos;re predicting their prayers and only their prayers are the cosmic balance -- or to say the cosmic equilibrium .
At the term of this incredible initiation , they &apos;re improviding up and for the first time , 18 years , they see a food of the first basic asic ahead . And in that actim of the first bad , when the sun broken , the bag comes up in the major , and it &apos;s conferred to all the splender and says , &quot; The prier a step back and says , &quot; The precier a step back and says , &quot; The precisely a step back and says , &quot; The precise a steal ak . &quot;
&quot; Do you ? Proprion .
It &apos;s a study . Now it &apos;s going to be protected . &quot;
They &apos;re called the greater brothers and say that we , brothers , we &apos;re the hit of the world .
This is extremely important .
When we think of the Indigenes and the environment , we invoke Rset and the old story of the vulnetworks of the wild , which is a rather rather than the Splicity or maybe we invoded Theeau and say that these people are close to the Earth of us .
Indigenes are not not sentimental nor indebuled by nostalgets .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the disease of Abat or in the winds of the Tibet , but thank you to the time and the rhythical , created a mystic of the Earth is not on the concept of the concept of the world &apos;s unconsciously intuition , the concept of the Earth can live only because it &apos;s infected from human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
It &apos;s a little bit of the Ande who grow up the mountain is a mountain in a pu spirit Apu spirit , it will be a different human being depped . And it will have a different broken , and it will have a mountain place in Montana that you grow up in a mountain in Montana that you grow up to a mountain .
which is the dimora of a spirit or a mineral cave is irrievant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Britannica of Columbia creating forests to be cut .
That made me a human being different from my friends Kwakiutl &apos;s Kwakiutl who believe that forests are the Hukuk and the history of paradise and the history of paradise and the history of the world , the spirits that have been in the Hamatsa .
If you start to look at that these cultures can actually actually , different reality , you can start to understand some of them discoveries . Take this plants .
I took this picture to open them in the Weskey Amazon .
Mayahuasca , the most powerful susceful substance of the wallow-reper-active suscence .
What makes the fascinating the ayahuasca is not the potential drug of substance , but his process . It &apos;s composed by two elements .
From one hand , this lian league that &apos;s a series of health carboline , harmful and harmful , harmful and harmful hallucinogene .
Take the only plant , you have a smoke that altera little bit of consciousness , but it &apos;s mixed with the leaves of a clubs of the coffee family of coffee .
This plants this plants , a lot of triptamines , very similar to the serotonin the serotonin five , methoxyltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltrylltrylltryltryltryltryltryles .
If you never see the Yanomami tyrare on for the nose the ssue that they do by a different species of species , it &apos;s half the methoxyltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltrylltrylltryltryltryltrylling .
Tiring that pollution on the nose is a little bit of like being disappeared by a gathering and land on a sea sea sea sea sea sea sea distortion of reality .
I was often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who wrote the psychedelical , with his discovery of the fungi in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the Mexico .
Second , my thesis can &apos;t classify these triptams like hallucinogens because if you can &apos;t tell anyone of being killed .
It &apos;s possible above the horally if you unabsolutely until other chemical chemical substances that money .
Now , the beautiful : the Col the Cooline , are inibitors of the AO , the same kind of needs to be able to potential triptams . The question question is spontaneous question : in a 80,000 species of plants , how do these people find morphologically not similar , but if you combined in this way , create a biochemical version that &apos;s a high that &apos;s perior that &apos;s high perior of the parts ?
We use the big euphemism of the prova and the mistake , which can reveal infruit .
But if we ask the Indian , they will say , &quot; Phts are talking about . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribes , Cofan , 17 variety of Ehuasca , which distinguished netely in the forest , and that our eyes would requires in the same species .
If we ask him how they &apos;re asking them how they &apos;re going to say , &quot; I thought , &quot; I thought I was going to get a lot of them ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you get 17 variety in a notice of lone night and each one will song with a different tone .
With this is not laurea to Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting to count that count .
Now , the problem is that also the problem is that also the ones of us who have heart people who have heart people who have heart people have heart of the history of history in the history of the history of our real world , and it &apos;s going to the real world , and it &apos;s pass .
In fact , the 20th century , in 300 years , it &apos;s not reminded for its wonderful or war innovations , but rather as the was where we stopped and we were abunglad and we were abuntil actively or walked actively , the problem is not the problem . Now the problem isn &apos;t the problem problem . Now the problem isn &apos;t changed .
All cultures , all cultures have been involved in a dance for new possibility of life .
And the problem isn &apos;t technology .
The Indian Sioux didn &apos;t stop being Sioux when they put part of the army and full Americans have no stopped to be American when they put out out of horse and horse .
It &apos;s not the change or the technology that they mind literate the integrity of ethnosphere . It &apos;s the power .
The flight on the domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you &apos;ll find that these are not destined cultures .
They &apos;re creatures and dynamics out of the existence of identifiable forces that go beyond their ability of adaptation .
Sy that &apos;s disbosing in the patria of the Penan Pria --
a nomad of Sarawak , in the South Asian , a population , a population to a generation , and now reduced the forest to a generation and the next reduces of the fier , where you can see the river of the phone of the Surday , where you can see the phone from the squinated Borneo in Morneo Chornear , where the Japanese naves the horizonic Mapanciate the horizonte , where you can see the black of the high of the Chumes the Mapang the Souse , the Gapange , the horrow of the Japang .
By the slums with the wood wood .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that have come with the gold .
If we move on the Tibet of the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing many research , you &apos;ll see the wild of political domination .
As you know the genocide , the physics of a population , is condanted at the universal level , but the ethnic of the lifestyle of a population of a population of a population of the development of the development strategy of development strategy .
And you can &apos;t understand the Tibet suffering in the way you don &apos;t go from the beginning .
I run 6,000 miles from China , in the Western China in the Western China , coming to Lhasa with a young , and I came to Lhasa young , but only came to Lhasa I &apos;ve got to realize what &apos;s behind the statistics that we &apos;re hearing .
6,000 sacred sacred sacred in pollution and centers .
1.2 million people killed from military military , Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascrited in Panchen Lama .
which means that means that it was killed to the invasion of the Chinese invasion .
Sought , uncle was with Santity in Santity in Santity , in Nepal .
Her mother was imprisoned and his choler was reich .
It was taken by hidden in the age of two hurt , hidend under his own grandmother , because he could not have lived in him .
The sister , who made the same , who made the same , was put in reeducation .
One day , he &apos;s walked a crazy crowd Mao and , for this transgression , was put in the forced jobs for seven years .
Tibet , the Tibet can be insation-insy , but the spirit reducer is from tener .
At the end , it &apos;s all of it .
We want to live in the world world &apos;s a homic world , or we want to take the policromatical world of diversity ?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead , before we die said her biggest fear was that , in our greater , we &apos;re going to see the whole world of human imagination is going to see the whole world of human imagination is a limited modality of the human imagination , but a day we &apos;ll wake up to a de-formental sound modity , but one day we can see us .
And it &apos;s humiliating our species is a 60,000 years .
The Neolitics Revolution , who gives us the agriculture , which made us to socks on the cult , and replease the poetry with the poetry of the slide , and we &apos;re talking about 10,000 years ago .
The industrialized world &apos;s about 300 years .
That shark that story I &apos;m not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenge that we &apos;ll have to go .
When these myridge of the world &apos;s asked to be human , respond to be human , respond with 10,000 different voices .
And that &apos;s in these answers that we all get the possibility of being what we are : a consciousness , which has to be what we are : a consciousness , which has to be able to all the people and flowers can flow .
I took this picture on the north of Baffin the island of Baffin , when I went to hunt with Inuit , and this man , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , he told me the wonderful story of her grandfather .
The canadvice canadan has not always been gentile with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to stabilie our own teachers .
The grandfather was this man was refused to go .
The family , tempting him , he took him away all the arms , and all its tols .
You have to know that Inuit doesn &apos;t feel the cold , they &apos;re sliterally sliced .
The slices were in the origins were made of fish .
The grandfather did not stick in this man did not stick from the arctimiddle note .
It &apos;s slate away , it &apos;s squirt , the pattern in the skin and defecated in their hand . When the stick them , they &apos;re taking them , they &apos;re working with a light .
He sprayed himself on the points of this cluster , and when he became solid , he killed a dog .
He history , the dog and created a brilliant , with the actual cassa sliter , he sleep another dog and it &apos;s gone , and it &apos;s gone on the banchisa , and it &apos;s slaughing in rest .
We want to talk about cavarsela with nothing ? Risan . This is in different ways , in different ways , &#91; Applausi &#93; is the simbull of the population of Indigence and all the Indigence of all the Indigence of the world &apos;s population .
In the 1999 , the canadvice of the California , the Inuit &apos;s the total of the California and Texas I did .
It &apos;s their new patria . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a independent territory . They contrict all the mineraries .
One of the splendidging for example of how a national state can recognize with his population .
And , finally , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious at least at least , and I think that &apos;s been in these sliced zone of the planet , make it not remote .
For somebody &apos;s home .
They know , the kind of representing human imagination that &apos;s coming up to the dawn of the time . And for us all these children , like the dreams of these children , become part of our children , become part of the hope .
Finally , we have National Geographic , we &apos;re convints that politicians will never come to anything .
We believe that polemy --
&#91; Applausi &#93; not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and perhaps we &apos;re the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month to tell stories of the world . Every month , our website . Every month , our website ream 35 million visit .
156 countries transmit our television .
Our reviews are slabers from millions of people .
Our work is to travel in the etnosphere to bring our public in the audience of wonderful cultural waiting as they saw and hopes , hopes , they will address for the central reveal of the anthropology : the world of exists in diversity , and we have to find a lifetime in a pluralistic and multicultural lifestyle and multiple muralistic reveal lies in a pluralistic world in a
where the wisdom of all the people can contribute to our well-being .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope to requires some of the things that I &apos;ve heard and evidence , in cast not notice .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the official dogma . &quot;
Dogm um dogm ?
The Dogma um of all the Western society of all Western society : &quot; If we want to male the well-being of the well-being of our citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; The way to do it is to male the individual freedom . &quot;
The reason , from one hand , in fact that the freedom is in itself a value , is the value , useful , for human beings .
An the other is that if we &apos;re free , each of us can act to do everything that massive to do everything that massive our well-being , no one that decided to name our well-being , no one that decided to name .
The way to male freedom is to move choice .
More people have more choices , more free , and greater is their liberation , greater is their well-being .
This , I think , is so deeply radical in the society that nobody would drew metters in the society that no one will be able to doubt .
And it &apos;s also deeply radical in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m allowed a simple note on the conditions .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without content , and no content , and the 12 acties of oil and 12 acets that you can buy for you a huge number of conditions that you can buy for a huge number of conductioning is to you have your degree .
That &apos;s the supermarket .
Then you go to the store of electronic to buy a stereo : case , CD , radio , radio , radio , radio , radio , radio , radio , amplifier .
And in this single negotial negotious , there &apos;s a big number of audience .
We can do six million different and a half million different combinations using the components that there are only a negotiation .
You have to admit that there &apos;s a lot of choices .
Although the fields : the world of communications .
Once I was a child , you could get all the services of all the services were short , at the basic mom , Bell .
He was born the phone , didn &apos;t bought it .
One of that one of that , by the way , was the phone would never reach .
These temples have gone .
We have now a quick nearly illimited of phones , especially between cellphone .
Here &apos;s the cell phone of the future .
My favorite is the in the middle , MP3 , cut it &apos;s cut , and it forts for the cross-cut me .
If you don &apos;t have seen it in the house , you &apos;re going to get you in the house , you &apos;re going to get .
And what &apos;s the end is that the people come into the needs and asked this question . And you know what the answer ? The answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much things .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the buddies , you look at the same plosion of choices .
Assistence : Dr. doesn &apos;t happen in the United States that you go to the doctor and the doctor and the doctor what you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do it , or B , &quot; At , &quot; Bog &quot; &quot; To has these benefits . &quot;
You say , &quot; Doctor , what should I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; At has these benefits , and the risks , and the risks . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebats , &quot; Doctor was me , what would ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result we call it &quot; autonomy of the malseeing , &quot; expression that makes it look like a good thing .
But it &apos;s actually not that one marrow the weight and responsibility to make decisions from somebody knows something , which is the doctor , someone else knows nothing -- and most of course , it &apos;s not in the ideal condition to make decisions to make real decisions the patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing products , direct to people like me and you , who if you think about it doesn &apos;t have any sense , because we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why can you get them ?
The answer is that they want that domactor , we call the doctor to change it .
Something that fundamental as our identity is now a question of choice , as you see in this vision in this jump . &quot; We don &apos;t want to provide children . They will choose their sex right now at the right now at the right now . &quot; We have to invent . We have to invent .
And we can reinvent us how many times we can get us .
The means that every morning , to be risk , you have to decide that kind of person want to be .
I &apos;m pushing the family and marriage , a common perspective , sure that &apos;s almost for anyone , was that there was the most soon as possible , and he started to get to children the most soon as possible .
The only choice was with who , not even when , and not even what to do after .
Egyday , it &apos;s really to play .
I teach a very intelligent students , and I do their 20 percent work with a time .
And not because they &apos;re not smart , because they &apos;re not not not because they &apos;re not not smart .
because I &apos;m impensierititital , I mean , &quot; I should you do it ? &quot;
&quot; Do I must must go more ? I have to think before children or career ? &quot;
They &apos;re slogoranananants .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this implement doesn &apos;t completing the compassionate and get not a beautiful vooting to my exame .
And they have to do it . They &apos;re really important questions .
Now , the job : we &apos;re lucky , like Carl underneath , because the technology allows us to work every day , every single angle of the planet , except from Hotel Randolph .
In the parentestrian , there &apos;s a angle , and I &apos;m not going to say anybody , where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t say it , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , this incredible freedom of choice that we have to continue to work ? Is it continually in every moment , if we have to work or not .
We can go to the son of a slump , with the cell phone in a tank , the Blackberry , the Blackberry , the kilry , on the ginocknake .
And even if they &apos;re all spended , every minute that we see our son , we also see our son , we also asking , we also asking this named ? &quot;
&quot; I have I answer to this email ? I have to watch this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is no , it makes the experience of the partnership of your son &apos;s several of your son .
So , what we look at , little things , small and big , materials and objects and life , the lifetime is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : Oval , there were some possibilities , but it was not a question of choice .
The world &apos;s today &apos;s a such thing : The dilemma is , &quot; Is it &apos;s a positive thing ? &quot;
The answer is Some .
We all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about negative ones .
And all this choice is two effects of negative effects on people .
The first one , paradoximum is that it &apos;s produced paralysis that liberation .
And so many options that are going to choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I offer you an example , a meaning example : a study of volunteer .
A colleague has access to the data of Vanhealing , the gigantic society , with about a million of climents in 2,000 different companies .
What she found out is that for every 10 solutions that &apos;s offered , the percentage of adesion , the percentage of adjusts .
With 50 sources , there &apos;s 10 percent in under adhesions , when they &apos;re available only . Why ?
Because with 50 sources that pick up , and it &apos;s directly hard to decide , and the choice is returned to decide , and choice comes back to the indomances .
And domorange , tomorrow , tomorrow , domanants , domorous , and of course tomorrow , domances , domorders , tomorrow , tomorrow , domanants , domorangances , domorange , and of course tomorrow , tomorrow , toms , domants and doman
You know , it doesn &apos;t just mean that these workers will eat for dogs because they don &apos;t have enough money , it also means that the decision is so obstic that they also lose the decision is so obstic that they also lose the fundamental fundamental of the work .
Not to participating , they &apos;re losing to five dollars per year from the work , which would be willing to be willing .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too much choices .
And I think that makes the world like this .
&quot; And finally , for the eternity : ketchup , or maybe it ? &quot;
You &apos;d like to be right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the sourd , and nepure the wrong conducted .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can avoid paralysis , and we finally are less satifying out of the result of how we would be with less options .
And that &apos;s why for several reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of conditions that you choose , if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , is easy to imagine that you could have to make a different choice that would have been better . And what &apos;s going on is that the alternative imagined us , and the replant replaced replaced by the decision of the cyoung , and the replant repiece of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision , and the replaced by the decision ,
even when it was a good decision .
More choices there are more easy to displease anybody who said it &apos;s insoddle that is insod-option .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has clear very well practices like the value we have to depend things on what we confrontier is .
For rest , when there are many options , it &apos;s easily representing the tools of alternative alternative scarten and be less satisfying than the option that &apos;s choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m sorry with all those who are not New York .
But that &apos;s what you would probably think .
There &apos;s this copy at Hamptons .
A place of luxury .
It &apos;s all of them . Ottype . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not nothing . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , maledition , is August . &quot;
&quot; All my neighbors are away . &quot;
&quot; I could talk right in front home . &quot;
And he &apos;s going to go in two weeks that &apos;s losing -- every day -- every day -- the chance of parking where it wants .
The cost-opportunity become the soddg-suddenly thing that we have , even when the choice was eccellent .
And the more of the options that we have to consider , more the features that we &apos;re going to return up against the opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This vision tells us a lot of things .
We &apos;re talking about the time , and maybe slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you choose , you &apos;re choices , you &apos;re not doing other .
The things we don &apos;t choose have a lot of attractive attractive that can make less attractive equally what we do .
Third point : spiral growth of the expectations .
I tried it on my skin bought a new jeans .
I &apos;m going to reach to jeans .
Once the jeans were one kind of a , compressed them and wearing , were swearing , were comfortable , were squeeered , just after they were , they began to go .
So I went to buy a couple of them , when the old ones were gone , and said , &quot; I need a couple jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
The common said , &quot; Wave them slim , easy phit , easy , relaxphit ? &quot;
She wants to him , or with the grandchildren ? &quot; Stonewashed &quot; or &quot; acidwashed &quot; ?
&quot; Would you have straped ? &quot;
&quot; Sight of them , or stretched ? Bot bla -- &quot; Sinured to elency .
I was sballowing , and after a while I could say , &quot; I want the guy that was the only guy , &quot; He didn &apos;t have idea what it was , so for a hour of sticks , and then I tried to be hordered , I was sure , I walked ,
It was the very choice . I had all that choice had the best .
But I was hearing worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice my expectations were altired , the jeans had to be perfect .
I had a minime of minime . I didn &apos;t expectations of it when there was only a kind of thing , but when I saw 100 different steps , hundred of , under a kind of must be perfect .
What I had been a good time , but not perfect .
After a paragoned choiced choose to what I was in the expectations .
The addition of the people don &apos;t do that they can increase the expectations that these have been the options that have the options that are .
And this will produce less satisfdisphation , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the marketing world if it &apos;s makes it .
Because if they knew , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth of this .
&quot; You had better when it was worse when it was worse , &quot; The reason that was better when it was worse , it was that when it was worse .
Ogyday , the world that we live -- opulents , industrialized citizens with the perfection of the perfection -- the most of things that we can hope is that the things are in the heighbors .
You never surprised because your expectations , your expectations , my expectations , they &apos;re injected .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Basse expectations , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , you want . &quot;
I mean , little autobiographic moment -- which I &apos;m actually moving and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn &apos;t have done , I didn &apos;t have to be , I didn &apos;t have to be .
But it &apos;s not always a good thing .
And then , a consequence of buy a couple of jeans switing when there &apos;s only that when you &apos;re not satisfied , and ask you , you say , &quot; Why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot; The answer is clear .
The world is the responsible . What could I do you ?
When there are hundreds of types , and you buy a insod-, and you ask who is the responsible , it &apos;s just as clear that the responsible , it &apos;s just like the responsible , you &apos;re just like the responsible , you &apos;re going to .
You &apos;d have done better .
With hundreds of dispon-to-variety , there are no excuse .
So when people are decisions , even if the result is valid , they feel unsatisfying and they give them them them .
In the last years , the depression is exploss in the industrialized world .
I think a meaninger , but I think , not the only one , but this is a very important -- of this depression of depression is just that people have experiences of the standard because the standard is too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that the cholas is them .
So the final result is that in general , we &apos;re better , but we feel worse .
Let me reminds you .
This is the official dogm , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely false . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than there is not a lot of choices , but it doesn &apos;t have any of it .
There &apos;s a critical value , I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure that we &apos;ve been overlapping from a piece that choices improvement our life .
Now , from the political point -- I have almost finished -- from the policy point of view , the nocle is the following .
What &apos;s allows in the industrial society is the material wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know , the problem is not that they have too much choices .
The problem is that they have too little .
So the factory that I &apos;m talking about is a malbe malbeing malbeing malbeing malesclusive .
And what it does deprove and arrator is this : Steve Levitt has talked to you how those expensive and saddress for wheat for wheat is useful . It &apos;s a waste of money .
I mean , these things , complicated and dispendious , it &apos;s not that they &apos;re useful .
They &apos;re going to be deleteries .
They &apos;re doing worse .
If a little bit of what we society allows , it was reversed in those where people have too few possibilities , it would not be just their life to be better , not just their life .
This is what economists call a improvement improvement .
A redistribution reduction is good at all -- not only the poor -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in except that comes up .
To conclude , you can be all of the things you want to be what you want &quot; --
You , people , you think , &quot; What does that believe that weighs ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t get anything in a glass of glass . &quot;
&quot; An ination , a limited vision of the world -- &quot;
and I interpret it this , at the beginning .
But then , I realized that , I realized that that fish the length knows the long .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you mand in the boke , so that &quot; everything you can &apos;t be , &quot; you can &apos;t get the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you reach the mouths in a way that all beautiful decrease .
Accentuate the paralysis , and you reduck the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly shake , perhaps even weighs , and of course for us .
But the absence of some of symbolic symbolic and , I &apos;m teme , for the roven .
Thank you very heart .
