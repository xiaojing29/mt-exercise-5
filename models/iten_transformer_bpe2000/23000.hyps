The year I showed these slide to demonstrate that the calculus is arctic artics , which for almost three million years has had the size of 48 percent .
But this is , this is the gravity of the problem because not shows the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice .
The artic heat is artic glacial is , in a sense , the heart heart heart heart of the global climate system .
It &apos;s winter inside and it &apos;s ritira .
The next slide is going to be a remarkable rapid in the last 25 years .
The ice loss are signed in red .
As you see , they expand until the blue .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter , which is the grimp .
You can see that the ice cosidly , of five years or more , it &apos;s like the blood , which is like the blood , which here five years from the body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been so .
This is a problem because the interested in the entire terrain the artage of the artic artic amp , where there are huge amount of conged , which , science , they &apos;re transformed in metane from the microbes .
The totality of the totality of the atmospheric inquent of global warming , that amount may radinate , supersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersuper-hythree-scale , supersupersuper-hythree-like ,
In some lagherself , in Alaska , the methane is already rebecting from the water .
The professor Katey Walter University of Alaska has received team with a team in the last last last last last .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : She &apos;s good . The question is if we will be .
A reason is that this termal termine scale the Greenland from north .
This is a glacial figures .
The brought didn &apos;t reach to swasn &apos;t reaching .
This is the Kangerlush &apos;s Kangerlush , in the southwest of Greenland .
If you want to know how the sal level to the sea slip to the sea of the ice of the ice of the ice , here is where it reaches the sea .
These running are increasing rapidly .
At the other part of the planet : Antartide , the largest block of the planet .
The month scientists have diclear that the ice of the ice of ice is in the negative , and the Antarctis in the negative , which is about some islands , which is particularly rapid , is particularly rapid .
Equives at six feet of the action of the action of the action of the action .
Sull Himalaya , the third largest block , you see new laghands , which a few years ago , that a few years ago , they were glacker .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population is going to be half of the powerful water from that slights .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the power of the power of the power of the power of this city .
The brought is increased .
But when you say , the same happens to be able water .
In California , the snow on Sierra is 40 percent of 40 percent .
The backins are in crises .
The predictions , as you &apos;ve read , are graves .
The growth sure growth in the world takes a remarkable increasing .
The environmental disasters are increasing a rhythm and without precedented .
Four times more numerous in the last 30 years , I read for 75 .
This is a whole thing about all sustainable .
If you look at it in the context historic context , if they can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we &apos;ve added 70s , 25 million tons of CO2 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean in the ocean every day .
Look at the time , the area of the oriental Pacific Pacific , to the American , and on both the subcontinent , where there &apos;s a radical impairly impoveriment in the oceans .
Most because of the global warming , together to deforestation , which is the 20 percent , is the use of fossil of the fossil of fossil .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States are one of the two more emissions , together at China .
And he was proposed to build a lot of other carbon .
But we &apos;re asking to a change of direction .
These are the projects in the last few years and some of the alternative alternative .
At every way , there &apos;s a politics in our country .
The carbon industries and the oil industries have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting the carbon , which is a hosymle .
That image I remember something --
Very Natal , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion paper of carbon paper .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen on the news .
This is the second largest flow in America .
It happened to Natal .
The nature published in one of the carbon industries was this .
Video : The paper is the carbon is a kind of alligro and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it &apos;s going to grow our economy .
Fross the carbon is more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more clean .
It &apos;s good precise , adorable and the work is supposed to be stipendent .
Al Gore : Da here &apos;s a lot of the West Virginia .
The largest society in the mountain minary mountain is Massey Coal .
Video : Don Blankenship : I &apos;m going to be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Peloss , Harry Reid -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clim of Clima has two campaiged .
This is one of them , one of them .
Video : Ator : At the COALergy see the climate change as a serious serious mine in our business .
So , our prioritizens is to invest a great amount of money in a published and advertising the truth .
In fact , the carbon isn &apos;t spork .
We think it &apos;s clean -- it also has a good profuman .
So , you don &apos;t preocratic change .
Let me do with us .
Video : Ator : Ator : You &apos;ve heard about it .
So let &apos;s do a game in a structure in a structure at the paper .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little humor , but this is the sound of the paper technology .
The carbon consumption is between the major causals of global warming , but the remarkable technology , but the remarkable technology ,
Take a look , this is the clean of the carbon technology of the carbon clean .
At Gore : Inally , the positive positive alternative , the positive national security .
Video : Surn : America is in crisure ; the economy , the national security , national crisafety .
The philos that the broken that the broke of fossil dependence from fossil , like the heads and the oil and the oil oil .
Now , it &apos;s a new , audace solution for using circumstums .
Really America : 100 percent of the cleaning energy , in 10 years .
A plan to repect America to make sure more safety , and help to stop the global warming .
Finally , one solution that &apos;s going to solve our problems .
Really America . Scover more .
Al Gore : That &apos;s the last .
Video : Smince of energy to America .
One of the fastest ways to get to the bustible dependence from the combustible that killed our planet .
She said , the future is here . I mean , one new energy .
It &apos;s going to be two : Novi investment for a post-home jobs .
Steam : Shert America . It &apos;s time to be realists .
At Gore : A old old old African is a proverwhelming , you go to fast , you go to the sunlight , you go on .
If you want to go away , you go back to the way . &quot;
We need to go away , we have to go away , quick .
Thank you very much .
The year at TED I did a 100-day in the LHC .
And I was going to return to travel you about how the machine .
So here . And so , there was no , the LHC is , the LHC is the largest experiment that was the largest experiment -- 27 miles of circumstence .
His compiece is to rerequired conditions that were present less than a billion second from the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
And all of this is just environment .
This is the car underlying the car is under Ginevent .
We picture these mini-Big Bang in the resevators .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLATLAS -- it &apos;s a 44 meters , and it has a 22 feet .
This is a spectacular image of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions .
Ten in 10 years of the last year we have access to the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was causing of immense facts in control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first phask of the first of LHC , and it was going to collision , with a part of the LHC , and it &apos;s a part of the LHC , and it &apos;s spread in the resior .
In other words , when we see that image 10 , we realized that the car was a great vitter , we realized that the machine was a great vitting .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to do us exultar , when somebody went on Google and saw that the initial page was this .
That means we &apos;ve had a cultural impact over to the scientific impact .
And it &apos;s a week after , there was a problem with the machine , and it had to these phils here -- these dorders .
These are taking 13,000 ads , when the car works the machine works at the high of power .
Now , the technical technical is going to look at the phils and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . &quot;
And they can do it because when they &apos;re very cold , they get the surface , they &apos;re very cold .
So , at least 271 degrees , at a temperature in the space , these phils between the stars , these phils can bring that race .
In one of the younger of the younger in LHC , there was a fect of fabication .
So the phils slightly , and the 13,000 advanced , and the 13,000 ampounds improvised a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think these magnets are more than 20 tons , and that &apos;s moving more than 20 tons .
They are damed about 50 magnets .
We had to take them , what we did .
We repristinted and traveled .
Now they &apos;re returning all their sub-place .
By the end of marzo LHC is is going to be again .
We &apos;re going to happen , and we expect to get the data or light , and then we &apos;re going to get our adventure to find out what the morning is going to be able to find out what the universe is .
Now , of course , in a square of the way , these crashing the value of science and engineering in frontier of science and engineering .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that I think is the value , I think that &apos;s the value of things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of a Inglese scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , imagine , in the inuseful defense experiments of his pupillo , his pullo , his pullo , he said , &quot; Nothing is so dangable to the progress of the human mind as the rest of the human mind as the rest of the human mind of the human mind that the ideas of the science of the human mind of conquenters , that our tries that are conququires that our new words .
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to rethink about when , from kids , you played , you played with the morning .
While you reach them and relationship them , and take them and get them and move them , learned , and you know , you actually learned about and resolving problems and manipulating relationship to space .
The space is deeply deply is connected to the way we understand the most of the world intorn world around us .
So , from the information , from the usual usual objects of our interaction with physicists , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to ask me , &quot; And if we use a wonderful computer , when we use a digital computer , we could have the only digital computer , we could have the digital information with digital information with a desktop with the mans , we could have a desktop with the manior ,
and systemate it to our placement ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , and build the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer interactive computers like a biscoom .
In a few words , a Siftable computer interactive computers like a biscoom .
You can move them with the hand , they can see , &quot; you can see , &quot; between them , you &apos;re going to be a screen and a radio and a radio .
But above , they &apos;re physicists , like morning , as the morning , they can move them .
The Siftable is an example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physical , you know , of the other people , and they become more physical , and they become more physical , of the other , how we can explore new and the other , how we can explore new and the whole fun of interaction .
I &apos;m going to start with a few simple example .
This is Siftable is configurated to show video : if you incline in a direction , video will rotate it , if I encline from the other back back back .
These interactive realized , are consciousness .
If you go , you know , they &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re going around .
If they come circumstates , they can be standing it up .
If they come circumstates , they can be standing it up .
They also have their movement and inclination .
And then I realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power to use a liquid , &quot; a color like a liquid as if it &apos;s a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable , as a century who &apos;s a hundred of the versity in the central , where they measure .
And I can use them to be able to be able to be able , where they misk .
If we &apos;re too much , we can put a little place .
I also beautiful chance to learn , as languages , mathematics and games of logic , where people can try to try the fast things , and see the results of the results of the immediately .
Now , I &apos;m --
This is a sequence of Fibonaces that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a game of words that &apos;s half between Spapabeo and Boble .
Pratically , every turn on every turn in the case of a letter on every Siftable , in any Siftable , at any turn on every Siftable on every Siftable on every Siftable .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new sletters and new possibilities to try and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the kids came up to the Media Lab , I did in a way that they were trying to put them and video .
They are very placeased .
And one of the interesting things of this app is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of education .
You just say , &quot; Let &apos;s say , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s what other people who try it .
This is our younger biggest , there &apos;s the right there .
It was actually just implement to implement them .
They were only morning morning , for him .
Now , this is an application of an interactive cardboard .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of languages . He &apos;s Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , solving Siftable .
It can put new characters in the scene , solving Siftable .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : The sun is spring .
David Merrill : Now he brought a treatment in the scene .
Video : The arange treatment .
Books !
So schooling the Siftable and put them close to interact the personally --
Video : Bau !
Take your story .
Video : His !
DM : It &apos;s a story with the open , and it can decide him as you &apos;re going to be .
DM : It &apos;s a story with the open , and it can decide him as you &apos;re going to be .
Volice : Volice : Yeah , right .
DM : The last example I have the time to show you is a tool , realized recently , to wait and exequiet music .
it &apos;s a tool , realized by recently , to wait and exeguide music .
The Siftable here is sound , base and battery .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose what use .
You can also put these sounds in a sequence of the sound in a sequence of comport .
And modifiing it &apos;s just doing it to touch a &quot; and a &quot; sequence . &quot;
These are effects that you can control from the vive , like the reverse and the filter .
The one in a particular sound and then inclines to be in the way .
And then there are the general effects like time and fly , which are the whole sequence .
Let &apos;s look like that .
Video : We &apos;re going to start put a base in two Siftable , &quot; sequence , &quot; sequence , we &apos;re doing the systems , we extended to be base .
Now , I put a basis line .
Video : Now I add to the percussions --
Video : And I &apos;m going to put the bacteria , so I can control the effect of the vive .
Video : I can speed the whole sequence , I can speed the whole sequence of time from one or another .
Video : And I &apos;m going to add the basic philer to just get more expression .
Video : DM : I can reombing the sequence &quot; to fly . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to planning it before , but I can suddenly , it &apos;s going to be a long time or more cording .
And now , finally , I can smoke the whole sequence inking left the whole sequence , I can smoke up the Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new man &apos;s all the time more like the brain and more like the brain and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the results of this percorse , and also some possibilities that we &apos;re trying to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmitting you is that &apos;s coming to this new generation of designed objects to interact with digital media media , that will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the hour to talk to all of you .
I &apos;m a written .
Book is my profession , it &apos;s my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , obviously .
It &apos;s also the love and the fass of my life .
And I don &apos;t expect that it can change .
But , said , something particular has happened by my life and my career , and in my career , which brought me to report the whole report with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently written this book , this biography called &quot; Manway , which , of course , from my previously , for some reason in the world and become a great , for some reason in the world and become a great sensitive , became a whole , bestseller , untiseller , untiseller ,
And the result is that everywhere now , people treat me as if they were condants ,
Davigate -- condanned , condanned !
They &apos;re all going to be worried and they say , &quot; Don &apos;t you fear that you can &apos;t do you have to do better than doing better ?
You don &apos;t have to continue to continue to writing all of life without able to create a book that can important to someone ? &quot;
What can you important to somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s rasses , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a written .
I met the same reaction , I met the same reaction .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t I &apos;m going to have successful ?
Does you have no fear that the billion refected you ?
You have no fear of doing this all all of life without any living without any infrankers and die on a smoke of all infrankers with the mouth of food ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
Yeah , I have lots of all those things .
I &apos;ve had always had a couple .
And I have a lot of other things that people might not have to inate .
As the algae and other things .
But , as I think about the write what I thought and I was going to be type is , why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logic that anybody who have been waiting to be spavented by a work that you feel under to do .
But what is so particular in the creative creative creative to make us nervous health , or in a way that other charge don &apos;t do ?
As my father , for example , he was a chemist and I don &apos;t remember of one once in its 40 years of activity in its 40 years of activity in the slands ?
There was never -- that was that , that was in the engineer John , how does it do ?
Does &apos;t work like that , understanding that ?
Onestly , the chemicals have not certainly , in the centuries , in the secreputation of being already depressive depressive manized manized manized manized .
We have enough , we have enough this reputation , and not only writers , but creative of all gender , we have this reputation of being enormous instable .
And it &apos;s not going to look at the trists of the magnifices of magnific ments that only creative ments in the 21st century , they die of young people and often for them .
And also the ones that are suicidated to be really disgued by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before I die , in the last interview said , &quot; Every my book killed a little bit more . &quot; A extraordinary death is a little bit more .
But we don &apos;t bad when we heard these things , because we &apos;ve heard these things that we &apos;ve completely interior , we &apos;ve completely interior and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering to some way and you reach it , at the end .
And the question I want to bring all over today is : are you agree with this idea ?
And it &apos;s going to you this thing -- because it &apos;s looking at a distance , it &apos;s not good for anything this supposposition .
I think it &apos;s odiosa .
And I think it &apos;s also periculous , and I don &apos;t want to see it perpetured in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our big creative minds to live .
And I know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start fuging to be suppositions , on the host hurt , but involved in my career .
That &apos;s a look , right -- look , I &apos;m rather young , I have about 40 years .
I have still about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything about it , and then it will be judged by the world as the work that &apos;s after the work that I did after the switch .
I &apos;m going to be sliced , because we &apos;re all over the most or less friends here -- likely , my biggest successes .
Oh , Gesus , which think .
You know , this is the gender thinking that &apos;s a person to start to start bing a person to start bing home in the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would keep going to keep doing this work that we do .
So , the question is becomes , how ?
And so it looks like , after a lot of reflective reflective , which is to create a psychological constraints , okay ?
I have to find a few way to find a security distance between me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxium about what reaction can . And while I was trying to do it . And while I was trying to look at the time , trying to find out of time , trying to find out of the best ideas to see if they could have better ideas more as more society to see if they could have the best ideas and more healthy . And as I &apos;m trying to do it , and I &apos;m trying to writing the best ided . And as to have better ideas
how to help people creative to deal with the emotional inerent inerent the emotional inerent inerent .
And that research has taken me to the ancient Grex and ancient Rome .
I sept because I gave me in a circle and then go back .
In the ancient Grex and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that the creativity is from men , OK ?
It was thinking that creativity was this spirit of divine and they were being being in the men from a few distant and unknown , for the distant and unknown , for the distant and healthy .
The grew of these beyond these spirits of the creativity of the creativity &quot; .
Socrate , wonderful , creded a demone that was a demic that was wisdom wisdom .
The Romans were the same idea , but they call that kind of spirit without body body genius .
The one is great , because Romans didn &apos;t really think that a genius was someone particularly intelligent .
They have a genius was this kind of kind of divine that you &apos;ve got to be literally in the walls of a artist , a little bit like Dobby , and that was like Dobby , and that was out of the hidden artist and model out of the work of that work .
Here &apos;s the way -- that &apos;s the distance of what I talk -- that &apos;s the distance of what I &apos;m talking about -- that &apos;s the psychological costrucks that you have to the result of your work .
And they all knew that was so that it was going , right ?
So , antice artists were protected by certain things , like the too much narcism , no ?
If your work was exciting work was exciting you could not take all the market , everybody knew that you were helped by this incorporate genius .
If your work , it was not all all the way , it wasn &apos;t all the right ?
They all knew that was your genius to be an inable .
And so people have concept to make the creativity in Occidest for a long time .
And then the Renasent came and everything changed , and all changed , and we put the human being at the mistake in the universe , and we put the human universe , and no more likely to leave the creatures and the more space to the creatures .
This was the rational principle of the rational humanism and people started thinking that creativity was completely from the hyoung dividary .
And for the first time in history , you started to refer to this or the artist as a rather than one person with genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big herror .
I think it allows someone , a simple person to believe that you &apos;re like a recipient , the essence and the source of all the mysters , creative , creative , unknown and the ourselves and the source the psyched of the psychches that human fragile to be .
It &apos;s like to ask someone to ingoes the sun .
Deform and completely creates the ego and creates all these expectations on performance .
And I think it was this pression to have destroyed artists in the past 500 years .
And , if that &apos;s that &apos;s true , and I think it &apos;s , the question is , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe you get back to a understanding more than the relationship between humans and creative .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t sing 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people between the audience who would have solled scientific systems on the notion of the notion of the notion , you do that they &apos;re going to be in their projects .
I &apos;m not going to convince you all about this .
But the question I &apos;d like to ask is -- why not ?
Why don &apos;t you think that way ?
Because it has more sense of all the other thing that I &apos;ve ever heard to explain the exasperant exasperant of the process of creative process .
A process that , as anyone who I &apos;ve ever been trying to do something -- so , basically , all of the way , you know , you don &apos;t comport rationally .
And in fact , it can sometimes look completely paranormal .
I did this met recently control with the extraordinary poetame Ruth Stone , who now 90s , but it was a few of all life and said that she was a few of the lives in the camps , and he was going to work out of the Virginia , and he was hearing it , in the driving of the country came from the landscape .
He said that it was like a fragorous air .
And he was coming up to her on her landscape .
He was going to hear it , because he was tremendous under his feet .
She knew to have one thing to do at that point and it was , words , and it was to run as a math . &quot;
And so it was correct to home and it was followed by this poetry , and it wouldn &apos;t have to get a piece of card and a faster faster , while he was going to collect it on the page .
She couldn &apos;t be fast enough , so correct and correct and correct correct and correct the poem and the poetry and the poetry and the lost wites and he would continued to rolthrough the landing , trying to do one poet . &quot;
Then there were times -- this is I &apos;m going to never sit -- there were the moments that &apos;s almost perfect , OK ?
So , it was running home and was trying to card and the poetry to card and the poetry to be a math in the way that he was going , and then he said , that was like you &apos;re going to hold with the other hand and the hand and the hand-hand-hand-hand the hunged .
He was going to cut the poem and repage it in his body and put it in the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on perfect page and intately , but the contrary at the top .
So when I heard it &apos;s a crazy , it &apos;s exactly the same thing to my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conducture .
I &apos;m a move , and my way to work is ; I &apos;m going to wake up with the same horary every day and you &apos;re going to work and go on and go on on on .
But even , in my test , in my test test , I striped against that thing , sometimes .
And I &apos;m going to imagine that many of you in the han done .
You know , even if the work and ideas came up with a certain source , I could not be able to know .
And what is this ?
And how can we relate to the head , but rather , rather , but rather , rather , rather , what do you get healthy ?
For how much I remember , the best example I have is the musician musician musician musician musician , which I interview of several years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of the life has been the incarnation of the artist &apos;s artist , trying to control , trying to control , to deal with these species of impulses of the impulses of the totally interior .
But then he invested , and he was driving , and one day , and he was driving on a &quot; highway in Los Angeles , changed everything .
He was going to go quick and all of a sent sent , this little sent broom , which is coming into its head like ispiration , and the head , and the allows , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the desiderve , but not as you can take it .
It &apos;s not a card , it doesn &apos;t have a math , it doesn &apos;t have a math record .
So he &apos;s starting to feel this species of old old anxized , &quot; the sessentially to lose , and I &apos;ll stay obsessed by this personal song .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to go to the panic , it stopped .
And I &apos;m going to stay up the whole process and did something completely new .
And I &apos;m going to just the sky and said , &quot; Scause , not see what I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you have a song now ?
If you really want to exist , you get to a more standing when I can take care of you .
Although , you &apos;re going to important something else today .
You &apos;re going to be Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his work worked changed , and he changed after this .
Not work , the work was still hoscure .
But the process , and the anean any thing was reeded when I prese the genius , the genius that was going to be able to do anything else and libering it back from where they came out of , realizing that didn &apos;t have to be an interior and gained it .
but I &apos;m going to have this peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and and this external thing that it &apos;s not Tom .
So , how much I felt that story started changing a little bit , the way I was working and I &apos;d already once I was working and save me once .
This idea , he saved when I was write when I was writing , &quot; Manway , and the fall in one of those deppped in which we &apos;re all working on something and we &apos;re all working on something and we can &apos;t think that it &apos;s a disaster , which is the worst book , which is the worst book is the worst book .
Not just book , the worst book wrote .
And I started thinking about to think about this project .
But I remember of Tom who talked to the air and I tried to the air and I tried to the air and I tried to the air and I tried to the air and I tried to the air and I tried to the air and I tried to the air and I tried to the air and I tried to the air and I tried to the air and I tried to the air and try .
So I went up my face and I went up to my face and I got my bad corner and I got my comments to a hand-hangle .
And I said , &quot; Sent , what we &apos;re going to both , what we &apos;re going to be smart , it &apos;s not going to be short , it &apos;s not going to be bright ?
Because as I see here , I &apos;m going to put everything everything I have , not more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to present you and do your part .
Okay . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , I don &apos;t do anything .
I &apos;m going to go to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I want to do for favor that was recorded to do my part , &quot; because it &apos;s like , &quot; Because , the end is so , OK -- in the deserts of Africa in North Africa , the people would sk to the challenge of the slanding of the slanding of the slanding of the saving of hours and until hours .
And they were always magnific , because the baleres were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every once , it was going to be , and one of these artists , and one of these artists ,
And I know you know what I &apos;m going to talk , because I know you &apos;ve all seen , a performance like that .
It was like the time you stop , and the ballerine walked through a kind of bringal and wasn &apos;t doing anything about it , like 1,000 night before , but it &apos;s all halls .
And I suddenly don &apos;t just like a human .
But it happens from the didriver and under the divinity .
And when this was happening , to the time , people knew what was , they were called it with her name .
They were conged to sing the hands and started sing , &quot; Allah , Allah , God , Allah , God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curious storic -- when the Ments invased Spain , they took this habits of Spain , I got this habits with them and pronounded changed in the centuries of the Allah , Allalah , Allalah , Allah , Ellah , &quot; the workers in flamening in flamening .
In Spain , when an artist has done something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , magnificent , the Allah , magnifictional , &quot; I &apos;m going to be -- one scoring , it &apos;s a scoring of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem is coming up the day , for the same , when you see it and you see that are the 11 in the morning of Martedested in the morning of Martedested in God . There &apos;s no longer .
It &apos;s just a death with a huge bad to ginocky , and maybe not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to ask that altitude .
And maybe no one name of God while you still have to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most sushous recognizing recognizes to make a creative life .
But maybe not to be so angosciant if you can &apos;t believe , anzycle , which extraordinary expect , which extraordinary expect , you know ,
But created just that you have data in the suppose from a unimaginable source of this source of your life you have to go to anything else when you finished anything .
And , you know , if we think about this everything is changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s certainly as I thought about for different months in the book that I &apos;m going to try to published , the perangerous , perangerous , dangerous , very , dangerous successful .
And what I have to keep me when I &apos;m electrized by this is , not having fear .
Don &apos;t bear you . It &apos;s not just your work .
It &apos;s going to present you to present your part , any may be .
If your work is ballown , ball .
If you have the wine , aburd you decided to leave some kind of wonderful kind of wonderful wonderful , for just through your short , so you know , &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Although , you do the same thing .
And I said , &quot; Ole ! &quot;
I think it and I think you have to teach it .
&quot; You know , &quot; at the same time , only for the human had and test love and test tape test tape you &apos;re going to present you continually .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects on human genome , what can meaning and the new discovery of new set of genes .
Now , we &apos;re starting a new corse : we started digitize biology and now starting to digitalize biology , we &apos;re going to be in a new biology , designing and synthesizing and syntize life .
We always tried to take big questions .
What is it ? &quot;
We tried different approach , reducting the minimes .
We &apos;re digitizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequencyed the human genome was treated to go from the analogic world of the digital world &apos;s digital world .
Now , let &apos;s say , we can regenerate life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome , which is the species that can authorary in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a more smaller .
We &apos;re able to eliminate a hundred of genes about 500 that are here .
But when we &apos;re looking at the test metabolic maps , it &apos;s relatively to our .
Credet , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one is very unlikely , that this can take a living cell .
So , we decided that the only to design was synthesize this croma in a way to be able to make components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of the Pan &quot; we can synthesize a croma ? &quot;
Can chemistry to make these big molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create before ?
And in case , we can make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of inert material chemical material .
The speed that we can digitalize life is growing up is growing up to be exponential .
Our capability to write the genetical code , instead , rather , but it &apos;s improving a pretty slowly , but it &apos;s improving .
And our most recent retained the brought to a exponential curve .
We started over over 15 years ago .
The process has required a lot of the past , starting with a bioetics before the first experiments .
But we found that that synthesize DNA is very difficult .
There are decades of thousands of machines in the world that product small sector of 30 to 50 letters and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the more herrors are along , there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these fragments and correcting the herrors .
And this was our first attempt to be our first attempt from the digital information of the genome of Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills .
We have designed the fragments , actually the correction of the errors and get a molecule of DNA about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material chemical material chemical material , the bacteria , the bacteria , the bacteria have started to read this genetic and producing viral particles .
The viral particles have been back from cells , and they &apos;re going back and they destroyed the Even .
I spoke about recently with the oil industry , oil industry , and they have certainly compress this model .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build his same hardware can actually build his own hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the more larger things .
We wanted to build the whole battery of the bacteria .
They &apos;re over 580mile letters of genetic code .
So we thought about building it in the size of the virus of the virus of the virus , so we could change the casses to understand what the components of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate information .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accurateties was a herror for every 10 mile .
We found out , resequencyone-herrors . If we used that original sequence we &apos;ve never been able to do that .
One part of the process is designing sector , 50 letters that they have to have all the other signature with all the other sletters of 50 letters to build smaller subject that working together .
We can see the unique elements here .
You probably have read that we put that we &apos;re going to get a broads .
Think about it : we have a genetical code basic genetics , C , G and T.
Three of those letters together , they care about 20 , and there &apos;s a specific order to each ammine for every letters of letters .
So we can use the genetical code to write words , frasured , senter think .
What we did is that the beginning was autographs .
Some have been deluses from the fact that it wasn &apos;t a few .
We have designed these segments to just help them together with a full full .
There are a enzymes that they reped them and put them up .
And we started to assemble parts , starting with segments from five to seven to seven meet , unendured them in a way to form segments in a way to be in a sletters of them until to 72 mile .
We have produced these segments in the abundance , so we could seat the sequency that we &apos;re trying to create a very robust -- as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems the tabellone of a broke play-basket .
When we get these very long segments , more than 100 mile , more than 100 midle , they &apos;re not going to grow up in E.
It &apos;s coming to the limit of the modern modern molecular biology .
So we &apos;ve been considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called a homologist , which in biology , in biology , which in biology is using DNA degree to help the DNA can actually put the gments .
Here &apos;s an example .
This is organism , called Deinoccurs in the radiodues three million rad rad rad .
You can see in the switch as his perior as his chromosome is destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s been like before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can do completely .
They can live under the vacuum .
They &apos;re absolutely sure that life exists in space , and you move to find new environments of water .
Actually , NASA showed that this is .
This is an image of the molecule we built these processes , just using the lievening the appropriate segments to put out .
The lievening them ables the automatically .
This image was not taken with a electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a tough molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are photograph that they have a period of six seconds .
This is the published that we did a little time ago .
They &apos;re over 580,000 genetic code .
It &apos;s the biggest molecule of a definitely definitely ever created by man .
It has a lot of switching 300 million .
If you &apos;re going to be proud to a 10 without spaces , they would like 142 pays to transcriting this genetic code .
Now , how do we do it work ?
Of course , you know , you &apos;re a virus is a game from kids .
It &apos;s a little more complicated when they use bacteria .
It &apos;s more simplest when it &apos;s cells as well cells as our euclear : you just extract the nucleo and put another , which is pratically the nucleo and seriously , which is the clonely the clonely .
In the archaea , the archaea is integrated integrated by the cells , but we recently demonstrated that we &apos;re able to do a complete traph of a chromosome from one cell to another and activity to another and activating it .
We have a crowned chromosome from a microbial species .
The two are different are as men from the topes .
We &apos;ve added some gene gene gene in a way to decide what he pushing for this croma .
The slights with the funny in a way to kill all proteins .
And when we put it in the cells was study -- and we &apos;re going to appreciate our soops -- the new chromosome is going into the cell .
And so we were thinking that we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried anyway in the way .
This is one of the most evolution .
We found that many of the tants are added a second or third cromosome somewhere , adding in a second thousands of new ones , in a second thousands of new , the species .
So who &apos;s thinking about evolution as just gene as a gene gene has not understand most of biology .
There are a scientist , they &apos;re called the restriction , which is that addiction that addiction DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell of it doesn &apos;t have one .
The cell phone that we have inseritous cellula-shrun .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other croma like the extraneous material , and we found it with only cell , and we found out with only cells and the new chromosome .
it &apos;s became blue because of the genes we &apos;ve been inserted .
And in a short lelassic , all the characteristics of one , they have lost , and it &apos;s transformed all in a new kind of a new kind of software that we inserious in the cell .
All the proteins are changed , membranches are changed , and when we read the genetical code on what we &apos;ve turned you .
Now , this may seem to genetics , but altering the software DNA software we going to change things in a very standing .
Now , I &apos;ve been explained that here is not talking about genesius -- but to be a signature of evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the explosion of the Cambodies that are going to create new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty obvious when we think about our need .
We &apos;re going to spend six billion and a half billion people at nine billion in the next 40 years .
Right to give you an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now , there are three people on the planet for each one in 1946 , in 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find food , fresh water and fresh , medicinal medicinal and gas for six and a half billion people .
It &apos;s still more than it to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion carbon , more than 30 billion barils .
That means millions of barili a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replaced it , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
We have to have to contain all the time , we have the CO2 emission from these materials that ends up in the atmosphere .
At the day today , thank you to the scientific discoveries all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they are the design components for the future .
The electronic industry is only a dozen about components , and you think about how many different things are come out .
Our limits here are principlly data from biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , thank you to these synthesids of synthesization , able to create what we call combinatory .
We &apos;re able to build a big robots that can make a billion cromosomes a million croms a day .
Think of these 20 million genes or to try to get these 20 million different genes or to get the processes to make a type or drugs , we can change , because of a small team , and to create more biology , and create more biology , and we create more more biology , and create more biology .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for the possibilities of survival , chemistry or carbon , chemistry or carbon , production vaccines .
This is an instantly instantly instantly , a few software program that we &apos;re working for being able to seem and design species to computers .
Well , we don &apos;t know necessarily know how they will be .
We know exactly what they &apos;re their genetic code .
Now we &apos;re focusing on the carbon about how much generation .
You &apos;ve seen you who extract ethanol from the grain was a bad experiment .
We have a second and third generation that are going to be able by the sugar to carbon the higher value as the open or different types of butants .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increasing food and limited the cost of food and limiting the availability would be transform CO2 in match , which we &apos;re working to design cell the first , which we &apos;re working to design this , and we could think of the first carbons of how much generation in about 18 months .
The solar solar light , the solar light is a methodoor -- but in our discoveries in the world , we found different metodoor .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , at the deep temperature of the water temperature of the water .
It &apos;s going to be from CO2 using hydrogen molecular as the source of energy .
We &apos;re trying to figure out if we can incanalate CO2 , which can be a type of your bes , converting that CO2 in carburant , to drive this process .
So we think we might be able to be able to increase the way to increase what the question is , &quot; What is life , we have the modest goal -- we have the modest goal to replacing the obic industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can ?
It would be a principal from energy .
And also , we &apos;re working on using the same methods to create vaccines vaccines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with influence , we &apos;re always behind a year and a dollar in less when you &apos;re going to find the right vaccine .
I think that it can change it &apos;s building vaccines in the anticipate .
Here &apos;s how the future could start to change , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating the evolution with synthetic bacteria , and then I was , archaaachievement .
We &apos;re so much like that , we &apos;re going to be the improvide people .
Our purpose is to make a long enough to try to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the most fundamental work , some fundamental work , the new technology that we brought to the Microsoft in the follow-up to a squeet ago .
It &apos;s a environment that you can interact is at the local level that remote with an enormous amount of visual data .
And here we &apos;re seeing a lot of digital photograph , with a kind of digital zoom , and continuous , for a bread speed , depending the images of how we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big big these these data or these these data or the images .
Most people are common photographs , but this is a kind of thing is a provency from Biblioteca standing of the Congress , and reentry in the gama 300 megapiel .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that you represents a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen in any time . It &apos;s also an architecture .
This is a whole book , you know , this is not images .
This is Casolate dest of Dickens . Every colonners represents a capital .
To show you that it &apos;s about textbrown and not images , we can do something like this , to see it &apos;s a real thing , to see it &apos;s a real picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a book ,
I don &apos;t consider it .
This is an realistic example . It &apos;s a number of the Guardian .
Every big image is the beginning of a seem .
And it really gives you the pleasure and beauty experience the chart version cards of a newspaper version of a junky or a lot of a junky .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the Guardian .
We created a fasull in the highest solutions -- much more higher than the way , which is in a published normal contains .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific specific specific .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hopefully that means put in the pop-up and other nurses like the people , they should not be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don &apos;t want to lose time , if we don &apos;t say that we have contributed to be in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States , there &apos;s geospatial imagination of NASA .
So , let &apos;s go to something else .
This is actually actually from the website ; you can go to see it .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which is two different technologies .
A is Seady , and the other is a very interesting research in Noah . In the University of Washington , a student of the University of Washington , with the help of the UW and Rick Seliski &apos;s Microsoft Rick Seliski . It &apos;s a very collaboration .
And it &apos;s from the vive Web , gentleman Seady .
You can see it when we do this , you can see this kind of pattern , where we can spend from one picture and have this kind of experience in the multiply solution .
But the space collocation of the pictures here has actually a meaning .
The signature of the computer visization of the computer recorded these imaging imaging together , so that they &apos;re going to be able to the real way the imaging of the way -- all the close to the Grasks on the Montagne Rockcious Rockcious -- have been taken . And then you see the elements of the elements of a slight-show or of a slikely show .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more space .
I want to go to the directly at one of the original set of Noahes -- and this is from a prototynth of Photosynth of Photosynth , we &apos;ve done the first time , the first time experienced the first time , the surface of the key behind this technology , the key Photosynth . And it &apos;s not so much evident to look at the environments that we &apos;ve put in in the website .
We had to have to worry about the legal and on the slanding .
This is a rebuild of the Cathedral Cauck Dimimage from Flickr . Bauckr Din Flickr and you get images of the type in magic , other field of the fields and on the site and on the watch . Each one of these arancies a picture that &apos;s discovered .
So , I &apos;m all images from Flickr and you &apos;ve been all connected to space .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this way simplicate .
You know , I would never have thought I &apos;d ever thought I was going to work for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratificant to realize this kind of account here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of different types of fote : from those of the cellular phone , the number of the professional phone , in this environment .
And if I can , I try to try to try to try to be more strange .
Many are blocked from faces , etc .
Some some part here is a series of photographs -- etest .
This is a Nothers of Dame &apos;s a correctly correctly .
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the entire collective memory of how to applied the land , from visual point of view -- and the needs all those data together .
All those photograph become linked together , most of the parts .
You have a model of the whole land that emerging .
Think about this as a prolungment of Stephen Lawler &apos;s work on the virtual Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as you have to be doing it , and the adantages that are going to use for the user .
Their pictures are marked with other people .
If someone &apos;s the idea of contrassigning all these several several several , my picture of Nothers of Nothers of Nothers of the data , and I can use as a point of ingress to be inground as in the space , in that middle , in that middle , and I can use the photograph , and have a social experience of the kind of chosses and the nosses and the moil .
Of course , one consequence of all of this is extremely elaborated virtual model of the land , they have not only been from the airplanes and satellitary images and satellitary images , but from holding holding holding .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What your software will contaken us to do is that at a certain point , in the next few years , all the way in the whole world will be practical in the world will be reading together ?
BA : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is , I &apos;m going to find .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the images .
The thing is really interesting is if you think about the wealth of simanti-wish information that many of these images are going on .
As when you do a research on on the web , you get a sentence and the heb on the web page has a lot of information about the picture .
Now , what happens if that picture you connected to all your picture ?
So , the amount of interconnected in the simantity of recheeness that &apos;s really huge . It &apos;s a hugmine is really hugmine .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible .
BA : BA : thank you very much .
One of the main please , when you travels and one of the election of the ethographical research is the power to live between who has not foreign the traditions , the past in the wind , the spring in the wind , the drop , it &apos;s going to be in the leaving plant plant plant , the driver is in the wind of the plants .
Bastes thinking that Jagar Jagar , still the Way Mattea , or that the Milky Way , or that the Inuit are still meaning , or Himalaya , the budddged of Dharm , to remember the importance of Dharm , to remember the importance of the central central ants of the central anthroughout of the world that we live in the living , but it &apos;s just a model , but it &apos;s just a model , but it &apos;s just a model , but it &apos;s just a model of the world &apos;s a model of the way , but just a matter , but it &apos;s a really not just a really not just a model , but model ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stirles has done , well or a bad bad , many generations ago .
And of course , we all share the essential towards .
All we all do . We all procreating .
We &apos;re subjects in the beginning of the beginning .
We have to death the inexorability of death , so it doesn &apos;t take us if we &apos;re canding and ballisten --
We &apos;ve got a art .
What it &apos;s the particular is the particular rate of canone , the dance of all culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that they are the Penan forests of the Borneo or the follow-Voodoo , or the desert Kenya , or the desert Kenya , or the desert of the Kenya , or a camels in the heart of Sahara .
He was my journey was my journey in the desert a month ago , or a hallevator in the values of the Everest , deaths of the world .
All these populations teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of the dies of thinking , other ways of the world .
And , if you reflected a second , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
Insive , the cultures of the world creating a spiritual life spiritual and cultural cultural life that &apos;s important for the planet and it &apos;s important for the planet as biosphere as a biosphere as biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural nature as an ethnosphere and you can call the ethnosphere , the total , all , dreams , hystery , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , holding ideas , as , intuitive ideas .
The ethnosphere is the great patriage of humanity .
It &apos;s the simple symbols of what we can be in how much inquisitive species .
And because the biosphere was fell to ethnight , as it happened to ethnosphere and unfortunately quicker .
No biologist , for instance , it would say that 50 percent of all the species has been on the extinction of the extinction , because it &apos;s falitting in the most apocalitty -- in the most apocalitting in the field of biological diversity -- and you don &apos;t even have the neighborhood in the most untimistic different cultural .
The whole thing is , of course , is , of course , the lost linguistic .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not just a vocabulary or a series of rules or a series of grammmmmmmmmmmmmmmments .
A language is the human spray of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the medium with which animation of every culture is coming into the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a bind , a wind , a piece of spiritual possibility .
And those 6,000 languages , while we &apos;re sitting at Monterey , at least half not sussurrers in the ears of the kids .
They &apos;re not teached to kids , which is not taught , less that you won &apos;t watch something , which are already death .
What is more sad of the being being being happened by the silence , the being the last to talk to a language , not have a way to transmit , not have a way to transmit , or anticipate the promiping of the kids ?
This is a standing is the state of somewhere in the two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks .
And I know someone who &apos;s not better ?
The world would not be better place if we &apos;re going to all the same language ? &quot; We &apos;re all going to all the same language ? &quot; We &apos;re all going to talk about sing .
Let &apos;s talk .
You &apos;ll cover a tract thing to say , not to talk about your language .
Today , I &apos;d like to do you have a journey through ethnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a surface of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , &quot; different ways of existing ways of existing ,
Let &apos;s take for example this Barasana Barasana , in the heads , the popululate , the population of anaconda , which creates the means of being being being from the latest sacred in the watch of sacred sacred .
It &apos;s a population that &apos;s not able color the blue color blue color blue color , because you &apos;re cellent in the forest , which is the population .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rules , deal with language , &quot; Linguistic , &quot; : you have to move a different language .
And all this has radical past mythological past , but particularly the particularly history in which you &apos;re talking or seven lands or seven lands seven , because of the mysts in the mysts .
They limiting to listening and then they start talking .
Let &apos;s take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived , the Waoran Ecuador , an incredible population , an incredible population that has had the first contact in 1958 .
In 1957 , five mesionaries have taken a comfortable contact .
They &apos;ve been able to pick from the photographs that they had been in positive poses that they had been forests , forests , forests , and he had never seen anything about bi-size .
They &apos;ve been taken pictures from the ground , they have been shoulder or a shape , they have concled nothing , they have conclusable to the diot , and they have the five means that they were the five means with the lance .
But Waorans don &apos;t just killed the stranished .
They had to be killed with them .
54 percent of mortality was caused by them .
We &apos;re sitting at eight generations and we found two of the morts and when we &apos;ve been insisted to know , they admit , they admit to be involved , and then they killed it . They had a incredible way , they had a incredible way , they had a incredible way , they had an incredible knowable knowable forest .
The hunters were able to reveal the animal urina from 40 step and reconcerned the species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned a very interesting compiece of my Harvard professor , if I wanted to go to Haiti to intruccraft society in the base of Dualier and Tonton Mosaces , and impossessing me for the basic zombie to the fast the fast of the fast I used to do the slums .
To give a sense to the miraculous , I should have to understand the Vooo culture Vooo and that Vooo culture is not magic .
It &apos;s a very rather than a mea-physics of the world .
Many interesting .
If I asked you to tell me about the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddism , etc , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has no religious feelings . And instead and the Vooo , and the Voot of these very deeper in the slavor of these very deeper in the tragic tragic diaspores of slavavism .
What makes interesting is the intense is the intense report is the intense report of life and death .
So , the vive are going to be able to be .
The spirits can be invoccurred by the Great Acqua , they say to the dance of the dance and they replace temporary at the soul of the vive in the way that for a short way that for a short deal .
So , the voodooists love to say , &quot; You white you go to the wonderful God .
We &apos;re going to start in the temple and becomes God . &quot;
And from the moment that you &apos;re sitting , it &apos;s the spirit that you , how can you do you do the mal ?
So you have to these incredible events : following you to do that voodoo history in the state of the power of the power of the mind of the power of the mind on the body &apos;s mind on the body &apos;s mind when it &apos;s catalyzed in a state of the body &apos;s mind when it &apos;s been catalong in a hestern state .
In all the people with the most extraordinary , which I lived the most extraordinary people are the Kogi in Santa Marta , in Colombia .
It &apos;s going to be the ancivil ancivil ancivil ancivil anization , the population of the Colombia , the population of the vulation , that populated on the vulation that you get on the vulation .
In a drugs continent , this population has never been conquired by the spagners .
But it &apos;s today , they &apos;re government , but their formation is really extraordinary .
The young people are taken from the families to three or four years , and they live secret in a basic world of the bake in a bake world of the bait for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years , in the way to reproduce the nine months of the gestation of the gestation of the mother , now are metaphor in the user of the mother , now , they &apos;re metaphor .
For all this time , they are acculated to the values of their society , values that they prevent their prayers and only their preventing their prayers , or for the cosmic balance .
At termine of this incredible initiation , they &apos;re improving taking out and the first time in their own , at 18 years , and they see a high high . And in that actim of the first best best , when the sun burning ses , all that they &apos;ve learned in theory is conmted in the first burned , all the predict is conmitted in all his splender and says , &quot; beautiful , a past behind a past and says , &quot; Day . The pret a pass a past .
&quot; I &apos;m going to be ? Proprium ?
It &apos;s studies . Now it &apos;s going to protect it . &quot;
They &apos;re called fractops and say that we , fraid , fraid , the miners of the world .
This is extremely important .
When we think of the initioning of initive people , and the old story of the old story of the night of the noble story , which is a razy concept in its simplicity or perhaps we ask Thoreau and say that these are more close to the Earth of us .
Indigenes are not nor feeling feeling from nostalking about nose .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the disease of Are Are or in the gelids of TIbet , but thank thank you to the time and rites , they created a mystic of the Earth &apos;s not about the concept of the maintuition , but on an intuition : the concept that the Earth can only because it &apos;s infected from human consciousness .
What does it mean ?
Vuoice , that a little girls grow up with the mountain is a Prit Apu that will be a deep human beings , which is a depth of human being a deped different , and it will have a fairly different montagger , or that you grow a mountain or that grow a mountain or that a mountain is a mountain , which is a mountain is a mountain .
That &apos;s the demonstrate or a mineral cave is irrievant .
What &apos;s interesting is it is the metaphor that &apos;s the relationship between individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Britannic Columbia creding that forests serve to be cut .
That &apos;s a different human being different from my friends Kwakiutl &apos;s friends that crew the forests are the forests of Huk and the song of the paradise and the song of the paradise , and the song of the paradise in the northern world , the spirites that are in the northern initiation of the Hamatamatsa .
If you start consider that these cultures can actually actually actually have different , you can start to understand some of them , you can start to understand some of their sensitive sensitive .
I took this picture to open in the noroccurred in the noroccurred .
Mayahugly some of you heard about the Ehuash , the most powerful sushuge ssymophugly .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuash is not the pharmacological potential of sustaining , but it &apos;s a two elements .
It &apos;s a hand-hand-bed lights that contains a series of carboline , harmers and harments , harmers and harmed , sleep .
And by making the sun plant plant , you have a bluaser that alterm a little bit the consciousness , but it &apos;s mmeans with the leaves of a house broken ,
This is a triptamines , very similar to serotonin the serotonin the serotonin the mithoxylthoxyltryltrype .
If you never see the Yanomami in the nose , you &apos;ll see the suspity of the sushing of species , which is methoxyltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltrade .
Tiring that policy on the nose is a little bit like being disappeared from a fire purpose fucile and landing on a hand-shape . Really issues the dissolution of the reality .
I was often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who wrote the standing was psychedelivered , with his discovery of the fungi in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in Mexico .
And I mean , my type , you can &apos;t classified these triptames like sallucinogens , because if you &apos;re doing not under any of being killed . She can &apos;t be unable because they &apos;re money because they &apos;re money because they &apos;re money money are money because they &apos;re money for money , they &apos;re deal with a scientist that intest ines .
It &apos;s possible to assumerely only if they make any of the chemicals that money money in the MAO .
Now , the beautiful : the carbon is in this lian inibulate , are the same kind of MAO , the same kind of the MAO , the same kind of a spontaneous , the question : in a fleor of 80,000 species of plants , like these are the people who are inherent two dies , but if you have a biochemistry , but if you have a biochemism that &apos;s a biochemism .
We use the great euphemism of the provide and the error , which can reveals .
But if we ask the Indians are going to tell us , &quot; Phanks are talking about .
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 varieties of the Ehuash , which distinguished in the forest , and our eyes would be in the same species .
If we ask them how they &apos;re going to say , &quot; I thought , &quot; I was going to tell us , &quot; I thought I was going to have a lot of plants , you don &apos;t know everything ? I said , &quot; No .
The solution is : you get 17 varieties in a night of the fills and each one will song with a different .
With this is not lauret in Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting that counting the press .
Now , , the problem is that the problem is that the problem is that even the ones that have the people who have the heart people who have the hundred people , but in a few respect of the history of the history of the history of the history of the real world , and the past .
In fact , the 21st century , between 300 years , it will not remember for its wars or their technological innovations , but rather as we stop and the way we stopped and activally or the passively of the cultural diversity and cultural inches the masses of the planet . Now the problem isn &apos;t changing .
All the cultures have been involved in a dance for new possibilities of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux don &apos;t stop being Sioux when they put up the arch and they have they put up as American , and they have no stopped to be American when they put up in the horse and head .
It &apos;s not change or technology that are not change or the technology that are integrity of ethreatening .
The domination is the domination of domination .
And if you look at the world , you &apos;ll discover that these are not destined cultures are not destined to disappeared .
They are creatures and living dynamics out of the identific forces that go beyond their ability to be adapting .
And it &apos;s the waste of the wind of the Pen--
a population in Sarawak , in the southwest Asian , a population that has lived in the forest to a generation , and now reduced to a generation , and then the next reducing of the figuums , where you can see the river of the physical medium that looks like the Borneo to the MCinese Mar Cinese Madional Minjapanese , where the named the gapancior of the higher , where you know , the named the inth of the highest of the y-signapanciplights the gatory of the garawak to the gath of the bris of the bris of the bries the giap
It &apos;s going to replaced the stives with the wood wood .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that have come with the discovery of the gold .
If we move on the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the right right pattern of the politics of politics .
You know , you know the genocide , physics of a populated populated , but the ethnight , the ethnium , but the ethnight of life , not only lifestyle , but even though , it &apos;s not condanted , but also cell in the environments , because it &apos;s part of the developing strategy of the development .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of the Tibet until you get part of the beginning .
I realized the 6,000 miles from Chengine in the West Chengu in the Western Chengineering , and they get to Lhasa with a young colleagues , but only came to Lhasa , I realized what &apos;s behind the statistics we &apos;re hearing .
6,000 feet sacred sacred browd and cens .
1.2 million people from the military .
The father of this guy was ascrited to Panchen Lama .
The means that it &apos;s been killed to the Chinese invasion .
Her is initive with Santity in Santity in Santity in the diaspores that has brought the population in Nepal .
Soum mother was imprisoned and his colpa was reich .
It was taken to the age of two hundred of two years , hidden under his gonna because he wouldn &apos;t live in him .
The source , which has done the same , it was put in result in reeducation .
A day has inavverted a day , he &apos;s been put a raffigned Mao and , in this transgression , was put in the workers for seven years .
The Pain of the Tibet can be insportable , but the pain of the population is from tener .
In the end , it &apos;s all reduce a choice .
We want to live in the world world &apos;s world &apos;s the world &apos;s world , or we want to collect the policromatic world of diversity ?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead said , her bigger said that her largest fear was that , in our largest fear of the world , we &apos;ll just see the whole amorous ama modality of the human imagination is that , but a day we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able able to be able to be able to be able to be able able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able .
And it &apos;s a huilant remember that our species is there for 60,000 years .
The Neolitics Rivolution , which has given us the agriculture , which has done us to be able to the cult of the sea , and they replace the next few of the neights of the specialization , and we &apos;re talking about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has 300 years .
That sths , history , I don &apos;t suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to do in the millennia to come .
When these cultures of the world is asked what it is to be humans , they say , what it &apos;s going to be human , they have 10,000 different voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all return the possibility of being what we &apos;re like , a consciousness , that has to be what we &apos;re a kind of a consciousness , and all the garden . And there are great moments .
I took this picture on the north of the north of Baffin , when I went to the hunt hunt hunt with Inuit , and this man , and this man , Olaya , he told me the wonderful story of her non-history .
The sang government has not always been gentile with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to stabilier our prematic sanks , we have them in colonies .
The non-hand-refused to go .
The family , temting for his life , and he brought them out all the arms , and all of his attracted .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t temate the cold , they &apos;re slanding .
The slites of the origins were made of fish have flows in the basic skin paper .
The name of this man doesn &apos;t have to stick arten &apos;t saying from arctics or or or the blizer that was suffiped .
It &apos;s switched , you get the bankmed pins and defecated in its own hand defecated in its hand . When the fake they did it , it &apos;s working on a lama .
He was sprayed out on the war of this cail cacca , and when they were solid , he was a song .
He was high schools and created a bridge , with the roughly hurt , has imbridge , he ged a sled , and it &apos;s banchisa , and it &apos;s banchisa , and it &apos;s slightly in the rest .
We want to talk about cavarsela with nothing ? Do you want to be able to be cavar , in different ways , and all of the resilience of the population of the Indigenes of the world .
In the most largest 1999 the canadvated canadvated the total control of an area of a territorary of California and Texas I had together .
It &apos;s their new patric . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a territorary territory . They &apos;re all the minerary resources .
One is one of the example of how a national state of the national state can reveal with his population .
And I think it &apos;s pretty obvious , I think it &apos;s rather obvious , is actually in these slights of the planet , make it connects that they don &apos;t remote .
For someone &apos;s home .
They are seeing sections of the human imagination that they &apos;re rising at the time . And for us all these children , as the dreams of these children , as the dreams of of the hope .
Finally , we National Geograpraphic , we &apos;re convints that politicians never to anything .
We believe that polemyments --
Applauses are not persuasive , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and maybe we have the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month to tell us about 35 million living .
156 countries our television .
Our revists are seven from millions of people .
Our work is to travel in the etnosphere to bring our public to bring our public market in the ethnost of the central reveals and hopology , hopology will be able to get the central reveal of anthropology : the marketing of the world in a pluralist and move a style world in a pluralist and multicultural world in a pluralist and move a myliving in the oographs of the ctural world to the central reveyourself as they &apos;re going to take to be in the cle .
which is the wisdom of all the people can contribute to our collective well-being .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope reped out of the other people who have heard and I &apos;ll try and try and I &apos;ll try and try and I &apos;m not noticed .
I want to start with what I call the &quot; officer . &quot;
The dogma dogma dogma is what ?
The dogma official dogma society of all the Western industrial industrial . The dogma officer is the way to male the well-being of our citizens &quot; The way to do it is to male the individual freedom . &quot;
The reason is , from a side , in the fact that freedom is actually a value , is precious , useful , is precious , for humans .
At the other is in the fact that if we &apos;re libers , each of us can act to do everything that masses our benefit , without any one that decided to our name .
The way to male the freedom is to men the choice .
More people have , more libers are libers , and most of them is their liberty , most of them are liberty , most of them are .
This is , I think , it &apos;s so deep radicated in the society that nobody would dream to put it in the doubt .
And it &apos;s also deply radicated in our lives .
I &apos;ll show you a few examples of what progress has done possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m going to put a simple note on the condent condents .
In my supermarket , there are 175 condents , without contact , without contact 10 varieties of oil . And 12 acetes , the balsamic balsm that you can buy a huge number of conditions in the resive results that nobody &apos;s already to you a huge circumstance .
Here &apos;s the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic of electronic to buy a stereo : case , the CD , radio , radio , radio , radio , fleastra ,
And in this single negotial negotiate , there &apos;s a great number of audio .
We can make six and a half million different half of combinations using the components that there are only in a negotior .
You have to admit that there &apos;s a lot of choice .
Although , the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all the serve phone telephone , the best that were fornounded by the Bell .
It was born the phone , not compressed it .
One of that , the other one was that the phone was that the phone was never going to care .
These are going to be .
Now , we have a variety almost illimited phones , especially between cellular cellular .
Here &apos;s the cellular cellular cellular .
My favorite is that in the middle leters , MP3 , cut of the nose , and the stream for the ebrules .
If you don &apos;t have seen in the store under the house , you &apos;re certain that it will be .
And what happens is that the people get into the gozes and does this question . And you know what &apos;s the answer ? The answer is &quot; No .
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell that doesn &apos;t do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the aquarters , you have the same explosion of choices .
Asanitary health : Don &apos;t happen in the United States that you &apos;re going to be from the doctor and the doctor , what you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do it , or you know , &quot; As these benefits and these risks . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Dr. &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; As these benefits and the risks , and B has these benefits and these risks . &quot;
What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebed , &quot; Dr. if she was me , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result of the result of the malite , &quot; expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But it &apos;s not that one is that a fish and responsibility to take a decisions from someone who knows something , which is the doctor , anything else that doesn &apos;t know anything -- and so it &apos;s not in the ideal condition to take a true patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing products , you know , there &apos;s a drug people like me and you , that if you think about it doesn &apos;t have any sense , I mean that we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why do they published them ?
The answer is that they want to ask them , we call the doctor to ask them to change the recipe .
Something so fundamental identity as our hythemselves is a question of choice , like you see in this jump . We &apos;re not going to be forced to be able to be hereding kids . &quot; We don &apos;t want to be an identity : we need to invent .
And we can reinvent ourselves how many times us .
The means that every morning , at riszone , you have to decide that kind of person want to be .
And I was going to be family and matriage , a time the next communal next communal next to anybody , it was that you could have the most of the most possible , and it was that you can .
The only neighborhood was with who , not when , and not even , and not even what to do after .
Egyday , it &apos;s really to play .
I teach in the very smart students , and I do their 20 percent in the work in less than a time .
And they &apos;re not because they &apos;re not smart , because they &apos;re not not because they &apos;re less diligence .
but because I &apos;m impensierites , I mean , I should be going to move or not ? Do I should be going to do it now ? &quot;
&quot; Do I have to move ? &quot; I have to think about the kids or career ? &quot;
They &apos;re logorant to logorant .
And they &apos;re trying to answer these questions , even though this implement doesn &apos;t have the compitors that you don &apos;t get a bel wait , and not get a bel wind .
And they have to do it . They have to do it .
Now , the work : We &apos;re lucky , as Carl was , because the technology allows us to work every minute , every day , every day , from Hotel Randolph .
In the parentests , there &apos;s a angulum , and I &apos;m not going to anybody who , where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t say , because I want to use it .
What does it mean , this incredible freedom of choice we have to work ? It &apos;s that we have to continuously , if we have to work or not .
We can go to the switch to play head , with the cellphone in a task , the Blackberry in the other , and the night , typically , on the ginockberry .
And even though they &apos;re all spended , every minute that we see our son , we &apos;re also looking , we &apos;re also asking , we &apos;re also asking , we &apos;re also asking this ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , that makes the experience of your child very different child very different than what would would be in other conditions .
So , anywhere we look at the way we look , small things , small materials and life is a question of choices , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : Oval , there were some possibilities , but not all of the choice .
The world today looks like this : The dilemma is , &quot; Is it &apos;s a positive , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Sometimes .
The positive layers we all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative ones .
All this is two two two negative effects in fact , two negative effects on people .
The first , is that it &apos;s producing , is that it &apos;s producing liberation .
And so many options between which choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I offer an example , meaning : one study conducted on the flight plans .
A colleages had access to the Vankfully data , the giant society of the source of the source of a billion climbing climbers in 2000 different companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offered every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the adesion is two percent .
With 50 source source , there &apos;s 10 percent in the adesions of the available to when they &apos;re available to five . Why ?
Because with 50 sourds between which choose , is maledetail , it &apos;s a difficult to decide , and the choice is remanded to the indomorrow .
And the domorders and domorders , domain , domain , domain , and of course domorders , of course , domorders ,
You know , that it doesn &apos;t just mean that these are going to eat the work that &apos;s food for cans because they don &apos;t have enough money , you also want to say that the decision is so obstic that they also have the decision is so obstic that they also have the loser than the work .
Don &apos;t participating , they &apos;re losing , and it &apos;s going to be a job , which would be wouldn &apos;t be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be .
So , the paralise is a consequence of having too much choices .
And I think that &apos;s going to make the world like this .
&quot; And finish , for the eternity : &quot; Yeah , you know , you &apos;re not ape ? &quot;
You would like to take the right decision , if it &apos;s for ethernity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong sourd , and nepppect the wrong .
So , that &apos;s the first effect . The second is that even if we can avoid the paralise and do a choice , we finally have less satisfying on the result of how we would have been with less options .
And that &apos;s a different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of these is that you &apos;re going to be better , if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have a better choice that would be better . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us , and the satives , and the repipipipipipipipipipipipiece of the choice , and the satisfacation of the press , and the satisfacility of the decision ,
even when it was a good decision .
More choices there are , more easier to be able to be untold anything that it &apos;s insod-insodenting .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call cost costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has asked very well as the value we have to do things that we have to depend things that we &apos;re going to confront .
In rest , when there are so many options , it &apos;s easy to be able to be the alternative characteristics , you know , you &apos;re less satikling and be less satisfted in .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m going to be a picture with all of the New York .
But that &apos;s what you probably think you &apos;re probably going to think .
There &apos;s this coppia of Hamptons .
A place of light .
It &apos;s splendida . Otttype . It &apos;s all for them .
Don &apos;t anything . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , maledition , is Agost . &quot;
&quot; All my neighbors in Manhattan are on . &quot;
&quot; I could talk about the right front of home . &quot;
And it &apos;s two weeks are asking from the idea that &apos;s losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The cost-opportunity is the sodenting sodation for what we have , even when choice was choice .
And the more are the options that we have to consider , more the characteristics will be able to be conconstitute as a cost-opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
And we have to live the living , and maybe of the living .
But the most important point is that anything you choose , you &apos;re choose to do other .
The things that we don &apos;t choose have a tactivity that can make less attractive what we do .
Tirst : the growth : the growth of expectations .
I tried it on my skin bought a new couple of jeans .
I &apos;m going to almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were one like , compraved them and bought to stay , they were comfortable , they were comfortable , they were spring them a life and working on a lot of times , began to go well .
So I went to buy a couple of my old , when those old people who went , and said , &quot; I need a couple jeans , and I said , &quot; I need a couple jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
The said said , &quot; Who wants to me , &quot; Do you want to fit , relaxy and fit ? &quot;
Who wants with the certain or or whatever you want to be a swashed , &quot; or &quot; acidwashed &quot; ?
&quot; Who wants to be strained ? &quot;
&quot; Sow the basic or strets ? Bt bble bla -- &quot; Sunder the bble -- he was going to elencare .
I was blown , and after a little bit , and after a little bit , I &apos;ve got the guy , which was the only guy who was the only guy who was , so I tried all the disease , and I had no idea what I &apos;ve ever had .
It was the very best . I got all that choice I got the best .
But I was feel worse .
Why ? I wrote a book at the book .
The reason I was worse , I was worse with all that I was going to be high high , the jeans had to be perfect .
I had a minime I had waiting . I didn &apos;t expected anything . But when there was a sit , but when there was 100 different , but when you &apos;re living in 100 different , lacket a should be perfect .
What I was doing is good , but not perfect .
After I talked about that I was trying to do what I was trying to insodented in the expectations .
The addition of options in life of the people don &apos;t do that these have respectations of the options of options in the options of options .
And that is less satisfying , even when the results are good .
No one in the marketing world , if it makes it .
Because if they knew it , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more like this .
&quot; It was better when you were worse , &quot; The reason why it was better when you were worse , you know , when you were worse , you know , you were worse , you know , you could actually meet .
Egyday , in the world we live in the world we live , opulent citizens with the perfection of perfection -- the most of the perfection of the perfection of the expectations .
You never surprised places because your expectations , my expectations , they &apos;re ingiant .
The secret of the happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Basse waiting , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , you want to . &quot;
I mean , little , the autobiographical time , which are actually moved and my wife is really studied .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t have to be able .
But it &apos;s not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of buy a couple of jeans switing when there &apos;s just that you &apos;re not satisfaced , and you say , &quot; Why ? &quot;
Who is responsible ? &quot; And I said , &quot; Do it &apos;s clear .
The world is responsible . What could I do I do you ?
When there are hundreds of types of jeans , and you buy one who is the responsible , and you ask you who is the responsible , it &apos;s otherwise , it &apos;s just like you .
You &apos;d have better do .
With hundreds of varieties , there are not out there for the insuccess .
So when people are decisions , even though the result is valid , they feel injected and they &apos;re going to hold them .
In the last few years , depression is exploss in the industrialized world .
I think a meaning factor -- not the only one , but the important one -- not the only one of this depression is that people have experiences of the standard because standard are too highest .
And when they have to explain this situation thought that the color is they think of the color .
So the final result is that we &apos;re better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely false .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit better than it &apos;s better than they have no matter , but it &apos;s not going to be better than a lot of choice ,
There &apos;s a critical value , magic . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we have been surrounded by a piece of the way that choices improve our lives .
Now , from political point , I &apos;ve almost finished -- from political point , the nocle is the following .
What allows all of this choice in industrial society is the material wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you &apos;re known , and you know , which the problem is not they have too much choice .
The problem is they have too pocks .
So the factory that I &apos;m talking about is a malesclusive of modern modern , recidesclusive society .
And what it does deprove is this : Steve Levitt has talked about yesterday , and the spoke set of how those and spend segols for bibes .
I mean , these choices , complicated and dispendious , it &apos;s not that they &apos;re just inutionary .
They &apos;re addicting to be deleteries .
They &apos;re going to stay .
If a little bit of what our society allows , it was revered in those where people have too few possibilities , it would not be the way to be better , but also , our life .
That &apos;s what economists call a improvement improvement .
A redistribution of the reduction is good at all -- not only to the poor -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in excess .
To conclude , you can become everything you want to become everything you want &quot;
You , people of culture , you &apos;ll think , &quot; What does that be ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t get anything in a glass of glass . &quot;
An inside the world &apos;s immation , a limited vision of the world --
and I interpretty much , and I interpretty much , and I &apos;m going to start .
But then , thinking about it , instead , I realized that that fish the long knowledge .
Because the reality of the fact of the fact of the broke , so that you can &apos;t be liberty , so that you can &apos;t be freedom .
If you can have the best broads in a way that everything you can diminished sodpheration .
You &apos;re going to get the paralysis , and you reduced the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too much , perhaps even for fish , and sure for us .
But the axished with some symbolic symbolic , and I &apos;m going to be the roughly .
Thank you cue .
