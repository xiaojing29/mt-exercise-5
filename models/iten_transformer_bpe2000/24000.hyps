The year I showed these slidemonstrate to demonstrate that the calculus of artic arctic , which almost three million years has had the size of 48 percent .
But this is to be the gravity of the problem because not shows the spexhibition of the ice .
The arten typical clean is , in a sense , the pulsant , the pulsant heart of the global climate .
You &apos;re winter and it ritis .
The next slides is going to be a faster of the last 25 years .
The ice loss loss are signed .
You see , they expand down to the blue .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter , which is the glasses .
You can see that the ice costle of perenn , of five years or more , it &apos;s like the blood , which is the blood , which is the blood .
In 25 years , it &apos;s going to go from this , at this .
This is a problem because the interested in the ground , the glactor , where there are enormous amount of congeled that , and there are huge amount of congeless , and they are transformed in metane from the microbes .
I &apos;m putting to the totality of the atmospheric inquent of global warming , that amount could radical , surgery , super-run , super-return , super-returning this point of not .
In some little laghi little little deep in Alaska , the metane is already standing from the water .
The professor Katey Walter University of Alaska is reversity with a team , and a team that watching a team .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You &apos;re good . The question is if we &apos;re going to be .
A reason this is that this term scale from the north .
This is a figured fight to the glacial .
The carried wasn &apos;t reached .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the south of Greenland .
If you want to know how the sal level of the sea level of the sea of the ice of the ice of the sea .
These ropents are increasingly increases .
As the planet : Antarctes , the largest block of ice ice ice ice the planet .
The month of the scientists have diclear that the balance of the ice is in negative , and the Antartis in negative , and the Antartis particularly , which path on some islands , is particularly quick in the science .
Equival 16 meters of the wild of the wild , like in Greenland .
Sull Himalayas , the third largest block , you see new laghi , that a few years ago , which a few years ago , and they were glaced .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population has gone half the water from that he source .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the water of this city .
The carried is increased .
But when it dimining , it &apos;s the same account water .
In California , the snow on the Sierra Nevada is diminuit .
The hyrics are in the crises .
The predictions , as you read , I &apos;m graves .
The growing growing safety in the world to a wild of incends .
The environmental disaster are increasing a rhythm out of the normal and without previous .
Four numerous times more numerous than the previous 75 .
This is a whole thing that is insustainable .
If you look at it in the context , if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years we &apos;ve added 70 million CO2 tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the time of the Pacific area , to the American , to the objection , and on the objection of the subcontinent , where there is a radical impact of oxygen in the ocean .
Most of the global warming , together the deforestation , and it &apos;s the 20 percent , is the use of fossil of fossil combustible .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with more emissions , together to China .
And he was proposed to build a lot of other centers .
But we &apos;re assisting a changing changes .
These are annuled projects in the last few years and some of the alternative .
At every way , there &apos;s a lotta politics in our country .
The carbon industries and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon , which is a host .
The picture I remember something --
Sernessee Natal , Tennessee , there was a lost of 3.8 billion paper scories of carbon .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the second biggest flow in America .
It &apos;s happened to Natal .
The nature of one of the carbon industries and carbon was this .
Video : The carbon , the carbon is a kind of food and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it growing our economy .
My palent is more and more and more lightly .
It &apos;s good price , it &apos;s holds and work work , and the work , they keep the stipendent .
Al Gore : For here is a lot of West Virginia .
The largest mountains is Massey Coal . This is his amministration .
Video : Won Blankenship -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosis , Harry Reid -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Protection of Clima has two campaign .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Ator : At COALergy see the changes as a serious mine changes as a serious serious as a serious serious as a serious serious changes .
So our priority is invest a big amount of money in a lot of money in a public effort to make public and confuse the truth .
In fact , the carbon doesn &apos;t spork .
We think it &apos;s clean -- it &apos;s also a good profumo .
So not preoctor of climate change .
Let me do .
Video : Ator : Carbone -- you &apos;ve heard very much .
So let &apos;s go around a tyrate in a stream to the basic .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little bit of the car technology , but this is the sound of the paper technology .
The carbon of carbon is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology , but the remarkable technology that you see changes everything .
You have a look at this : this is the hate technology of the pails of clean .
Al Gore : Inend , the positive positive to the economic issues and the security of the national security .
Video : My America is in cription ; the national economy , the national security , the national security .
The philos that the college of all of our connections , as the sea sporal combustyle and the oil and the oil and the oil and the oil and oil .
Now , it &apos;s a new audace , and it &apos;s a new solution for cirners .
Really America : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A piano to repect America at the work , make more sure , and help to stop global warming .
Finally , a solving solve solve our problems .
Repower America . Scoover .
Al Gore : That &apos;s the last .
Video : It &apos;s about reducing energy to America .
One of the fastest ways of bring up to dependence from the combined to our planet .
Comparse : The future is here . I wind , just a new energy network .
Something about two : Noves investment for places of the basic jobs .
Commment : Minent America . It &apos;s time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old old old old old , &quot; If you want to go speed , go to the faster , go from the sun .
If you want to go away , go back , go together . &quot;
We need to go away , speed .
Thank you very much .
The year at TED I did a TED TED I did a LHC .
And I promise to go back to you about how the machine works .
So here . And then , for those who were there , the LHC is the biggest experiment , ever , the biggest scientific experiment , ever ever ever ,
His compit is to rereach the conditions that were present less than a billion second from the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
All this is just environment .
This is the car underneath Gineven-Gineven-Gineven-Gineven-to-Gineven-up .
We move these mini-Big Bang inside the resevators .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- is 44 meters and it has a 22 meters .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in building , so you can see the proportions .
Ten in 10 years of the last year we have accested the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was cause of immense festegen in control the control of control .
It &apos;s an image of the first picture that had done all around the LHC , and in collision , in collision , with a part of the LHC , and I spread particle in the seven-level .
In other words , when we see that picture the 10 sectember , we realized that the machine worked , which is a great vitter .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to make us exultate more or this , when somebody went on Google and saw that the page was this .
That means we have a cultural impact to be cultural impact to that scientific .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , and it had to these phils here -- these dored phils .
These phils bring 13,000 lampits machine works at the most power of the power of the power of power .
Now , the technical technical , and they &apos;re going to watch up , &quot; It &apos;s not true . I &apos;m too good . &quot;
And they can do that because when they &apos;re very cold , they become very cold phils .
So , at less 271 degrees , at a floor at that delivers between the stars , these phils can bring that run .
In one of the youngest gest novemila in the LHC , there was a fabulous difect .
So the phils surgery , and the 13,000 ampounds of improvising a electric resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think these magneties that these magneties more than 20 tons .
They are damaged about 50 magneties .
We had to take them , what we did .
We repriised and travel .
Now they &apos;re coming back to their sub-place .
By the end of the brzo LHC is , it &apos;s going to be new integro .
We &apos;re going to accenate it , and we &apos;re going to get the right data or light , and we continue our adventure to discover what the morning to be the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these incidents reaccount on the value of science and engineering of science and engineering . It &apos;s easy to confuture .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact of go beyond the value of things like the LHC .
I &apos;d like to end with the words of a Inglese scientist , Humphrey Davy , who , I imagine , in the defense of his bael , his pupilllo , his pupiler , he said , &quot; Nothing is so dangerous for the progress of the human mind that the ideas of the human mind that the ideas of science as of human mind that the ideas of science that ideas well as the rest of our triethemselves . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start wonderful to think about when , from children , played , as children , played car .
As you figure out how to get them and dead , and they &apos;re going to be able to think and solve problems , and you know , solve problems and solve problems .
The space is deply connected to the way that we understand most captures in the world around us .
So , from the information of our interaction with physics , together my failing , together my Patts , and my hand the collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to ask me , &quot; And if we use a sure computer , instead of having the only as a pastraining of the digital mouse , we could have a desktop with the digital information with the streets , we could make physically further further , with my hands ,
and systemaring our placement ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , by building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable , is a whole whole big computer , as a biggest computer .
In a few words , a Siftable , is a whole whole big computer , as a biggest computer .
You can move them with the hand , you can see , &quot; you can see &quot; between them , you feel their movement and a radio and a radio and a radio and a radio .
But above , they &apos;re physical objects , as the morning , you can move them .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem to manipulate the digital information .
And as a physical , knowledge of their movement , of the other , and as they become more physical , of the movement , of the other , as we move new movement , of the other , as we can explore new , and fun size of interaction .
I &apos;m going to start with a few simple example .
This is Siftable is configurated to show the video : if incline in a direction , video will roter , video will roter .
These are interactive , interactive , are consciously consciously .
If you go , they &apos;re interested in the thing is , they &apos;re interested in .
If they come circumstates , they can act a little bit .
If they come circumstates , they can act a little bit .
They also watching their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the poter using common data , &quot; a color of the color , &quot; a color like a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable , as a center of the vernice and I can use them to real color in that central , where they missed .
and I can use them to train color in the central , where they missing .
If we &apos;re too , we can get too , we can get a little bit .
They also beautiful possibilities of learning , as the languages , the math and games where people can try and eventually come up with the results of the speed , and see the results of the results .
Now I &apos;m --
This is a sequence of Fibonaces that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a game of words that &apos;s half between Scarabean and Boble .
Pratically , to realize a letter to case on every Siftable , Pratically , every turn to every turn on every Siftable on every Siftable on , and trying to comport words , and certainly control of a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new letters and new possibilities to try to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s a children came to the Media Lab , I did this in a way that they came up to them and turn a video .
They are very lived .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people many education .
You &apos;ve got to say , &quot; Compons of words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s other people who come to try to do it .
This is our younger tester , there on the right .
It was actually to implement them .
They were only morning .
Now , this is an application of an interactive cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool to the learn of languages . He &apos;s Felix .
It can insert new characters in the scene , solid Siftable .
It can insert new characters in the scene , solid Siftable .
So , he &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : The sun is source .
David Merrill : Now he brought a treator in the scens .
Video : The arange treator .
Books ! Yeah ! Yeah !
So schooling Siftable and put them near can interact the personally --
Video : Bau !
To inventing its story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a story with final open-open-up , and he can decide him as you get .
DM : It &apos;s a story with final open-open-up , and he can decide him as you get .
Vololice : Gola , cat .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , to wait , to wait , to wait and exeguide music .
it &apos;s a tool , realized by recently , to wait and exeguide music .
The Siftable here are agenda on as basis , based and battery .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose to use .
You can also insert sound these sounds in a sequence of comport .
And modificate it just to touch a &quot; sound &quot; and a &quot; sequence . &quot;
These are effects that you can control from the alive , as the reverse and the filter .
The acks at a particular sound and then inclins to be in the way .
And then there are general effects as time and volume , that they applied to the whole sequence .
Let &apos;s look at how it works .
Video : We &apos;re going to start to put a base in two Siftable . &quot;
Now , I put a basis .
Video : Now I add to percussions --
Video : And now I &apos;ll put the philer to the battery , so I can control the effect from the alive .
Video : I can speed the whole sequence , I can speed the whole sequence of time from one side or another .
Video : And now I &apos;ll add the movie to the basic philos to dare more expression .
Video : I can realize the sequence &quot; to the fly . &quot;
So I didn &apos;t have to planning it before , but I can try and make it longer , and I can make it longer ,
And now , finally , I can smoke the whole sequence inking on the left Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is built new man &apos;s interfaces more and more more like the work and body .
And today , I &apos;ve got time to show you one of the results of this loss , and also some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that &apos;s coming up this new generation of projects to interact with digital media , that will bring information in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the hour of you .
I &apos;m a written .
And I wrote books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the fass of my life .
And I don &apos;t expect that it can change .
But , said , something particular has been recently successful in my life and in my life and in my career , who bring me to realibring the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called &quot; Manore , Prua , Prua , &quot; which , and I &apos;m saying , for some reason my precedented in the world and become a big , for some reason in the world and become a big , sensitive , sensitive sensitive ,
And the result is that everywhere in the waiting now , people treat me as if I was condanned .
It &apos;s condanned -- condanned .
They &apos;re all worried and they &apos;re saying , &quot; You don &apos;t fear of fear that you can &apos;t do better ?
You don &apos;t keep going to be writing for all life without being able to make a book that you can important to make a book that you can important to someone ? &quot;
which can important to somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s rassurant , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent -- I was a cent writer .
I met at the same reaction based by the pure .
And people said , &quot; I don &apos;t feel you can &apos;t get succeeed ?
You don &apos;t fear that the humiliation of the refer ?
You have no fear of doing this all life without any living without any living in and die on a smoke on of a snake of every infranker with the full of filled by fallimb ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
Yeah , I have fear of all those things .
I &apos;ve always had fear .
And I have also fear of many other things that people can &apos;t inate .
As the falgap and other things spavently .
But , as much as it wrote what I thought and wonderful and I was wonderful , because ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logic that anyone has been waiting from a work that you feel like to do .
But what is this particular in the creative creative creative , to make us nervous about mental health , in a way that other career do ?
Like my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don &apos;t remember one once 40 years of activity that he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was a chemical engineer ?
There was never -- that was -- that block of the engineer John , as it goes ?
He didn &apos;t work , you know ?
Onestly , chemical engineers as group have no , in the centuries , in the centuries , depressive manized manized manized manized manized manized hyd-.
We have a writers , we have enough this reputation , and not only writers , but creative of every gender , we have this reputation of being enormous instasible .
And it &apos;s not rest of the other than looking at the conteain of the magnificent ments , only in the 21st century , died young people , died young , they died young people , died young people , they died young people , they die .
And also the ones that are not suickly disguys to be really disgued by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before I die , in the last interview he said , &quot; Every my book has kill me a little bit more . &quot; A extraordinary wild about work .
But we don &apos;t bad to the saying because we &apos;ve heard these things that are so long that somehow completely interior that we have completely interior and accepted the notion that creativity and the suffering , and the art , it &apos;s going to the end .
And the question I want to take all over today is : are you agreed with this idea ?
It &apos;s good to you know this -- because it &apos;s also looking at a centimeter of distance to me , not good for anything .
I think it &apos;s odiosa .
And I think it &apos;s also pericangerous and I don &apos;t want to see the perpetuate in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our great creative minds to live .
And I know , in my case -- in my situation -- would be very dangerous to start fuging that I was host of the suppose of the circumstances , I &apos;m in my career .
Of true -- you look , I &apos;m rather young , I have about 40 years .
I still have about four decades in me .
And it &apos;s likely that anything write about the world , then it will be judged by the world as the work that was used to be successful from the last book .
I &apos;m sled , because we &apos;re all more or less friends here -- is likely that my biggest success is to my horse .
Oh , Gesus , who think !
You know this is the kind of thinking that &apos;s the kind of thinking that door to start bing in the nine morning , and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would keep going to keep this work that we .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it seems to me , after many reflective , that the way of working to continue is to create a psychological construct , okay ?
I have to find a distance distance between me , who I &apos;m written , and my natural anxiety of what reaction is about what reaction is going to get out . And as I was trying to do this last year , trying to start to look through time , trying to find other society to see if they could have ideas and more healthy to see if they could have ideas and more healthy more sane and more sane and more sane than healthy , and more saneously , and my natural anxion . And I was trying to go to look at
to help people creative to reach the emotional inerent inerent people who are creativity .
And that research to me to the Grex and ancient Rome .
Let me go back .
In ancient Greek and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that the creativity was from men , OK ?
And it was thought that creativity was this spirit divine and that was to be a several source and known , for distant reasons and unknown , for distant reasons and healthy .
The greatest called these spirites of the berites of the creativity .
Socry , wonderful , he creded a demon the side of the landscape .
The Romans were the same idea , but they called the kind of spirit without a genius .
The that &apos;s great , because Romans didn &apos;t really think a genius was a very intelligent someone particularly intelligent .
They believe that a genius was this kind of wind , which was this kind of wild literally in the wallmurs of a study of a Dobby , and that came out of the Dobby , and that came out to the hidden work of the artist and model , and model that job .
Excetional -- here is , that is the distance of what I talked about -- that psychological construct you from the result of your work .
And everybody knew that was so that it was , right ?
So the anticism artists were protected by things , like , for example , the too much narcism , no ?
If your work was exceptional work , you couldn &apos;t take all the market , everybody knew that you were helped by this encourage .
If your false work , it wasn &apos;t all the piece of your , right ?
They all knew that was your genius to be a incapable .
And so people are fully further creativity in the West , for a lot of time .
And then the Renasent came and everything changed , and all changed , and nacque this great idea ; we put the human being at the mistered and no longer and no longer and no longer to fit from the divinity .
This was the principle of the rational humanity and people started thinking that creativity was completely from the sharke .
And for the first time in history , it &apos;s beginning to this or the artist as a rather than a person with a genius with a genius with the genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big herror .
I think it allowed to be like a nice person to believe that as a recipient as a source , the essence and the sisters of all mysteries , creative , unknown , and the source of the lights , and the lighting human , and the source of human hand to ethels .
It &apos;s like to ask someone to watch the sun .
And it &apos;s completely the ego and fully creates all these expectations on performance .
And I think it was this pression to destroyed the artists in the past 500 years .
And , if that &apos;s true , and I think it &apos;s , and I think it &apos;s , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t sing 500 years of rational thinking about a 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience that would have been a scientific suspects on the notion of the notion of the notion of the projects of the projects .
I &apos;m probably not convince you all on this .
But the question I would like to ask is -- why no ?
Why don &apos;t I think that way ?
Because it &apos;s more sense of all other thing that I &apos;ve ever heard to explain the predictable of the creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever ever ever have been trying to do something -- so , I mean , you know , you don &apos;t get rationally .
And in fact , it can be completely paranormal .
I met recently with the extraordinary poetched Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years old , but it was a poetic for all life and said that during his childhood in the Virginia , working out in the camps , and he felt it , in the welds , and he felt it , in the wind .
He said that it was like a fragorous air .
And that was rolling towards her , and she &apos;s landscape .
He felt it to be , because he was tremendous to his feet .
He knew to have one one thing to do at that point and it was , words , &quot; run as a math . &quot;
And so it was correct to the house and he was walking up with this poem , and he had to take a piece of card and a faster , and a faster , while the traphor , and he would run it and deal it on the page .
Somce , he could not be fast , so correct and correct and correct and correct and correct the house and the poem and the poem and she would continued to rolate through the landscape , trying to rolate through the landscape , trying to do another poet . &quot;
And then there were some -- this is , I &apos;ll never forget it -- there were some moments that &apos;s almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running house and he was trying to card and the past through , and he was going to go through , and he was going to go through , and he was going to go , and then he was like , and then he was like the other hand the hand the hand the hand the housing .
He was a poem from the tail and he put in his body and he was page on the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the loss and intately , but the last word on the last word .
So when I felt you heard it -- it &apos;s fully , it &apos;s exactly the same thing to my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conducture !
I &apos;m a mulo , and my way of work is , and my way to work on the same horarian every day and work and go to the and go on and go on and go out and go on and go out .
But even , in my testardagges , I stripped against the thing , sometimes .
And I also imagine that many of you in the han done .
You know , even if the work and ideas came up with ideas , and the ideas , you know , I won &apos;t even know .
And what is this ?
And as can we relate to it in a way we don &apos;t lose the head , but rather , rather , that make us sure healthy ?
And as much as it is about , the best example I have is the Musician musician Tom Waits , which I interviewed different years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life has been the incarnation of the actual artist , trying to control , to try to control , to deck , wonderful , days , dominate these species of totally interiorized .
But then he invected , he was hot , and a day when he was driving on a Los Angeles , changed everything .
He was going to go queeeyes and all of a sent witch , and it comes into his head of the head of the inspiration , and the hall-on the head , and the literally , and the loving , but not knows how to take it .
It &apos;s not a piece of card , it doesn &apos;t have a math , it doesn &apos;t have a clean .
So he starts to feel this species of old anxiety , &quot; I &apos;m sitting to lose , and I &apos;ll remark up up by this persenhouse .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t make it . &quot;
And instead of going to go to the panic , he stopped .
He ended the whole mental process and he did something completely new .
And he just watching the sky and said , &quot; Scause , don &apos;t see that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; You seem to write a song now ?
If you really want to be , you get back to a more when I can take care of you .
Although , you go to important out to each other today .
You know , Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his process worked changed after this .
Not work , the work was still host as always .
But the process , and the heavy , and the heavy was regided when the genius , the genius that was in the genius , and libered it back from the way to the well-back , and libered it back from , and libered it back from , and that libered , and the libered .
But he was wonderful , wonderful , wonderful collaboration between Tom and and this external thing that &apos;s going to be not Tom .
So , how much of the story I was working on a little bit of the way I worked , and he save me once .
This idea , he saved when I write , &quot; Manore , Prua , &quot; Ama , and fall in one of those of the disperation that we all work on something and we &apos;re doing on something and we &apos;re doing on something and we &apos;re going to think that it &apos;s going to be a disaster , which is going to be disaster .
Not just , the book , just the book wrote .
And I started thinking about to think of gets this project .
But then I remember Tom who talked to the air and I tried to try to the air and try .
So I went up to my face in the house and I got my house and I got my comments to a room .
And I said , &quot; Sent , &quot; Sent , what we know , if this book , you know that if this book won &apos;t be bright , won &apos;t it &apos;s going to be wouldn &apos;t be interested in my , no ?
Because as I see us as I &apos;m going to put everything everything I have , I have no longer than that .
So if you want to better , you have to be better , you have to present-up and do your part .
Okay . But if you don &apos;t , you know what , you don &apos;t do anything .
I &apos;m going to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to favor that was recorded that I today to do my part , &quot; Why -- at the end is , OK -- in the wind of Africa in North Africa , the people were wonderful sitting for the wonderful wonderful sitting on the wonderful swich and hours to allow up .
And they were always magnific , because the banks were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every once , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists , and one of these artists in fact , it &apos;s actually transfer .
And I know what I talk , because I know you &apos;ve all seen you see it , at a performance .
It was like the time , and the balery , and the walking camaleras , and he wasn &apos;t doing anything from the sun , like 1,000 nights before , but it was all walking .
And suddenly , it &apos;s not just as a human .
But it turns out from the didying and sought illumined in the divinity .
And when this was happening , to the time , people knew what was , they were called it with his name .
They were conged to sing , and they started sing , &quot; Allah , God , Allah , God , God , God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curious night storic -- when the Morororic south of the Spain , I took this habits and the land-changed pronounce in the centuries from Allah , Allalalah , Allah , &quot; Oklah , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; as you can hear in the flamense .
In Spain , when an artist did something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , magic , &quot; Allah , magnificent , &quot; I &apos;m broken , &quot; incomprehensible , &quot; God scoral .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes down the day , to the day , to the same , when you watch and down that are the 11 in the morning of Martedtedge and the scores of God , and I go down the God of God , there &apos;s no longer .
It &apos;s just a mortal with a lot of bad to ginocky , and perhaps never can get to the tree .
And perhaps no one name of God , and what it must do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most sweet recognizes to make a creative life .
But perhaps it doesn &apos;t have to be so angosciant if you can &apos;t believe , anzyutt , which is extraordinary expected in your own .
But it just created that you get data in the present of a unimaginable source of this squish of your life that you have to go to to someone else when you &apos;re finished .
And , you know , if we think that all changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s certainly as I thought for different months in the book , I &apos;m going to published , the performance , I &apos;m going to be following , and I was waste , and I was following my graduate success .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel electrized from this is , not fear .
You don &apos;t go to the way . It &apos;s just your work .
It &apos;s going to presented you to presented your part , whatever you can be .
If your work is balance , ball ball .
If the wind , sure genius to lead up some kind of wonderful kind of wonderful , for a moment through your effort , then , &quot; Okay ! &quot;
Although , you &apos;re in your dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot;
I believe and I think you have to teach it .
&quot; Okay ! &quot;
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
You know , I &apos;ve already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , on what can meaning and discovery of new genes .
Now we &apos;re starting a new perspent : We started digitizing biology and now to talk from that digital code we &apos;re in a new biology , designing and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing .
We always tried to take big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists I think they have tented to be livels .
We tried different approaches , reducing the minimes .
We &apos;re digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treating from the analog world of the biology of the digital world of the digital world of the computer .
Now , we can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome of those that can authorem in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create one more smaller .
We are able to eliminate a hundred of genes about 500 that are here .
But when we have a look at his map metabolic mapaph , it &apos;s relatively to our .
Credetails , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , once it &apos;s very unlikely that this can bring to a living cell .
So we decided that the only to program was to synthesize this chromosome so that we could modify the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of the &quot; Pan &quot; we synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Can chemistry to make these big molecule that we &apos;ve never been able to create before we have been doing before we have ?
And , in case , can we make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a chemical material chemical material .
The speed that we are able to digitalize life is growing up to the exponential .
Our capacity to write the genetic code , instead , rather slowly , but it &apos;s better .
And our most recently , our most recently , we have exponential curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process has been require many passioned , starting with a bioethical reatens before we began to start the first experiments .
But we found that DNA is very hard . It &apos;s very hard .
There are decades of thousands of machines in the world that producing little DNA , the long-letters of 30 to 50 letters and it is a degenerative process : the most herror . There are .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these framments and correct .
And this was our first attempty , to talk about the digital information of Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills .
We designed the fragments , actually , the correction of the herror and I got a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material chemical material and we &apos;ve got in the bacteria , the bacteria , batteres started to read this genetic and producing the viral particles .
The viral particles have been left from the cells , and they &apos;re back and destroyed the Ecoli .
I talked about recently with members of the oil industry and they have been talking about this model .
They &apos;ve got more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build his same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things more in larger .
We wanted to build the whole cromosome of the bacteria .
I &apos;m more than 580 middle of the genetic code .
So we thought we built it in the casses of the viruses , so that we can change the casses of the components of a living cell .
The progress is crucial , and if we start with digital information , they have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accurator was a mile for every 10 mile .
We found out , if we found out , 30 errors . If we had the original sequence , we would never be able to do that work .
A process is to design segments , and we have a letters that are overwhelse segments with all other segments of 50 letters to build smaller subject that works together .
We can look at unique elements here .
You probably read that we &apos;re going to inserve of the flights .
Think about it : We have a genetic code basic on four letters : A , Good and T.
Three of those letters together , and it &apos;s a little bit of letters , and there &apos;s a specific order to every ammine for every ammind .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , sentences .
What we &apos;ve done in the beginning was autographing .
Some of the states of the fact that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
We designed these segments to be able to just unique with enzymes .
There are enzymes that they are standing them .
And we started to assembling parts , beginning with segments from five to seven , so that we form to form of 24 mile , seven of 24 mile letters to come to 72 mile .
At every step we have produced these segments in abundance , so that we &apos;re trying to sequency , we &apos;re trying to make a very robbbrobust -- as you see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems to be a basket play-basket play-basket .
When we get to these very long segments , more than 100 mila , more than 100 middle , they will not grow directly in E.
It comes to the limit of modern molecular biology .
So we &apos;ve considered other mechanisms .
We knew of another mechanism called the romology , which is useful to repair the DNA can switch the DNA can come to the segments .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinoccurs , it can make three million radiodurans , can make three million radiation .
You can see in the upper time as his own chromosome as his cromosome of the distruted .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s reassembled exactly as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do .
These organisms can &apos;t be completely .
They can live under the vacuum .
I &apos;m absolutely sure life in space , and you move to find new environment of water .
ASA , NASA showed that this is .
This is an image of molecule that we &apos;ve built this process , just using the lievening with the open-segments from inserious design .
The lievening them up automatically .
This picture was not taken with a electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a tiny molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that they cover a time of about six seconds .
This is the published we &apos;ve done little time ago .
They are more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the biggest molecule of a definitely definitely created by man .
It &apos;s a weight spring 300 millions .
If we stop it with a career 10 without spacecraft , they would like 142 pages to just transcare this genetic code .
Now , how do we do it work ?
Of course , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , if you &apos;re a game .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when you use of bacteria .
It &apos;s simplest when it &apos;s cells as well as it is about the nuclear , you can just extract the nucleo and put another , which is prately the process of clonically , the process of the process of .
In the harchaea , the cromosome is integrated inside the cell , but we &apos;ve recently demonstrated that we &apos;re able to make a complete trapition of a chromosome from one cell and a cell and activating it .
We got a chromosome of a microbial species .
The two are different than men from topes .
We &apos;ve added some genes in a way that we decide to decide that chromosome for this cromosome .
And then it &apos;s a slip with the enzymes .
And when we put it into the cell was study -- and you &apos;ll open-study our software -- the new chromosome , the new cromosome , the new cromosome .
And we were actually thinking that we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to spushers in there .
This is one of the most evolution of evolution .
We found that many species have added a second species have added a second or third chromosome from some of the new thousands of new , the second new , and that species .
So who &apos;s thinking about evolution as a gene at the time that you modified doesn &apos;t understand the biology .
There are scientist &apos;s scientists called &quot; enzymes that we have to digerism .
The chromosome that was in the cell of it .
The cell phones that we have inseritous to have it .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other croma as an extraneous material , and we found out with only the cell and the new chromosome .
it &apos;s became blue because of the genes we &apos;ve inserious .
And in a short lelass of time , all the characteristics of a species have loss , and it turned out of the new software that we insert in the cells .
All the protein is changed , membranes are changed , and when we &apos;re reading the genetic code of exactly what we &apos;ve transfer .
Now , this may seem genetic altering , but altering the DNA software we going to change things in a way .
Now , I &apos;ve got explained that here is not talking about this -- but we have a size of three million years of evolution , and I &apos;ve already said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the Cambodies that we &apos;re going to create new species on this digital process .
Why to do that ?
I think it &apos;s enough to be obvious when we think about our need .
We &apos;re going to go from six and a half billion people at the nine 40 years .
Gust to give you an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946 , in 46 , there &apos;s four .
We &apos;re going to find food now to find food , fresh and clean , medicinal and beneath for six billion and a half billion people .
It &apos;s going to be more dare to do that for nine billion .
We &apos;re going to use more than five billion , more than 30 billion barils , more than 30 billion bariles .
That means millions of barils a day .
When we &apos;re trying to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replaces , it &apos;s a huge challenge .
In more we have to hold of the CO2 emission of CO2 from these materials that finds in the atmosphere .
At today , thank you to find scientific discovery all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the design of the design components for the future .
The electronic industry , it can only have a dozen history , and think about how many different things are out .
Our limits here are principlly by the biological reality .
Now we have technique , thank you to these metods of synthetization , that we call the combined genomics .
We &apos;re able to build a big robots that can make a big robots that can make a million chromosomes a day .
Think about this 20 million genes or try to get to optimize the processes to make the processes to make the process to make it , new vaccines , we can change , thank you to change , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more molecular biology .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for a possibility of survival , chemistry or carbon , chemistry .
This is an instantly instantly , some of the program that we &apos;re working to be able to sat and design species to the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know necessarily as they &apos;re going to be .
We know exactly what they are genetic code .
We &apos;re now focus on the carbon fourth of how quarter generation .
You &apos;ve seen you extracted from the grain was a finished experiment .
We have a second second and third generation that will use enough from the sugar to the high of high value as the open or different kinds of butanketol .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact with no advice , and we think of food and limiting the food and limiting the CO2 in the mathor , that we &apos;re working to design cells that we &apos;re working to design cells that can make this scale , and we think of the first carbons of quarter generation in about 18 months .
The solar solar combined with CO2 is a methodowntown -- but in our discovery in the world , we found different metodds .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , at about 2500 feet depth of the water temperature of the water .
It &apos;s from CO2 using hydrogen molecular hydrogen as the source of energy .
We &apos;re trying to figure out if we can incanalt CO2 , which can be transported by your typically , converting that CO2 in carburant , to drive this process .
So we short thinking that we could be able to be able to increase what the basis that the basis that the life is Nes , &quot; is , &quot; We have the modest modest of replacing the whole oil industry to replacing the whole oil industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do this from TED , where can you do ?
It was a main of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working to use the same metods to create vaccines .
You saw this year with influence , we &apos;re always forward a year and with a dollar when it &apos;s going to find the right vaccine .
I think that &apos;s changing a lot of the combinable vaccines in anticipate .
And that &apos;s the future could start to be changing , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating the evolution with synthetic bacteria , and finally , I was , and finally cells .
We &apos;re in so much from the impressing people .
Our purpose is to make it . Thank you very much . Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;ll show you , the most quickly possible , some fundamental work , the new technology that we brought to Microsoft in the following a year ago .
It &apos;s a environment that you can interact with local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data .
Here we &apos;re seeing a lot of digital pictures with a kind of digital photos , and I continued , for a speed speed , and I continued to the images as we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these colraces are of the data or images .
Most of the digital photographs , but this is a scanning of the Congress of the Congress , and it &apos;s entering in the gama of 300 megapiel .
It doesn &apos;t make a difference because the only thing that &apos;s the presents of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen on your screen . It &apos;s also a very flexeless .
This is a whole book , you know , not images .
This is Casolate for Dickens . Every colonnail . Every colonnake .
To show you that it &apos;s just about the text and not images , we can make a kind of thing , to see that it &apos;s a real real representation of the text .
It could be a little bit artificial to read a book to read a book .
I don &apos;t recommend it .
This is a more realistic example . This is a lot of the Guardian .
Every big picture is the beginning of a sea .
And it really gives you the please and beauty of the lighting version of a day or a daily watch of a day , or a lot of a lot of a medium .
We also made something with the corner of this particular number in the particular number of the Guardian .
We created a fasull fasull solutionef -- much higher than that uses in a publisher -- and we &apos;ve insert of the extra contained .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific specific specific .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space .
We hope that this means to put population and other similar , and other similar porcheries , they should not be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this camp , if I don &apos;t want to lose time , if we don &apos;t have contributes to this field .
These are all the streets in the United States , you know , the NASA .
So now , we &apos;re going to go to to something else .
This is actually actually from the Web , you can go to the web .
This is a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
A is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting seech a very interesting computer , very interesting , in Noah Snavel , a student of the University of Washington , with the aid of the UW and Seliski of Microsoft Research .
And it &apos;s from the Web , gesters from Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this , kind of screen , where we can go from one picture and have this kind of experience to the other and have this kind of experience to the multiply solution .
But the space collocation of the pictures here has a meaning .
The size of the computer visualization have recorded these pictures together , so that corresponds to the real hogs that the real hogs that -- all the near of the record . The slages on Montne Roccious Mound Roccious Roccial Montne Rocciets , you see the elements of a slides of a slides of a slides of a slides , and these things have been all the space collegiven .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a few more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original set of Noahhabit -- and this from a prototype of Photosynth of Photosynth that we did work for the first time , the first time , the first time , the square I really watching the key behind this technology , Photynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily inherats .
We had to worry about the legal aspects and so on .
This is a rebuild-holds of Noththers . Dimimages prize . Bauckr Din Flickr . Bauckr Din Flickr and you get images of types , and I &apos;m saying . Egnal one of these arancies , represents a picture that &apos;s discovered an image that you have discovered a picture that &apos;s discovered .
So I &apos;m all images from Flickr and they &apos;ve been all collected to this way .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this .
You know , I would never be thought I &apos;d never thought of finish working for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratiffying to realize this kind of account here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different kinds of phototo , from those of the cellphones to those professional cellphones to those professional phones to those professional .
And if I can , I try to try to try to get those more strange .
Many of them are blocked out of faces , etc .
Some of here is a series of photographs -- etcolums .
This is a Noththree-Decter Can Dr.
We can go from the poster to the poster of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is taking data from yet , collective memory of how to applies the earth , from visual point of view -- and college , and college .
All those pictures become connected together , most of the parts of the parts .
You have a model of the ground that emerge .
Think about this as a prolent of Stephen Lawler on the virtual Earth .
It &apos;s something that growing in complexity as a hand that people use it , and the amount of the people use to use it .
Their pictures are mark with metadhert metadhert by other people .
If someone comes to contrast all these several several severing several , my picture of Noththtrial Dimprovises of Nothththin , and I can use the switch of all those data , and I can use the picture of all those data , and I can use the pictures of anyone , and have a social experience of all those of the chases of the kind of choss-model .
Of course , a consequence of all of this are very very , extremely elaborate , and the college of the earth , and from satellitarians and from satellitarians and satellitarians and similar images , but from collective memory .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What your software is that at a certain point , in the next few years , all the photographs shared by anyone in the world , all the photographs , all the photographs shared together ?
BA : Yeah . What &apos;s doing in practice is to find .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , if you want , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the contains of the pictures .
And it becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of the sea of wish information that many of these images .
As when you make a research of images on the web , you get a senter and the head on the picture of the picture .
Now , what happens if that picture , you know , if that pictures ?
So , the amount of interconnection and the amount of wealth that &apos;s really huge . It &apos;s a classical effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really unbelievable .
BA : You &apos;re very rinning .
One of the main pleases when you travel and one of the news of the ethnic research is the power of the living in the wind of the traditions , between who have the past in the wind , the past in the wind , the wind , the floor , and he &apos;s in the floor of the plants .
Bastes thinking that Jagar Jagar travel still over the Via Lattea , or that the Milky of the Inuit &apos;s still column of the Inuit &apos;s still constantly significance , or Himalayas , the bad of Dharm , to remember the central importance of Dharm , to remember the world that we live in the world that we live in the world we live live in living no sense , but it &apos;s just a model , but it &apos;s just a model , is just a model , but it &apos;s just a model of the central model of the world ,
the conset of a particular set of a particular set that our stirs has done , well , or a bad , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential .
We all naked . We all procreating .
We are subjects at the beginning .
We have to death the inexorability of death , so it doesn &apos;t surprising if we &apos;re standing and ballim --
We all have a art .
What hit is the particular is the particular rhythm of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that they are the Penan forest of the Borneo , or the follow-up of Haiti , or the Haiti &apos;s World Wist Kaisut , or the Kenya , or a sameling camels in the Sahara .
He was my journey of journey in the desert of yak in the valley of yak in the valley of the Everest , on the Everest , the mother of the world .
All populations teaching us , there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of move in the world .
And , if you reflect a moment , it &apos;s a concept that you can give you hope .
Insive , the cultures of the world creating a girl of spiritual life and cultural life that &apos;s important to the planet , and it &apos;s important for the benefits of the planet as a biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural girls as a cultural nosphere , and you can call the nosphere , the total of all the concepts , dreams , ideas , inspirations , inspirations , inspirations , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitiitions , holding the whole of the consciously ,
The ethnosphere is the fantastic patrimony of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how inquisitive species .
And because the biosphere was free consumed by the way , as it happened to the ethnosphere and too much quickly .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all the species was on the extinction of the extinction of the extinction of the biological diversity -- in the most apocalitty , in the camp -- and you don &apos;t even even have to be more than the optimistic diversity -- that &apos;s the most of the cultural diversity .
The whole window of this is , of course , the language .
When you were born , there were 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only composed by a vocabulary or a series of grammad .
A language is the spray of human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle with any culture in the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a bind , a bind , a thought , a piece of spiritual possibility .
And those 6,000 languages , as we are sitting at Monterey , at least half no longer in the ears of children .
They don &apos;t come to teach children , who &apos;s like , which is , less you watch something , which is already .
What is more trists of being flowed by the silence , the last to be the last to talk to a language , not a way of transmit wisdom or to be wisdom of the children , or anticipate the promise of the children ?
This is horring is the state of somewhere in the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks , and a nice , and he brings with a tomb .
And I know somebody who &apos;s going to say , &quot; Isn &apos;t that ?
The world wouldn &apos;t be better if we &apos;re talking all the same language ? &quot; So , we all talk all talk to all the yoruba . We &apos;re going to go to the canton .
Let &apos;s talk .
You &apos;re going to be a trouble , what it means don &apos;t want to talk about your language .
Today I &apos;d like to do a journey through the ethnosphere --
a little journey in the ethnosphere to give you a surface of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , &quot; there &apos;s a lot of us exists of exists .
We take for example this Barasana Barasana , in Amazon , the population of anaconda , the population of anaconda , which creat the middle of the latest watching of the watch of sacred .
It &apos;s a population that &apos;s not able color , because the blue color blue from the green because the cells is identified in the forest of the forest , which dependent of the population .
They have a strange language and a master , &quot; Law language , &quot; you have to move a person who park the language of a different language .
All this has radical in the mythological past , but the particularity is that in these families that are talking or seven or languages , or seven languages no languages .
They limiting to listening and then they start to talk .
We take one of the most interesting tribe with which I lived , the Waoran of Ecuador Eastern Ecuador , an incredible population , a incredible population that has had the first contatts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five measure out a touch that contact a constantly constantly .
They &apos;ve done from the photographs that they were reversing them in poses that they had been advice , forest that this population of pluvial forest pluvial forest .
They hold the ground pictures , they turned it to the research of a shape or a shape and , not find nothing , they have concled that it was diables , and they kill the five missionaries with the liance .
But Waoran doesn &apos;t only kill the strange .
They were killed by their own .
54 percent of mortality was caused by them .
We &apos;re sitting at eight generations and we found two of natural deaths and when we &apos;ve got a lot of them , they have been investigation that one of them was actually invected , and then they kill it the same . Risate every way , they had an incredibly knowable to be incredibly knowable to be incredible forest .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urina from 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned a very interesting compiece when my Harvard professor was asked if I wanted to go to Haiti to intrum in the secret of Dualier and Tonton Minn &apos;s power and Tonton Mininside the Sores , and imposed to the fast fast to the zome zome .
To give a sense to miracy , I should have to understand the Vodoun culture . And that the Vooo is not magic .
It &apos;s a very complex metaphysics of the world .
Many interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Budhism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that Africa is sub-Saharan has no religious faith . And he investigation is not religious . And he was not other than the distilled of the nails of these very profound religious religious .
What makes interesting about the voot is the intense relationship between life and death .
So , you live in the spirits .
The spirits can be invoded by the Great Aqua , they say , and they replace to the dance of the dance of the dance of the vive in a short way that for a short , that we &apos;re going to the goes .
So , the voodooists love say , &quot; You go to the wonderful God .
We &apos;re dancing in the temple and become God . &quot;
And from the moment that you &apos;re playing , is the spirit that you , as you can do the mal of ?
So you &apos;re assists to these incredible events : followed in the state of trance that touches touches infuel .
I &apos;ve all the popules with which I lived the most extraordinary people are the Kogi in the Nevada Santa Marta , in Colombia , in Colombia , Colombia .
She &apos;s going to ancivilization , that once was a living on the careful planes of Colombia , the population of the conquist , the population was wonderful willing that you hert on the wind surrounds .
In a druged continent , this population was never conquered by the spagners .
And I &apos;m government today , they &apos;re government , but their formation is extraordinary .
The young people come up from the families , and three or four years , and they live secret in a huge world , and they live in a hair , and bombs in the basic basic hair for 18 years .
Two periodes of nine years , in the nine months of gestation that transmitted in the mother of the mother , now I &apos;m metaphor , I &apos;m metaphor in the uter of the Mther .
So , this is happened to be acculated to their society , values that they are predicted their price and only their price and only their price and their price and only to say the balance of the cosmic balance .
At the term of this incredible initiation , they come improvising out and for the first time , 18 years , they see a falong . And in that actim of the first bad of the first basic bad , when the soles the values of the first bad , the basic , when the soles the bad of the landscapes , everything that &apos;s confiring . And the preciate a passion-forward and says , &quot; The pret a pass back and says , &quot; The prevailed ,
&quot; I &apos;m going to be ? I &apos;m like you .
It &apos;s studied . Now it &apos;s now to you protect it . &quot;
It &apos;s called fratelers and say that we , frackets , frackles , we are the holds of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about Indigene populations and the old history of the non-vage of the non-vage history , which is a razy concept in his simplicity or maybe we invoded to Thoreau and say that these people are more close to the Earth of us .
The Indigenes are not nor sentimental waste from the nostalgets .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the world paludies of Astat or in the gelids of Tibet , but thank you to have a mistic mystic of the Earth , they created a mistic of the Earth , not on the concept of the maintains , but a concept that the Earth can only live because it &apos;s only infuse from consciously consciously consciously infuse from the consciously consciously consciously fought .
What does it mean ?
It &apos;s a little bit of the Ande who grows up the mountain is a Mountain a Mountain the Apu that will be a deep human beings , and it &apos;s going to be a deep human report with the mountain or the mountain , or that &apos;s a little girl , or that &apos;s a mountain a Montana of Montana that growing a mountain is a mountain .
which is the demour of a spirit or a mineral cow , or a mineral cer .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that &apos;s interesting is the metaphor of the natural world .
I grew up in the forest of the Columbia cred-up , and they were creating that the forest serve to be cut .
And that I got a different human being from my friends Kwakiutl Kwakiutl that creates the forest are the Hukuk &apos;s dimour of the paradise of the paradise and the spirits that live in the northern of the world , the spirits that live in the Hamatator of the world , the Hamatap .
If you start to look at that these cultures can actually make different realities , you can start some of the sensationally understand some of them .
I took this picture to open up in the noroccurred in the noroccurred .
Mayahuge of you have heard about the ayahuge suspsychoactive of the repertoire of the repertoire .
What it makes the eye eayahuge is not the potential drug of susance , but it &apos;s a standing . It &apos;s about two elements .
It &apos;s a side , this lian lady that &apos;s a series of that contains a series of the homes and harmful , slightly .
Ping the sun plant , you have a blubasic phils that alters a little bit of the consciousness , but it &apos;s choia , it &apos;s choia with the floor of the basic of the family of the caffecting of the hand of a traveling .
This plants , this plants , very similar to the serotonin the serotonin the serotonin five , methoxyltryltryptamine-five , methodd .
If you ever see Yanomami , the Yanomami , the susance that they do by a different set of species , which is methoxyltryltryptami .
Tiring that pollution on the nose is a little bit like being disappeared by a little bit of the eye of the eyes of electricity .
I was often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who took the psychedelic was psychedelic , with his discovery of the allucinogenages in the &apos; 30 in Mexico .
Secondly , my tanks can &apos;t classifly , these triptaminogens because if you &apos;re doing not telling any of being .
It &apos;s possible to be absolutely only if you could make chemicals that money money to the MAO .
Now , the beautiful : the Boil : the British of MAO , the same kind of MAO , the same kind of necessary , the same kind of necessary . The question of the sources of the things that are in a flow , in a flow of 80,000 species of plants , as they make these are deaths , but if you combined in this way , they make a version , creating a version that &apos;s sustaining in this way , but of the parts ?
We use the great eupheral of the provide and the herror , which can reveal .
But if we ask to Indians , they &apos;ll say , &quot; plants talk about . &quot;
What does it mean ?
This tribes , Cofan , 17 varieties of ayahuge , which is netically in the forest , and our eyes would come into the same species .
If we ask him how they stabilises are going to tell us , &quot; I thought , &quot; I was thinking about that , you don &apos;t know ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : 17 varieties in a night of the full and each one will song with a different tone .
With this is not laurea Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting that contact the stami .
Now , &#91; &#91; &#91; &#91; &#91; &#93; &#93; the problem is that also the problem of us that have to the other people who have to be powerful people , but somehow reduces to our real history of the history of the real world , and pass .
In fact , the 21th century , 300 years , it &apos;s not remember for his wars or innovations , but rather as the one of the way we stopped and we have abled and we have abuntil the waste of the mass of the biological diversity and we have abulsive district . Now the problem issue is not changing .
All cultures , in the centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibilities .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians are not standing to be Six when they put up up in the arc and fall as well as well as Americans have no Americans when they put up up in the horse and hot .
It &apos;s not change or technology that threatens the integrity of ethnic . It &apos;s the power .
The domination of domination .
And if you look at the world , you &apos;ll discover that these are not destiny cultures .
They are living and dynamics out of the hydynamics of hyentifiable forces that go beyond the capacity of adaptation .
And the typical disboses in the patria of the Penan --
a population of Sarawak , in the south Asian , a population that lived free in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to a generation , and now reduced to the result of the river of the river , where you can see the river of the Bornear Cinese , where the named Merize that the Japanese Merian , where the naves the Japanese , where the navailums , and the next to the horest , and the next titled of the rest of the rest of a graduinside of the result of the holding of the ress , and the ress of the ress , and the ress , and the major
It &apos;s about style stives with the wood law to the forest .
Or in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that have come with the discovery of the gold .
If we move on the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you see the volt of political domination .
You know , the physical genocide , physics of a population , but the ethnium of the universal level , but the ethnium of life a population , not only condanted , but also , it &apos;s not only condanted in the development , because it &apos;s part of the development .
And you can &apos;t understand the Tibet suffering in the way .
I &apos;ve got the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in the West China in Western China , as well , as a young college , but only only came to Lhasa , but only came to Lhasa , but only came to Lhasn , I realized what &apos;s behind .
6,000 sacrates standing sacred and centers .
1.2 million people killed from the military Rivolution .
The father of this guy was absolutely to the Panchen Lama .
which is that means that it was killed to the time of Chinese invasion .
And Suo , I was sitting with Santity during the deaspores that brought the population in Nepal .
Souther was imprisoned and his colpage was rich .
It was hidden of two nails at the age of two nases , he was named to his grandmother because he wouldn &apos;t have lived without .
The sister , who made the same , was put in the same , was put in the result of reeducation .
A day has inavvered a day fashion Mao and , for this transground , and for this transgression , was put forced to seven years .
The Tibet of Tibet can be insatiades , but the spirit of the population is from holding .
At the end , it &apos;s all reduces to a choice .
We want to live in the world world &apos;s world , or we want to collect the policromatical world or we want to collect the policycical world ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before we die said that her biggest fear that , in our love to this amorous amorous amorous of the world , we &apos;ll only see the whole amorous of human imagination , but a day , a day , we &apos;re wake up from a landscape , but a day we &apos;re wake up to us to be able to be able .
And it &apos;s uilant to remember our species is existed for 60,000 years .
The Neolitic Rivolution , which has given us the agriculture , which has done us to the cult of the sees of the sees , and by the slide of the slip , and by the next to the cler , creating the gerarchy of specialization , and we &apos;re talking about 10,000 years ago .
The industrialized world , it &apos;s 300 years old .
The challenges that history , I &apos;m not suggested that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to go .
When these cultures of the world is asked what it is to say to be human , they say , &quot; Are 10,000 voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all rediscover the possibility of being what we are : a consciously , that it must be what we are , and all the garden , and all the gardens can flow . And there &apos;s great moments .
I took this picture on the north of the north of Baffin , when I went to the hundred of bales with Inuit , and this man , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , Olayas , he told the wonn of his nonen .
The government has not always been gentile with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to stabilie our prematise , we have rink them in colonies .
The grandfather refused to go .
And the family , I &apos;m going to his life , he brought up , and all his tools .
You have to know that Inuit doesn &apos;t teme the cold , they don &apos;t get it .
The slites were in origins were made of fish flowers in the career of caribs .
The grandfather of this man wouldn &apos;t have to be intimiddle of the artica or of the lizard that was suffer .
It &apos;s basic , it &apos;s hot the basic purs in the skin of focus and defecated in their hand . When I did the frog , it worked creating a lama .
He spring out on the dots of this crows , and when I was solid , and when I was solid , he was killed a dog .
He schools schools and created a bria , with the house casses , he has a sleep , he gave a sleep on the banchisa , and it &apos;s slide on the banchisa , and it &apos;s slightly .
We want to talk about cavarsela with nothing ?
In the 1999 , the sanks of the California control the total control of a largest of the California and the Texas I was in the California and the Texmed exmessed .
It &apos;s their new patria . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a territory territory . They controlate all the mineraries .
One splendid-like example of the nation-state can recognize with his population .
And finally , finally , I think it &apos;s rather obvious at least who was in these wildlife of the planet , make it connects that they are not remote .
And for somebody &apos;s house .
They know , the setions of the human imagination that &apos;s human imagination that &apos;s rising at the time . And for all of these children , as the dreams of our children , become part of the swwimming .
For finally , we National Geographic , we are convints that political never come to anything .
We believe that polemy --
&#91; Applausi &#93; are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and perhaps we have the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month to tell us the world . Every month , our website , and perhaps we have .
156 countries our television .
Our revists are slands from millions of people .
Our work is to travel in the ethnosphere to bring our public to bring up the swich , and hope , you hope , they &apos;re hoping , and hope , hopefully , hope to be hope , and hope , hopefully , the world of the central reveal of life , and we have to find a lifestyle in a world of the lifestyle world and multicultural resultical resultural results , and we have to find a style .
where the wisdom of all the population can contribute to our collective benefits .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope records , and I &apos;m going to try to evidentiate some connections , in case , not notice .
I &apos;d like to start with what I call &quot; the dogma officer . &quot;
The dogma dogma dogma dogma ?
The dogma dogma of all of the West industrial society , &quot; The dogma offices : &quot; If we want to male the benefits of our citizens &quot; &quot; The way to do it is to male the individual liberty . &quot;
The reason is , from a side , in fact that liberty is in the same value , is precious , is precious , for the essential , for humans .
As the other is in fact that if we are free , each of us can act to do everything that maximizing our benefits , without any one that decided in names our .
The way to male the liberty is to male the choice .
More choices people have , more libers , and most of them , most of the liberty , most of them .
This is , I think , it &apos;s so deeply radicated in the society that nobody would have dream of putting it in the right .
And it &apos;s also deply radicated in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I hope a simple note on the conditions for insalt .
In my supermarket , there &apos;s 175 conditions , without contextreme oil , and the 12 of oil , and 12 acets that you can buy for you to buy a huge number of conduct in the result of conditions that nobody &apos;s 175 proned is to you a huge circumstance .
Here &apos;s the supermarket .
And then you go to the electronic to buying a stereo : case , letters , CD , radio , radio , radio , radio , radio , letters .
And in this single negotide , there &apos;s a big number of audio .
We can make six and a half million combinations using components that there are in a negotized .
You need to admit that there is a very much choice .
Other fields : the world of the communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the serve phone of the desire , and the bat that they were fornes , and they were forned by the mom Bell .
And she was born the phone , and he didn &apos;t bought it .
A consequence of that , in the other , was that the phone had never been caught .
These are days .
Now we have a variety of telephones , especially , specially between the cellphones .
Here &apos;s the cellphones of the future .
My favorite is in middle , MMP3 , MP3 , cut the nose , and the broken for the brules .
If you don &apos;t have seen in the house under the house , you &apos;re certain that it &apos;s going to be .
And what &apos;s the end is that people get in the news and does this question . And you know what the answer ? The answer is &quot; No .
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell that doesn &apos;t make too much things .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the acquire , it &apos;s the same explosion of choices .
Asanitarian sistence : not happens in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor and doctor , what you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do , or whatever , and these benefits . &quot; It &apos;s these benefits . &quot; And these benefits . What do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Dr. &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A has these benefits and these benefits , and these benefits . &quot;
&quot; What do ? &quot;
And you rebats , &quot; Dr. If she was me , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result of the malseem , &quot; expression that makes it seems to be a beautiful thing .
But it &apos;s actually not a fish and responsibility to make decisions of taking anybody who knows something , which is the doctor , which is the doctor , and whatever certainly , and so it &apos;s not in the ideal condition to make true patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing products , direct to people like me and you , and if you think about it , and you , that if you think there &apos;s no sense , because we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why do it ?
The answer is that they want to be called the doctor to ask to change the recise .
Something that is basically as our hythentity is a question of choice , as you see in this watch as you see in this watch . &quot; We &apos;re going to hold their sx right now . &quot; We don &apos;t want to be an identity : We don &apos;t want to be an identity : we have to inventing .
And we can reinvented us how many times us .
which means that every morning , to be able to be able to be .
I puts at the family and the mathor , a time , the next common , source , and it was that you could , and the most of the most possible possible , and he started to make the most of possible .
The only choice was with who , and not even when , and not even , and nothing that &apos;s going to do after .
Ogyday , it &apos;s really to play .
I teach in a very intelligent students , and I do their 20 percent in the work of a time .
And not because they &apos;re less shark , not because they are less diligence .
Because I &apos;m impensieritites , I should you say , &quot; I should move it ? &quot;
&quot; I should move more tards ? I have to think about the children or career ? &quot;
They are logorant .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this implement not to completely totally companies and not to get a beautiful watching my exame .
And they have to do that . I &apos;m asking the importantly .
Now , the work : We are lucky , as Carl was , because technology allowed us to work every minute , every day , from Hotel Randolph .
In the parentests , there &apos;s a angoline , and I &apos;m not going to anybody , where WiFi works .
I don &apos;t say , because I want to use it .
What it means , this amazing liberty of choice that we have to continue , and we have to continue , if we have to work or not .
We can go to the switch , with the cell phone in a task , Blackberry in the other , and the basic basic , on the ginocy .
And even if they &apos;re all spended , every minute that we see our son , we &apos;re also wondering the partner , we &apos;re going to spending , &quot; I have to spend this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have to spend this ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , &quot; that makes the experience of your child , very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , from whatever we look at , little things and big , and the materials and the things , life is a choices .
Once the world was this : Over , there were some possibilities , but not a choice of choice .
The world today looks like this : The dilemma is , &quot; Is it a positive thing ? &quot;
The answer is Short .
And we all know , we know all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative ones .
This choice is two negative effects negative effects on people .
The first , paradoxally , is that produces are paralysis that liberation .
With many of options that choice , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I offer a meaning example : a study conduct on the plans of volunteer .
A college has been access to the data of Vanlook , the giant society of the sources of a million customers in 2000 companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that &apos;s going to every 10 solutions that are offered by two percent .
With 50 funds of offered , there &apos;s 10 percent more adesions than when I &apos;m available to five . Why ?
Because with 50 funds between the sources , and it &apos;s disease , is dieded to decide , and the choice is remanded to the indomorange .
And by domain , and still domain , domain , domain , domain , domain , and of course , domain &apos;t .
You know , it doesn &apos;t mean , these works food workers , because they don &apos;t have enough money , because they don &apos;t have enough money , you also want to say that the decision is so obstic that they also lost the complementary of the job .
Not participating , they &apos;re losing to five dollars from the work , who would be wouldn &apos;t be going to be going to be going to be going to be .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think that makes the world like this .
&quot; And finally , for the eternity : ketchup , or mayor or mayor ? &quot;
You would like to be right to take the right decision , if it &apos;s for ethernity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and neppursue the wrong .
So , this is the first effect . The second is that even if we could avoid paralysis , and we &apos;re less satisfying on the result of how we would be with less options that choose .
And that &apos;s a different reasons .
A lot of these is that with a lot of conditions , if you buy a choice , and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have been better . And that &apos;s that &apos;s that you could have been better . And that &apos;s that &apos;s that alternative imagined us , and the replaced the choice , and the replaced the full of the choice , and the repieces of the choice , and the replef of the reployed , and it &apos;s full the swaites that you could have been . And that you could make a better choke . And that you can &apos;t get a different choke .
even when it was a very good decision .
More choices there , more it &apos;s easier to displease of choices that it &apos;s inherent of choice .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has asked a lot of printing , as the value that we &apos;re depending with things that we are .
In rest , when there are so many options , it &apos;s easy to be the attractive characteristic of alternative alternative and be less satisfying of the option that is choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I wrote with all those who are not New York .
But that &apos;s what you probably would think .
There &apos;s this coppia coppia .
A place of lussize .
It &apos;s splendida . Otyma days . It &apos;s all for them .
Nothing . But what he thought is , &quot; Well , maledition , is Agost . &quot;
&quot; All my nearest Manhattan are away . &quot;
&quot; I could talk about the house . &quot;
And it &apos;s a two-weeks , and it &apos;s going to be dying -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The costo-opportunity is decreating the sod-on the oil is that we have , even when choice was except .
And the most of the options that we have to consider , the most attractive characteristics will return out to the construct of the cost .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
We talking about the living time , and perhaps of living .
But the most important point is that you choice , you choose , you choose to not do other .
The things that we don &apos;t choice that we &apos;re going to make less attractive what we do .
Tirst : spiral growing up the expectations .
I tried it on my skin bought a new jeans .
I &apos;m going to almost always jeans .
And once the jeans were a kind of beside , and bought out of the best , they were dissims , only after they had them brought a lot of times , they started to go right .
So I went to buy a new pair when the old ones were landed , and I said , &quot; I &apos;m going to go , &quot; I need a couple jeans , this is my table . &quot;
The committed to me , &quot; Who wants to slifting , relaxy ? &quot;
He wants with the naked or bottons ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I &quot; Stonewashed , &quot; or &quot; hats &quot; ?
&quot; Where , &quot; Would you stream ? &quot;
&quot; Sow the basic or streets ? Bla bla bab .
I was balance , and after a little bit , and after a little bit of , &quot; I want to say , &quot; I want to the guy , &quot; He had no idea what was , so I was , so for a little jeans , I was going to use out of the best , I gave out of the best jeans , I gave , with the best jeans I &apos;ve ever had .
It was the best . With all the choice I got the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a book at the hair .
The reason I was worse , the reason I was worse with all the expectations were high , jeans had to be perfect .
At the beginning I had minime . I didn &apos;t expect anything about it when there was only one kind of 100 different , lacters , at least one kind of 100 different , hundred of hundred , at least one guy was perfect .
What I was buying was buying , but not perfect .
After paragoned that choice with what I was trying to insoon on the expectations .
The advice of options in the people don &apos;t make expectations that these have been in the expectations of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of options in the living things .
And that is going to make less satisfying , even when the results are good .
No one in the world of marketing if it makes it .
Because if they knew it , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more to this .
&quot; It was better when it was worse when he was worse , &quot; The reason it was better when you were worse when he was worse , when he was worse you could meet surprised .
Oggiday , in the world we live -- opulent , citizens with the expectancy of perfection -- the most of the maxpatterns that we can hope is that things are in the heighborhood .
You never have been surprised because your expectations , my expectations , they &apos;re ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you are here -- is , &quot; Well , &quot; Well , &quot; You want to , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , you want . &quot;
I mean , little autobiographic moment , which I &apos;m actually moving and my wife is really study .
I couldn &apos;t have to do better , I didn &apos;t have to be told .
But it &apos;s not always a brutt thing .
And finally , a consequence of buying a couple jeans scomfortable when there &apos;s only that kind of jeans is that when you &apos;re not satisfied , and ask you say , &quot; Why ? &quot;
Who is responsible ? &quot;
The world is responsible . What could I do ?
When there are hundred types of jeans , and you buy , and you wonder who is responsible , and you wonder who is responsible , you know , the responsible to you .
You could have better better .
With hundreds of dispon-up varieties , there &apos;s no discussing for the insuccess .
So when people are decisions , even though the result is valid , they feel inherself and they give the colpath to their own .
In the last years , the last depression is exploss in the industrialized world .
I believe a fattor meaning -- not the only one , but the important -- but the important -- of this depression of depression is that people have experiences of the standard because standard are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation thought that the colpsyches is they think that the colpurn is .
So the final result is that we &apos;re better better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the dogma dogma , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely false . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than it doesn &apos;t have to have a little bit better than a little bit of choice , and it &apos;s better than a little bit .
There is a critical value , I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure that we have surface from a piece of the level that choices better our life .
Now , from political point of view -- I &apos;ve almost finished -- from the political point of view , the nocle is the following .
What it &apos;s allowed to the industrial in industrial society is the material wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , which is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too little bit .
So the facility of the modern I &apos;m talking about is a malbeing of modern , recidesis .
And what it does to do is to depresent is this : Steve Levitt talked about how I was talked about yesterday and comfortable seats for bibs are useful . It &apos;s a waste of money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and dispendent , it &apos;s not that they &apos;re just useful .
I &apos;m going to be deleteries .
They make worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows , it &apos;s been revered in those where people have too few possibilities , it would not only be the better lives , but also our better life to be better , but also our better life .
This is what economists call a paretian improvement .
A reduce of the reduction is good at all -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in except that goes us .
To conclude , &quot; You can become everything you want to become everything you want to --
You , you think , you &apos;re thinking , &quot; What does that believe ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious you can &apos;t make anything in a glass of glass . &quot;
A castrated imagination , a limited vision of the world -- &quot;
and I &apos;m interpret , so I interpret , in the beginning .
But then , you think about , instead , I realized that fish the weight .
Because the fact of the fact of the facts is that if you eat the broke , so that , &quot; everything is possible . You can &apos;t get the freedom .
If you run the switch as it as it can be diminuit &apos;s possible diminuit .
You blow the paralysis , and you reduced the benefits .
