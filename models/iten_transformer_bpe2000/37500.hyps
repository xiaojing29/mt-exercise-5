Last year I showed these slide to show that the calotta glacial , which for almost three million years has had the size of the 48 continental United States , 40 percent .
But this submit up , the gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the spent of the ice .
The arctic glacial is , in a sense , the pulsing heart of the global climatical system .
You expanding around the summer and retreatment .
The next slide is going to be a rapid cared on on the advice of the last 25 years .
The ice lennia are signed in red .
And you see , they expand they expand down to the blue .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter , which is retreated .
You can see that the ice ice ice , the cost-told ice , of five years or more , it &apos;s like the blood , which is where the blood comes from the body .
In 25 years , it went on , in the way .
This is a problem because the rescaling frog , the gllacier around the ocean arctic amount of carbon congested , which , shoulder , and they &apos;re slightly transformed in metane from the microbes .
I &apos;m putting to the totality of the atmosphpheric inquation , that amount might radically rate , super-h-hand , surgery , super-hand .
In some laghi short laghi in Alaska , the metane is already rebecting from the water .
The professorehit Katey Walter University of Alaska was based with a team pressed a team pressed .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : She &apos;s good . The question is if we &apos;re going to be .
A reason is that this term , the term scening the Greenland from north .
This is a rub to the glacial .
The cared didn &apos;t have reached levels like this .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the southeast of Greenland .
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea level for the ice short of ice ice on the land , here is where it &apos;s reaching the sea .
These roughly are increasing .
An the other side of the planet : Antarctor of ice ice ice ice ice ice block .
The month , the scientists have diclosed that the balance of ice is in negative , and that the Antarctica , which the Antarctica , which is particularly rapid , which is particularly rapid in the square .
Equiving six feet of the watch , like Greenland .
Sull Himalayas , the third biggest block of ice , you see new laghi , which a few years ago , which a few years ago , they were ice .
40 percent of the world population is going to be able to be able water by that short site .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the water of this city .
The card is increased .
But when it comes up , it &apos;s the same thing is going on to water .
In California , the snow on Sierra Nevada is 40 percent .
The house hits are in crisis .
The predictions , as you read , are graves .
The growing growing set in the world leads to a remarkable increase .
The environmental disaster are increasing a rhythm out of the normal and without precedented .
Four times more numerous than the last 30 years of the precedented 75 .
This is a whole thing that is an unsustainable .
If you look in the historic context , if you can see the consequences .
For the last five years we &apos;ve added 70 tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of tons in the oceans every day .
Look at the East Pacific area , from American , towards the American , and on the obvious , and on the obvious parts of Indian , where there &apos;s a radical impoverments .
Most of the global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fuel .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with more emissions , together at China .
And it was proposition of building a lot of other central central .
But we &apos;re seeing a change of direction .
These are the annyled in the last years and some alternative high-green proposes .
At every way , there &apos;s a political lost in our country .
The carbon industries and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon clean , which is a hospital .
That picture me up to something --
Very Natal , in Tennessee , where I lived , there was a lost of 3.8 billion pounds of carbon .
You may have seen it on the news .
This is the second biggest flow of scories in America .
It happened around Natal .
The publishing of one carbon industries industries was this .
Video : My carbon , the carbon is a kind of alleground and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it &apos;s going to grow our economy .
Might the carbon is more and more clean .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and work , adorable and work machining the stipendent .
Al Gore : From here , there &apos;s a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest society on the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administration .
Don Blankenship : Don Blankening -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosis , Harry Reid -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Protection of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is one of them , a part .
Video : At COALergy , we see the climate change as a sery tiny tiny ,
So our priority is invest a big amount of money in a bad effort to make public effort to make public and confused the truth .
In fact , the carbon is not sporting .
We think it &apos;s clean , it also has a good profuman .
So , not preoctation of change .
Let me do this .
Video : Ator : Carbone -- you &apos;ve heard that -- you &apos;ve heard a lot of you .
So let &apos;s look at a clean up in a advancing .
Stradicary ! Maches are a little bit of noise , but this is the sound of the carbon technology .
The carbon consumption is between the main causes of global warming , but the needed technology of the clean clean night that you see changes everything .
Do a look at : this is the carbon technology of clean clean .
Al Gore : Inally , the positive alternative alterm , and the economic issue and the economic security .
Video : Sem is in America is in the economy , the national security , the national security , climate crisis .
The philos that connects all : our dependence of fossils , like the heads and the oil .
Now , perhaps there is a new , audace for it &apos;s circumit .
Repower : 100 percent of the power , 10 years .
A plan to remit America to make safer , make us safety , and help to stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that &apos;s going to solve our problems .
Repower . Scom . You &apos;re reading more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : That &apos;s about reducing energy to America .
One of the fastest ways to get to the dependence of the combustible that kill our planet .
Compared : The future is here . I &apos;m sunclear , a new energy network .
She &apos;s got a novi of investment places for places of work .
Comming : I &apos;m going to be realistic .
Al Gore : A afraid , they say , &quot; If you want to go speed , you go to it .
If you want to go away , go together . &quot;
We need to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED I did a LHC .
And I promise to return to you about how the machine works .
So here I fix . And for those that the other time , there was no , LHC is is the biggest scientific experiment ever tried -- 27 kilometers of circumference .
His task is to rerequires that were present less than a billion second from the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
All is just environment .
This is the spot under Ginevening .
We photographing these mini-Bang Bang in the relevators .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- is 44 feet .
This is an executive image picture of ATLAS in buildings so you can notice the proportions .
The 10 section of last year we &apos;ve got accent machine for the first time .
And this photo was taken by ATLAS .
It was cause of immense festeger in control room .
It &apos;s a picture of the first phasm that he made all the way around LHC , entering , and it into collision , with a part of the LHC , and it &apos;s hard , and spread particles in the resevator .
In other words , when we see that picture , we see that image , we realized that the machine worked , which is a great vitting .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to do it , when somebody went to Google and saw that the beginning page was this .
That means we &apos;ve had a cultural impact over to the scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , it had to these files here -- these dored files .
These files are bringing 13,000 ampounds when the machine works to the powerful power .
Now , technical technical in you and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . They &apos;re too unlike too much . &quot;
And they can do that because when they &apos;re very cold became the superconducted ,
So , unless 271 degrees , at a free temperature at the space between stars , these files can bring that run .
In one of the juntures between the most of the novemila in LHC , there was a fect fabrication .
So the files surprising down , and the 13,000 ampitch , and the 13,000 ampounds improvising an electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressionating if you think these magnets more than 20 tons , and that have been moved of about 30 inches .
They &apos;re damaged about 50 magnets .
We had to get them , what we did .
We resisted them and travel .
Now they &apos;re coming back all right now , they &apos;re all right now .
Big the end of marzo LHC is , it &apos;s going to be new integrate .
We &apos;re going to accenate it , and we expect data to get right or slum , and continue our adventure to discover what the morning is the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these accidents reather the dibate on the value of science and engineering . It &apos;s easy to confuture .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s the value , I think that is the value of things like LHC .
I &apos;d like to end with the words of a Ingan scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , I imagine , I imagine in the inuseful experiments of his stand-to-use bledrive , his stmichael Faraday , he said , &quot; No is so dangerous for the progress of the human mind that science , which our own own own measure that ideas of science , which our triumputs are not conquered , and our triumped ,
Thank you .
I want to start asking , to rethink when , as children , played , as children , played .
While you know how to get it and run them , take them and get them , learning and move them , learned , and they learned , and manipulating relationship to realize and manipulation .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , from information , as an inspired by our interaction with physicists objects , together my own Patre , and my collaborator Jeevan Keevan Kalanithi , I started asking me , &quot; And if we &apos;re going to have the gone , inspire a computer , we could have the digital desktop , we could run a desktop , we could consciously afferating a desktop , we could run a desktop ,
and systems our ploymous ?
The question was so interesting , we decided to explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big computer interactive computer as a birth .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big computer interactive computer as a birth .
You can move them with your hand , you can see , &quot; you know , &quot; you &apos;re saying that movement and they have a screen and a radio wireless .
But above , I &apos;m physical objects , like the morning , you can move just in the midle .
Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physical , consciousness , consciousness , and as as they become more physical , and as they become more physical , of other people , how we move them , we can explore new and fun style .
I &apos;m going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configurated to show , if you just incline in a direction , the video , the video , the way it will rotate on the other side back .
These are interactive realized realized realized realized remarkable .
If you say , you know , you &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re around .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they notice it and they can get a little bit .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they notice it and they can get a little bit .
They &apos;re going to be their moving and including .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power to use communicate gestures , &quot; a color like , &quot; a color as a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable , as a century of the versor and I can use them to be able , where they measured to be configure out .
and I can use them to be able to be the central , where you measurements are measured .
And if we grew too , we can put a little place .
They also are beautiful possibility of learning , like languages , the mathematics and plowner of logic where people can try things , and see the results of them , and see the results .
Now I &apos;m --
This is a Fibonackage of Fibonacks that I do with a program .
Here we have a game of words that is in Scarabeo and Boggle .
Pratically , at every turn , you get a letter in case , on every Siftable , Pratically , to every turn up a letter to every Sift-As-t-t-up , and cers of the squeen , and while you &apos;re controlling words on a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds are remissing , and you have a new letters and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
And here &apos;s the children came up to the Media Lab , I did so that I did them , and I turned a video .
They &apos;re very placeased .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of interesting things about this kind of thing is that you don &apos;t have to give people many instructions .
You just say , &quot; Compons of words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s some other people who try it .
This is our younger toward , there on the right .
It was actually wanted to implemployed them .
They were only in the morning , for him .
Now , this is an interactive cardboard .
We wanted to build a tool for learning languages . He &apos;s Lui is Felix .
It can put them in the scene , sunglasses in the scene , sunlight , Siftable them .
It can put them in the scene , sunglasses in the scene , sunlight , Siftable them .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : Sun is source .
David Merrill : Now he brought a treator in the scene .
Video : The arange tracks .
Bel work !
So school Siftable and put them neighborhood can make the characters --
Girl : Bau !
and by inventing their story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a story with final final , and it can decide , and it can decide ,
DM : It &apos;s a story with final final , and it can decide , and it can decide ,
Volice : God , cat .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , that &apos;s a recently , to sample and exegue and execting music .
It &apos;s a tool , realized recently , to sample and execting music .
The Siftable is sound like base , base and battery .
Every one of these has four different variations , and you can choose what it is to use .
You can also put these sound sound in a sequence to compose sequence to your placement .
And modificate it just doing a sound , &quot; and a sequence . &quot;
These are effects that you can control from alive , like the reversus and the filter .
The tacks to a particular sound and then including to the way it .
And then there are the general effects like time and volume , which is going to be in sequence .
Let &apos;s look at how it works .
Video : We &apos;re going to start with a base in two Siftable , &quot; sequence , we &apos;re doing it in a series , we extend it , we add it , we add it ,
Now I put a basis line .
Video : Now , I add to percussions --
Video : And I &apos;m going to put the filter battery , so I can control the effect of the battery .
DM : DM : I can speak the entire sequence inating time from one side or another .
Video : And I &apos;m going to add the filter to the ban to give more expression .
Video : DM : I can remember the sequence &quot; to the sequence &quot; to the flight . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to plant it before , but I can suddenly , making it longer or more correct or the correct .
And finally , finally , I can use the entire sequence inating on the left Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is build new man &apos;s interfaces more and more like more like what our brain work and body .
And today , I &apos;ve got time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some possibilities that we &apos;re trying to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to transmit is that it &apos;s coming to this new generation of design objects to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the hour of talking to you all .
I &apos;m a written .
Scool books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the fashion of my life .
And I don &apos;t expect that it can change .
But , said this , something particular happened recently happened in my life and my career , which bring me to realibrate the entire relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called &quot; Mangy , Pregardless , &quot; Ama , &quot; which , a very much of my book , for some reason that I was going to use in the world and become a big , feels , became a became a ler book , became a book , ler .
And the result is that everywhere goes now , people treating me as if I was condanced .
Davigate -- condanced , condanced !
They &apos;re all going to be worried and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t feel you feel that you can &apos;t do you feel better ?
You &apos;re not afraid to continue to write for all life without being able to create a book that can important someone makes somebody ? &quot;
What can you care anybody ? &quot;
It &apos;s rassurant , you know .
But it might go worse , except that I remember more than 20 years ago , when I started saying to people -- I was a adolescent to be a written .
I meet the same reaction based by fear .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t get me to be successful ?
Don &apos;t you fear that the humiliation killing you kill ?
You &apos;re not afraid to do this for all of the lives that nothing was ever out and die on a smoke of under a sleep in the infrants with the mouse of full to full of filled ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yeah , I fear of all those things .
I &apos;ve been afraid .
And I &apos;m afraid of many other things that people might not involved .
As the food and other things .
But , as much about it , what I thought and ask me , I was wonderful , why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logic that anybody who &apos;s waiting to be friendly by a job that you feel to do .
But what &apos;s so particular in the way that you have creative to make us nervous about the mental health , in a way that other career do not ?
Like my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don &apos;t remember of one in its 40 years of activity that he was asked if he was asked if he could be engineer ?
It was never -- that block of John engineer , how do it ?
It wasn &apos;t that , you know ?
Onestly , chemicals as a group have not , in the centuries , in the centuries , in the centuries , have been high depressive lly .
We have enough , we have enough this reputation , and not only writers but creative of every gender , we have this reputation of being enormous instable .
And it &apos;s not going to look at the trists conteains died of the magnific ments that only in the 21st century , they died young people died young and often for hand .
And even those who are not suicidated to be really disapttops from their dons .
Norman Mailer , before I die , in the last interview , in the last interview , in my book killed me a little bit more . &quot; An extraordinary affirmation about their own life .
But we don &apos;t bad when we feel these things , because we heard these things so long that we &apos;ve been completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering and suffering , and the art , it &apos;s going to be in some way balance it &apos;s going to conduce the cord .
And the question I want to ask everybody here today is : are you agree with this idea ?
That &apos;s good -- because it also looks like this -- because it looks from a distance to me , not good for anything that suppose .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous and I don &apos;t want to see it &apos;s perpetuate in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our great minds to live .
And I know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start figure out the host of suppositions , above the surface of the circumstances I &apos;m in my career .
That &apos;s what you look , I &apos;m quite a young people , I &apos;ve about 40 years .
I &apos;ve got about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything write about this is going to be judged by the world as the work that was going to be judged by the way ,
I &apos;m going to be slety , because we &apos;re all the biggest friends is likely to my homing .
Oh , Gesus , who think .
You know this is the kind of thinking that that brings a person to start boundary , and I don &apos;t want to do that .
I would stop doing this work that we do .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it seems to me , after a lot of reflection , which is to make a psychological construct , OK ?
I have to find a security distance between me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxiety of what I &apos;m going to get the reaction will get . And as I was trying to get a landscape on how to do it , you start looking at through the time , trying to see if they could have some better ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthy ideas and healthy , and more several ideas and more healthight . And as I was trying to do it . And as I was trying to w
about how to help people creative to help the inerent inerent inerent risks of creativity .
And that research has brought me to the ancient Green and ancient to me to the ancient Green .
Seguitems because it &apos;s going to get back in a circle and then back .
In ancient , the ancient Green and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity is from men , OK ?
And it was thinking that creativity was this spirit , and that he came to a few distant people , and sell men from some distant and unknown , for reasons , unknown .
The great-to-to-ward divins of creativity &quot; demons . &quot;
Socry , wonderful , believe that he was created to have a demon that elar wisdom .
The Romorrow were the same idea , but they called the kind of a genius .
which is great , because Romans were not really smart that a genius is someone was a particularly intelligent .
And they thought a genius was this kind of entity that was created literally lived in the walls of the study of an artist , a little bit like Dobby , and that came out to hidden the work of the artist and model the result of that work .
Exceptional -- here is the distance of which I talk -- that psychological contruth that you protect from from the results of your work .
And everybody knew that was how it worked , right ?
So the antic artists were protected by certain things , like the narcism too much narcism , right ?
If your work was exceptional , you couldn &apos;t get to the market , everybody knew that you had helped by this genioral genioral .
If your fales work , it wasn &apos;t all all your own all , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a inable .
And so people han conception of creativity in the West for a long time .
And then the Renaising came and everything changed , and nacque this great idea ; we put it to the human being in the center of the universe , and the mysteries and leaving in the creatures that write detail from the divinity .
This was the rational principle and people started to think that creativity was completely from the hydrop .
And for the first time in history , he started to refer to this or that artist as an artist genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think that to allow somebody , a simple person to believe that it &apos;s like a source , the essence and the source of all mysters , creative , unknown and inknown and inknown and inknown and ethern a little bit of huge to give to the basic fragile human psychc .
It &apos;s like somebody to get the sun .
Death and fully distorts and creates all these expectable .
And I think it was this pression to destroy artists in the past 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it &apos;s , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do that different ?
Maybe go back to a more ancient than the relationship between humans and creative mystery .
or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t sing 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people between the audience that there would be a scientific legitimimprovement , inside , income , you make that people sparking the people and they follow people .
And I probably don &apos;t convince you all about this thing .
But the question I &apos;d like to ask is , why not ?
Why don &apos;t you think that way ?
Because it &apos;s more sense than any other thing that I &apos;ve ever heard to explain the exasperant exasperant exasperant .
A process that , as anybody who I &apos;ve ever been trying to do something -- so , fundamentally , everybody here -- knows , you don &apos;t understand rationally .
And in fact , it can be completely paranormal .
I did this met recently with the extraordinary poetc , Ruth Stone , who now 90 years , but that was a poetry for all life and she said that during his childhood in Virginia , working out in the fields , and he heard , and he heard , when a poem came from the landscape .
And he said that it was like a fragorous train .
And she was coming up up up to her landscape .
He felt it , because he was tremendous to be under its feet .
He knew he was to have one thing to do on that point and it was , words , &quot; run like a matter . &quot;
And so it was going to be followed by this poem , and it would not have to get a piece of paper and a fairly faster , and it was faster , as the transplant , and he would requires and deal with it on the page .
Sometimes he couldn &apos;t be fast enough , so correct and correct reverse and correct it was going to go to home and the poetry and she would continue to roll through the landscape , and he kept roll through the landscape , looking , like , &quot; one other poet . &quot;
And there were times -- this piece I &apos;m going to forever -- there were any moments where the was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was looking for paper and the poem passed through , and he was switch a math in while he was swalking , and he was , and he was , and he was offered .
He was walking the poem from the tail and he put it in his body and he travel on the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on perfect and intatta , but the contrary to the contrary , from the last word to the first .
So when I heard it was thinking -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly the same thing .
Not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conducture .
I &apos;m a moving , and my way of work is , and I &apos;m going to wake up to the same orary every day and work and swake up and work and swake up .
But even I , in my test test , I &apos;ve been test against that thing , sometimes .
And I imagine many of you have done .
You know , even though the work and ideas came from a certain source of a source , I could not know it .
And what &apos;s this thing ?
And how can we relate it to do it in a way that we don &apos;t lose the head , but , rather , what do you get healthy ?
And as I &apos;m about , the best example of the contemporary , I &apos;ve been interviewed , which I interviewed a different day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life was the incarnation of the artist , the most of the artist , trying to control , to reach , tops , ask these species of totally pulsed species .
But then he was told , she hoted , and one day as he was driving on a highway in L.A. , changed everything for him .
He was going to be a quick and all of a sent , this little sent , which is coming into its head as inspiration , which comes to its head , and the various , and the various , and the wants , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the desidery , and the desident , but not knows how to get it .
It has no piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a match , it doesn &apos;t have a record .
So it starts to feel this species of old old , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m hostioned by this persemitted song .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to the panic , he stopped .
He was the whole mental process and he did something completely new .
He just looked at the sky and said , &quot; Scususes , don &apos;t see that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; What seems to write a song right now ?
If you really want to be , you know , when I can get a care of you .
Although , you go to important something else today .
You know , Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his process worked changed after this .
Not the work , the work was still hoscure as it always .
But the process , and the anxiety that attornidered the genius , the genius , the genius out of him chap out of it , and liberate it back from where he came up , and realized that it didn &apos;t have to be a interiorized and gained .
but it was going to be this peculiar , wonderful , wonderful , and this external thing that was not Tom .
So I felt that story started changing a little bit even the way I was working and he saved me once .
This idea , he save me when I was writing , &quot; Mangift , &quot; Ama , &quot; and fall in one of those despair that we all have to be working on and we all do on something and we start thinking that it &apos;s going to be a disaster , that the worse book is going to be disaster , that the worse book .
Not only book , right , right the worse book .
And I started thinking about to throw this project .
But then I remember of Tom who was talking about air and I tried to the air and I tried .
So I hold my face in the hoscritish and I made my comments to a vacuum eless room .
And I said to the highly voices , &quot; Sent , what , we know that if this book is not shining that , it &apos;s not going to be bright , right ?
Because as I see us , I &apos;m going to put everything I &apos;ve , I &apos;m not going to this .
So if you want to be better , you have to press and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , I don &apos;t do anything .
I &apos;m going to get the same , because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to be recorded to be recorded to me to do my part , &quot; Because -- at the end is so , OK -- at the end of North Africa &apos;s deserts in North Africa , people would raduned for the people dance sacred to the chair of the sacred , dance and hours to the head and hours to the heat and hours .
And they were always magnific , because the balleres were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every once , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists had actually become in .
And I know what I talk , because I know you &apos;ve all seen you &apos;ve all seen it , a performance that &apos;s going to be able .
It was like the time you stop , and the dancing the walking , and the walking the ballerin a kind of different from the usually , like the 1,000 night before , but it all was going to be liked .
And suddenly , not just like a human .
But it turns out of the divinside and under the fire of divinity .
And when this happened , to the time , people knew what was , they were called it ,
They were played and started sing , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , God , Allah , God , God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curious night , when the Many of the Spain , they took this habitude , and they took this habituine , and the pronounce changed in the centuries of &quot; Allah , &quot; in &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; , &quot; Okay , &quot; Allah , &quot; in the flow . &quot;
In Spain , when an artist did something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , broads , burning , burn , burn , ebring , etch a God of it .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes the dancing day , for the dancing at the same time , when you wake up and discovered that are the 11 in Martedesday and the score that are the 11 in the morning , and I score it .
It &apos;s just a death with a lot of bad to the knees , and maybe not able to get to ask that altitle .
And maybe no one name of God still while I play , and what is it &apos;s to do with rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most porous reconciliations to make in a creative life .
But maybe not to be so angosciant if you can &apos;t believe , although you can &apos;t believe , anzyourself .
But it just , you know , you &apos;re just going to have data in a unimaginable source of this squid source of your life that you have to get something else when you &apos;re finished .
And , you know , if we think it all changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s sure how I thought it for different months in the work of the book that I &apos;m going to public , the dangerous , spaved , the dangerous , spavening , so that I was going to do this , and it &apos;s been a very successful successful .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I &apos;m electrized by this is , not afraid .
Don &apos;t travel . It only your work .
It &apos;s going to present you for your part , any of any of it can be .
If your work is bought to dance .
If the wine , assume you would ask you decide to leave some kind of wonderful , for one moment through your effort , then , &quot; then ! &quot;
Although , you do the same dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot; Since . &quot;
I think about it and I think you have to teach it .
&quot; Since ! &quot; Since , even for having love and test later test later , and test tape you &apos;re going to present you continually .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I &apos;ve already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can meaning and discovery of new genes .
Now we &apos;re starting a new perspective . We started digitalize biology and now to start from that digital code we &apos;re in a new phase of biology , designing and synthesizing and synthesizing life .
We always tried to ask a big questions .
&quot; What &apos;s life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists I think they &apos;re trying to understand various level .
We tried different approaches , reducing it to the minimum .
We &apos;re digitizing almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was going to go from the analog world of the digital world of the computer world &apos;s digital world .
Now we ask us : can we regenerate life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome that can self-replaced in laboratory .
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome for creating one more smaller .
We can eliminate a hundred genes about 500 that are here .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our .
Credemies , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this can bring to a living thing .
So we decided that the only way to design was syntize this chromosome in a way that we could modify the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of &quot; Can we synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Can the chemistry to make these great molecules that we never could create before ?
And in case , in case , can we make a chromosome ?
A chrromosome is just a piece of chemical material .
The speed that we &apos;re able to digitize life is growing to be exponential rhythm .
Our ability to write the genetic code , rather lastly , rather slowly , but it &apos;s improving .
And our recent recent recent retaken the date on an exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process has request a lot of the past , starting with a biothers , before the first experiments .
But we discovered that DNA is very difficult .
There are deces of thousands of machines in the world producing small segments of DNA , of the long-50 letters and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the segment is long , more herrors there are .
So we had to develop a new metod to assemble these fragments and read the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , to start to draw digital information of Phi &apos;s genome of Phi &apos;s genome of Phi &apos;s genome .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
We did the fragments , actually , the recorrection of the mistakes and got a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material chemical material , and we put it in the bacteria , the bacteria , the bacteria , the bacteria particles .
The viral particles are then reped by cells , they &apos;re gone back and destroyed E.
I &apos;ve been talking about recently members of the oil industry is saying , that they have certainly compress this model .
They re-up more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where software can actually build its its own hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the biggest things .
We wanted to build the whole chromosome of the bacteria .
They &apos;re over 580 mythletical code .
So we thought we could build it in cassette of viruses , so that we could change the cassette to understand what the components of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequency this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard was a mistandard for every 10 thousand basic .
We &apos;ve discovered , requency , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence , we never were able to do that work .
One part of the process is to design segment of the length 50 letters that you have to have a little bit of 50 letters to build under a smaller and work together .
We &apos;re going to stay for unique elements here .
You probably have read that we &apos;re going to put it in the grain .
Think of it like this : We have a genetic code based on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters code together , and there &apos;s about 20 amminoacids , and there &apos;s a specific admind of letters for every amminoke .
So we can use genetic code to write words , fraction , sentences .
What we did about the beginning was self-doing to .
Some of them were delivered by the fact that it wasn &apos;t poem .
We &apos;ve designed these segments to just put them together with enzymes .
There are enzymes reputting them up and put them up .
And we started to assemble parts , starting with segments , starting with segments , unendlector , unendled them to make a sletters of 24 lletters to come to 72 thousand letters .
We have produced these segments in ababababundance so that we could sequency them , and we &apos;re trying to create a very robust process -- as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems to be a basketer playoff .
When we get to these very long segments , more than 100 mile , it &apos;s not going to be directly in E.
It comes to the limit of modern , molecular tools of molecular biology .
So we consider other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called the Mromology , which in biology , which in biology to repair DNA can get the segment .
Here &apos;s one example .
This organism , called Deinococcus , it can make three million radical radiation .
You can see in the square spring as its chromosome as his chromosome .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s been reassembled as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can &apos;t do it .
They can live under a vacuum .
They &apos;re absolutely sure that life in space , and you &apos;re going to find new environments of water .
In fact , NASA showed that this happens .
This is a picture of the molecule we built these processes , just using the free segment with the design appropriate segments to put it .
The lievity , assemble .
This image wasn &apos;t taken with a electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a very big molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are photographed that they cover a six seconds .
This is the publishing we did a little time ago .
They &apos;re over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the biggest molecule of a definite structure ever created by man .
It &apos;s got a weight molecular spring to 300 million .
If we &apos;re going to be able to a 10 without spaces , it would take 142 pages to just transcriter this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ? How do we do that ?
Obviously , through a virus is a virus is a game from kids .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s simpler even when it comes to the euur euulliterally , you can just extract the nucleus and inserate it , which is practically the clonically process .
In the bacteria , the crrromosome is integrated in the way , but we &apos;ve recently shown that we &apos;re able to do a complete trape of a chromosome of a chromosome from one cell to another and activate it .
We had a chromosome chromosome from a microbial species .
The two are different men from the men from topes .
We added some gene in a way that we could decide what you &apos;re going to chrromosome .
The stone has then skip with the enzymes so that you &apos;re all the protein .
And when we put it in the cells was study -- and you &apos;re going to be a software , the new chromosome -- the new chromosome , the new chromosome .
And we started thinking that we could not go beyond , but we did anyway to push us .
This is one of the most mechanisms .
We discovered that many species have added a second or a third or a third chrromosome somewhere , adding in a second thousands of new tanks .
So who thinks about evolution as a gene as a only gene at the time you modified has no grained much of the biology .
There are enzymms called the restriction enzymms that are decade of DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cells , not one .
The cellula-in cellus .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other chromosome as an extraneum material , and we found it with only the cell and the new chromosome and the new chrromosome .
it became blue because of the genes we &apos;ve inserious .
And in a short of time , all the characteristics of a species have lost , and it turned out of all over a new species , based on the new software we in the cells .
All the proteins are changed , the membrane are changed , and when we read the genetic code balesactly to what we &apos;ve transfer you .
Now , this might seemy genetics , but altering the DNA software , we can change things in a way .
Now , I &apos;ve been explained that here is not about genestil of genests -- but progress to go from three million and a half million and a half years of evolution , and I &apos;ve already told that we &apos;re going to create a new version of this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s enough when we think about our needs .
We &apos;re going to spend six billion and a half billion people to nine billion in the next 40 years .
Right to give you an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one existing in 1940 , there are four years , there will be four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find fresh fresh water and clean , medicinal and gas for six and a half billion people .
It &apos;s going to be more hard to do that for nine billion .
We use more five billion carbon , more than 30 billion barils , more than 30 billion barils .
That means a hundred million barils a day .
When we &apos;re trying to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replaces , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
We have to hold out of all the CO2 emission of these materials that ends in the atmosphere .
At the day , because of the scientific discoveries all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that they &apos;re the design components for the future .
The electronic industry is only a dozen about components , and think about how many different things come out .
Our limits here are principlly data from biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , thanks to these synthesization , able to create what we call combinatory binary .
We can build a big robot that can make a big robot that can make a million chromosomosoms a day .
Think of processing these 20 million different genes or try to get to optimize the processes to make the processes to make it , new vaccines , we can change , because of a small team , and create molecular biology , and create more biology that in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , production , chemical or carburing , or carburing , production of wins .
This is an instantly instantly of some software programmed on that we &apos;re working on for being able to be able to sit and design species on the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know necessarily how they &apos;re going to be .
We know what they &apos;re exactly the genetic code .
Now we &apos;re focusing on carbons of how quarter generation .
You also see you extract ethanol from the grain was a bad experiment .
We have a second and third generation that will be going to have enough to be able to be able to be high value as the opposite or different types of butanol .
But the only way biology can have a great impact without more than food , and we &apos;re going to be able to be transformed the cost of food and limiting the CO2 in matter , as we &apos;re working to design cells that can get to design cells that can reach this purpose , and we think we think we could get the first carbons of how much generation in about 18 months .
The solar combined with CO2 is a methodoor -- but in our discoveries all over the world , we found different metodd .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
He lives in the deep ocean , at about 2500 feet of deep at the time of the water temperature of the water .
It &apos;s creating by CO2 using hydrogen by CO2 using molecular source of energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can sing CO2 , which can easily be transported through the tiny , converting that CO2 in carburging , to drive this process .
So we think that we might be able to reach what the basic question of what the base question of &quot; which is , &quot; is . &quot; We , &quot; , &quot; We , &quot; , &quot; We , &quot; , &quot; We have the goal to replacing the whole oil industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do that TED , where can you do that TED ?
It would be a main fairly fun .
And also , we &apos;re working to use the same methods to create vaccines instantaneous vaccines .
You saw this year with influence , we &apos;re always on a year and with a dollar a year and with a dollar vaccine when it comes to find the right vaccine .
I think what you can change is changing combinable vaccines in anticipate .
So , here &apos;s how the future might start to be changing , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria , and under the euukariote .
We &apos;re going to be so much from improve people .
Our purpose is to do enough to try to get it . Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the most faster than a fundamental work , in new technology we &apos;ve brought to the Microsoft in a following almost a year ago . This is Seadragon . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s about an environment where you can interact is at the local level that remote with a huge amount of data .
Here we &apos;re seeing lots of digital photos with a kind of digital photos with a kind of expensive zoomers , and I continued , for a bread , digital , and I continue to be .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big big these data or images .
Most of digital photographs , but this is a scanning from the Bibliotem of Congress , and it reaches in the games of Congress , and it comes in in in the games .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that &apos;s the one thing that &apos;s the number of pasting the paper of pxel on your screen on any time . It &apos;s also an architecture .
This is a whole book , you know , it &apos;s not images .
This is Dickens of Dickens . Every colonnaked .
To show you that it &apos;s about the text and not images , we can do something like this , to see that it &apos;s really about a real representation of the text , not a photo .
It could be a bit artificial to read a book electronic book .
It doesn &apos;t have to add it .
This is a more realistic . This is a number of the Guardian .
Every big image is the beginning of a set .
And it really gives you the pleasure and beauty experience of a read version of a magazine or a newspaper , which is for nature a lot of a medium .
We also did something with the corner of this number in the Guardian .
We created a higher higher solutions -- much higher than that you use in a normal advertising -- and we &apos;ve been inserious content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you see it .
or even other models , or even specific species , or even specific species .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that that means to put to the pop-up and other similar synthetic , they should not be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not to lose time , if we don &apos;t want to say that we have contributed to give even in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. , you know , it &apos;s geospatial picture of the NASA .
So , we go to something else .
This is actually from the web , and you can see it .
This is a project called Photosynth , which combinine two different technologies .
One is Seadragging , and the other is a searching for a very interesting computer . Noah Snavely , a student in the U.S. S. Snavel &apos;s UW and Rick Seitz of UW and Rick Seitz and Rick Seliski &apos;s Microsoft Research .
And it &apos;s from the web , square , seventually Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of pocket , where we can go from a picture to another image and have this kind of experience to multiple solution .
But the space collocation of pictures here has actually a meaningful meaning .
The algorithms of visualization have been recorded these pictures together , so that they &apos;re corresponding to to the real places -- all the close to the record to the Grasks on the Mountain Roccial Mount &apos;s Mountain Roccial Mount . There &apos;s elements -- you &apos;re seeing . There are all slides in a slides of a slides stable .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a few more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data from a Noahosynth prototype of Photosynth that we &apos;ve done in Photosynth that we did work for the first time , the last time , the key , the key Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily the key to this technology , the Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily evidence by looking at the web .
We had to worry about legal and so on .
This is a rebuild of Nothers of Nothers from Flickr Do images from Flickr . Bauckr , and you get images of typing and shirt images in the slums and away and away and away and away saying . Every one of these arancions represents a picture that &apos;s discovered a picture that &apos;s discovered .
So , I &apos;m all images pren from Flickr and they were all connected to space level in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate so simplicism .
You know , I &apos;d never thought about finish to work for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifying to get this kind of account here .
I think you can see that this is a lot of different kinds of different kinds of different kinds of different kinds of photocamazing in the professional , which is a significant , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try and try and look for those more strange .
Many of it &apos;s faces , etc .
Some of the photographs here is a series of photographs -- etcolums .
This is a Nothers of Nothers ,
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with the social environment . This is now taking data from the entire hot memory of how the land , from the vision point of view -- and all those data together .
All those pictures become connected , greater than the seems .
You have a ground model of the entire environment .
Think of this as a prolungation of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as people use it , and the advantages to be used to care it , and the advantages to use it .
Their pictures are marked inside by other people .
If someone comes to contrast all these several several several , my photograph of Nothers , my photograph of Nothers , it &apos;s a photograph of all those data , and I can use as a point of all those data , and I can use the photos of anybody else , and having a picture of anybody else , and having a social experience of anybody , and having social experience of cross-mo-graduate cheaper and chooss-like copy ,
Of course , a consequence of all this is extremely elaborate , extremely elaborate , which is not only a airplane , not only from airplane and satellite images and satellite images and satellite memory .
Thank you very much .
CA : I realized ? What &apos;s good ? What &apos;s your software will contain us to do is that , in a point , in the next years , all the photographed , all the photographed photographed , all the world are going to be readed ?
BA : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is discover .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , among images .
And it &apos;s going to the content of the pictures .
And what it becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of sea of set information that many of these images possible .
As when you do a research pictures on the Web , you get a sentence and the head on the web page has a lot of information about the picture .
Now , what if you &apos;re connecting to all your photograph ?
So the amount of simantly interconnection and the amount of wealth that &apos;s really huge . It &apos;s a classical effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really amazing . Computers .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure when you travel and one of the ethnography research is the power of the people who have not forget the antic antic antic traditions , between who who has the past the wind , the steel , the steel in the faveled , the one in the flows .
Baste think that Jaguar , are still beyond the Vy Lattea , or that the Milky of Inuit are still meaning , or that in Himala , the good broads , the good broad , the good break of the Dharma , to remember the central importance of the central central , and that the idea that the world that we live world in which we live not absolute model , but it &apos;s just a model , but it &apos;s just a reality , but it &apos;s just a reality ,
the consequence of a particular choices that our stirs did , well or eventually , a lot of generations ago .
And of course , we all share the essential .
All naked . We all procreating .
We &apos;re subjects in the beginning .
We need to death the inexorability , so it doesn &apos;t surprising it , so it doesn &apos;t surprising and ballie --
We all have a art .
What hit is the rhythm is the rhythm , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that they &apos;re the Penan forests of Borneo , or the followed the Voodoo of Haiti , or the Saharrowers , or the Kenya , the Curander , or a cameler in the heart of Sahara .
He was my journey of journey in the desert a month ago , or a month ago , or a hallevator of the world &apos;s Everest , the Everest , the world &apos;s mother .
All these populations teach us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And , if you reflect a second , it &apos;s a concept that it can give you hope .
Insit , cultures of the world creating a spiritual life of spiritual life and cultural life that &apos;s important for the planet and it &apos;s important for the planet and it &apos;s important for the planet as a biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural girl as a cultural , as a nosphere , and you can call the etnosphere , under , under , under , inspirations , inspirations , inspirations , inspirations , inspirations , and inspirations of the consciousness .
The ethnosphere is the fantastic patrimony .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we can be in and what we can be as inquisitive .
And because the biosphere was graveled by the ethnosphere , and it was too rapidly .
Nobody biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species was on or the extinction , because it &apos;s fake , or -- in the higher hypothesis in the most apocalyptic diversity -- and not even even nearest ypothesesesthesis , and it &apos;s not even the optimistic pull of cultural diversity .
The indicate of all that is , of course , the language ,
When you were born there , there were 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only composed by a vocabulary or a series of rules .
A language is the spray of human spirit .
It &apos;s the medium of which the soul of every culture is going to be in the material world .
Every language is a forest , a bind , a backin , a thousand , a psychosystem of spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re sitting in Monterey , at least the half doesn &apos;t be sussurred in the ears of children .
They don &apos;t come to be teached , the less means , unless that it &apos;s not going to won something , which are already death .
What &apos;s more sad of being flourished by the silence , being the last to talk a language , not having a language , not having a way to stop the wish of the driven ?
This is a fan has been somewhere in the world , every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks . And a old old old old , and it brings with it into the tomb .
And I know somebody of you will say , &quot; Isn &apos;t that ?
The world wouldn &apos;t be a better place if we talk all talk to everybody &apos;s the same language ? &quot; We talk all talk all the same way . We talk all talk to the cancer .
We talk about kogi .
You &apos;re going to take a saddition of what it means is not talking about your language .
Now , I &apos;d like to do you a journey through ethnosphere --
a little journey in etnosphere to give you a massive of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , &quot; different ways of exist , there are a very different ways of exist .
We take for example this Barasana &apos;s baby , in Amazon Amazon , the population of anaconda , which creates to be from the lath side of the lath sacred sacred in sacred .
It &apos;s a population that &apos;s not able to distinguished the blue color , because the blue color is identified in the forest , which depending the population .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial , called &quot; , &quot; Listish exogamy , &quot; : you have to must must have a person talking a different language .
All of this has been roading in the mythological past , but the particularly of these extbroads in which you &apos;re talking about six or seven languages no one languages a languages no one languages .
They limited to listen and then they start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived , the Waorani of Eastern Eastern Eastern order , an incredible population that has the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 five measured measured a commercial connection .
They &apos;ve been able to get out of the photographs that they were advice , by the way , that this population , by forest , as the population of the pluvial forest .
They &apos;ve been collected the ground , they turn them to the research of a form or a figure , and they don &apos;t find nothing , they &apos;ve been conclosed that they were dig , and they kill the five missionaries .
But Waorans don &apos;t only kill the stranieters .
They kill them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by them .
We &apos;ve been sitting in eight generations and we found two cases of death , and when we insisted to know , they have a lot of them , they admit that one of them was invented by invecting , and then kill it killed , and then kill it killed , and then kill it killed the incredible forest .
The copters were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned a very interesting task , when my Harvard professor asked me , if I wanted to go to Haiti , I was assumped at the base of the secret society and Tonton Macouth , and Tonton Macouth , and Tonton Macouse , and I used to use to do the basic zome that &apos;s used to do the zome zome zome of the first of the site of the site of the first of the secret society ,
To make sense of a miraculous , I should have to understand Vodoun culture and that Vodoun is not magic .
It &apos;s a pretty good thing about a metaphysically , method of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimo , Islam , Buddism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no religious feelings . And instead , and the Voodoo is not the distilled of these religious concepts of naked in the tragic concepts of naked in the tragic diaspores of slavavising .
What makes interesting interesting about the voodoo is the intense of life and death .
So the lives are born .
The spirits can be invoded by the Great Aqua , they respond to the rise of dance and replace temporary the anima way that for a short , so that for a short , and for a short , which is the god .
So , the voodoohists love say , &quot; You know , white you go to the watch of God .
We &apos;re given in the temple and become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re plenty , is the spirit that you are , how do you do the bad ?
So you &apos;re living events : they follow wonderful events : following voodoo , which touch touches infuriled a rather straight of the power of mind on the body state when it &apos;s catalyzed in a state of extremely strong excitement .
I &apos;m all the people with the most extraordinary , which I lived the most extraordinary Kogi in the Sierra Nevada Marta , in Colombia .
Discendmer civilization , which was once a carairplane on the carairplane , the population , the population , the population was going to be roughly on the massicrobing planture .
In a continent of blood continent , this population never been conquered by the spagnols .
But now , I &apos;m government today , they &apos;re government , but their formation is very extraordinary .
The young people followed away from the families to three or four years , and they live in a world , and they live in a world , and hombers in a world of the ice for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years of the extation of nine months that transrate in the country of the mother , now are metaphorically in the user of the Great Mther .
For all this time , they &apos;re acculated to the values of their society , values that pregner and only their prayers that they &apos;re getting the balance -- or for the cosmic balance -- or for the balance .
At the term of this incredible initiation , they &apos;re improvising out and for the first time in their age , at the age of 18 years , they see a treatment . And in that actids of the first burning ban , when the sun ky sun buts the bag , when the sun key kay . It &apos;s all the people who learned in the headquight . The pregns a step back and says , &quot; The forth a step back and says , &quot; The preciplies . &quot;
&quot; Good ? Proprize I said .
It &apos;s study . Now it &apos;s going to protect it . &quot;
They call the greater frrothers and say that we , frrothers , we &apos;re the brothers of the world .
This is extremely important .
When we think about inhistory populations and environment , we invochieve Rouser and old history of the nurse , which is a razy concept in its semplicity or maybe we .
Indigenes are not not feeling sentimental nor indebolites from the nostalgaze .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the paludi Asmat or vinints of the Tibet , but because of the time and the rhyths , and they created a mystic of the Earth based on the concept of consciousness , but on a hundred , but on a concept that the Earth can only live in the world can only because it &apos;s infected from the human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
It means that a Ande of the Ande who grows up in the mountain is a spirit of Apu that &apos;s going to be a deep human being deped . And it &apos;s going to be a deep human being deped and it &apos;s going to have a different broken site with the mountain or that you grow up with a Montana boy or the mountain is a rocken of rocken .
which is the dimall of a spirit or a mineral cow it is irrievant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Britannic Columbia creating forests to be cut .
And that made me a different human being in my friends that believe that the forests are the forests that forests are the forests of Hukuk and the paradise and the paradise and the paradise of the world , the spirits that live in the northern extreme Hamatsa .
If you start to consider that these cultures can actually create reality , you can start to understand some of their sensationally discoveries . Let &apos;s take this plants .
I took this picture to open up to the norock Amazon Amazon .
Mayahuge some of you have heard about the ey-reperto-active suscity of the repertoire repertoire .
What makes the fashic is not the potential pharmacological potential pharmacological potential of suspicity , but his own two elements .
From a side , this lian lian lian amazing series , and harmed , harminogene , harminogene , slightly .
Pring the only plant plant , you have a bluxer that alters a little bit of the consciousness , but it &apos;s mixed with the leaves of a family of the coffee family , the virid-slightly policy .
This plants is powerful plant , very similar to the serotonin , dimethoxyle-five , methoxyl-five , methoxyltryltraining .
If you ever see Yanomami tyrare on for the substance that are doing from a different species , which is contain in methoxyltryltrypten .
Tiring that policy on for the nose is a little bit like being disappeared by a file fucies and landscape on a sea of electricity . Rather creates the dissolution of reality . Rate dissolution dissolution dissolution dissolution dissolution .
I was often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has scened the psychedelic was , with his discovery of the hallucinogenages in the &apos; 30 in Mexico .
And my text , you can &apos;t classified these triptams like allucinogens , because if you &apos;re doing not telling anybody to be kinated .
It &apos;s possible absolutely only if you make a lot of other chemicals that denaturing MAO .
Now it &apos;s the beautiful : the carboline carboline are inibitors of MAO , the same kind of needs to be able to potentiate triptams . The source question is in a 80,000 species of plants , like these people make these people find dia-like dia-like dia-like dia-like version , but if you combine in this way , create a biochemical version that &apos;s high perior the high of the parts ?
We use the great eufemism of the evidence and error , which can reveal infruit .
But if we ask Indian , they &apos;re going to tell us , &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of Ehualahuge , which is networks nicely in the forest , and that our eyes would come in the same species .
If we ask him how they stake their tassonomy will tell us , &quot; I thought &quot; I was going to have a plant , you know , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you get the 17 variety in a notice of the full and each one will song with a different tone .
With this is not laurea Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than contact that contact the press .
Now , the problem is that the problem is that even the ones of us who have to have heart people have heart of the people are painting in the history of the history of our history than our real world , and the pass .
In fact , the 19th century , in 300 years , it &apos;s not remember for its wars its wars , but rather as the one of the technology , but rather as we stop and embracked actively or the passively destruction of the mass destruction of the mass destruction of the masses of biological diversity and cultural planet . Now the problem isn &apos;t change .
All cultures through centuries have been involved in a new possibility of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux , they don &apos;t stop being Sioux when they put up and they put up as the Americans have no stopped being American when they put up up and hot .
It &apos;s not the change or the technology that threatening ethreatening . It &apos;s power .
The flight of the flight .
And if you look at the world , you will discover that these are not destinate cultures .
They &apos;re creatures and dynamics out of the existence that are beyond the ability to be adaptation .
And the way it is disbosing in the patria of the Penan --
a population of Sarawak , in the Sarawak , a population that lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to the next replaced to the replaces of the figuums , where you can see the river , where you &apos;re going to be able to get the river of the Borneo , where the naveling Borneo , where the naveling the environment of the illuminan herent , where the navi is ,
and it takes the stives with the stives with the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that are come with the discovery of gold .
If we move on the mountains of the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the right hard of political domination .
As you know the genocide , the physics of a population , is condanced at the universal level , but the ethnoisistry , not only is convicted , not only is convicted , but it &apos;s also not only convicted , but also celebrated in the development , because it &apos;s part of the development strategy of development .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of the Tibet , until you &apos;re in the beginning .
I spent 6,000 miles from Chengdu in the West Chenger in the West China , coming to Lhasa , and I realized in Lhasa , but only realized in Lhasa , but only came to Lhasa I realized what &apos;s behind the statistics that we &apos;re talking about .
6,000 feet sacred in policy and centers .
1.2 million people killed from the military Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascrited in Panchen Lama .
The means that it &apos;s been killed to the time of Chinese invasion .
His uncle with Santity in Santity during the diaspora that has brought the people in Nepal .
His mother was imprisoned and his cheeef was to be rich .
It was taken to carry in the age of two years , hidend under his own glasses under his own ground because he wouldn &apos;t have lived without .
The sister , who made the same , which has been put in reeducation .
A day , he inavverted a day , a Mao office , and , for this transgression , it was put to the force bulled for seven years .
The Tibet of the Tibet can be insationally , but the redenter of the population is from tener .
At the end , it &apos;s all about a choice .
We want to live in the world world &apos;s world , or we want to get the policromatically or we want to collect the policromatically ,
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before we die said that his biggest fear was that , in our lighting to this amorous amount of the world , we &apos;re not just going to see the whole amorous limited limited to a limited limitation of modality , but a day we &apos;re wake us to a deal with a decrease , but a day we &apos;re able able able able able able able to be able to be able .
And it &apos;s humiliating our species is existed for 600,000 years .
The Revolution revolution , which gives us the agriculture , which made us to socks to us to the cult of the sime , replacing the poem with the next to the closer , creating the species of clue , and we &apos;re talking about 10,000 years ago .
The industrialized world has about 300 years .
That sthemselves history , I &apos;m not suggests that we have to have to defix in the millennia that we &apos;re going to have to deal with .
When you get these cultures of the world is asked what it means to be human , they say , &quot; they respond to to be human voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all rediscover the chance of being what we are : a consciously species , which has to be what we &apos;re -- a consciously population , which has to flow . And there are great moments .
I took this picture on the north of Baffin , when I went to the hundred of balas with Inuit , and this man , and this man , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , and she told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The canadvice canoes not always be gentile with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to be our own own colonies .
The grandfather of this man was going to refused to go .
The family , templating for his life , he brought him away , and all of its arms .
You have to know that Inuit is not the cold , they feel it .
The slickly package were made of fish fleipath .
The non-type of this man , it did not intimiddle or the blizard night .
It &apos;s sitting away , you &apos;ve got up , you &apos;ve got the ballowed in their hand . When I did the test , and when I did the test , you work with it , it &apos;s made it , it &apos;s working on it .
She sprayed salive on the dot of this clean cold , and when I solid solid , it killed a dog .
He high schools and created a brilliant , with the actical cassa slitta , he gave a slitta , and it &apos;s disappeared on the banchisa , and it &apos;s slums in rest .
We want to talk about cavarsely ? Rissues : What are you in different ways , in different ways , &#91; Applausi &#93; is the symbolish of the Inuit and the inadvice population and all the digit .
In the 1999 , the canadvice has region the Inuit &apos;s the total control of a horn area of the California and Texas I put together .
It &apos;s their new patric . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a territory territory . They construct all the minerary resources .
One splendiging example of how a nation-state can recognize with his population .
And , finally , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least to us was in these slightly remote of the planet , make it not deal with remote .
For somebody is home .
They know , the seems of human imagination that go up the other time . And for us , the dreams of these kids , as the several dreams of these children , as the swimming .
Finally , we National Geographic , we &apos;re convinced that political will never arrive to anything .
We believe that polemy --
&#91; Applausi &#93; are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month our site region 35 million visit .
156 countries transmit our television canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal .
Our resources are slabor millions of people .
Our work is to travel in etnosphere to bring our public in places of wonderful cultural places that they &apos;ve seen and hope , hopefully , hopefully , hopefully , the world revealing for the central revealing of the world , and we need to find a lifestyle and must find a lifestyle and must myth in a world , and we need to find a move style and must find a lifestyle and men in a world of the central reef and melse reveals from how they saw stycool ,
where the wisdom of all the people can contribute to our well-being .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope requires that I hope to evidence some connection , in the case , not notion .
I &apos;d like to start with what I call &quot; the official dogma dogma . &quot;
The official dogma dogma dogma ?
The official dogma of all the Western society industrial society : &quot; If we want to men the officer , &quot; The way to do it is to massure the benefit of our citizens &quot; &quot; The way to do it is to men to do that is to men to be bad . &quot;
The reason is , from a side , in the fact that freedom is in itself a value , is precious , useful , for humans .
As the other is that if we &apos;re free , each of us can act to do everything that maximizing all of the myself , without any any one that decided in our name .
The way to massing freedom is to massing choice .
More people are the more liberation , more free , and greater is their liberty , greater is their well-being .
And that , I think , is so deep radicated in the society that no one &apos;s dream to put it in the society that no one is going to be able to do .
And it &apos;s also deep radicated in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarketing . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m going to allow a simple note on the insalate .
In a supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without contact the 10 variety of oil olive , and the 12 acetes that you can buy for a huge number of conducting , which you can buy for a huge number of conductioning is that no one of the 175 pronce you have to be a huge of your dedeath .
So , that &apos;s the supermarketing .
And you go to the electronic store to buy a stereo : case , letters CD , radio , radio , radio , radio , amplificer .
And in this single store of electronic store , there &apos;s a great number of audio .
We can do six and a half million different combinations of using components that there are in a negotiate .
You have to admit that there &apos;s a lot of choice .
Although the world of communications .
Once I was a child , when I was a child , you could get all the desired services , under the basic services , until the Bell .
You &apos;d born the phone , you didn &apos;t buy it .
One consequence of that , by the way , it was that the phone was never pulled .
These times have gone .
We have a variety variety of phones , especially between cellphones .
Here &apos;s the future cellphones .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , tapels of the nose , and it &apos;s holding for the crossing .
If you &apos;re not seen you saw it in the house , you &apos;re going to get you in the house you &apos;re not seen you &apos;re going to get .
And what &apos;s the end is that people come into the stopping and makes this question ? And you know what the answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cellphone that doesn &apos;t make too much things .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the acquire , you might be the same explosion of choices .
Assistence of health health : not happening in the United States , you have to go from the doctor and doctor what you have to do .
But instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do it , or B , &quot; A , &quot; B &quot; A , &quot; B &quot; B &quot; has these benefits . &quot;
You say , &quot; Doctor , what would I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A have these benefits and the risks , and B has these benefits and these risks . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebats , &quot; Doctor she was me , what would that ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not she . &quot;
The result that we call it &quot; autonomy of the malseems , &quot; expression that makes it seems to be a good thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not that a fish and responsibility to make decisions of making decisions from somebody who knows something , which is not knows -- and almost certainly it -- and it &apos;s not almost certainly in the ideal condition to make patient decisions that obs the patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing products , direct to people like me and you , that if you think about it doesn &apos;t have any sense , because that you don &apos;t understand them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why do you published them ?
The answer is that they want to ask them , we call the doctor to ask them to change .
Something so fundamental as our identity is horever is is a question of choice , as you see in this jump . &quot; We don &apos;t want to provide children . They &apos;re going to stay . &quot; We don &apos;t want to get a longer identity : us we need to invent .
And we can reinvented us how many times we &apos;re going to get us .
which means that every morning , to the swake , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I spend a family and marriage , a time the common , a common , square of any , it was you could have the most soon as you could , and it started to get the most soon possible , and it started to get the most of the most possible possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not even what to do after ,
Egyday , it &apos;s really to play .
I teach to very intelligence students , and I do the 20 percent work in a time .
And not because they &apos;re not brilliant , because they &apos;re not not brilliant , because they &apos;re not diligent .
but because I &apos;m impensieritation , I mean , &quot; I should I get to do that right now ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m going to move more ? I have to think about the children or career ? &quot;
They &apos;re slogorant several .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this implement , even though that you &apos;re not going to get the companies and not get a good vote to my exer .
And they have to do that . They have to do that .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , like Carl underolineant , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from Hotel Randolph .
In the parentests , there &apos;s a angler , and I don &apos;t tell anybody , where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use it .
What does it mean , this incredible freedom that we have about work ? It &apos;s that we have to continually decide , continually on every moment , if we have to work or not .
We can go to the juggle , with the cell phone in a pocket , Blackberry , the Blackberry , and the night , typically , on the knees .
And even though they &apos;re all spent , every minute that we see our son , we see the boy , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; Do I say , &quot; Do I say , &quot; Do I say , &quot; Do I say , &quot; Do I say , &quot; Do I say , &quot; I have to answer that , we &apos;re going to see our son , we see that our son &apos;s son , we &apos;re going to spend
&quot; I have to answer this email ? I have to habboze this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , &quot; that makes the experience of your son &apos;s partners very different than what it would be in other conditions .
So , as any of the things we look , small things and big , objects and huge , life is a choices , life is a choices .
Once the world was this : Oval , there were some possibility , but it was not a choice .
The world today looks like this : The dilemma is , &quot; Is it a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is SShe &apos;s got to be able .
So , positive lates all of them , so I &apos;m going to talk about negative ones .
All this choice is two effects of two effects of the people .
The first , paradoxally , is that it &apos;s producing paralysis that liberation .
And so many options that choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I offer you a significant example : a study conduct of volunteer pensive plans .
A colleagues had access to the data of Vanguard , the giant society of the sources , with about a million customers in 2000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of adesion , the percentage of adesion .
With 50 sources , there &apos;s 10 percent of adesions , when I &apos;m available to do it , why ?
Because with 50 sources that choose , is maletheless , it &apos;s hardward , and the choice is remanded to decide ,
And by domorders , and again domorders , domorders , of course , domorders , and of course , domorders , of course , domorders ,
You know , not only mean that these workers are going to be eating workers because they &apos;re not going to have enough money , because they &apos;re not going to have enough money , it also , to say that the decision is so hospital fundamental fementary of the work .
Not teaching , they &apos;re losing , they &apos;re losing to five dollars per year from the work , which would be disposed to be disposed to be tdisposed to be disposed to be disposed to be disposed to be disposed to be disposed to five dollars per year from the work , which is not going to be displaced to five dollars per year
So the paralysis a consequence of having too much .
And I think that &apos;s making the world like this .
&quot; And finally , for the eternity : ketchup , feelape or maionese ? &quot;
You &apos;d like to make the right decision , if it &apos;s for eternity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and nepure the wrong , and nepure the wrong .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even though we could avoid paralysis , and we &apos;re not satisfying out of the result of how we &apos;re going to be with less options .
And that &apos;s a different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of conducting , which you choose , if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , is easy to imagine that you could have to do a different choice that it would be better . And what happened is that alternative imagined us , you get indeed with the choice , and the replaced the replaced of the choice , and the repieces that you have the decision , and the replaced by the decision , and the way , and the replaces the several conducting sing the paper , and it &apos;s not perhaps .
even when it was a good decision .
More choices are easier , more easy than any details that it &apos;s insodisaster than the choice .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has clear very well , like the value we &apos;re going to depend on things that we confrontiers .
In the rest , when there are so options , it &apos;s easy to represent the alternative characteristics , and be less satisfying than the options that are choice .
Here &apos;s one example . I &apos;m wrong with all those who are not New York .
But that &apos;s what you &apos;re probably going to think .
There &apos;s this copy in the Hamptons .
A place of lussize .
It &apos;s beaving splendida . Otype good day .
It &apos;s not nothing . But what he thinks , &quot; Well , malediition , is August . &quot;
&quot; All my neighbors in Manhattan are away . &quot;
&quot; I could park up right in front home . &quot;
And it &apos;s going to switch , and it &apos;s losing -- every day -- the chance of parking -- every day -- the chance of parking where it wants .
The cost-opportunity is the fulfilled the fulfillment we , even when choice was eccellent .
And the more of the options we have to consider , the more active features we &apos;re going to return to the way cost-opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This vignment tells us a lot of things .
It &apos;s about living the time , and maybe slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you choose , you &apos;re choose to not do other .
The things we don &apos;t choose have a lot of attractive activity that we do .
Third thing : spiral growing .
I tried it on my skin byet , and I tried a new jeans .
I remember almost always jeans .
And once the jeans were just like one , buying them and bought them , they were scomfortable , they were uncomfortable , just after after I was washing them , and they were swear a lot of times , they started to go well .
So I went to buy a couple again when the old old ones were landed , and I said , &quot; I need a couple jeans , this is my tackle . &quot;
The common said , &quot; Lewish , fashion , relaxy , relaxy , relaxy , relaxy , relaxy , relaxy , relaxy , relaxy , relaxy , relaxy , relaxy , relaxy , relaxy , &quot;
She wants to do it or whatever ? &quot; Stonewashed &quot; &quot; or &quot; aciwashed &quot; ? &quot;
&quot; Let them want ? &quot;
&quot; Sight wants to be large or stricks ? &quot;
I was sbalance , and after a while I could say , &quot; I want the guy that was the only guy , &quot; I want the only guy , &quot; He had no idea what I was , so for a hour , and then I went out of the jeans , and then I used from the best jeans , and then I was going to have .
I had the very choice . I had all that choice . I had the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was that I was worse is that with all that choice , and the jeans had to be perfect .
I was very very much expectations . I won &apos;t expected anything when there was only a kind of thing , but when there was a kind of a kind of , but when I saw 100 different , lackage , at least a kind of must be perfect .
What I had busted was good , but not perfect .
After I had paragoned that choose what I was trying to injury in confront of expectations .
The add of options in life doesn &apos;t make that make the expectations that have been respect to the eccellence that these have been .
And this will produce less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing if it makes it .
Because if they knew , you &apos;re not known what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth looks like this .
&quot; You were better when you were worse when you were worse , &quot; The reason you were worse when you were worse , it was that when you were worse , you could still meet the placed surprises .
Egyday , in the world we live -- opulent , industrialized industrialized , citizens with the perfection -- the maxpattern that the things are heights .
You never surprised pieces because your expectations , my expectations , they &apos;re injected .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Basse expectations , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , you want . &quot;
I mean -- a little self-time time time , which I &apos;m really moved and my wife is really stupend .
I could not have done , I could not have tackle .
But it &apos;s not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of buying a couple of jeans scomfortable , when you &apos;re just the kind of jeans is that when you &apos;re not satisfying , and say , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot; And the answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What could I do with it ?
When you have a jeans of jeans , and you buy a insodently insodently , and ask you who are responsible , it &apos;s as clear that responsible , is , as clear that you are .
You &apos;d have to do better .
With hundreds of disponally variety , there are no scuses for indeed .
So when people are they asked , even though the result is valid , you feel insoddisappeared and they give the basic choices .
In the last few years , the depression is exploss in the industrialized world .
I think a meaningful factor -- not the only one , but that &apos;s important -- of this depression is that people have experiences of the experiences because the standard experience are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that the colpa is them .
So the final result is that we &apos;re in general , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me reminds you .
This is the official dogma , what we all all take for good and it &apos;s completely false . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little choice is better than it &apos;s not uncare about it , but it doesn &apos;t be a little choice , but it &apos;s better than a little choice .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic . I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s .
But I &apos;m pretty sure we &apos;ve been on a piece of the level that choices better our lives .
Now , from the political point -- I &apos;ve almost finished -- from the political point , the nocle is the following .
What allows all of this choice in the industrial society is the material wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is they have too much good .
So the facility I &apos;m talking about is a malbeing malbeing malbeing malesclusive , recidly society .
And what it does deprove and angry is this : Steve Levitt spot , you &apos;ve talked yesterday of how those expensive and unuseful seats . It &apos;s a waste of money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and dispendependent , it &apos;s not that they &apos;re just useful .
They &apos;re addicting of deleteries .
They &apos;re doing worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows a lot of choice was reversed in those where people have too few possibilities , it wouldn &apos;t just be better , but our life .
This is what economists call a parethrow better .
A redistribution redest for everybody -- not only to the poor -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in excess that comes up .
To conclude , you can become everything you want , &quot;
You , people of culture , you think , &quot; What does that make that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t make anything in a glass of glass . &quot;
&quot; A castrated imagination , a limited vision of the world -- &quot;
And I interpret it so , at the beginning .
But then , you think , as I realized that that fish knows that that that fish knows the long .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you &apos;re manipped in a way that &quot; everything is possible , &quot; you can &apos;t get freedom . You get the paralysis . &quot;
If you reach the mouth in a way that everything divent you can diminiit .
Look at the paralysis , and you reduce the well-being .
Everybody needed a sphere .
This is almost certainly too strictly , maybe even for the fish , and it &apos;s sure for us .
But the axy of some symbolic symbolic , I &apos;m afraid , I &apos;m afraid , for rovine .
Thank you of heart .
