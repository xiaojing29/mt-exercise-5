Last year I showed these slide to show that the cotta calculate glacial glacial , which for almost three million years has had the size of 48 continental continental .
But this is , this underestimating the gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the spexpector of the ice .
The arctic calotta is , in a sense , the pulsing heart of the global climate system .
You expanding around the summer and retreat the summer .
The next slide is going to be a rapid carled on the living beautiful 25 years .
The ice loss are drawn in red .
And you see , they expand down to the blue blue .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter , which you retreat the summer .
You can see that the cohoid-year-old ice , it &apos;s like five years or more , it &apos;s like the blood , which is like the blood , which is like the blood ice .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been going on for this .
This is a problem because the climbing frog the glacier around the ocean arctic quantities of congested carbon congel that , shoulders , they &apos;re transformed into metane from microbes .
I &apos;m putting to the totality of the atmospheric inquation , that amount could radical , surrending , super-survey point , super-hytheme .
In some laghi in Alaska , the methane is already rebucing from the water .
The professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska was recated with a team at the winter lake , a team broken lake .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You &apos;re good . The question is if we &apos;re going to be there .
A reason that this term scening the Greenland from the north .
This is a figum to glacial .
The led was never reached to switch .
This is the Kangerlussuaissuaq , in the South of Greenland .
If you want to know how the sea level for the sea level for the ice of the ice slowly , here &apos;s where it &apos;s where it &apos;s reaching the sea sea .
These running are increasingly moving .
At the other part of the planet : Antarctica , the largest block of ice ice ice ice block .
The last month , the scientists have diclared that the balance of the ice is in negative , and that the Antarctica Antarctica , which is particularly rapid in some islands , is particularly quid in the submarine .
Equive to six feet like the wild wash , like Greenland .
Sull Himalaya , the third biggest block , you see new laghot laghi , that a few years ago , they were glacier .
40 percent of the world population is half of the world &apos;s potable to the scale .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the water of this city .
The led is increased .
But when it diminishes , the same thing happens to be able water .
In California , the Sierra Nevada is decrease of 40 percent .
The house hyrices are in crisis .
The predictions , as you read , they &apos;re graved .
The growth care in the world door to a remarkable increase .
The environmental disasters are increasing a rhythm outside the normal and without precedental .
Four times more numerous numerous than the last 30 years of the previous 75 .
This is a whole thing that is unsustainable .
If you look in the historic context , if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of the oceans every day .
Look at the East Pacific area , from American , from Americas , and on both the West , and on both parts of Indian subcontinent parts , where there &apos;s a radical impoverments of oxygen in the ocean .
Most because of the global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossil fuel .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States are one of the two of the countries with more emissions , together to China .
And it was proposed to build a lot of other centers .
But we &apos;re seeing a change .
These are the projects in the last few years and some of the high-year-old high-ternative years .
And in the way , there &apos;s a political lotta in our country .
The caral industries of the oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon clear , which is a hospital .
That picture me up to something --
Natal Very , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion lbox billion flions of carbon of carbon scories .
You may have seen it on the news .
This is the second largest flow of scories in America .
It happened to be around Natal .
The natalization of one of the carbon industries was this .
Video : My carbon is a kind of thing , and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it &apos;s going to grow our economy .
It putting the carbon is more and more and more clean .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and the work machines are style .
Al Gore : From here , a lot of the West Virginia .
The largest society on the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Dion Blankenship : Don Blankenship : Al Gore , Nancy Pelosososis , Harry Reid -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Protection of Clim has launched two campaign .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Ator : At COALergy see we see the climate changing climate as a serious scale .
So our priority is to invest a great amount of money in a public effort to make public effort to make public and confused the truth on the truth .
In fact , the carbon isn &apos;t himself .
We think it &apos;s clean -- it also has a good profumal .
So not preocatency of climate change .
Let me do us .
Video : Ator : Cot bag . You &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
So let &apos;s take a toward structure to advancing to advanced .
Strtraordinary ! Mar is a little noise , but this is the sound of the coal technology .
The coal consumption is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology , the remarkable technology that you see changes everything .
Do you look at this : this is the carbon technology clean clean .
Al Gore : Infinally alternative alternative , the positive altery and the economic security , to the national security .
Video : Comment America is in crisis ; the economy , the economy , national security crisis .
The filing that the connects : our dependence on the fossil of fossil fuels , like the health and the oil .
Now , though , there &apos;s a new , audace for using it .
Repower : 100 percent of hundred energy , 10 years .
A plan to put America to make safer safe , and help to make safer , and help to stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that to solve our problems .
Really ? Scop . You get to cover .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It &apos;s about to red-energy to America .
One of the faster ways of dependence of dependence from the combustable dependence of the combustable .
Computer : The future is here . Vent , sunnetwork .
She &apos;s got a full investments for places for a bunch of jobs .
Commment : Wepower . It &apos;s time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old old proverbial proverbies says , &quot; If you want to go down , go down to it .
If you want to go away , go together . &quot;
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED I did a feckle on the LHC .
And I promise to go back to how the car works .
So here . And for that , for those who was no , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever trial -- 27 miles of circumference .
His task to reach the conditions that were present less than a billion second from the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
That &apos;s all of this is simply environment .
This is the car under Genissue .
We picture these mini-Big Bang in the repair .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- it &apos;s 44 meters and has a 22 meters .
This is an image picture of ATLAS spectacular picture .
Ten the last 10 section of last year we &apos;ve accent the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was cause of immense festhegent in control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first particles that had done all over LHC , entering in collision , in collision , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles in the resft .
In other words , when we see that image of the picture , we realized that image , the machine worked , which is a great vicycle .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to do more or this , when somebody went to Google and saw that the beginning page was this .
That means we &apos;ve had a cultural impact on the scientific impact .
And it was a week after , there was a problem with the machine , had to these files here -- these dorful files .
These files bring 13,000 ampits when the car works at the very powerful of the power .
Now , technicians are going to look at the files and they will say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . They &apos;re too subtle . &quot;
And they can do it because when they &apos;re very cold became the conductor ,
So at least 271 degrees , at a floor temperature to the star to the star in the stars , these files can bring that running that rant .
In one of the junture between the most of the novemistry in the LHC , there was a fabrication of factory .
So the files surround , they &apos;re going to read , and 13,000 ampits improvising electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think these magnets are more than 20 tons , and that have been moved of about 30 meters .
They &apos;re damaged about 50 magnets .
We had to get them , what we &apos;ve done .
We &apos;ve been resisted and traveled .
They &apos;re now coming back to their submit .
The end of march LHC is , the end of the LHC is new integrate .
We &apos;re going to happen , and we expect to get the right data or switch or , and continue our adventure to discover what the morning to discover what the morning of the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain a way , these accidents reaccing the value of science and engineering in frontier of science and engineering in frontier .
I think that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s so hard , I think it &apos;s the value of things like LHC .
I &apos;d like to end with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , I imagine , in the defense of his standing , his pupille was Michael Faraday , he said , &quot; Nothing is so dangerous for the progress of the human mind that the reening minds of the human mind that the ideas of science are , that we not mysteries in the remarkable to us ,
Thank you .
I want to start asking the wind of rethink when , from kids , playing , from kids , playing for the morning .
And as you reach them and rate them , take them and get them , take them and move them , learned actually to think and solve problems and solve problems and manipulating relationships .
The reasoning reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , from information , from the user useful , from our interaction with physical objects , together my consultor , Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to ask me , &quot; And if we &apos;re using a computer , and I started to ask me , &quot; And if we &apos;re a pass as a digital polymouth as a digital polysically , to configure out a desktop with the hands , we could actually further a desktop with a desktop with with entry ,
and systems to our piacement ?
The question was so interesting , the question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer interactive computer as a bet computer .
In a few words , a Siftable computer interactive computer as a bet computer .
You can move them with the hand , they can see , &quot; you can see &quot; see &quot; between them , and they have a screen and a radio wireless .
But above , they &apos;re physical objects , like the morning , you can move just down them .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem for manipulate to manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physical , conscious of their movement , of other people , and as they become more physical , of the other people who are physical , of other people , how we can explore new and different style style and different style style .
I &apos;ll start with a few simple example .
This Siftable is to show the video of the video : if you just incline in a direction , video , the video grid video , it will rotate like this , if you cut up the other side side back .
These are interactive realized realized realization .
If you go down , they &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re around .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they notice it and they can act a little bit .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they notice it and they can act a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclining .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the poter using community gestures , &quot; a color like a liquid color like like a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurated as a century and I can use to spend the color in the central central , where they central .
and I can use them to versing in the central central , where they care .
And if we grew too much , we can put a little place .
They also are beautiful possibility of learning , like the languages , mathematics and plowners where people can try things things fast , and see the results of immediately .
Now I &apos;m just --
This is a sequence of Fibonaces that I do with a program of equations .
So here we have a game of words that is half in Scarabeum and Boggle .
And at every turn on every turn to every Sift-case on every Siftable , Pratically , at every turn to the letter at every Sift-broken , and circles of them controls on a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you &apos;ve got a new remarkable to read and new possibilities to you .
Thank you .
So here &apos;s the kids in the Media Lab , I &apos;ve done it in a way that they tried them and I turned a video .
They &apos;re very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very much they &apos;re very , very , very , very , very , very , very
And one of the interesting things of this application is that you don &apos;t have to give the many instructions .
You just say , &quot; Compons of words , and they know exactly what to do .
So here &apos;s some other people who are trying to do it .
This is our younger , the younger , there on the right .
It actually wanted to implemployees .
They were just in the morning .
Now , this is an interactive cardboard .
We wanted to build a tool for learning , and he &apos;s Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , suncable , Siftable them .
It can put new characters in the scene , suncable , Siftable them .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : The sun is sunsister .
David Merrill : Now it brought a tractor in the scene .
Video : The tractor .
Bel work ! Yeah !
So schooling Siftable and put them neighbors can interact the person-interact in the way .
Video : Bau !
-- inventing your story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a story with final open , and it can decide him as it .
DM : It &apos;s a story with final open , and it can decide him as it .
Vly : Fly , gets away .
DM : The last example I have the time to show you is a tool , realized for recent , to wampling and exequiet music .
It &apos;s a recent , a recent recent , to sampling and exeded music .
The Siftable is sounds like basis , base , and battery .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose to use .
You can also put these sounds in a sequence to compose to your placement .
And modificate it just to touch a &quot; sound &quot; and a sequence . &quot;
These are actually that you can control from alive , like the reverse and the filter .
It stayed to a particular sound and then clines to stand to stand up to the way .
And then there are the general effects like time and volume , that they apply to the whole sequence .
We look at how it works .
Video : DM : We &apos;re going to start putting a base in two Sift-sequence , we &apos;re doing it in a series , we extend it , we add the other base .
Now I &apos;m going to put a base line .
Video : Now I add to percussions --
Video : And now I &apos;m going to put the filter to the bacteria , so I can control the effect from the view .
Video : DM : I can speak the entire sequence by a hand on the other side .
Video : And now I &apos;m going to add the filter to the base to give more expression .
Video : DM : I can reach the sequence . &quot;
So I didn &apos;t have to plan it first , but I can suddenly improvising it longer or more cords .
And now , finally , I can smoke the whole sequence by inclining to the left the Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is built new man &apos;s building new man machine and more like more and body &apos;s how our brain works and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also a few possibilities that we &apos;re trying to bring out of bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to transmit is that it &apos;s coming to this new generation of designed to interact with digital media , that will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;m not going to see the hour to talk to you all .
I &apos;m a written .
Boy profession is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , obviously .
It &apos;s also the love and the fascine of my life .
And I don &apos;t expect to change .
But , said , something particular has happened by my life and in my career , which has brought me to realize the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I &apos;ve recently written this book , this book , this biography called &quot; Mananger , Prega , Ama , &quot; which , diversly , for some reason that I &apos;ve got been a great sensational , walking , for some reason that became a lot of people who became a lot , sensitive best .
And the result is that everywhere now , people treat me as if I was condanced .
Daveled -- condanned , condanned .
They &apos;re all going to be worried and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t fear that you can &apos;t do fear that ?
You can &apos;t afry to continue to write all life without any life without any living in a book that can important to somebody &apos;s ? &quot;
that can be important to somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s rassuring , you know .
But it could go worse , part of that I remember that I think more than 20 years ago , when I was saying to people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a written .
I would meet the same reaction based by the pure .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t get to me succeed ?
Do you fear that the humiliation of the refuse you ?
You can &apos;t be afraid to do this for all life without any life that nothing happened to die on a smoke of snone smoke of all infrants with the falliment falliment ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
Yes , I fear of all those things .
I &apos;ve had always been afraid .
And I also have a couple of many other things that people could not inspiring .
It &apos;s like treatment and other things .
But , as much as I think about the write what I thought and I was told me , I &apos;m losing that ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logical that everybody has been waiting to be spaved by a work that you feel to do .
But what &apos;s so particular in the creative enterprising us to make us nervous health mental health , in a way that other career can &apos;t do ?
And as my father , for example , he was a chemist , and I don &apos;t remember a only time in his 40 years of activity that he was asked if he was asked if he was crazy to be able to be able to be able to be ?
There was never -- that block of John engineer , how does it ?
It wasn &apos;t that , you know ?
Onestly , chemical engineers as a group have not , in the centuries , in the centuries , depressive manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manifigures as group have been almost of the repucing of the group ,
We have enough to be a reputation , and not just writers , but creative of every gender , we have this reputation of being enormous instble mentally .
And it &apos;s not going to be looking at the conteger death of the magnific minds that only in the 21st century , they die young people die and often for hand .
And even those who are not suicidated to be really displaced by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before he die , in the last interview said , &quot; Every book killed me a little bit more extraordinary de-up on work on their life .
But we don &apos;t bulate it when we heard this because we &apos;ve heard these things along that we &apos;ve been completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering to the art , at end , it will always conducive to the end .
And the question I want to get to all over here is : Did you agree with this idea ?
It &apos;s good for you -- because it &apos;s also looking at a centimeter of distance to me , not good for anything to do for nothing that suppose .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous , and I don &apos;t want to see it in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our great minds to live .
And I know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start figure out the surroundings , above the surface of suppositions , above the circumstances that are in my career .
And that &apos;s really -- I &apos;m a look , I &apos;m pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I have still about four decades in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything write about this is going to be right from the world as the work that was going to be used to be successful from my last book .
I &apos;m going to be a little bit , because we &apos;re all about the most friend here -- is likely to my biggest success is to my huge .
Oh , Gesus , who thought .
You know this is the kind of thinking that that brings a person to start bend up in the middle crowd and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would stop doing this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it seems to me , after a lot of reflective , that the way of work to keep write is to create a psychological construct , right ?
I have to have some some way to find a security distance between me , which I &apos;m going to write , and my natural anxy on what reaction is going to get back and I was trying to get over the last year about year , trying to find out of how to do it , trying to find out if they could have ideas better and more several ideas to see if they could have the better ideas and more sane and more sananem and more sane several ideas to see if they could have the better ideas to see if they could have ideas and more sure of the world and more s
about how to help people to get to the emotional inerent risks of creativity .
And that research has brought me to the ancient Grex and ancient Rome .
So , I &apos;m going to go back .
In ancient the ancient Great ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity is from men , OK ?
And it was thinking that creativity was this spirit divine , and he came to a few distant and saving men from some distant and sure , for reasons , distant reasons .
The Greeks were called these spirits of the beyond the creativity &quot; demons . &quot;
Sog , wonderful , it was believed to have a demon the wisdom of wisdom .
The Romans were the same idea , but they called the kind of spirit without a genius .
That &apos;s great , because the Romans didn &apos;t think a very smart was someone was someone was a particularly smart .
They thought a genius was this kind of divine that was a kind of divine that was created in the walls of the study of an artist , a little bit like Dobby , and that came out to hidden work in the hidden work of the artist and model to model the result of that work .
So , here &apos;s the distance of which is the distance of which I &apos;m talking -- that psychological construct that you protect from your work .
And everybody knew that was that it was that it was , right ?
So the antic artists were protected by certain things , like the narcissm , right ?
If your work was exceptional job was not to take all the market , everybody knew that you had been helped by this genius encourage .
If your work , it wasn &apos;t all the basic beyond your job , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a incapable .
And so people have been full creativity in the West for a long time .
And then the Renaissent came and everything changed , and all this great idea ; we bring the human being at the center of the universe over the misteries and leaving more to the misteries and leaving more mitions that write detailed by divinity .
This was the principle of humanism and people started to think that creativity is completely from the hyd-broken .
And for the first time in history , you begin to refer to this or that artist as a rather than a person rather than a person with the genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big herror .
I think that to allow somebody , a simple person to believe that I &apos;m like a source , the essence and the sisters of all mesters , creative , unknown and the source of all mesters , unknown to give to a little bit too much much to give to the psyched human fragile to give to the psyches that human .
It &apos;s how to ask somebody to enjoy the sun .
Death and completely driven the ego and create all these expectable expectable .
And I think it was this pression to having a district the artists in the past 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it &apos;s , and I think it &apos;s , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe that you can go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t sing 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience that we would solve to the notion of the notion , inside , and they do that follow people to do happen or the projects of their projects .
I &apos;m probably not going to talk to you all about this thing .
But the question I want to ask is -- why not ?
Why not think about this way ?
Because it has more sense of all other thing that has ever heard to explain the exasperant exasperant of the creative process of creative process .
A process that , as anybody who ever &apos;ve been trying to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- knows , you don &apos;t behave rationally behave rationally .
And in fact , it can sometimes seems completely paranormal .
I did this meet recently with the extraordinary poetched Ruth Stone , who now 90 years , but it was a poetry for all life and he said that during his childhood in the Virginia , working out in the Virginia , working out in the Virginia , and he heard , inside of the landscape .
He told me that it was like a switch train .
And he was coming up to her landscape .
He heard it , because he was tremendous to his feet .
He knew to have one thing to do at that point and it was to do with a words , &quot; he was to running like a matt . &quot;
And so it was going to go to home and he was following on this poetry , and it wouldn &apos;t have to get a piece of paper and a fast fast , as the translate , and running it on the page .
And sometimes it couldn &apos;t be fast enough , so he realized and roll out and roll out of the house and the poetry was roll through the landscape and she lost up through the landscape , trying to like , &quot; another poet . &quot;
Then there were some times -- this piece I &apos;m going to forget -- there were the moments that was almost losing , right ?
So , it was running home and it was trying to paper and poetry her paper through , and he would go through a city in the way that he was going , and he said , that was like if you stand the offer .
He wouldn &apos;t care poetry to his body and put her in the page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be presented on the perfect page , but at the last word at the first word .
So when I heard it was crazy , it &apos;s exactly equal to my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conducture .
I &apos;m a moving , and my way of work is ; I &apos;m going to wake up to the same horarian every day and work and go through it .
But even I was in my test daggin , I &apos;ve striped against that thing , sometimes .
And I imagine a lot of you did .
You know , even though the work and ideas came from a certain source , I could not be honestly known to know it .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate it to it in a way that we don &apos;t lose the head , but rather , rather than it ?
And as much as I think about , the best example of me , the best example I have is the musician musician , which I &apos;ve interviewed by a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life was the incarnation of the artist gmented artist , trying to control , to control , to run , dominate these species of totally interiorized impulses .
But then he got to get driving , and one day as he was driving on a L.A. , he changed everything for him .
He was going to fast and everything that was a sent sent this little slide , that comes into his head like inspiration , elusive , and the vodies , and the votherwise , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the desiderve , but it doesn &apos;t know how to take it .
It has no paper of paper , it has no climbs .
So it starts to feel this species of anxiety anxiety to losing , and I &apos;ll remark up up with this chart song .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to the panic , he stopped .
It gets the whole mental process and made something completely new .
And he just just just the sky and said , &quot; Hush , I &apos;m not going to see I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Do you know , it seems to write a song now ?
If you really want to exist , you know , a more time when I can take care of care .
Otherwise , you go to important something else today .
You see Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his process has been working on this .
Not the work , the work was still hoscure as always .
But the process , the anxy that attack it was replied when he took genius , the genius that &apos;s got a whole thing else and liberry it remarkable to where it was going back from , realized that it was going to remust to where it was come from , realized that it didn &apos;t have to be interiorized and tomented .
but it was not Tom .
So how much I heard that story began to change a little bit of the way I worked , and he save me once .
This idea , he save me when I was writing , &quot; Mangy , &quot; Ama , &quot; and fall into one of those depperation , where we all work on something and we can &apos;t start to think that it &apos;s a disaster , that &apos;s going to be the worst book , that &apos;s going to be the worst book or never wrote .
Not just the worst book , right .
And I started to think about to throw this project .
But then I remember Tom who was talking to the air and I tried to the air and try to try .
So I went up to my face in the house , and I bdirest my comments to a high-angle corner .
And I said to the high voices , &quot; Sent , what , we &apos;re both , if this book isn &apos;t really shinking up , no ?
Because as I &apos;m going to put everything I &apos;ve got , not more than that I have , not more than that .
So if you want to be better , you have to show you and do your part .
Okay . But if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , I don &apos;t do anything .
I &apos;m going to go to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I want to do for favor that was recorded to me to do my part &quot; because it &apos;s so , OK -- at the end is so , OK -- in the deserts of the North Africa &apos;s watching to the watch of the dance of the wild of the wonderful music that they were going to raise .
And they always were magnific , because the dancers were professionals and they were great .
But every time , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists was actually transcendent .
And I know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know you &apos;ve all seen it to a performance .
It was like the time , and the dancing ballerine walking through a kind of walking and it was not doing anything in different from the usual , like the 1,000 night before , but it all was going to go .
And suddenly not appeared just as a human .
But it turns out from the divinside and the illuminated in the fire divinity .
And when this was going to the time , the people knew what was , they called him with her name .
They were broken and started to sing , &quot; Allah , Allah , God , Allah , God , God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
And he was going to have the historic -- when Momer invaded the Spain , they took this habits and the pronounded in the centuries of &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; The floor , &quot; Okay , &quot; to be , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , , Allah , &quot; to , &quot; Alla
In Spay , when an artist did something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , running , broken , broken , a bunch of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes down the day after , for the dancing at the same time when you wake up and discovered that are the 11 of Martednice , and I scork it of God is no longer .
It &apos;s just a death with a bad bad to the knees , and maybe not going to be able to get to ascending to the heith .
And maybe no one name of God still while she goes , and what is so it has to do with rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most sweeter recognizes to make a creative life .
But maybe not to be so angosciant if you can &apos;t believe , anzythrow , that the most extraordinary expect of your being coming from you .
But it just makes you data on a full of this inimaginable source of this source of your life that you have to have to go to to something else when you &apos;ve finished .
And , you know , if we think about this way .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s sure as I thought about for a different months in the work that I &apos;m going to public , dangerous , spaving , the dangerous , spaving , expurely , I &apos;m going to do this , exactly following my great success .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I &apos;m electrized by this is , not afraid .
Don &apos;t go down . It just your work .
It &apos;s going to present you to present your part , any one can be .
If your work is baling , bbble .
If the divine , absurd genius , assigned decids to leave some kind of wonderful , for a moment through your efforts , then , &quot; then , &quot; Yes ! &quot;
You get your dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot; Sime ! &quot; It &apos;s the same . &quot;
I think it &apos;s got to go and I think it &apos;s got to teach it .
&quot; You know , &quot; to you , just for you had to love and test later , and test test later , you &apos;re going to be able to be realize .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : June !
And as you know , I &apos;ve already talked about some of the human genome , on what it can mean and discovered by new set of genes .
Now we &apos;re starting a new path : we started digitizing biology and now to go from that digitizens we &apos;re both in a new phase of biology , designing and synthesizing life .
We always tried to ask big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists I think they &apos;ve been trying to figure out of loves .
We tried a different approaches , reducing it to the minimal terms .
We &apos;re digitizing for about 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome is to go from the analog world &apos;s digital world &apos;s digital world &apos;s digital world .
Now , we can regenerate life from this digital universe from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome of the smallest genome of the tiny genome .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit more smaller .
We &apos;re able to eliminate a hundred genes about 500 that are here .
But when we &apos;re a look at his metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our own .
Credeep , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this can bring to a living cell living .
So we decided that the only way to design was synthesize this cromosome in a way that we could modify the components to get some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of &quot; Can we synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Can the chemistry to produce these big molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create before ?
And in case , we can make a chromosome crowd ?
A chromosome is simply a piece of chemical material .
The speed that we can digitize life is growing to exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , rather slowly , but it &apos;s better by impressing .
And our recent recent retained to a exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process has required a lot of past , starting with a biothic review before the experiments .
But we found that synthesize of DNA is very hard .
There are deces of thousands of cars in the world that product small sections of DNA , the length of 30 to 50 letters and it &apos;s a process , more error , more error , more error , more errors there there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these fragments and re-cord to the mistake .
And this was our first attempty , to go from the digital information of Phi &apos;s genome of Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
We &apos;ve designed the fragments , actually , the correction of errors and got a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material , and we put it in the bacteria , the bacteria , the bacteria , the bacteria began to read this genetic code and producing viral particles .
The viral particles are then you got to cells , they &apos;ve been back back and destroyed the Ecoli . This is .
I &apos;ve been talking about with members of the oil industry and they say that they have certainly compress this model .
They have more than you .
We think this is a situation where software can actually build his same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the bigger things .
We wanted to build the whole cromosome of the bacterium chromosome .
They &apos;re over 580 mile of genetic code .
So we thought of built in the size of the virus of the virus of the virus of the virus to understand what the components are in a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequency this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard was a mile for every 10 mile base for every 10 mile base .
We found , resequency , 30 errors . If we used that original sequency , we would never be able to do it .
One part of the process is to design segments over the letters of the process is to design soverwhelments of 50 letters to build smaller suburban to build smaller subject that work together .
We &apos;re going to see one elements here .
You probably have read that we &apos;re going to put a physical cle .
Think of it like this : we have a genetic code based on four letters : A , G and T.
Three of those letters code together about 20 amminacids , and there &apos;s a specific order of letters for every ammind .
So we can use genetic code to write words , fractsently , thoughts .
What we did in the beginning was to do it .
And some of them have been deluvered by the fact that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
We &apos;ve designed these segments to simply joined with enzymes .
There are enzymes that they repair them .
And we started to assemble of the parts , starts with segments five to seven thousand letters , uncrazy in 24 mile letters , at the time to get to the 72 mile .
And we &apos;ve been produced in the abundance so we could segments so we can sequency them to sequency that we &apos;re trying to create a very robust .
We &apos;re trying to car the process .
So , this seems to be a basket playmon a bunch playmon .
When we get to these very long segments , over 100 middle , more than 100 mile base in the E. coli . It &apos;s going to be directly in E. This is .
You get to the limit of the modern tools of molecular biology .
So we &apos;ve been considered other mechanisms .
We knew of another mechanism called a homology , which in biology is a homology , which is using to repair DNA degree to get the seats .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus , it can absorbed , it can absorbed three million rad of radiation .
You can see in the swimming record as his chromosome is destroyed .
In 12 , 24 hours , it &apos;s been reassembled as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that they can do it .
These organisms can &apos;t do that .
They can live under vacuum .
They &apos;re absolutely sure that life in space , and you move to find new environments of water .
NASA , NASA showed that this happens .
This is an image of the molecule that we &apos;ve made these processes , just using the free segments to put the design of appropriate segments to put .
The lievening them , automatically .
This image was not taken with a electronic microscope , but with a microscope to regular .
It &apos;s a very big molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that are a period of six seconds .
This is the publishing we &apos;ve done a little bit ago .
They &apos;re over 580,000 genetic code .
It &apos;s the biggest molecule of a definitely ever created by man .
It &apos;s got a molecular molecular sue to 300 million .
If you prove it with a 10 cartoon 10 without spacecraft , it would take 142 pages to transcritation .
Now , how do we do that ? How can we make it ?
Obviously , you know , a virus is a little girls .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria .
It &apos;s simpler even when it comes to the cell of eukariot as our : You can just extract the nucleo and inserious , which is practically the cloning process .
In the bacteria , the cromosome is integrated inside the cell , but we &apos;ve just shown that we &apos;re able to do a complete transplant of a cell trape of a cell on one other and activate it .
We got a cromosome , a chromosome from a microbial species .
The two are different than men from topes .
We &apos;ve added some gene in a way that we decide to pick out to this croma .
And then the slide with the enzymes in a way to kill all proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was study -- and you &apos;ll open our graph -- and you &apos;ll open our graph -- the new cromosome , the new cromosome .
And we basically thought we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we &apos;ve tried to push in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms .
We found that many species have added a second or a third or a third chrromosome somewhere , adding in a second thousands of new , in a second thousands of traits .
So who think about evolution as a only gene at a time that has no understood a lot of the biology .
There are enzymes called &quot; restriction enzymes that addrestrition that they &apos;re going to digervation .
The cromosome that was in the cell of it not a one .
The cell phone that &apos;s the cell phone that we &apos;ve insert .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other croms as extraneous material , and we found it with just the cell and the new cell cell and the new cromosome .
it became blue because of the genes we &apos;ve put .
And in a short labor time , all the characteristics of a species have gone lasses , and it turned around a new new software we in the cell of the software we in in the cells .
All proteins are changed , membranananants are changed , and when we read the genetic code exactly to what we &apos;ve transfer you .
Now , this may seem genetic altering , but altering the software , we can change things in a pretty substantial .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that here is not talking about genesius -- but we &apos;ve been able to go from three million years and a half years of evolution , and I &apos;ve already said that we &apos;re maybe in to create new species of this digital process of this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty obvious when we think about our necessity .
We &apos;re going to pass six billion people to nine billion in the next 40 years .
Just to give you an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one in 1946 , in 40 years , in 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re now having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medicinal and weird for six to six and a half billion people .
It &apos;s going to be even more hard to do that nine billion .
We use over five billion carbon , over 30 billion carbon , over 30 billion barrasses .
That means a hundred million barbonds .
When we &apos;re trying to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replaces to replace them , it &apos;s a huge challenge .
We have to convey of the CO2 emission of CO2 from these materials that ends up in the atmosphere .
And the day of the discoveries of the scientific discoveries all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that they are the design components for the future .
The electronics of the electronics of about components , and think how many different things came out .
Our limits here are principlally from reality and our imagination .
Now we have now have techniques , because of these metods of synthesization , able to create what we call combined genomic genomic genomic genomic genomic genomic prize .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think of processing these 20 million genes or try to try to optimize the processes to produce optimize processes to produce optimize or drugs , new biology , and create more biology , and create more biology , and more biology than the molecular now , which over the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemistry , chemistry or carburn , production of vaccine or carburn .
This is an instantly of some software programmed on we &apos;re working on to be able to be able to sit and design species on the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know necessarily how they &apos;re going to be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
Now we &apos;re now focusing on the carbon of how quarter generation .
You &apos;ve seen that extract ethanol from the gran experiment , it was a bad experiment .
We have second and third generation that they &apos;re going to be able to be able by sugar to the higher value as the eight-foot and a different types of butankers .
But the only way that biology can have a great impact without increasing a great impact without increasingly increasingly increasingly the cost of food , it would be transform CO2 in the first , we &apos;re working to design cells that we &apos;re working to design cell cells that they can reach this scale , and we think we think we could think of the first carbons of how quarters about 18 months .
The solar light combined with CO2 is a methodoor -- but in our discovered in the world , we found different metodd .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , at the deep ocean temperature of the time at the ebolliance of water .
It &apos;s creating by CO2 using hydrogen by CO2 using molecular source .
We &apos;re trying to figure out if we can put CO2 , which can easily be transported through your touch , converting that CO2 in carburn , to drive this process .
So we think we could think that we could be able to increase what the question of base , &quot; what the question of base that &apos;s life . &quot; We , &quot; we have the fashion of replacing the whole obies of replacing the whole oil industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can you do it ?
It would be a main in the main energy .
And we &apos;re working to use the same methods to use the same methods to create vaccines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with influence , we &apos;re always always behind a year and with a dollar in less when it comes to find the right vaccine .
I think that it can change binning vaccines in anticype .
So , this is how the future could start to look at the time , the tree of evolution , accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria , and evil cells , and finally incells .
We &apos;re so much on the improve people .
Our purpose is to do enough to try to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the most of the new technology that we &apos;ve brought to the new technology that we &apos;ve brought to the Microsoft in a follow-down , almost a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s a environment where you can interact on the local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data .
So , here we &apos;re seeing a lot of digital pictures with a kind of constant photos with a kind of a constant , disponing quarters , disponing the pictures of the images we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big the amount of data or images .
Most of digital photographs , but this for example is a scanning from the Bible scan of Congress , and it &apos;s reaching in the gamm of the Croad of of Congress .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that you limit , the one thing that &apos;s the number of pxel on your screen in any moment . It &apos;s also a very flexeless . It &apos;s also a very flexeless .
This is a whole book , you know , data not images .
This is Dickens of Dickens . Every column is a capital .
To show you that it &apos;s about textbable and not images , we can do something like this , to see really that &apos;s a real representation of the textbable representation of the text .
It may be a little bit artificial to read a book for a book .
It doesn &apos;t look at the advantage .
This is a realistic example . This is a realistic example . This is a number of The Guardian .
Every big image is the beginning of a seal .
And it really gives you the please and beauty experience of a version of a magazine or a journey or a newspaper , which is for a molteaper .
We also did something with the angle of this particular number of The Guardian .
We &apos;ve created a high-resoluate advertising -- much higher than that you use in a very higher published normal content -- and we put you in extra extra .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even techniques , techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that means to put up to the pop-up and other similar porcheries , they should not be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obviously applications for this kind of technology .
And on this not to lose time , if not to lose time , if we don &apos;t have to say that we have contributed to this camp .
These are all the streets in the U.S. , you know , the geospational images of NASA .
So , we &apos;re going to go to the other thing .
This is now , in the website ; you can go to see .
This is a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragging , and the other is a search for a very interesting computer . It &apos;s a very interesting computer . It &apos;s a student in Washington , a student in the U.S. Seady and Rick Seady and Rick Seading Seading and Rick Seliski Seady . It &apos;s a hottim .
And it &apos;s from the view on the web , Seadragon .
You can see when we do this kind of screen , where we can past from an image to another image and have this kind of experience to multiple resolution .
But the space collocation of the pictures of this is actually a meaningful .
The size of the computer visualization have recorded these pictures together , so that they &apos;re going to the real places that imaging the real crawling -- all the closed to the record to the Roccious Mountains Roccious Roccious Montagne &apos;s showing . There are some ex-stable to show a slide sten show or of a slide , or of the road of southern imaging rate at the same time .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;ve got time to show you some other environment .
There are a few more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data set of Noaherself -- and this from a prototype of Photosynth that we &apos;ve done in Photosynth , we &apos;ve shown you what I think is really the key behind this technology , Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily the key behind this technology , the Photosynth &apos;s technology ,
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of Nothers prising a Nothers prised to Flickr . Bastian Nothers and you get images of shirt , and you get images of shirts and so on . Each of these arancions represents a picture that &apos;s discovered a picture that &apos;s discovered to this model .
So I &apos;m all images practices from Flickr , and they &apos;ve been all connected to the space level in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this very simplicissue .
You know , I wouldn &apos;t have thought I &apos;d ever thought I &apos;d ever thought I was going to do Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifying to get this kind of access here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of foting different types : from those of the cell phones to the professional , LR : SLR meaningful , put together in this environment .
And if I can try to go on those more strange .
Many are blocked by faces , etc .
And somewhere here &apos;s a series of photographs -- etching .
This is a Noththtrial poster .
We can go from the posters to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is taking data from the ential interior holding -- from the collective memory of how the earth , from vision point point of view -- and connected to all those data together .
All those pictures become connected , more than the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the sum of the size of the sum of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the parts of the size of the parts of the sum of the sides of the size of the set of parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the sideal .
You have a third model of the entire model of the entire thing .
Think of this as a prolunging of Stephen Lawler on the virtual Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as people use it , and the people use it , and the advantages for people who use it for the people who use it .
Their pictures are married by other people .
If someone comes to the idea of contrassigning all these sets saying the name , my picture of Nothers of Nothers . It &apos;s a picture of all the data , and I can use the way I can use that I &apos;m going to get to the immerge in the space , in that metaphics , using the pictures of any other , and having a social experience of cross-like cross-cys-like cross-fashion of mod-model kind of cross-modity .
Of course , a consequence of all that are extremely elaborate model of all the interesting part of the earth , you don &apos;t just just give up a satellite vists and satellitarian images and satellitary memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What your software will contain us to do is that at some point , in the next years , all the photographs shared by everybody in the world will be going to be going to be ready connected ?
BA : Yes . What &apos;s doing is basically , it &apos;s discovering .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , in images .
And it &apos;s doing it at the content of the pictures .
What it becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of set information that many of these images can be set of these images can be .
And as when you do a research of images on the web , you get a sentence and the web page has a lot of information about the picture of the pictures of the picture .
Now , what if that picture is , what if you get to all your pictures ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of wealth that &apos;s really huge of it is really enormous . It &apos;s a classical effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really amazing .
BA : I thank you very much .
One of the main pleased , when you travel and one of the research for ethnography is the power of the powerful traditions , between who have the past in the wind , the past in the wind floating , the stead of driving , the foods up , and the floating plants .
Bastes to think that Jagar &apos;s still beyond the Vy Lattea , or that the Milky of Inuit are still meaningful , or that in Himalaya , the buddies are still meaning the respire Dharma , to remember the important central of the central of the anthropology , and the idea that the world we live in the world we live in a very city , but it &apos;s just a model of reality ,
the conset of a particular choices that our style has done , well , or a bad bad , a lot of generations ago .
And , of course , we all share the essential thing .
We all get to the nate . We all procreation .
We &apos;re subjects in the beginning .
We have to death the inexorability of death , so it doesn &apos;t surprising if we clear and balleet --
We all have a art .
What hit is the particular rate is the rhythm of song , the dance of dance .
It doesn &apos;t matter that they are the Penan forests of the Borneo &apos;s forests , or the followered Kairs , or the Kairs of the Kaisut , the Curander of Ande , or a cameleras in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my journey of journey in the desert a month ago , or a hallevator of yak in the valley of the Everest , the Mot of the world &apos;s Mokay .
All these people teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , and other ways of move in the world .
And , if you reflect a moment , it &apos;s a concept that it can give you hope .
And together , the cultures of the world creating a world of spiritual life and culture that is the planet and cultural life that the planet and it &apos;s important for the benefit of the planet as a biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural girl as a cultural elhere , and you can define the ethnosphere the subject of all the concepts , under , ideas , inspirations , inspirations , intuitions , intuitions , in the human imagination from the same way of knowledge .
The ethnosphere is the great patriage of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how inquisitive .
And because the biosphere was graved by the way as much as it was happened to the ethnosphere and unfortunately quickly .
Not biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species was on the extinction simply because it &apos;s fake , or in the highest ipowered ipowered in the most of the biological diversity -- and not even nearly neighborhood in hypothesis -- that of the cultural diversity -- that of the cultural diversity of cultural diversity .
The index of all that is , of course , the language .
When you were born there 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only a vocabulary or a series of rules or a series of rules .
A language is the shake of human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle with the animal of every culture is coming in the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a backin , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re here sitting to Monterey , at least half not susussurring in the ears of the kids .
They don &apos;t come to the kids , the who means , unless they &apos;re dead .
What is more sad of being being fled from the silence , of being the last to talk to a language , in the last to talk to a language , in the wisdom of the wisdom of the broken of the kids ?
This is a fan state of somewhere in the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks . And it &apos;s going to get into the tomb of an ancient language .
And I know somebody who will say , &quot; Isn &apos;t that ?
The world would not be a better place if we talk to everybody the same language ? &quot; We talk all the same language ? &quot; We all talk to the way .
We talk about koges .
You &apos;ll take a tract thing to say , you &apos;re not going to talk about your language .
Today I &apos;d like to do a journey through ethnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a absolutely what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , &quot; different ways of existing , &quot; I really mean , &quot; I mean , &quot; I really mean , &quot; I think of that when I say , &quot; I &apos;m going to have a lot of them ,
We take for example this Barasana Barasana , in Amazon , the population of anaconda , which creds to the myth of the side of the side of the latt of the hest swatts of sacred sacred sacred sacred .
It &apos;s a population that &apos;s not able to distinguishing the blue color blue from the green , because the cell of the forest , that it depends the population .
They have a strange language and a marriage , deta called &quot; Linguistic Two : &quot; you have to move a person that &apos;s a different language .
All of this has radical passed in the mythological past , is that in these extbalance of the families that are talking about six or seven languages no one practices a languages that no practices a language .
They limited to listen to to and then start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I &apos;ve lived , the Waorani of Ecuador , an incredible population , an incredible population , an incredible population that had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionaries have tried a contact that was committing a construction .
They &apos;ve been able to get from the photographs that retraditional poses that they had been advantage , forest that this popular Plessly pluvial forest had never seen anything in bi-dimensional forest .
They &apos;ve been taken the pictures of the ground , they turned them to look for a form or a figure , and they didn &apos;t find anything , they have conclosed the dial five , and they kill the five sionaries .
But Waorans not just killed the straniests .
They kill them .
Fi54 percent of mortality was caused by them .
We &apos;ve got up at eight generations and we found two cases of natural death and when we &apos;ve insisted to know , they admit to know , they admit that one of them was aging , and then they kill it . And then they kill the same . They had a incredible knowledge of the forest .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal from 40 step of recognizes .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned a very interesting tassigned when my Harvard professor assigned to go to Harvard to enjoy in in the secret of the power of Duvalian and Tonton Macouth &apos;s power and Tonton Macouth &apos;s powerful , and imposed to the bombies .
To give a sense of the myraculous , I should have to understand Vodoun culture , and that Vodoun is not magic .
It &apos;s a pretty good measume for measume ,
Very interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the big religion in the world , what would you say ?
Health , Islam , Budddism , Ebraism , excetc .
A continent is always left to be left , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no religious feeding . And it &apos;s not religious features . And it &apos;s not the distillation of the nate of the ground diaspora diaspora diaspora diaspora .
What &apos;s interesting about the voodoo is the intense report between life and death .
So the living people are getting birth .
The spirits can be invoded by the Great Aqua Great the end of dance and replace temporary to the animate of the alive in the animation of the view of of the vive in a very short that we &apos;re going to be the god .
So , the voodooists love say , &quot; You white you go to wonder God .
We &apos;re going to start in the temple and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re possitting , is the spirit you , how can you do the evil ?
So , you get to these incredible events : follow voodoo in the state of trance that touch impowerful demonstration of a rather strong demonstration rather than the body &apos;s mind on the body state of the mind when it &apos;s catalyzed in a state of extremely exciting .
I &apos;m all the people with which I lived the most extraordinary people are the Kogi in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta , in the Secentrion .
It &apos;s decendent civilization that once they were on the caraibic planure , the population of the Colombia , the population of the vulcanic vulcanic that you get on the vulcanic planture .
In a slate continent of blood , this population never been conquered by spagners .
And so , I &apos;m governed today , they &apos;re government to the training is so extraordinary .
The young people followed away from house to three or four years , and they live in a world that &apos;s done a good bombers and bombers in the hair of the glacier for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years of proposed to reproduce the nine months of gestation that transmit into the user of the mother , now are metaphor forever in the U.K. .
So , this time they are acculated to the values of their societies , values that they predict their prayers and only their prayers to do the cosmic balance -- or for the balance equilibrium .
And the term of this incredible initiation , they &apos;re improvising brought out and for the first time , 18 years , they see a health of the first bad of the bad of the first button the bad of the first butting the bad of the beauty , when the sun bull-scape , all that they &apos;ve learned in the health care . The pright is a steel . The pright to a step back and says , &quot; The pret a steel . &quot;
&quot; Do ? Proprise as I said .
It &apos;s study . Now it &apos;s going to protect it . &quot;
They &apos;re called the major frail , and they say that we , brothers , we &apos;re the hit of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about Indigene populations and environment , we investigate Rseau and the old story of the vage of the nnice , which is a razy concept in his simplicity or perhaps , we say that these people are more closer to the Earth of us .
Indigenes are not not not sentimental people that are indebolites from the nostalgathered by the nostalgets .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the malaric paludiaric of the clear or in the winds of the Tibet , but because of time and the rhyths , have created a mystic of the Earth is not on the concept of consciousness , but on a huge ble , the concept that the Earth can only live because it &apos;s infused by the consciousness of human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
It means that a little bit of the Ande who grows up to create that mountain is a spirit . Apu that will be a deep human being depth , and it &apos;s going to be a different ratic report with the mountain or that place to a boy or that place in the Montana who grows a rock of rock , a mountain is a baby of rocken rock to prove a mountain ,
That &apos;s the dit of a spirit or a mineral cone is irrievant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Britannica to create that forests to be cut for being cut .
And that made me a human being a different human being in my friends , Kwakiutl who believe that forests are the heavy dimora of Hukuk and the paradise of the paradise and the spirits that live in the northern extreme in the world , the spirits that are going to northern extreme Hamatsa .
If you start to consider that these cultures can actually create reality , you can start to understand some of their sensational discovery . We take this plants .
I took this picture to open up in the noroccy .
Mayahuge of you have heard about the Eahuge purch , the powerful sushuge of the repertoium repertowards .
What it takes the fascinating the ayahuge is not the pharmacological potential pharmacological potential of the substance , but his work . It &apos;s a two elements .
From a side , this lian league , that lian account of Chacarboline , harmine and harmine , harmful hallucinogene .
Tring the only plant , you have a little broken smoke that alters a little bit of conscience , but it &apos;s mixture of a family of caffee family of the coffee .
This plants is powerful tripage of the tripal , very similar to serotonin , dimethoxyltryltryltryltryptamine .
If you ever see Yanomami , you &apos;ll see the substance that they do by a different set of species , in a different species , which is methoxyltryltryltryltryptamine .
Tirking that policy on the nose is a little bit like being gone from a file purpose of pints and landscapes on a sea sea mate of electricity . Don &apos;t create a distortion of reality ; it doesn &apos;t create a distortion of reality .
I got to get a lot of my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who scatened the psychedelic was , with his discovery of the hallucinogens in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s , in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the Evan &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s .
And I think about my thesis , you can &apos;t care these triptamines like hallucinogens because if you &apos;re doing no one of being able .
It &apos;s possible to above the very much if you make other chemical chemical substances that denaturing the MAO .
Now , the beautiful : the carboline , that are the clow-like MAO , the same kind of needs to be able to potential triptamines . The question of expontaneous . The question is spontaneous , like 80,000 species of plants , like these people are dying in this way , they create a biochemistry , and that if you get a version that &apos;s perior that &apos;s perior that &apos;s perior that it &apos;s perior of the similar ?
We use the great eufemism of the providing and error , that can reveal infruit .
But if we ask the Indian , they &apos;ll tell us , &quot; Parish . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of Ehubah , which distinguishing , and that the eyes would reach in the same species .
If we ask them how they stabilisonomy will tell us , &quot; I thought , &quot; I thought I read to it . &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take the 17 variety in a notice of the moon and each each each each each one and each one will cing with a different tone .
With this not laurea to Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting to count to contact the present .
Now , &#91; applauses &#93; the problem is that even the ones that have to heart the people who have heart the history of the history of the history of the history of the history of the real world , and pass beyond .
In fact , the 21st century , 300 years , it &apos;s not remember for its wars its wars or technological innovations , but rather like the was where we stopped and we abbractively actively or willing to the passively des of biological diversity and cultural distriction of the planet . Now the problem is not change .
All cultures through centuries were involved in a dance for new possibility of life .
And the problem is not the technology .
The Indians have no stuck to be Sioux when they put up in the part of the army and they did as recess as American , when they put up in the horse and hot .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that they mind the integrity of the etnosphere . It &apos;s the power .
The flight of domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you &apos;ll discover that these are not destinate cultures are not destined to disappear .
They &apos;re creatures and dynamic dynamic forces that go out of the existence that go beyond their ability of adaptation .
And it &apos;s disbosing in the patria patria --
a nomad-high nomadows in the Sarawak , a population that lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now reducing to the news of the rivers of the figured out of the rivers of the figured out , where you can see the river Borneo to the midle of the Cinal Mdian Cinch , where the naveling Chorneo , Mdian Centerrible , where the horizonte horizonic physouth of the high East of the world &apos;s read of a ,
and filled style with the wood wood on the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that have come with the discovery of gold .
If we move on the Tibet of the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the volved fly of the political domination .
And as you know the genocide , the physics of a population , is condannated at the universal level , but the ethnic of the style of the style of the style of the style of the development of the strategy , because it &apos;s part of the development .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of the Tibet as it &apos;s not part of the beginning .
I spent 6,000 miles from Chenger in the West Chenger in the Western Tibet , coming in Lhasa , with a young colleague , but only came to Lhasa , I &apos;ve got got to realize what we &apos;re going to talk about .
6,000 worlds on the centers in the policies and centers .
1.2 million people killed from the military Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascritish in the Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed to the time of Chinese invasion .
His uncle with Santity in Santity during the diaspora that brought the people in Nepal .
His mother was imprisoned and his cholas was a rich .
It was brought to hidden in cars for two years old , hidending under his craft because it wouldn &apos;t have lived without .
The sister , who did the same , was put in a reeducation camp .
One day has inavversion of a day , a days , Mao and , for this transgression , was put on the forced work for seven years .
The Tibet pain can be insopporable , but the spirit redesian redesize of the people is from typical .
And it &apos;s all about it , it &apos;s a choice .
We want to live in the world world &apos;s world , or we want to take the policromatic world or we want to take the policromatical world of diversity ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before we die said that his biggest fear was that in our liver vision of the world , we &apos;re going to see the whole amount of human imagination is going to see the whole ama of modity of thinking , but a day , a day , we &apos;ll wake us from a day , but a day , a day , we &apos;re going to wake up to the sound , that there were other possibilities .
And it &apos;s humiliating that our species is existed for 60,000 years .
The Neolitica Revolution , which given us the agriculture , which has done us to get to the cult of the sime , and replacing the poetry to the next few of the cler , creating the hierarchy of specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The industrial modern world has been at the same time .
That sharks , I &apos;m not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we &apos;re going to have to deal with the millennia to come .
When these miriades of cultures of the world is asked what it means to be human , they respond to 10,000 voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all discover the possibility of being what we are , a kind of consciousness , that has to be able to do all the garden people and all the garden ges can fiord . And there are great moments . And there are great moments .
I took this picture on the north extremity of Baffin , when I went to the hundred of balene with Inuit , and this man , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The canadvantage has not always been gency with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to stabilier our own company , we &apos;ve reached them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man got to go .
The family , temting for his life , he brought him away , and all of his tols .
You have to know that Inuit doesn &apos;t feel the cold , they exploit .
The slices were in originally , the original pators were made of fishery shape .
The grandfather has no typical non-in-city or the blizard night .
It &apos;s hot , you climb the paper pins in their hand . When the foca focus in your hand . When the photo have frog , you work with a moke .
He sprayed himself on the pointing of this clear , and when solid became solid , he killed a dog .
He schooled the dog and created a brilliant , with the toracy cassa , has made a slitel , and it &apos;s gone out on the banchisa , and it &apos;s gone on the banchisa , clean tello , crowd tells a banchisa , and it &apos;s slide on the banchises .
We want to talk about caving with nothing ?
In 1999 , the canadvantage of the Canadvantage the total control of an area of a territory area of the California and Texas a sive set .
It &apos;s their new patria . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a independent territory . They construct all the minerary resources .
One of the basic example of how a nation-state can recognize with his population .
And , finish , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious at least to us to have been in these remote zones of the planet , make it remote .
For somebody is home .
They look at the setions of human imagination that are coming up to the da-driven of the other time . And for us , the dreams of these kids , as the dreams of the road of of of the hope .
To finish , we are convinced to the political political that politicians will never come to anything .
We think the polemy --
&#91; Applauses &#93; are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month to tell stories in our site reat 35 million living .
156 countries transmit our television .
Our reviews are seven slowers from millions of people .
Our work is to travel in the etnosphere to bring our public to bring our public to become floor as they saw and hopefully , hopefully to get a time for anthropology of anthoothers , and we have to find a lifespan of lifestyle , and we have to find a lifespan of pluralistic world and mululticultural world and multicultural walked in the etnostor ,
where the wisdom of all the people can contributing our collective well-being .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope is to be able to evidence some of the connection , in the case , not note them .
I want to start with what I call the official dogram .
The official dogram ?
The official dogram of all Western societies . The Dogma official dogram , &quot; If we want to male the benefit of our citizens &quot; The way to do it is to male the individual freedom . &quot;
The reason , from a side , in fact that freedom is in the same value , is precious , is precious , for human beings .
On the other is that if we &apos;re free , each of us can act to do everything that maximum to do everything that massive to do everything that massive to do our benefit .
The way to male freedom is to male to male choice .
More people are the more to be free , and more free , and the greater is their liberty , more to their well-being .
This , I think , it &apos;s so deep radicated in society that nobody would be able to put it in the society that there &apos;s a doubt .
And it &apos;s also deep in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly great .
I &apos;m going to allow a simple note on a hundred .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without contact 10 variety of oil and 12 acets of otherwise and 12 acetes that you can buy to make a enormous conduct of conditions in the resive resive , in the result of your deground dededededeground .
That &apos;s the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronics to fight a sterean : My , CD , Letor CD , radio , radio , radio , radio , amplificer , amplificer .
And in this single negotiation , there &apos;s a great number of components .
We can do six and a half million combinations using components that there are in a negotiation .
You have to admit that there &apos;s a lot of choice .
Other fidience of communications .
And when I was a child , when I was a child , you could get all the services , at the least basic services , at the least basic mom .
It was born the telephone , you didn &apos;t buy it .
A consequence of that , the phone was that telephone was never going to crap .
These times have gone .
We have a variety of telephones , especially between cellular cellular between cellular .
Here &apos;s the cell phones of the future .
My favorite is that in the middle , MP3 , cut up , and holding for the cycle cut me out of the rye .
If you not see you in the store under the house , you &apos;re going to take a little bit of you &apos;re going to get it .
And what &apos;s the one that happens is that people get into the stops and does this question . And you know what the answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell that doesn &apos;t do too much things .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the acquired , you know , the same plosion of choices .
Assistence of health , not happens in the United States that you go from the doctor and doctor doctor what you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do it , or B , &quot; A , &quot; has these benefits , &quot; B has these benefits . &quot; B has these benefits . &quot;
You say , &quot; Dr. &quot; Does , what should I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A has these benefits and these risks , and the risks , and these benefits . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebats , &quot; Dr. &quot; Dr. &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; I &apos;m not her . &quot;
We call it &quot; autonomy of the malseeing , &quot; the expression that makes it seems to be a beautiful thing .
But it &apos;s not that a site , and responsibility to make decisions of making decisions from somebody who knows something , which is the doctor , to someone else who knows nothing -- and then in ideal condition to make the patient decisions to make the patient decisions .
There &apos;s a huge marketing product of pharmaceuticals , direct to people like me and you , if you think about it doesn &apos;t make sense , that we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why can they published them ?
The answer is that they want to ask them to be called the doctor to ask to change the recipe .
Something so fundamental identity is horever is is a question of choice , as you see in this jump , &quot; we don &apos;t want to force the kids . They &apos;ll cut their own sex . We &apos;re going to get it right now at the right time . &quot; We have to invent .
And we can reinvent how many times we can do it .
That means that every morning , to the risk , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I &apos;m putting up to the family and marriage , a time next pective , sure at almost for anyone , it was that there was the most possible , and it was that you started to get to drop the most possible .
The only choice was with who , not when , and not even what to do after .
It &apos;s really about it .
I teach to a very smart students , and I do do their 20 percent in the work than a time .
And not because they &apos;re not smart , because they &apos;re not unless diliging .
But because I &apos;m impensieritation , I &apos;m going to ask , &quot; I should go to ? &quot;
&quot; I should go more ? &quot; I have to think about the career or career ? &quot;
They &apos;re interrogorananants .
And they &apos;re trying to answer to these questions , even if this implement not to the companies that I seat my exame .
And they have to do it . They have to do it .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , like Carl was , because the technology allowing us to work every day , from every day , from Hotel Randolph .
In the parentests , there &apos;s a angle , and I &apos;m not going to say to anybody , where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , this incredible freedom of choice we have about work ? It &apos;s that we have to continually decide , if we have to work or not .
We can go to our son play , with the cell phone , the cell phone in a tank , the Blackberry , the niebook , typically , on the kneberry .
And even though they &apos;re all spending , every minute that we see our son , we also see our son , we also see , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; Do I respond to this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer to this email ? I have to do this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , &quot; that makes the experience of your child very different than the experience of the partnership of your son .
So , what we &apos;re looking at all , little and big , things , small and six , materials and style of life , life is a choice .
And once the world was this : Over , there were some possibilities , but it was not a choice .
The world today is : The world today is : The dilemma is , &quot; Is it a negative thing ? &quot;
The answer is SSSchool .
We all know them , we know , so I &apos;m going to talk about that negative ones .
All this choice is two effects in fact , two effects in fact , negative effects on people .
The first one , paradoxally , is that it produced to free .
And so many options between which choose , it becomes very hard to do it .
I offer you a significant example : a study conduct of volunteer pensive plans .
A colleagues had access to the data of Vanheat , the giant society of sources , with about a million climents in 2000 different companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in the most of adesion , the percentage of adesion ses .
With 50 sources , there &apos;s 10 percent in unless adesions than I &apos;m available to the five . Why ?
Because with 50 sources that choose , it &apos;s hard to decide , it &apos;s hard to decide , and the choice is remanded to the domain .
And domority , domorders , domain , domain , domain , of course , domorly domants , of course , domain ,
You can &apos;t just mean that these workers are going to eat the dogs because they &apos;re not going to be enough money , they also want to say that decision is so obstic that they also lose the funds of the complementary of the dator of work .
Not to participating , they &apos;re allowing five dollars per year from work , which was going to be willing to sure them .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too many shows .
And I think that &apos;s making the world like this .
&quot; And finally , for the eternity : ketchup , or maybe or maion ? &quot;
You want to take a just-decision , if it &apos;s for eternity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and nepure the wrong , and nepure conditions .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can avoid paralysis , and we finally have less satisfying from the result of how we would be with less options that choose .
And that &apos;s for different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of conditions that you choose , if you buy one and not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could do a choice that you could do a different choice that the alternative imagined us that the alternative imagined us to bring up the choice , and the repieces of the repiecy of the decision , and the repiss of the decision ,
even when it was a good decision .
More choices are , more easy to displaced any details that it &apos;s insofdisaster of choice option .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert asking a lot of practices like the value that we &apos;re depending on what we confront .
In the rest , when there are many options , it &apos;s easy to represent the equal characteristics that are scarten and be less satisfying of the options that is choice .
So here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m just just just sure with that they &apos;re not in New York .
But that &apos;s what you would think about .
There &apos;s this copy in Hamptons .
A place of light .
It turns out it . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not about it . But what he thought is , &quot; Well , it &apos;s August . &quot;
&quot; All my neighbors are away to Manhattan are away . &quot;
&quot; I could talk a lot about the front home . &quot;
And it passes two weeks absolutely assilate from the idea that &apos;s losing -- every day -- the possibility of to talk about where it wants .
The construction is the fuld-opportunity to what we have , even when the choice was eccellent .
And the more of the options that we have to consider , the more action of attractive characteristics , we &apos;ll return to the constitute of the construction .
Here &apos;s another example .
This vibrating a lot of things .
It &apos;s about living the time , and maybe slowly living .
But the most important point is that anything you choose , you choose to , you choose to not do other .
The things we don &apos;t choose have a lot of attractive attractive that they can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : the growth of expectations .
I tried it on my skin bought a new jeans .
I &apos;m going to almost always jeans .
And then the jeans were one of a kind of buy , they bought them , they were switch , only after they brought them a life and baby a lot of times , they started to go well .
So I went to buy a couple again when the old ones were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Look slim , fit , honey , relaxy , relaxy , relaxy and relaxy ? &quot;
Was you want to get the ground or with the buttons ? &quot; Stonewashed &quot; or &quot; aciwashed &quot; ? &quot;
&quot; Who want to be street ? &quot;
&quot; Sow the basic or stricken ? Ble bble bla -- &quot; Since the bla -- &quot; Sinured to elency .
I was ballowing , and after a while I was able to say , &quot; I want the only -- that was the only guy , &quot; I didn &apos;t have idea what I was , so for a time I tried me all of the sticks , and then came out of the best , and then came out of the best , you get out of the best jeans I &apos;ve ever had .
It was the very choice . I had all that choice I got the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand it .
The reason I was worse for worse is that with all that choice , the jeans had to be high , the jeans had to be perfect .
I started in the beginning I didn &apos;t expectations . I wasn &apos;t expectal at least , but when I saw 100 different steps , at least a kind of must be perfect .
What I had buy was good , but not perfect .
And after I was talking about that choose to what I was trying to satisfying in expectations .
The advantage of options in people &apos;s life doesn &apos;t do that these have respect to the eccellence of options that are .
And this will produce less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing if you make it .
Because if they knew what I &apos;m talking about what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more to this .
&quot; It was better when it was worse when it was worse , &quot; The reason that you was better when it was worse when it was worse , it was that when you was worse to meet surprised .
In the world we live in the world we live in opulation , citizens with the perfection of perfection -- the maxpattern that we can hope is that the things are the height of expectations .
You never surprised because your expectations , you &apos;ll never survey , my expectations , they &apos;re ingiganizes .
The secret of the happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Basse wasn &apos;t expectations . &quot;
I mean , little autobiographic moment -- which I &apos;m really moved and my wife is really stupend .
I couldn &apos;t have done , I didn &apos;t have to do that .
But to contentate is not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of buying a couple of jeans swites when there &apos;s only that when you &apos;re not satisfied , and say , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot; The answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What could I do to do you ?
When there are hundreds of types , and you buy a disaster , and you ask who is responsible , it &apos;s just as clear that responsible , it &apos;s just as clear that you are .
You &apos;d have been able to do better .
With hundreds of dispone-details , there are no scuses for the indeed .
So when people are decisions , even though the result is valid , they feel insofdisfaced and they give the basic to them .
In the last few years , depression is exploss in the industrialized world .
I think a meaningful factor -- not the only one , but -- this wave of depression is that people have experiences of depression is that people have experiences because the standards are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation they think that the colp is them .
So the final result is that we &apos;re in general , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me get remind .
This is the official dogram , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely false . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little choice is better than it is that it &apos;s better than it , but it wouldn &apos;t be a little bit better than a little choice .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m pretty sure we &apos;ve been survey that we &apos;ve been overwhelming our life .
Now , from the political point -- I &apos;ve got almost finished -- from the political point , the nocle is the following .
What it allows in the industrial society is the material wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know about it , where the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too little bit of them .
So the factory that I &apos;m talking about is a malbeing malbeing malbeing in modern , reconnection societies .
And what it does to do is , and it &apos;s this : Steve Levitt has talked about yesterday of how those expensive and seats for whatever those are useless . It &apos;s a waste of money .
I mean , these choiced choiced , complicated and dispenditure , it &apos;s not that they &apos;re just useful .
They &apos;re going to be a deleteries .
They &apos;re doing worse .
If a little bit of what in our societies allows a little choice was reversing in those where people have too few possibilities , it wouldn &apos;t just be better , but it also wouldn &apos;t just be better , but it also .
This is what economists call a better , they call a better ,
A redistribution reduction is good at all -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in excess that comes back us .
To conclude , you can become everything you want to become everything you want to be &quot; --
You know , people of culture , you think , &quot; What does that do that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t get anything in a glass of glass . &quot;
&quot; A castrated , a limited vision of the world -- &quot;
and I &apos;ve interpret it like this , at the beginning .
But then , I realized that that fish the weight that fish the long .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you stand in the bookage , so that &quot; everything is possible . &quot; You can &apos;t get the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you take a bought that everything behind possible to decrease .
You get the paralysis , and you reduck the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too stricken , perhaps even for us .
But the axim of some symbolic symbolic , I &apos;m going to roughly , for the rouinside .
Thank you for heart .
