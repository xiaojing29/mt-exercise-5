The year I &apos;ve showing these living these slide to demonstring that the calculate glacial , which for 48 million years had the size of 48 million years had the 48 .
It &apos;s a lot of the gravity of the gravity of the problem because of the problem because not shows the fall .
The calculate glacial is , in a sense , in a sense , the cuor of the global system .
You have expected and you get the hundreds .
The next slide is going to be a record to be a recording to the last 25 years .
The drawings are in the front .
As you see , you know , you know , you know .
That &apos;s the winter in the inside , which is the winter .
You can see that the costype of the hopeffort , of five years or , is like the sangue , which is the sances from the body .
In 25 years is led by so , so .
This is a problem because the recording to the interested in the ocean , and they &apos;re instring to the ocean where there are huge of carbon , which is a huge , and they can transformed in metal to put in the microbs .
Rispect to the inquinter of the inquatmosphere , that global , that the global , that &apos;s the global , the surface , the surface of this point of thing .
In some laghes in a little deep of Alaska is already to the water .
The professority Katey Walter Walter the University of Alaska , and a tool , a later , I know ,
Video : Wow ! Gore : Let &apos;s good . The question is if we &apos;re going to be .
A challenges is that that this scales from the normic Greenland from the north .
This is a figures , this is a recording .
The bad had never reached to reach them to reach them .
This is the Kangerlussing , in the South of the Groenland .
If you want to know how to sal the sal to move the move to the food on the shape .
These corrents are aumenting .
Another part of the planet : The most blows , the most blows of the planet .
The months of the scientists have diared that the fanananycle is in negative , and that AntyIses , which AntyIsran , which is particular ararly , very arly , it &apos;s particular arararly , is particular ararly remember .
Equive deal at the midle of the action , like in Greenland .
Sull Himalaya , the most bigger than the block of the block , you see new laghes , which was a few years ago , who had been glages .
The 40 percent of the population was going to put a hundreds of water to the fall .
Sulle Ands : this little little ball is the source of water .
The brought is aumented .
But when you have when you get to the same access to the water .
In California , the nine on Sierra Nevada is diminutes .
The bins are in the cribe .
The predictions , like you have later , I &apos;m gravails .
The growth growth in the world &apos;s reevant in a notice of the ininitive .
The wasers are indeed to a writing out of the normal and without out out out of the normal .
For many times more numerous in the last 30 years , you &apos;ve got 75 .
This is a writing of the instainable to be instainable .
If you look at the context stories if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years we &apos;ve got 70 million tone-24 hours -- 24 hours -- 25 million tone-hours .
Look at the area of the area of the Pacifaster , the American , and on the American , and the American continent , where there is a radically adically , where there is a radical adicted to the ocean .
Most of the global recording , together to the global death , which is the 20 percent , is the 20 percent , is the used to be done .
The pural is a problem , and the carbon is even even even even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with more emissions , with the Cina .
And he was the way to build many other central central central .
But we &apos;re asking to a change of direction .
These are the projects in the last last years , some of the last years , and some of the alternative vers .
every way , there is a lotter in our country in our country .
The industries of the carbon and the oil 250 million dollars in the last year for promoting the last year for promoted the basic , which is a simple simple .
That imagine me remember me to something --
I know Natest , in Tennested , where I was a perditself , there was a 3.billions of 3.billions of scories .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen the news .
This is the second bigger of checks in America .
It &apos;s happening to Natest .
The published nature of the industries of the industries .
Video : I think , the bonasic is a kind of wonderful , and happy .
It &apos;s wonderful here in America , and does growing our economy .
Mrost the carbon is always more and more can .
It &apos;s a good predictable , adorable and the worth and work ,
Al Gore : Da here is here , the part of the West Virginia .
The most society on the mountain the mountain is Massey . This is his friend .
Video : Don Britenlikely , I &apos;m going to talk -- Al Gore , Nany Pelety Pelective Reid -- not saying what &apos;s talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Prottion of Clie , he has a ppay .
This is a part of the part .
Video : Ator : All COLergy : We see the climate change as a serious minactic .
So that our priority is invest to requantity of money in a source to a public to make public to make public .
In fact , the carbon is not sport .
We think it &apos;s a good good ball -- has a good good good ball .
So , not predictator of the change .
Let me to do it .
Video : Ator : Carbone -- you have heard very much .
So I do a journey in a street in a street for how to read it .
It &apos;s a little bit . The machines are a little bit of technology , but this is the sound of the technology of the car of technology .
The consumption is between the maybe in the principles of global recording , but the global needs of the gap of the carbon .
You have a type : this is the odieral technology .
Al Gore : The Infinally , the alternative positive to this is connected to this economic and that &apos;s a sure .
Video : My : My : My is in the crisis , the sure , the crisis .
The phils that the college of all , our dipendence , and the bone , like the bone , like the clear and the oil and the oil .
Now , perhaps there is a new , audace solution for use .
Reember 100 percent of pull , in diected , in the drights .
A pian to reach America to do it in the work , and help us to to stop the global recording the global .
Well , a solution that basts to solution to solution to our problems .
Reople have a more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Yeah , it &apos;s a lot of reduced energy .
One of the most of the most reduces to the end of the dependence that we &apos;re the bustible .
The future future is here . It &apos;s here . It &apos;s a new energy .
The two : Nuggling to the invested for posts to pose .
The mine : Retimes America . It &apos;s time to be done .
Al Gore : A very presson , &quot; If you want to go to source , you go to the solar , you go .
If you want to go to , you go , you go together . &quot;
We have to go to go to ,
Thank you very much .
The year at TED fected to TED fected a LHC .
And promise to get to the writing to get to to you about how to work .
So , I &apos;m going to be . And for the other time , there was the most experiment . There was the largest experiment -- 27 million homeers .
His to realize the conditions that were less than a billion a billion second of a billion second from the universe -- until to 600 million times times to the second .
All of this is just environment .
This is the broken , and he was .
Frunning these mini-Bang Bang Bang Bang ,
This is about what I work . It &apos;s called TLAS -- is 44 feet and has a 44 feet of 22 feet .
This is a picture of ATLATS in built so you can see this .
The 10 septest pembon-hand we have accested the first time .
And this picture was taking from ATLAS .
It was because of immentioned in the health of control .
It &apos;s a first of the first phasasks that he had all all the LHC , in the LHC , in collision , with a part of the LHC , and a diffoning part of the middle .
In other words , when we see that the 10 september 10 septest , the machine words , the words , the great thing , the great vitting .
I don &apos;t know if it was to make a more opping of more opping , when somebody on Google and vide that the page was this .
What means that we had a cultural impact cultural .
And a week after we had a problem with a problem with the machine , had to have a problem with these -- these phils here -- these phils .
These bring 13,000 ampes when the machine works to the machine .
Now , the technical technical of you will look , &quot; It &apos;s not true . It &apos;s not true .
And they can do that because they &apos;re very very much of become to the cost of the surface .
So , less 271 degrees , a temperature inferor inferor the space between the space between the stage , these phils can bring that corrent .
In one of the most of the most of novems in the LHC , there was a fables .
So , the further , and they &apos;re going to read , and the 13,000 ampes , and 13,000 ampes .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressionally , if you think these magnetwork are more than 20 tone-tonyes , and that are saying about about 30 percent .
They are dants about 50 magnetwork .
We had to have them , what we did .
We have repressed and traveled .
They &apos;re wrote to the war to their place .
The end of the end of the LHC will be going to be new .
We &apos;re going to be , and we wash to get the data , and we keep the way we continue to continue , and continue so our exprise that they are the morning .
Now , of course , in a way of a way , these revenue reactive on the value of science and engineering on the confuture of science and engineering . It &apos;s what &apos;s doing . It &apos;s doing .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so difficult , the fact of the limits , I think that &apos;s the value of things like the LHC .
I &apos;d like to tell you with the words of one scientists , Human , Human , Humbe , which , the imagine , in the inutionary of his broken , his broken , his broken , and his baday , he said , &quot; Nichael , which is so much for the progress of the resources of the way , which is that the way of the squickly , which are the square , which is that we &apos;re not going to be a very quickly ,
Thank you .
I want to start to ask the ground of rethink , when you , from the morning , you know ,
Why you can do you get them and further and further and move , to make them , learning them , learning to think and solve problems and solve problems .
The reasoning is to the way that we &apos;re going to understand that we understand that graphuntable .
So , from the information of our interaction with our interaction with our interaction with my construction on Path , and my constructed , and my collaborator , I started to read me , I started to reach me , when we &apos;re a computer , when we &apos;re going to have the seen to have the seen to the wator , you can have the source the watch , and we could have the south , with the source , and I could have the soughly , with a soughting the source ,
and systems to our piece ?
The question was so the thing that we decided to exploring the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer .
In a few words , a Siftable computer .
You can have to move with the mand they can see &quot; the movement , &quot; between their movement and they have a sceren and a scerm .
But you can help , I &apos;m objects , like the morning , and they can move , they can move .
The Siftable , you know , a new ecosystem to maniping information .
And they have more physical , connected , connected , the other , the other , the other , and they have more physics , consciously , consciously , as we can make them , as a new way we can get new and different interaction .
I &apos;m going to start with some simple example .
This is configure is configurated for video : if you &apos;re going to show the video , the reaction , the reacting video , if you &apos;re going to get back to the other way .
These realize are connected to the other .
If you &apos;re interested , you know , it &apos;s what &apos;s their inside .
If they get out of the data , and they can get a little bit .
If they get out of the data , and they can get a little bit .
They &apos;re also going to be their movement and inclination .
We &apos;ve got to consumption that one of the interaction was the power of the interaction was the power of the data , to example , &quot; a color as a color as if it was a liquires .
In this case , we have three Siftable , and you can use them for the sound of the color in the color in the central color in the central , where they ask .
And I can use them to be to save the color in the central , where they are .
If you &apos;re too much , we can put a little place .
I &apos;m also beautiful possibility of appears , like the logic , the mathematics and oyes , where people can &apos;t have to try to try to try and see things , and see things .
Now , I &apos;m going to --
This is a sequence of Fibonacks that I do with a program .
Here we have a little bit of words that is to put in Sabeo and Bobs .
Actually , you know , every single literally , a literally in every Siftable , every single Siftable , every single hydrink , and as a table to be measures .
Then , after about 30 seconds of 30 seconds , and you have a new set of literats and possibility to try to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s here of the children in the Media Lab Lab , I did it and I was a video .
They &apos;re further very much .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of things that is that you can &apos;t get to to be to get to people in a lot of education .
You just say , &quot; The pons of words , and they &apos;re going to do .
Here &apos;s here .
This is our best best best best , there there is there .
He had just just to implant .
They only morning , for him .
Now , this is an application of a carton .
We wanted to build a strument for the bad of the lingue of Lui Lui &apos;s Felix .
It can inserious to new personally in the scenes in the Siftable .
It can inserious to new personally in the scenes in the Siftable .
Well , it &apos;s doing the solar .
Video : The solar is source .
David Merrilled : Now he brought a train in .
Video : The tractor .
Bel ! Yeah !
So school , I &apos;m going to get the neighbors can make it interages .
Video : Do !
And I &apos;m going to be in their history .
Video : Ciao !
DM : It &apos;s a story with final final , and it can decide .
DM : It &apos;s a story with final final , and it can decide .
Video : Swey , game .
DM : The last example I &apos;ve got time to show you a strument , realized , realized to field , to fire .
It &apos;s a strument , to realized , to walk and to walk and to ware and exething music .
The Siftable here are the battery , basically and the battery .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can use .
You can inseriously these suons in a sequence from commercial comport .
And modificate the simplicity , they &apos;re doing a &quot; and a &quot; and a &quot; and a &quot; &quot; and a &quot; sequence . &quot;
These are effects that you can control from the vive , as the results .
The tyes are to a particular sound and then inclasses to get it .
And then there are the effects like time and wanted to be , which you know , which they &apos;re just to the interested .
Look at how it works .
Video : We &apos;re going to be doing a base in two Siftable , &quot; systems , &quot; We &apos;re just doing , the extensignal , the extensigned , we &apos;re going to add , we &apos;re going to do it .
Now , I &apos;m going to move .
Video : Now I &apos;m going to addition --
Video : And now , I can put the philils to the battery , so I can controlled the effect of the vive .
Video : I know , I know , I know the interested in the time to inating the time from another .
Video : And now I &apos;ll go to the phils to field to fight for the more expression .
Video : I can remember , I can remember the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to be the first , but I can try , but I can try to try , and more more more more more more cording .
And now , finally , I can save the interintera fump between the Siftable , inating the Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is built to make new interface . It &apos;s also more more than our brain works like our brain and the brain .
And today , I had time to show you a result of this perhaps , and also some possibility that we &apos;re trying to bring out of the laboratory .
The concept I want to put you is that it &apos;s going to be this new generation of objects to interacted with the media , which will will experience to our world that we want to do .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;m not see the now of you .
I &apos;m a church .
It &apos;s my profession is my profession but it &apos;s more than this , but it &apos;s more than this ,
It &apos;s also the love and the love of my life .
And I don &apos;t expect me to change .
But , said , this is to recently , I &apos;m just in my life and in my daughter , which has bred me to realize the interest with this work .
The particular thing is that I &apos;ve recently recorded this book , this book called &quot; Maneteth , As the &quot; Manangible , which is a very sunceds , a great reason , for some reason to be in the world and become a great hinsatic .
And the results is that anything that anywhere , people are just as if they were conducted .
David -- -- condanned , condannect !
They have to me now all works and say , &quot; I said , &quot; You don &apos;t have to do it more than it ?
You don &apos;t have to be going to go to to to be able to be able to be able to be able to create a book that can be able to make a book that ? &quot;
What can you ? &quot;
It &apos;s rurant , you know .
But it could go to the way , to the part of the more than 20 years ago , when I started to say , when I started to say , I was a writing .
I &apos;m going to control the same reaction from the same .
And people said , &quot; You know , &quot; You know , &quot; You know , &quot; You can &apos;t have success ?
You don &apos;t have a couple that is a billions of the results ?
You don &apos;t have to do this must to do that to all of all life without out out and dead on a cumual cumual , and dead of a bocket , with the bocket ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short is , the short of all these questions is , &quot;
Well , I have a couple of all of those things .
I &apos;ve been always had a couple .
And I &apos;ve also also a lot of other things that people could not have to involved .
As the galga and other things .
But , to how much about what I thought I thought I thought I was , and I ask me is why ?
Is it ?
It &apos;s logic that anything to expected to be to be further from a work that you know ,
But what &apos;s about this particular in the impressed to make us to make us to to the health th health th th involved in a way that other carries ?
How do my father , he was a ingetic ineths and not remember of a solar sold in his 40 years of activity in which was asked to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be exacacti
It was never -- that blows of the engineer John John , how it ?
It didn &apos;t work , so it was that ?
Onnly , the engineers like group , in the century , in the centuries , in the century , in the centuries of being allowed .
We have this reputation , we have this reputation , and not only scrines of every gene , we have this reputation of institutions .
And it &apos;s not to look at the tristory of the magnified , or the magnific death , only in the eximime , dead , dead , dead , dead , dead to them .
And also the people who are not suickly to be realized to be realized to their dings .
Norman Mailer , first of dead , the last few books , &quot; Oger my book has a little book , I know a little more than &quot; a little bit of the work .
But we don &apos;t bad when we feel that we &apos;ve heard of these things so much as we &apos;ve got to do this stuff that in some way we &apos;ve been interested in a way we &apos;ve got to do that .
And the question I want to do all today is : You &apos;re going to do with this idea ?
It &apos;s good thing , because even even even though from a centire fy to me to me .
I think it &apos;s odiosa .
And I think it &apos;s also pericked and I don &apos;t want to see the perpecugged in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to get our big creative creative creative creative creative .
And I &apos;m sure that , in my case -- in my case -- it would be very perhaps to start to refuger that I was going to be able to be able to be able to stop the cost of the worried .
Or -- I &apos;m looking at , I &apos;m just just a 40 years .
I still have about four details of work in me .
And it &apos;s very much , which is probably about what &apos;s going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be done , after the same success of my last last last last few books .
It was going to be , because we &apos;re all more or less , I &apos;m all the most of my big success to my big success .
Oh , Gesh , who think I was a !
You know that is the genetic to think that it &apos;s a person to start to start to start to start to the ground of morning , and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would like to continue to do this work that we &apos;re .
So , the question , how ?
And so , I think , after many reflected me , which the way to continue to continue to go to to to to create a psychological cost , OK ?
I have to find a way to find a distance of sound between me , which I &apos;m going to be write , and my natural , and my natural writing that will be able to get to the time to be able to look at the time , and I &apos;m trying to look at the time , trying to find other society , and I &apos;m trying to see if you could have to see if you could have to see if you could have to see if you could have to see the other .
It &apos;s about how to help people creative to make the inerent inerent the creative creative .
And that research has brought to the Grereveal and Rome .
It &apos;s because it was a hyslow and then back .
Not the Grerecording and Rome -- people didn &apos;t seems to believe that the creativity is the drights to the men , OK ?
It was thinking that the creativity was this explained to this explains and that if you get to a men of a few sorts of the reasons and wonderful , for reasons , and know , and know , and I know ,
We were called these divity , the beritism about the creativity . &quot;
You have to have a wonderful , credeal of a demand that &apos;s a basic that &apos;s wisdom .
Rome were the same idea , but they called that kind of the same kind of explained to it a gene .
The thing is great , because the Rome because the Rome was really a very deal .
They have to have a kind of writing this kind of wonderful , which is a lot of living in the murs of a public study , a little bit like the hundreds of the work . And that &apos;s a little bit like the artist of the work is to the work .
Here &apos;s a three--- here , that &apos;s the distance of what -- that &apos;s the expensive psychological protected to the results of the job .
And all had been so that works , right ?
So the artists were protected from certainly , how to do you know , you know , no ?
If your work was a ceycle was a way to make it , all the market , all all the beings , all of the incorporate .
If your work , you know , it was not all the ball , you know , right ?
They had been all the same thing to be a very good incapable .
And so people are so fantastic creativity in Occcident for very time .
And then the Rindeent was to the bind and all changes , and we put this big idea ; we put the universe , and we all all the universe and the universe and put it out more and without more left to creature that you have to write .
This was the human human human , and people start to think that people started to think that the creativity is about the creativity ,
And for the first time , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know that a person with the gene .
And I think I was a groserror .
I think I think it &apos;s a simple person , a simple person of creating to be as a repiece of how you have to be a fourth , creativity and the surprises , creative creatible , creatible to a phililild , and a big philililild to the huge of the buman .
It &apos;s like to ask to somebody of the solar .
Deeat and completely the way , and I think of all these initions expectative .
And I think it was this to describe the bed to destruction the 500 years .
And , if this is , and I think it &apos;s , the question is , and now ?
Can we do that ?
Maybe to get to a comcommercial commercial .
Or perhaps not .
Maybe we can &apos;t have a 500 years of thinking about 1500 years .
And probably , there &apos;s people in the audience that was suspsycheck , instead of , instead of , but you know , you know , you know , they &apos;re just saying their designs .
You can &apos;t have to be not convinced all of this .
But the question I &apos;d like to do is -- why ?
Why don &apos;t you think that in this way ?
Because it has more more than every other thing that has ever heard to explain the expert of the process .
A process , as anything that has ever ever ever ever been done to do something -- so , so , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
And , in fact , you can think about it seems .
I did this incontrol with the strap with the extraordinary Ruth , who now 90 , but he was 90 years , but that was a poeter for all life and he said that he had been a poeted to the weren , and he was in the waiting , and he was a poetched , and he was a powerful , and he was a powerful , and he was a a powerful , and he was a few time .
He was a fragree-inside .
And that was recording to the wind from the wind .
You know , it was to get to a third the land under the third source .
He had to have a solar thing to do that point to that point and he was , words and he was , &quot; Deep . &quot;
And then it was going to be in and he was inched from this powerful , and it won &apos;t have to make a piece of a clear mathers in the page , as the traditional , and it was going to make the page .
And then you could be enough to be enough to be enough , so it was recorcorcorrect and recorded out and recording to get in the home and the time to get up through and she would slow up and it would be continued to go through the countries , and it would be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to go to the way .
Then were the time -- this piece of the six dimensions , there were the moments that was almost cauthors , okay ?
So , he was recorded to the home and he was trying to make a bad and the time , and he was going to be a mathemselves , and then he was going to be , and then he said , and then he was when you were ungased , and he was going to be .
He was the powerful powerful from the code and reaction to his body and translation on .
And in these cases , the powerful , it would be represented on the page and intately , the last word before .
So when I feel like , it &apos;s a couple , is exactly to my process .
And my process , I &apos;m not a conducture . I &apos;m not a conducture .
I &apos;m a brother way of work is , and my way to work is , and I &apos;m sure out of the same time and work and go to the way .
But I &apos;m a personal , in my test , I &apos;ve got a control of the thing , sometimes .
And imagine that many of you can do that .
You know , even though the work and I was sitting me from a certain a certain you could &apos;t know .
What is this ?
And how can we have to do it in way to do that it doesn &apos;t get the head , but , a wonderful , which is , you know , you know ?
For how to me about , the best example of the contemporary example I have is the music Tom Waits , which I &apos;ve interview .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of the life was the indeed of the artist of artist artist of the artist of the artist of the results , to try to controlled , to be creationship .
But then I &apos;d invected , and a day , and a day when he was widing on a a a basic way .
He was going to go and all of the sent , this little little brother , and it was wonderful , which is the wonderful , and he was wonderful , elusix-wonderful , and the wonderful , and the wonderful , and the wonderful , and it was not like the .
It has no piece of cars , it has no longer , it has no regier .
So , I started to feel this species of the wind , &quot; the kind of , &quot; the sound for perpers , and he rewards to be personally .
I &apos;m not good and I can &apos;t make it . &quot;
And we &apos;re going to go to the wait .
I &apos;ll move the interest or and further something new .
He just just just the wind and said , &quot; Scush , &quot; Scush , not see ? &quot;
&quot; To you know , you know , you know , you know ?
If it really want to be existing in a moment when I can make me care of you .
And I &apos;m going to go to the important thing today .
You &apos;ve got to be a Cohen . &quot;
And his process , I have been changed after this .
Not work , the work was still like .
But the process , and the fish was realized that was recorded when he was left when the genial gene , the gene of him , the other problems that was going to use the other things that &apos;s problems that was going to be a interested .
But I &apos;m going to sure , he was wonderful , he was a conversation of a conversation between Tom and this thing that was not Tom and this thing was not Tom .
So how much you feel like that , and it &apos;s also the way I was working and already me and already me to do a time .
This idea , I was going to writing , I &apos;m going to be , &quot; Pria , &quot; and I , &quot; As , &quot; and I said , &quot; As , and we &apos;re all doing something we &apos;re doing this when we &apos;re doing something like to be doing that , and we &apos;re doing a writing .
It &apos;s not only buttered , the purpose .
And I started to think about this project .
But then I remember of Tom that works to the air and try .
So I went to my favorite in the host and driving my comments to a hangle .
And I said to the wall , &quot; Sents , &quot; What , &quot; Well , what we know if we know that if this book is not going to be interested in my own , no interested in my own , no interested , no interested in my own book , no interested in my book , no interested in my book , not interested in my book , you know ,
Because as I &apos;m going to put all that I &apos;ve never , I &apos;ve never more than this .
So if you want to be better , you depress you represented to you and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t know , you know , I &apos;m not to me .
I &apos;m going to go to to to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I want to favor that I &apos;m recording that I &apos;m recording to do my part of &quot; because , the end , OK , OK , OK , OK , OK , OK , OK , you know , the people who were recording to the watch of the wait was in the wait and the hours to the hours and and to the hours .
And they were always magnific , because the balleries were balleries and were fantastic .
But every so much , something happens , and one of these artists , and one of these artists was actually translate .
And I know you know what you know , because I know , because I know you all , a perforce .
It was like the time , and the ballery , and the ballery in a kind of a perforce and not doing doing a lot of different different from different source , as 1,000 news , but all the 1,000 , but all you know , but all , it was .
And to the improvide not as a human thing .
But you have to account from the wind and sunder the winter of the divinity .
And when this happens , you know , you know , people know what was , called the coal named .
They were the hands and and started to sleep , &quot; Allah , &quot; Allah , Allah , God , God , God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curiosa night -- when Morinvasoled the Spage of Spage , this tabables with their own own own own in the centuries , and the pronce of &quot; Allah , Elah , &quot; Olah , &quot; Okay , and the words , &quot; Olalah , &quot; The damazing in the corcorner .
In Spain , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , &quot; Allah , &quot; Heh , I was , &quot; incompared , &quot; one , &quot; one , a scored , a clear , a scored .
And it &apos;s great because we need .
But , the problem , the problem after the day , for the same day , when you save , when you save the 11 , and I &apos;m 11 , and the 11 Marteds and scored it , there &apos;s no more .
It &apos;s just a detailed with the ginocky with the ginocky , and it will not be more to ask to the hand .
And perhaps no one will be the names of Dod , and what &apos;s going to do it .
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most records to do in a creative life .
But perhaps not have to be so much if you could have to create , you know , you know , which the most extraordinary of your extraordinary to be stay .
But you can just you think that you can just get out of the data in the press of this source of this source of your life that you can get to the other life that you can get to the other when you &apos;ve got to get to the other when you &apos;ve got to get to the other life when you &apos;ve got to get to the other life when you &apos;ve got to get to the watch you .
And , you know , if we think about this way .
And I started thinking , and it &apos;s saying , and it &apos;s sure as I thought for different months in the book of the book that published I &apos;m going to be , the perhaps , the perhaps , the perhaps of my dangerous , exactly the same thing .
And that I have to continue to tell me when I sent I feel electried to this is , not had a couple .
It doesn &apos;t get to the basic . It only your work .
It &apos;s going to be represented to represented to your part , whatever .
If your work is to balls , balls .
If the divince , I &apos;m going to ask you decide to leave some kind of wonderful kind of wonderful , for a moment , and then you just through the szero , &quot; Okay . &quot;
All the same , you know , you know .
And &quot; Okay ! &quot;
I think I &apos;ve got to do it .
&quot; The ! &quot; You know , only for for for for had had to have a human-mine and tyes .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Okay !
You know , you know , some of these designs on the genome , what can meaning and discoveries on the new set of new set .
We &apos;re starting to a new perspective : we started to digitalize biology and now now to that code from that code in a new phase of biology , designing and syntheside .
We always tried to do great questions .
What is the life ? &quot; What is something that many biologists have been tented to understand that .
We tried to have a different approach , reduced to minimes .
We &apos;re deal from almost 20 years .
When we &apos;ve sequenced the genome of the world of biology to the world of biology in the world of biology in the world .
Now , we can regenerally regenerate life , or create new life from this universe ?
This is the maps of a little organism , Mycoped Mycoped , which is the kind of smaller than the floor that can autorem in the laboratory .
And we tried to reduce the way the genome for creators .
We &apos;re able to degree a hundreds of about 500 hundreds of about 500 that are here .
But when we look at his maps to put a maps , it &apos;s relationship to our .
It &apos;s simple , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can see , one to the time , it &apos;s very impossible that this can bring to a bilue .
So we decided that the only to do for the only to reveal to be to reveal with this way to make components to make components to bring some of these questions questions .
And so we started the wind &quot; Posystering a chromosome ? &quot;
It &apos;s the chemical chemical to product these big big molecules that we never have to create before ?
And , in case , we can do a chromosome ?
A chomosome is simply a piece of material chimic material .
The docity with that we &apos;re able to deal to deal life is growing life is growing up .
Our capability to write the genetics , investimates , realized , but it &apos;s more , but it &apos;s better .
And our most recently recorded the brand the brought on a a hourth .
We &apos;ve been starting more 15 years ago .
The process has requires a lot of revision , beginning with a revision that beginning to the first experiments .
But we have discovered synthetising of DNA very difficult .
There are decine of thousands of the world that are all the world that are all the world of DNA , the long long time , the most regenerative , and it &apos;s a process , more regenerative , more running , more rors .
So we had to develop a new metoxes to assembling these framments and reread the errors .
And this was the first of our first tatic , to talk about information , to talk about the genome of Phi 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that &apos;s a little virus .
We &apos;ve designed the ments , effectures the reaction of the errors and a molecule of DNA about 5,000 lect-lect-lect-lect-lect-lect-lect-hunglect-hunglect-lat-hundreds of the ments ,
The interesting part of the interesting thing is when we have this piece of material chimic material and we have injected in the batteratteries , they &apos;re starting to read this code .
The particles are then you &apos;ve got to leave the phone , I &apos;m going to come back and they &apos;re going to be house and they &apos;re going to be .
I &apos;ve talked about requires with membring the industry of the industry that their own own .
They have more than you .
We see that this is a situation where the software can actually build his same way to build his own own own .
But we wanted to do things to do more .
We wanted to build the interest or of the battery .
They are more than 500--hy-code .
So we thought of built in the size of the size of virus , so that we could change the class to understand what they &apos;re components to understand what they &apos;re components .
The designers is crucial , and if we started with information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequency this for the first time in 1995 , in 1995 , was a herror for every 10 mistap .
We &apos;ve discovered , required , 30 herrors . If we were used that sequence not to be able to do that .
One part of the process is to design seging 50 lectons that you have to get 50 lectable with all of the other other segents of 50 leters to build more smaller than 50 longer and work together .
We &apos;re going to do here .
You &apos;ve got later , you &apos;ve got later , we &apos;re going to get the flights .
And think about this : We have a code code on four leters on four leters : A , and TG .
And you have to the lectype of 20 amminacial 20 , and there &apos;s a specific specific remind to every amage to every amage .
So we can use the genetics for write to write , under , unclear .
What we &apos;ve done is to the beginning was autographs .
Some were used to the same that was not a few exia .
We &apos;ve been designed these segs to make them to simply with scientists .
There are the thing that are repartnetwork and put them .
And we started to assembling the parts , beginning with seglectable , and until lect--------------------------t-t-t-t-lectype lectype lectyles .
And every past we &apos;ve product these sesequenters so so that we could sequenced that we &apos;re sequenced that we &apos;re going to create a mestruck .
We &apos;re trying to automatizing the process .
So , this seems to the tables of a player .
When we &apos;re going to do this very long long , more than 100 mistakes , more than 100 mistakes , not growing in the EE.
You can get to the limits of biology of biology .
So we &apos;ve been seen other mectruth .
We had to do another mount of the network called the binination , which in biology , which in biology , which is going to repartment .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinoctor , it can make three million running three million rad .
You can see in the result of the suggested as his chomosome .
In 12 -- 24 hours is a first .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely .
They &apos;re live sunder .
They &apos;re asseminly that life in space , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know ,
AShe shows the NASA shot shows that this is .
This is a lot of the molecular that we have built these process , just using these process , just using the design of the design appropriate with the design approach .
The basic eventually ,
This is not been taking with a microscope with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a lot of great that we could see with a microscope that we can see with a microscope .
These are pictures that they have a periods of about six .
This is the publishshed that we &apos;ve done .
They are more than 50,000 lectype of code .
It &apos;s the most of a big street of a burance , created by the man .
It &apos;s a weight to a 300 million .
If you &apos;re going to get a carrier without out 10 page , you would like 142 page to transcar this code .
Now , how do we do it ?
Of course , a virus is a bad game is a little bit of kids .
It &apos;s a little more complicated when you use the batteratteries .
It &apos;s simple when it &apos;s a basic physical and as our own : You can just extract the nuclear , and you can just extract the way , which is pratically the process of the process .
In the battery of the photographs is invaded in the best phone , but we &apos;ve been seen to be able to do a physical physical .
We have a chromosome to talk about a kind of a microbial .
The two are different than the men .
We &apos;ve got some kind of a more way to decide that that we could decide to do to this .
The one to science with the entire entire all of the protein .
And when we have the phone was a was study -- and you know , and you &apos;re predicting our graphopefully -- the new physics .
And I thought we could not go to the way we could go to the most , but we tried anybody to go more .
This is one of the mectrons of evolution .
We discovered that that tants are very species have to address a third or a third of a second , and I think about new things in the middle of new .
So , who think about evolution as a kind of biology that you have no enough to do that .
There are the entire entire me called me , I &apos;m going to tell that that advantage the DNA .
The cell that was in the cells that was in the cell .
The cellula-cell phone that we have inseri------------t-t-t-t-stand---t-t-t-romosome .
It &apos;s expressed , and he remember the other traneycle , and it &apos;s extraneum , and we have been with only cells with only cells .
It &apos;s become a basic books that we have to have .
And in a short of time , all the caristic caristic species are going to be performed of all in a new species , and it &apos;s just about the new species , based on the phone that we have to have in the cells .
All the protecin are changes , the membrane are changing , and when we &apos;re going to be exactly what we &apos;ve been transformed to what we &apos;ve been transformed .
Now , this could look like to seemy , but altering the software , but the software . We can change things in the way .
Now , I &apos;ve got to explain that here is not talking about the genius -- but of the three million years and a few million years and a few million years and a mediately , and I said that we &apos;re going to create a new version of the trained to be a new new process .
Why do we do that ?
I think it &apos;s enough when we think that &apos;s the switches .
We &apos;re going to go to six billions of people in the next 40 billion .
Right to fight a example : I &apos;m non-in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for an exists in 1946 in 1940 , there are going to be four .
We &apos;re doing now now now now now , and pull , water and pull , medicinal , medicinal and pull of people .
It &apos;s more ducing to do that for nine billions .
We &apos;re more than five billion carbon of carbon , more than 30 billion paper .
It means that it means million broken the day .
When we &apos;re trying to find biological processes , or whatever , or whatever to repieces , it will be a huge .
In more we have to have to the most of CO2 from these materials that &apos;s just in the atmosphere .
And the day today , thank threalized that all the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are components to think that are components to do the future .
The industry is only only a dozen dozen of about components , and think about about a components .
Our limits here are data from the reality and the image .
Now we have the technical metowever , thank you very much of synthetization , we can actually create what we call genome .
We &apos;re able to build a grosycle that can make a million a million chromosome of chomosomosome ,
Think of the 20 million different different different different different . And to try to try to be able to make the processes to product or to make a little bit more and make a little bit more biological , we can change , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create a little bit more biology , and create a little bit of biology .
And it &apos;s just a further .
We can choose to possibility of surface , and it &apos;s a chemical carbururant , production of vaccines .
This is an anea of some of some of some of the program that we &apos;re working for to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to degree to be able to be able to degree .
Well , we don &apos;t know how to be be like it will be .
We know , we know , the fact , it &apos;s their code .
Now we &apos;re just going to be regeneration .
You can see you that you know that you know , the grandwined from the grandwinter .
We have a second generation and third generation that will use it very free to the bururant , and more value as the fururant , as a different value of banankymuts .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact to have a big impact to make most human beings the cost of food and limiting the cost of food , to be transformed to be transformed to design this to designed to make this phone to to make this phone , and we can make this pect , and we could actually have this to repend this , and we can actually have about 110th .
The solar solar solar with the CO2 is a metodown--- but in our discovered world , we found different different metohes .
This is a organism we have described in 1996 .
And I &apos;m going to be about 2500 feet of a properature to the temperature of the water .
It &apos;s going to put from CO2 , they &apos;re going to get a lot of energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can get the CO2 , which can be transported to be transported to be transported to be transported to be transported to reverse this process .
So we think that we could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the thing , &quot; We have the dest , we have the dest of remaybe we could have the intertrtrolic industry .
And so , if you can &apos;t do that ?
It would be a maybe a main the middle of energy .
And we &apos;re working to work for using the same way to use the other hot to create accinines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with the influence , we &apos;re always back to a year and a dollar when you &apos;re going to find the vaccine .
I think what you can change change is going to change in combinable in the anticipate .
Here &apos;s how the future could be to change , the alallowed , the Exerating evolution , and the evolution of evolution , and I could be infinally , and infinally , infinally ally , and infinally , and infinally ,
We &apos;re so so much from the better .
Our purpose is to to live enough to try to try to try to try to make it . Thank you very much .
But I &apos;ll do that , the most of you to see , some kind of a new work , some work , in new technology that we &apos;ve got to the Microsoft , a year ago . This is a year ago . This is Seadadon . This is .
It &apos;s a environment that you can have to the local living with a huge that &apos;s a huge of data .
And we &apos;re seeing a lot of physical photographs with a coom of a coom of squickly , a squickly , a squital , fast , fast , and I &apos;m going .
And not import how big big foundation of information that we see , how much are great .
Most part of the photographs , but this for example , but this for example is a scansion from Bible Bibliotececame , and reduced in the gama 300 gapixiel .
Not a difference because the only thing that &apos;s only thing that limits to be a system of a system of pixelelected on your screen . It &apos;s also an architecture . It &apos;s an architecture . It &apos;s a very flflickly .
This is a book , this is a book of data .
This is the Casoled of Dickens . Okens . Or colonment .
For you can show you that it &apos;s just about the head and not imagines , we can do a kind of see that it &apos;s really to see that it &apos;s a representation of the head , not a photograph .
It could be a little bit of a little artificial book for a book .
It doesn &apos;t look at the way .
This is a more existic example . It &apos;s a number of a number of the Guardian .
Every big is the beginning of a set of a .
And there &apos;s a very good way , and the beauty of read to read the version of a revision of a revision of a revision of a very nature .
We also did something with the angle of this number of this number of this particular .
We created a published published the resolution -- very much more than that it &apos;s a normal published , and we have inseriously inseriously , we have inseriously contained .
If you want to see the caristic of this author , you can see here .
Or other model , or even specific specific .
And this really departnetwork of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space .
We &apos;re going to put this means to the end of the population and other cheries , and other cheries , they don &apos;t have to be necessary .
Naturally , the mapplications is one of the applications and for this kind of technology .
And on this not to leave time , if we don &apos;t want to say that we have to say that in this camera .
These are all the streets in the U.S.
So now we &apos;re going to go to what &apos;s other .
This is now the way of the wb ; you can go to the wb .
It &apos;s a project called Photynth Photynth , which is two different technology .
One is Seady and the other is a research of the U.N. It &apos;s really interesting from Noah Steam , a student , a student Washington , with the U.S. , and the U.S.
And it &apos;s from the website , and I remind .
You can see when you do this kind of a scermine , where we can go from an image and have this kind of experience and have this kind of experience .
But the collocation of the images here has actually a meaning .
The goritorites of visualization , they &apos;re recording these images , in way that the way that records to the way that you can see the imagined that imagined the Montants , you know , the neighborhands on the Montancipes , you &apos;re scape .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;ve shown you some environment .
There are some more space .
I want to go to a type of Noahyn---------hyn-precedently , and that &apos;s just a precar to the first time that we did worked for the first time , to show you what &apos;s really , to show you what &apos;s really the only only only only only only only only reduced . And we &apos;re not going to do that . And we &apos;re not going to look at the watch .
We had to have to word about the well-s-hold and .
This is a recording of Nothree Does , three Does , and the Flickr . Badigital . Badigitain . We &apos;re just imagines in the magicians , other things in magic , other dums , other drather than these concert . Olickr that &apos;s a banker .
So I &apos;m all imagines from Flickr and I &apos;ve all all all the space in this way .
And it &apos;s possibly navigate in this way .
You know , I would never think about about Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratificant to reevening this kind of happens here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of a lot of different kinds of different kinds of different cellules .
And if you have to try to try to try to try to try to try to those more strances .
Many are blows , and it was a blows .
some part here is a series of photographs --
This is a name of Nothree Drame recorrectly .
We can go from the poster to the poster of this environment .
The essential thing is that we can do with the social environment . This is now a data from the entire rememory of the rememmemory of the free , from the point of visual visual data .
All of those pictures are become , most of the parts of the parts .
You have a model of the land that .
And you think about this as a prolg-like to the Stephysical TV .
It &apos;s something that growing in complex that people are usually , and the people who are useful to use it .
They &apos;re saying with metaphor with other people .
If you &apos;re going to do all of these data , and I can use all these saying , my photograph , my physical phone of Nothree Dimproved , and the other things , and the can use of all these data , and the can use how to do this . And I can use a space , and I can use the universe , and I can use a physical experience of the way .
Naturally , a connected connected of all that are extremely elaborate of every interesting part of the interesting part of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the rememory , but from the memorteam .
Thank you very much .
Cris Anderson : I do you know ? What &apos;s your flexighborhood to do is that a way to do is that a way , in the next years , in the next years , in the next year , all the world &apos;s going to be able to be able to be prove ?
BA : Yeah . What is doing in practice .
It &apos;s creating the hyperlink , if you want to be , between images .
And it &apos;s doing this in the containing of the images .
The thing is very interesting if you think about if you think about the information of information that many of these images that many of these images .
As when you do a research on the web , you know , and the head on the page and the page has a bad information about picture of pictures of picture .
Now , what if you have to have to the picture of all your picture ?
So the quantity of interession of interconnection and the quantity of remainessing is really a huge . It &apos;s a very huge . It &apos;s a very huge .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible .
BA lot of non-very .
One of the maybe when you get to the traveling and one of the research is the power is the power is the power of the research is the power of the wind , the who &apos;s the wind , the wind , the wind , the wind , the wind , the hames , and the fables .
Bastes you think the Jaguar Jaguar , and the Via , or who are still three hands of Instan Instancians are still still still realized , or who are still still still still recording the human , or , the broddanging the respect of the Dot , but to remember the world , and the idea that &apos;s just a sense of the idea that we are not in the idea that is only about the world , but it &apos;s just a sense of a sense of the way of the world , but that &apos;s really ,
The consequence of a particular particular set of scels that our irirt has done , or a lot of generations , a generations ago .
And , of course , all we share of the essential .
All we &apos;re all all . We &apos;re going to do .
We &apos;re sitting the beginning of beginning .
We have to record the inesority of dead , so we don &apos;t surprises and we &apos;re not going to be a standing and ballistening .
We all have a basic .
What &apos;s the writing is the particular clear of the canzone , the Not of every culture .
It &apos;s not import that they think of the Borneo , or the Wooks , or the Voodoo of Haita , or the Curt of the desert Kenya in Kenya , Curt , or a myself , or a myself in Sahara .
He was my companies in my companies in the desert of the desert of the weren in the value of the value of Tomolangered the world .
All of these populations are other ways of the ways of think there are other ways of think , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of the world .
And , if you can get a bad , it &apos;s a concept that can give you a hopeffort .
And in the midriades of cultures of the world &apos;s creating life and cultural , and cultural , and cultural , and it &apos;s important to be the planet .
And you can think about this beyond as a hundreds of the nosed , and you can see the nosed nosed the way of all of the concept , every mitself , and intuitions , and intuitiative intuitiation , and intuitiation to be in the human inumation .
The nosed was the fantastic bang of human human .
It &apos;s the simple of what we are and what we can be in how much inquissues .
And as a physical was very much more than it was going to be successful , and pursue very much more idly .
No biologist , for example , it would be the 50 percent of all of all of all of all of the species of the exestintion of the exestintion -- in the most apapaparart -- in the different places of different countries -- and you won &apos;t have a little bit of the food , and you can &apos;t even in the different countritritrial .
The drip of all is , and I &apos;m sure , the longer linguistic .
When you &apos;re non-hundreds of this planet .
One lingudes not only from a vocabolic or or a series of rules .
A lingua is prades , the human spirit .
It &apos;s the midle with the animal or of every culture in the world .
Every lingua binforests of the mind , a spensive , a source of possibility .
And those 6,000 lens , as we &apos;re here here , as we &apos;re seeing Monterey , less less it &apos;s sushed in the oreques .
They don &apos;t have more to teach kids , the wants to say , less that &apos;s not going to do something , which are dead .
What is more tristory and be being being in the silences , the last , the last few talks about a lenon , the last way of the won &apos;t have to translation the wish of the promise ?
And this is a few weeks of some part of any of the world , every two weeks and a suntil and a bancient and sunclear with the toms and a sunlababables .
And I know , you know , &quot; Well , it &apos;s better ?
The world would not have a better place if we &apos;ve got all the same same longer ? &quot; Benish , now we &apos;re all worlisten . We &apos;re all going to be a best .
We &apos;re going to pursue .
You &apos;re going to prise , you know , you know , you can &apos;t talk about their lingua .
Now , I &apos;d like to do a visual journey through the etnosed --
a little journey in the nosed to give you a bad of what we &apos;re going to give you a lot of what we &apos;re going to get .
Many of us direction that when you say , &quot; different ways of existing , which is really different ways of exists .
We can make for example that bigger Barasana , in Amazonia , the population of the anaconia , which crease the mysteral , which cream to requires from the spend of a sacross .
It &apos;s a popular population that is not able to be able to distingually the color because the best phone from the time , which is the populated in time time , which is the population .
They have a strange lingua remonial , &quot; long-remonial , &quot; exactly &quot; , &quot; You have to have a person who talking about a person who talking about a person that &apos;s world-smark .
All of what has been in the myththemselves , and tavy , the particular particular , which is that these family and the seven or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven or a none one practage .
They have to sure and then beginning to talk .
We take a tributes more interesting with whatever , with what I &apos;ve got to the Waoran Ecuador , a population , a population that has had had the first content that has had had been first contattents in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionary , they &apos;ve been a contact .
They did to make the photographs that they had to get them in pose , and they were in positive , digmental , who had never seen a , which was never seen seen to the bird dimensional .
They &apos;ve got the photographs , the drop , they &apos;re going to be a short or a shape , they &apos;re not in the five , they have been used to use the further , and they &apos;re five .
But Waoran wasn &apos;t only the stranieters .
They have to have the way to them .
54 percent of the death was used to their own .
We are saying to the generations and we found two generations of dead and when we have been insisted to know , they have to know , they have to have a lot of them was invected , and then they have the same . And then they have the same .
The bunch were able to remember the animal from 40 stead of 40 and reosed the species .
In the first 1980s , I was asked me to a very interesting when my professor of Harvard to Harvard to Haititites to Haiter , and I wanted to go to Haiter and Tualier , and Tadvalizer and Tand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-h-hand-homened , and I I was a bunch for the way to do .
For a sense of miracolic , I would have to make culture culture culture , and that the Voo is not magnine .
It &apos;s a complex complex of a complex of the world .
Molt interesting .
If I ask you to tell me about the world , what I have ?
Cristianesimime , Islam , Budwaste , Ebraism ,
A continent is always left out , I think that Africa &apos;s the South Africa , not have to religious . And he wooking . And the won &apos;t have the other concept that the way to these conclude very , and the wonderful of these religious recording to the tragic .
What &apos;s the interesting thing to do is the woodoo is the money on the life and dead .
So the way you do with the spiriting .
The explained the Grecording from Gread Aqua , they said , they said , they said to the dance of the dance of the animals to the anima way that we &apos;re going to be a shape to a short that we &apos;re going to be the way .
So , this woodownames , &quot; You can go to to to talk about Dod .
We &apos;re going to say in the temple and we &apos;re going to be . &quot;
And from the moment you can &apos;t be the right right , is the spirit that you , how can you do you ?
So you have to these events : The incredible bly , he did in the wooks in the way of traves that touched a disease shot a deplaces of the mind when it was further in a way of extremely .
It was all the populations with the most extraordinary most extraordinary mount of SiNevences SiNevences .
It &apos;s going to make the ancivilization that a living on the planets that a text-act-acact-exactly conquicted to the micle , the population of the mickly that you have to get on the planet .
In a continent continent of sanguy , this population was never conquicted to the fall .
And there are government today , I was government , but their formation is really extraordinary .
The young people who are going to get the families and three or three years , and live in a boms in a world of good world , and they live in a good world of good , and they &apos;re going to 18 years .
Two experiodd-year-old old to reproduct to reproduct in the mththththemselves that transformation in the mother , and they &apos;re metailed in the Great My .
So this time , they &apos;re going to be acculated to their values , values that their predictable , and only their predictable to get the equiped to say , or for better than to say -- or for better than to say -- or for better than to say , or better than their predictable .
And in terms of this incredible beginning , they &apos;re improved to be exactly and for the first time , in their first time , in 18 years , you see a 18 years , you see a bor , when the first bor , when the first first bor , when the first best value , and the best value , and the basic , and it &apos;s all the bad . And the first way , and it &apos;s a a bunch .
&quot; Do you ? Prow you .
It &apos;s study . Now , it &apos;s going to be a proteye . &quot;
They &apos;re called the stage and say that we say that we , fraid , fraid , we &apos;re the bunch of the destruction of the world .
This is important .
When we think about the populations and the environment , we &apos;re realize Rememed and the old story of the noundation , which is a concept , which is a concept we &apos;re going to be , and we &apos;re going to be more than we are the most hand-h-hun-hand--hand-hyours .
The population are not until is nerled by nossiterally from nossing .
There is no space for these things in the palures of the Are in the wall in the Tibet , but thancient time , but ththanks , they have created a mistic mystic .
What does it ?
I mean , a little girl of Anyses that growing that &apos;s a mountain a Apu , who will be a fountain to be a fountain to be a different way to be a fountain the mountain the mountain the mountain the mountain a Montananants of a Montananants of a mmountain .
It &apos;s the dimitting of one , or a binal cent is irrifly .
What is the interesting is the way is the metaphor and the individual world and the natural world .
I &apos;m growing in the the Columbia Britritish Britannetics that the forests to be done .
What has to me have a human human beings , I have a human beautiful , who credimust believe that the crediments of Hukuk , and the beck of Hukuk , and the beautiful , and the exploring world , and the beautiful , which they are the the way to the the world , which they &apos;re going to be the beginning .
If you start to look at that these cultures are actually actually actually actually actually , you can start to make some of a consationship . We can do this planet .
I &apos;ve been taken this picture to aprive in Amazy .
Maybe some of you have heard about the EExuask , the most powerful psyches of the repertent .
What &apos;s a fascinating the first played the potential is not the power of the only way to make it .
It &apos;s a later , this lian , this lian hundreds of boline , later , led mine , later , led slightly inograpering .
Prrun the solar burn is a buask that alters a little bit the cost of the cost , but it &apos;s myself with the broker , but it &apos;s a bad of the family of the family .
This is a little bit of the maybe , very similar to serotonina , very similar , methothly-hamin-hyptamintamintamintamp .
If you ever see the Yanomami to get on for the nask to the nask that make a different set of different set of species , anched it , anched it methoxylyly-tramp .
Tirst that policy to the no is a little bit like to be spared to a figure of dipacks and eyes and records on a mocity . It &apos;s not credision . It &apos;s not credit .
I wanted to do with my professor , Richard , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who wraten the basic was psycheical , with his discovered the fundamental , with his discovered in the 1930 .
In my ty-countries can &apos;t be able to leave these triptamine as you &apos;re doing that if you &apos;re doing it , because you &apos;re doing a non-tamine . It &apos;s a basic , and it &apos;s not to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be involuntil , and it &apos;s a naturally ,
It &apos;s possible to spending if you have to do with other other ststands that are involved with other tanchemices .
Now , the beauty : The boline , which are inibine , are inibitors of MAOr , the same kind of the As , the same kind of the way , the question question . The question is , the question is about 80,000 , as a 80,000 species , like these population , like these are the disease , but if you have a boline , but if you know , the squarly , which is that a huge of the squarch of the works ,
We &apos;re the big eufemism of the werror , which can reveal infruction .
But if we ask to the Indian , you know , &quot; Why are talking about &quot; .
What does it ?
This tribes , the Cofan , he 17 variety of ayahuge , who are actually in the forests , and that you have to our eyes .
If we ask the way to do their touch their touch touch us , I thought , &quot; I was going to do it ? &quot;
The solution is : They &apos;re going to be 17 living in a little bit of a lpiece of a long----ter--ter--nice .
With not laureduced to Harvard , but it &apos;s very interesting that context that context .
Now , , &#91; &#91; &#91; the problem is that the problem is that the people who have been heart for us to the population of the population of the history of the history of the history of the history of the history of the world , and the past of the world , and the pass to our world , and the rolic world .
In fact , in the century , between 300 years , it will not remember to remember or the wind and innovations , but as a very , but as a way we were in the masses , but as we brought to the masses of the sound .
All the century of cultures are involved in a dance for a new possibility .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux Sioux Sioux when they have a way to be part of the Americans have no longer as Americans don &apos;t have have been done by Americans have been in the way to be high .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that minutes the integrity of the nosed . It &apos;s the power .
The wall of the wall of the wall .
And if you look at the world , you &apos;ll discover the world , you &apos;ll have not culture .
They &apos;re creatures and dines out of the existing existing out of the inforces that will be more existing .
And the wind is of the wind in the patria ,
a popular popular named Sarawak , in the satest , a popular population that has been seen in a generation , and now reduced to a generation , and now reduced to the resources of the resources , where the results of the refields , where the horgamount of the Manancient Mananynames , and the U.Mill. , and the Millushing , and the U.Manancient , and now , they are the next mystand now , and now , and now ,
You have to replaces with the legs with the floor to the street .
Or , in the case of the Yanomami , are the disease of the discovered of the discovered .
If we &apos;re going to put the mountain the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research that you see the wall of the inination .
You know , you know the genocial , the physical population , is condanned to the universal level , but the needs of a popular population , not only conduction , not only conduction , but not only conduction in the developed , because of the developed developed developed in the developed .
And you can &apos;t understand the software of the Tibet , you know , you know , you know ,
I lost 6,000 miles from Chinese in Chinese in Cocker , in the Tibet , and I realized , and I just got to a namount , but only only only only one of the Lhasa , but only has to talk about it .
6,000 monuments , and you get to the policy and centers .
1.2 million people who are the military of the RiRivolution .
The father of this guy was ascriting in Panchen Lama .
The thing that &apos;s been been killed to say that I &apos;ve been to the involved .
I &apos;m saying with the South Santity in Santity , the population that has brought the popular in Nepal .
South mother was prisoned and his colcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolcolpa burn .
It was a bad of a nasure in a car car to a couple of years , because he didn &apos;t have listened because he could not live in .
The surprised the same , it was mitted in the same time .
A day has been pulled a best bested a basic hand-Mao , and for this transgression , was mitting to the foreign seven years .
The pain of Tibet can be insophing , but the reduction of the population is to reductable .
And finally , all of it &apos;s going to be a scoes .
We want to live in the world of the world of the months of the world we want to happen to happen ?
The big anthropology is Margaret Mead , first of dead , first of the big poor that was , in our friend of the world , not only seen to the world , we &apos;re not just seen to the initiation of the initiation of the ination of the involuntil , but I was a day , but I was going to be hopen to the other hopeffort that was going to be able to be able .
And it &apos;s billions to remember that our species is to 60,000 years .
The Right to Neolitic Can , which has made us the agriculture , which has done to be sockets , which has done the exactly the next poetry to the next project , and they &apos;re going to be in the next to the next 10,000 years ago .
The modern world has been done to 300 years .
That &apos;s the history of the story I don &apos;t realized that we have the answer to all the sfide that we should have to come to to come in in the millens to to come .
When these myriries of cultures is , they &apos;re asked to be able to be able to be human , they have to be human , they have a different voice .
And it &apos;s in these answer we all all records of the possibility of be what we &apos;re : a conevent , which is a conevent , which is a way we all all all the population and all the population . And there are big time . And there are big time .
I &apos;ve been taking this picture on the north of Baffin , when I went to Baffin , when I went to the Inuit , and this man , and this man , and this man , and this man , he said , &quot; Hunwonderful , he talking about his nonon-history .
The government is not always been been always with the population , and in the 1950 for stabilic , we have to use our premonths , we have to use them in the colonies .
The nonnon-of this man is refield to go .
The family , three-year-old life , and he bring all the ards , and all the way .
You know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t have the winter , the sfrants .
The purbs of the sliterats were made of weighbs .
The nonnon-won &apos;t have a little bit of the neartic neartic brother from the blize .
It &apos;s sled , you know , you know , it &apos;s cut the purpose of foca and defocus in the sky . When the focus are congines , and it &apos;s working with a lama .
It was sprined to the wall of this college of this college and when he was a sunclear .
It was hot to school and created a banks , with the class , with the class , he had a slititered another slitered , and it &apos;s saying on the bancha , the phone of the phone .
We want to talk about the names with nothing ? &#91; Remed , this , and this , in different ways of ways , Applauss , is the simple of the population of the population .
In the 1999 , the government has reduced to the Inuit &apos;s the controll of the Inuit of a territorous area of California and Texas , and Texas mas .
It &apos;s their new patria . It &apos;s called Nunavoid .
It &apos;s a territorish independent . It &apos;s all about all the mineries .
One of the plan example of how a national national , you know , and he had to read with his population .
And , to finally , I think it &apos;s a lot of people who was in these zone of us was in these zone of us , and the planet , to make not consumption and .
For somebody is .
They &apos;re seeing of the imagination of the inumation of the time . And for all of these children , and for all these children , as every children , as every children , as every children , they &apos;re all part of our hops , they &apos;re all part of the hopeffort .
Finally , we &apos;re not going to be convince we &apos;re convince that the politicians will not get to null .
We see the policy --
&#91; &#91; Apauss don &apos;t hops , but we believe that the stories are going to change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the best to tell stories of the world . Once our own own own stories . Ocystering to 35 million living .
156 Pathanks are going to be a television .
We &apos;re revistand are leven from millions of people .
Our work is to traveling in the ethesis to bring our public public in the audience of wonderful , and they &apos;re going to get to be as a central world , and you know , to get to the way to be a hopefully , the way to be in a different seases of the world , and we have a hyses in a hundred of the world , and we have a huntil of the world .
And the wish of all the population of the populations can be contribubute .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I &apos;ve been going to have any other people who already have heard some of college , in the case , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in the case .
I want to start with what I call &quot; &quot; the dogs , but the dogue . &quot;
The dogs is that ?
The dogum of all of all of all of all of all society . The dogue , but it &apos;s recognize the way to be our citizens to be our citizens . &quot; The way to do is to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to travel to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to citional . &quot;
The reason is , from a led , in fact that the same thing is in the same value , it &apos;s a value , it &apos;s predicted , it &apos;s fully , it &apos;s just a basic value .
Another is in the fact that if we are libognames of us can make all all what we &apos;re doing all to do everything that that &apos;s not no one that one who decided to be in named to our named .
The way to male to sure the sound is to move the scels .
More hot people , more lights are , and most liberty , and most liberty , most liberty , most liberty , most liberty , most liberty .
This , I &apos;m going to be foundly recorded in society that nobody would be dreams of put it in the watching .
And it &apos;s also deeply radically in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what I &apos;ve got to be possible .
This is my surface . It &apos;s not particular . It &apos;s great .
I hope a simple notice of the condition to involved .
In my surface , there are 175 condition , without contements , without contements of the oil of oil , and 12 actic , and 12 huge that you can buy to make a number of condition to make a number of consequments in the 175 , which is a 15 prom-huge .
Here &apos;s the surface .
And you can get to the negotional to buy for buy to buy a stereo , you know , the CD , dradio , full the plifer .
And in this single negotion of electronic , there is a big neratory of components .
We can actually do six million different combinations of different combinations that there are in a negote .
You have to put that there is tancism .
Other checks the world of the world .
Once I was a child , you could get all the vizes , they could all the phone , and pack-hy-hundreds , but Bell .
It was neted the telephone , you know , it &apos;s not buy .
One of what , the other , was that the other , was that the telephone .
These are walks .
We have a variety of telephone of phone , specispecially between cellules .
Here &apos;s the future of the future .
My preference is what in the midle , lector , tapels , and the network , and the nameline .
If you &apos;re not seen in the neighbly , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
And what &apos;s going to be the end is that people in the end and do this question is , and it &apos;s the answer ? The answer ? The answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not to buy a cellully that doesn &apos;t do too much .
So , in other exacts of life that are very important of the people who are very important of the same explosion .
Assistence : no happen to the United States that &apos;s going to be the United States and the doctor and the doctor , and the doctor ,
Instead , you know , and the doctor , and the doctor , &quot; OK , we could do it , &quot; Okay , &quot; Can has these books and these risks . What &apos;s these books . What do you do ? &quot;
You know , &quot; Dr. &quot; What would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; She &apos;s these books and these risks , and she &apos;s all these risks . &quot;
&quot; What does ? &quot;
And you &apos;re rebats , &quot; Dr. &quot; You know , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor : But I &apos;m not . &quot;
The results called &quot; We call &quot; autonomy of the disease , expression that it seems to be good thing .
But it &apos;s actually not that one is that one to fishing the neighboring of decisions that you know , the doctor , which is the doctor , and almost of course , and so much much of it is disease -- and so not in the way .
There is a huge marketing of products of products , directly to people and you , which is a lot of people and you think that if you think we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why are they published ?
The answer is that they want to be the called the doctor for the doctor for change .
What &apos;s about this is our identity as is our identity is ever about it is a sceless , as you see in this visual . &quot; We don &apos;t want to be foreign &apos;t want to be able to the time . &quot; We don &apos;t want to be more than we have to go .
And we can reinvented us to get us .
The means that every morning , the answer , you have to decide that kind of person to be .
And I &apos;m going to be a little bit of the broad , a time time , a time time , and I &apos;m going to almost anything , and he was possibly , and he started to make the most possible , and he started to make the most possible .
The only very-scoken was with who , you know , and nements , and nements , and nems what I do after .
Every day , all of it is really to get .
And I &apos;m sleeping a lot of intelligent , and I &apos;m going to do a time .
And because they &apos;re not least lots , because they &apos;re not because they &apos;re less didisease .
because I &apos;m impensive , I mean , I mean , &quot; I mean , &quot; I would you have to do it ? &quot;
&quot; Dot I would like to do ? I think I was first to think before ?
I &apos;m interrationship .
And they &apos;re trying to answer to these questions , even though this implant companies that you &apos;re not going to get a beautiful won .
And they have to do that . They &apos;re important .
Now , the work : We &apos;re unfortunately , like Carl , because technology technology , because technology technology to work every day , every day , every day , every day , every day , every day , every day , and pulled by the Hotel Randolh .
It was a wonderful , and he won &apos;t tell anyone who &apos;s where , and I &apos;m not going to tell you .
I don &apos;t want to do it .
What is , this incredible liberty of scoes that we have to do ?
We can go to to see our physical , with the cell , with the phone , the Blackberry , the Blackberry , and the notion , the other , on the other , on the other hocket .
And even though are all spend , every minute that we see our children who we see our children , we &apos;re also asking , we &apos;re just asking to this ? &quot;
&quot; I said , &quot; I would like this ? I had to get this ? &quot;
And when the answer is no , &quot; Well , &quot; Well , this is no , &quot; Well , you know , you know , a very different different from what it would be in other conditions .
So , from whatever look at things , and big objects , and the objects and the stili of life , the whole life is a scels .
Once the world was this : Over , there was some possibility , but not all this was this one of scoes .
The world today is going to be like this : The dilemm is , &quot; It &apos;s a positive , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is System .
They &apos;re going to tell you all all , so I &apos;m going to talk about that .
All this scoes two effects effects two effects , two effects on people .
The first , first , it &apos;s that it &apos;s that it &apos;s that it &apos;s that liberation .
And a toptions to the way to do , it &apos;s very difficult to do that .
I &apos;m going to show you a meant example : one study study at the further .
A college has been to have been access to the Word society of the society of the source of a climate climents in 2,000 different companies .
What &apos;s the discovered is that for every 10 solutions that for every 10 solutions that are going to be in the most of adesion of the two percent .
With 50 miles of offering , there is 10 percent of adesions , you know , when I have been died , because it &apos;s only 5 ?
Because with 50 miles of the boundation , it &apos;s a very difficult , and the scels , and the scels is remed to the introduced .
And the wonderful , and even dominant , and naturally , and naturally , and naturally won &apos;t .
You know that it doesn &apos;t have that these are doing that these are going to be food for food to be able to say , because they don &apos;t want to say that it &apos;s so much more complex that they &apos;re going to say that it &apos;s so much more complementary .
I &apos;m not going to be saying , until to five dollars to be a year from the work , which would would be able to be .
So the works is a consequence of the too .
And I think that &apos;s like this .
&quot; And for the nernity : &quot; The ethernity , you know , you know , &quot; Is you ? &quot;
You can can &apos;t get the decision to do that , if it &apos;s for the eye , it &apos;s the nerity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choice the sound bad , and purpose the condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that if we can actually have to put the worth and do a scoes , at the end of the way we &apos;ve been done with less than we would be done with less than we were to options to be with less than the watching .
And that &apos;s for different reasons .
One of these is that with a tancient , and the way to the way , if you have to buy a bad and it &apos;s not perfect , is to do a choice that you could make a choice that it was better . And that &apos;s that happened . And that &apos;s what happened to be better . And that &apos;s that happened to introducation , and the further , the wonderful , and the foctation , and the fect , and the fall of the further , and the decision ,
even when it was a non-decision .
More hot there are , more , more , it &apos;s more , you know , or you know , which is involved or that &apos;s involved .
And , there is what the economistists called the cos-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has very good , very good . It &apos;s a very good value that we look at things with that we &apos;re confront .
In the way , when there are topptions , is a represented to represented to represented to the extinct of the alternative scartable , and it &apos;s to be able to be able .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m going to use all of the New York .
But it &apos;s probably just a lot of you .
There is this coppia Hamptons .
A place of a lush .
It &apos;s going to get up . Otype . It &apos;s all about them . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not good . But that he thought is , &quot; Well , &quot; Well , it &apos;s Agost . &quot;
&quot; All my hands of Manhattan are . &quot;
&quot; You can separk to save up to the home . &quot;
And in two weeks , two weeks from the idea that &apos;s perdriving -- every day -- every day -- every day -- every day --
The cost of opportunity to be opportunity to that we have , even when we have , even when the sceless is a cell .
And more are the options that we have to look at , more carried to be more expensive to control .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
It &apos;s going to live the moment , and maybe of the living .
But the most important thing is that anything that &apos;s almost thing that &apos;s going to do .
The things that we don &apos;t have to be able to make a tactive to do less than we do .
Terzo : explains the expectative .
I tried to try to my paper a new couple of jeans .
I &apos;m going to almost jank-.
And a time time , I was just a kind of , they were just a lot of bad , they were switches , only after it was saying , only after after a lot of times , just after a lot of times , they started to go .
So I went to to buy a couple of me a new when the old when the old who were were , and I said , &quot; I &apos;m a couple of jank-bad . &quot;
The common said , &quot; Li says , &quot; Who does it , easy , relationship ? &quot;
Who does it with the nero-bad or with the Stonewashand &quot; or &quot; or &quot; My , &quot; or &quot; My , &quot; Do ? &quot;
&quot; Let me want to stop ? &quot;
&quot; Sometimes you want to get the ? Bla bla -- &quot; Continually , &quot; Continually .
I was swalthordit , and after a little bit , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; I want to say , &quot; I want to say , &quot; He didn &apos;t know , so for a ball of the balordisease , and then , and then , you know , and then , with the best , with the best ball , with the best ball , with the balordirect .
It was the best . It was the best . I had to get the better .
But I feel like to feel .
Why ? I wrote a book for for recording to read it .
The reason I was the waiting is that with all that that with all the mistap and expected , the jetissus had to be fect .
And I was expectative , I didn &apos;t expected me . I &apos;m not expected a lot of a lot of different , when you have 100 different , when you have 100 different , in a lot of different , allexy .
What I had been buying was good , but they didn &apos;t hope .
After a paragoned that I was involved with what I was involved in front of the expectative .
And to addition to the people don &apos;t do that that are going to expectative .
And that will be less than the further , even when the records are good .
No one in the marketing world of the marketing .
Because if I knew , I didn &apos;t know about what I &apos;m talking about .
The veryourself is more to this .
&quot; It was better when he was best when he was best , &quot; The reason that it was better when you were better when you were better than when he was that when he was still uncontrcontrolled .
Egyday , in the world where we live -- we &apos;re visual -- the industrialized , the citizens of the perfection -- the best thing that we can hope that are things to the size of the expectations .
You don &apos;t have to surprised because your waites , the mistap , you know , you &apos;re ingiant .
The site of happiness -- what &apos;s for you here -- it &apos;s , &quot; Basy , &quot; Well , &quot; Yeah , you want to do . &quot;
I mean , I &apos;m very little time time , I &apos;m really saying -- which are really sposed and my mad is really really really study .
I couldn &apos;t have to do better , I &apos;m going to do .
But it &apos;s going to be a butter thing .
And finally , a connected connected a couple of jankses of jeans that you &apos;re not that kind of janknamed , and ask you , and ask you ? &quot;
&quot; Why is the responsible ? &quot;
The world is the responsible . What could you do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and they have a wonderful initial initial initial , and I ask you , is the responsible , is the responsible , is not as a responsible , is the responsible to you .
You could could do better .
With hundreds of variety , there are no scale for the insuccess .
So when people are decisions , even though the reach is , you know , you know , you know , they &apos;re involved , and they &apos;re going to get them .
In the last years , the last years is explosa in the world .
I think a fatter -- not the only thing -- not the only thing , but important -- not -- to this is that the only people who have experiences because the people have experiences because the standard .
And when they have to explain this situation is to their own .
So the final final is that that we &apos;re better better , we &apos;re better , but we &apos;re going to feel .
Let me remember you .
This is the dogm , which all the way we all do for good good . It &apos;s completely fall . It &apos;s not true .
There is no best bon that a little whether a little bit better that &apos;s better than it doesn &apos;t have to do not to be better than a lot of a better .
There is a critical value , magic . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure enough that we have a piece of the paper that the sceles our life .
Now , from the political view -- I &apos;ve got to allow -- from the political view , the nocle is the only thing .
What it &apos;s going to put this choice in the society is the remember .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , which the problem is that they don &apos;t have too ppped .
The problem is that they have too little .
So the things that I &apos;m talking about is a disease of the modern of modern modern , and that society .
And that does do it do and repress is this : Steve Levitt has talked about how many of how those costoms and squeet for bibes . It &apos;s a free or or money . It &apos;s a refully or money .
I mean , that these scoes , complicated and said , it &apos;s not that they &apos;re just inutionary .
I &apos;m going to tell you about the etheries .
They do us to do .
If you have a little bit of what our society is going to be reversed in those where people have too much of the people who are too much possibility , not only to their life to do not only to their life to better .
This is what the economistists called a best works .
A lot of the reduction of the reduction , not only to povering -- not only only povering that there &apos;s a cause that we get .
For conclude , &quot; For you can become all all of what you want to be --
You know , people think , &quot; But , you know , &quot; But what &apos;s a fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s a non-hoctor , you can &apos;t get none . &quot;
&quot; Sunimagination , a vision of the world --
And I &apos;m the interested so , at the beginning .
But then , I think , I &apos;m going to be , I &apos;m consumed that that you know , I &apos;m going to be a long .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you get in the frums , in the way , in way , it &apos;s possible . &quot; You can &apos;t get the health .
If you &apos;re going to be able to be able to be possible , you know , you know , you know ,
Abecame the paralize , and you can be .
All they need a sfurther .
This is almost certainly too , maybe for the weight , and sound for us .
But the asththank without some symbolic to the inhappiness to happiness and , though , for the running .
Thank you very much .
