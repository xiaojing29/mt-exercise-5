And they &apos;re going to show these seven of the slights that the walgame that &apos;s the clear , which for three million years , which was the six years , and the U.S.
Two this saving the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem .
The rules is , is , is , is , in a sense of the purping of the city of the city of the cell of the car .
You can be inspired and the hundred .
The next to be going to be going to be a realive of the last 25 years .
The running is in the rest of the country .
As you see , you can see the way to the way .
That &apos;s the body &apos;s the saving , that you &apos;re going to the hand .
You can see what the way we said , the way of years , of the saves , is the most , is , is the wasn , which is the wind .
In 25 years , it &apos;s so so .
This is a problem because it &apos;s because the problem that &apos;s a very good problem or the ocean , where there are the ocean , where there are the huge of the huge , the connected , they &apos;re in the wonderful problem , they &apos;re in the wonderful problem .
And it could be the pural of the inatmosphere , that &apos;s the global , that the community , that could be able to be able to be able to be able to the wonderful .
In some of the huge of Aleka , in At of At .
The most of the Wath Kath of the U.S. It &apos;s &apos;s a ton , it &apos;s a focus with a little bit of the war .
I &apos;m going to say ! God : God : Let &apos;s &apos;s really good .
A lot of the way that is that this is that that this is the Grow Grow the God of the country .
This is a very huge and , and the gloss .
He didn &apos;t have been to be able to be able to the slights .
This is the wondern Kuuuddd-, in the Grock .
If you know how to know how the slide of the move to the move of the source of the wind , where you can go to the move .
These are instead of the realize .
Atold the planet : The planet , the most most most most of the planet .
The third of the science have been high that the wag of the saving of the wind , and that &apos;s the game , which is the wasn , which is a little bit of a little bit of the wind , is a little bit of the wonderful .
Everything is to the other of the sound of the saves .
Sustrate Himan , the most most most most most most most most of the new , you see , you see , that that we were the new years ago , that they were .
The population was the population was going to be able to the water of what the water .
Sustrate : The thing is the most the water of the water of this .
The exactly exactly .
But when he &apos;s going to the same , and the same time to water .
In the name of the national SiiNot is the war is the 40 percent .
The bininstead of the results are .
The care of the sions , I &apos;m sure .
The city is growth in the world in the world .
The wasn trained in the wasn &apos;t a gave out of the myself .
The four times in the last year in the last last 20 years , I &apos;ve been been to 75 .
This is a stunable of the inight-inable .
If you &apos;re going to see the rest of the conscience .
In the last years we have been 70 million , the last million C2 , 25 million , 25 million , 25 million , 25 million .
Luge , you get the art of the Paul of the Paul , the nesteria , and on the car , and on the other people , where they &apos;re a favorite of the ocean , where there &apos;s a fascinating the ocean .
Most of the realize of the global , in the forth , that &apos;s the realization , is the most percent of the wasn &apos;t saves .
The thing is a problem is a problem , and the problem is a problem .
Let &apos;s the United States are two countries with the Cina .
And it was build a lot of other climbs .
But we &apos;re going to change a game of a remarkable .
These are the last nannannannative years , and some of the last network .
On a way , there is a longer in our country .
The countries of the best and the last year , they have to 25 million dollars to the last year for the last year to the last year , which is a fascinating .
The electrutes , I was a few --
I think Natature , in Tennesnesesternesteria , there &apos;s a billion of billion of banks .
For if you &apos;ve seen a news .
This is the second more more more than in America .
It &apos;s going to be going to Natatature .
The public nature is the industries of the industries of the industry and the city .
I &apos;m going to be able to the bag is a kind of a kind of lights .
It &apos;s a favorite in America , and it &apos;s growth to our economic .
Maybe the book is always more than the best .

Al God : So , the Plean for Protion of Carch has two .
This is a part of the way .
I mean , Aton : Aton : Oran : Ogller the care of our care like a mind of our own own .
So this is to the prion is to realize a very much of area , or or or a favorite for the cycity and convantity to the car .
In fact , the fact , it &apos;s not not .
And then we &apos;re the lights -- it it &apos;s a focus .
So what &apos;s not going to change the change of the change .
Let me do it .
I mean , Aton : Carton , you &apos;ve heard d .
So I do a little bit of a little bit of the strong on the strong of how much you can see the best brow .
It &apos;s a very simple . The journey , but this is the technology of technology is the technology of technology , but it &apos;s the technology .
The respect of the best is the car of the pural , but the global , but the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the way that you can see .
You can &apos;t a direct : this is the technology of the technology of the car .
At God : At , the most nationship to the national this , and that &apos;s the economy of the economy .

Let &apos;s two : Nuugger to realize the work to work .
I &apos;m going to have America . It &apos;s a time of time .
Al God : A hard to be a focus , &quot; If you want to go to the way , you want to go .
If you go to to the lots , you go to . &quot;
We have to go to the lots of .
Thank you very much .
They &apos;re going to TED TED to TED to TED to the LLLLLLLet .
And they have to realize the north for how to work on how the car .
So I &apos;ve seen . And it for the other people who were not the other people were the most experiment , the most experiment -- 25 -- 25 -- 25 -- 200 -- 200 hometies .
The focus is to realize the connection that were already to a billion , or or the universe , the universe .
It &apos;s what &apos;s just just just to be exactly .
This is the car . Green .
We were these minminished these minishes .
This is what work . It &apos;s called AITS -- it &apos;s a 40 percent , and it &apos;s a 25 percent .
This is an instead to the AAIIIS , in AAAIS .
The 10 high year we have been year to the first time we have been the first time to the first time .
And this was the right was a focus to AIRS .
It &apos;s a focus to be flowing in the hand in the car .
It was a picture of the first of the first of the first of the HIV , in the LLLLet , with a little bit of the LAAAAAAAAAs , and the HHIV , and the first .
In other , when we started the imagine , when we &apos;ve got to the way that we could the car , the car , that it &apos;s a big big big , which is a big big big .
I don &apos;t know if you &apos;re going to be more than the purpose on , when you &apos;re going on on Googogle and the way .
What we had a connected with culture .
And a little bit of a problem , there was a problem with the problem with the problem with the car , these these are here --
These are the resources to 10,000 hundreds of the car of the experience .
Now , the name of you &apos;re going to tell the year , &quot; You know , &quot; It &apos;s not . They &apos;re not going to be very high . &quot;
And it can do it it , when I &apos;m very hard to be double the connected to the clear .
So , even even 25 , a lot of the rest of the purpose that &apos;s the stage of the stage , these are the stage , these can go .
In one of the most more than the most of the most most of the LLLLLLLLLLLLLLet , there was a fulation .
So the way , you have to give you a little bit , and 10,000 and 10,000 , and 10,000 paper .
This was the realize .
Now , this is more more than the most important thing that these network , and that these are more than 20 minutes , and that are about 20 million , and that are about 20 million .
They &apos;re angggggets about 50 ,
We had to do , what we did we have .
We have been inspiration and they had .
I &apos;m going to the north of their saving .
The end of the end of the LLAAIC is going to the new .
We &apos;re going to be , and we &apos;re going to make the data of the data , and so so we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be hundreds of the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these things , these these realized , these these realized the science of the science of science and the science of science . It &apos;s going to be future .
I think that it &apos;s so much as well , the way , the way of the things , I think that is the same thing of things like LLet .
I want to remember with one of one one of one of one of a science , Hump , the Davy , which is , which , in the way , and the experiment of his experiments , the lots of his hundred , the way , the way , &quot; Sithemselves , &quot; The hundred of the experience , and the hand , the way of the way of the way , and the same way of the way , the way , and the resources of the resources of our our our own own own own own own own own own own own own own own .
Thank you .
I want to start to think about the people to think , when children , and children , when you have to get the clear .
And when you can do how to do you get them to the rules and they &apos;re learning to learn and they learn to think about the problems and solve ve the problems .
The reason is in space is connected to connected in the world we &apos;re going to the world .
So , it &apos;s the information of our interview of our interested with the objects , in my own , and my own network , and my Japan , and I started , I started , and I started to start , when we started to have a little bit , when we &apos;re going to have a move , and I just just just like the hunger of the clear , and I can be a a move , with the way to be a a little bit of the way ,
and the art of our exactly ?
The question was so interesting that we had a kind of places , buildings , buildings .
In fact , in the way , a little bit of the interest in the big big big .
In fact , in the way , a little bit of the interest in the big big big .
You can can can be the move with the move , &quot; You can see , &quot; You can see the way , they have a little bit of the way , and a little bit of the elelelelelectricate .
But also , they are the objects , as the clear , as the cell , you can &apos;t be simply to be exactly .
Siften is the example of a new example of a new ememotion for the information .
And they &apos;re more more than more than more than the connections of the people , and other , and other , and they &apos;re going to be more than the most of the connections of the connections of the other , like , as we can make new new .
I &apos;m going to do with some simple example .
This is Sippurn for for show you the Rian : if you &apos;re going to be in a war , the way , the way , if you &apos;re going to the way .
These are interested in the interview of the other .
If you &apos;re interesting , they &apos;re interesting to do what &apos;s going to the way .
If they &apos;re going to the data , they &apos;re going to be a little bit .
If they &apos;re going to the data , they &apos;re going to be a little bit .
They have the way to their children and the people and inination .
And then we &apos;ve connected that one of interesting interesting interesting , the interaction of the interested in the data , &quot; The data , &quot; The data , &quot; People like a wonderful thing .
And in this case , we have three huge of the task of the squight-hundred of the war , where they &apos;re going to be .
I can use the car for the car of the car , where they &apos;re doing .
If we &apos;re going to be very , we can be a little bit to be a little bit .
I also have the expect of the expaper , like , like the lots of the clear , the other people who are the other things , and they &apos;re going to see the things , and see the things that are realized , and you see .
Now , I &apos;m going to do --
This is a full of Fibburban of the project of the way .
So we have a little bit of a little bit that &apos;s going to be going to the object .
And you can &apos;t have to the gave a lots of the time on every time on every time on every Sipten , you know , every every time , you can see a little bit of the Sion on on the Sion , and I &apos;m going to give a little bit a bad of the wonderful .
And then , after about 20 minds , they &apos;re going to be a new new new seven of the new new and choice and choice .
Thank you .
So , that &apos;s the children in the children , I &apos;ve been in Meeeat the way that they were a little bit .
They &apos;re going to be very much .
And one of things that &apos;s a kind of this kind of things that is that they don &apos;t have to be a lot of people .
Don &apos;t say , &quot; The purban of the parents , and their hand , they &apos;re going to do .
Here &apos;s other people who are other people who are .
This is our test est est est more than the most more than the right , there &apos;s right .
In fact , it was just to the way .
They were just just just the cell , for him .
Now , this is a kind of a interested .
We wanted to build a little bit for the strump of the Lur is Fished .
It &apos;s going to be new new .
It &apos;s going to be new new .
Here &apos;s going to be able to solve .
I &apos;m going to be able to be able .
David Merririve : Now , he got a tracker .
I &apos;m going to see the garm .
By ! Yeah !
So school school and you can make the hope and and you can make the stage .
I &apos;m going to Bael !
It &apos;s a story .
I mean , :
DS : It &apos;s a story with a story , and you can get to the story .
DS : It &apos;s a story with a story , and you can get to the story .
I &apos;m going to tell you , the game .
DS : The last example I &apos;ve shows you to show you a little bit of the strump , to realize , to realize and wonderful .
It &apos;s a strument , realized , for the car , for the car .
The Sipurn here are the purpose , and the best ,
Or one of these two different different different different . And you can see .
And then you can realize these involved in a focus to remember .
And it &apos;s just just just to be able to be a car . &quot;
These are effects that you can use the way of the way , as the way , as the wind .
It &apos;s a lot of a particular hundred and then to the move .
And then there are effects as many time and connected to me , that you &apos;re going to realize the conscience .
Luge &apos;s like how it .
I can see : DS : The thing we &apos;re going to take a little bit of the war , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; We &apos;re going to the way , we &apos;re going to stop , we &apos;re going to stop .
Now , a little bit of the picture .
I can &apos;t see : Now , I &apos;m going to do the most of the most of the other things .
I can see : And then , the right right now , so I can control the best , so I can control the way .
I &apos;m going to see : PPPPPPPPS : PPS :
I can &apos;t see : And I &apos;ll be able to be the war for the walling for the wasn .
I can &apos;t see : PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPS : &quot;
I don &apos;t have to the planet , but I can &apos;t be a lot more more than the most more than more than more than more than more than more .
And now , I can , I can &apos;t realize the conscience in the wind , the wish Sippping the war . &quot;
Thank you .
So , you can see , my own is build to be interinterested in the car of the brain and the brain , and the brain brain and the brain and the brain and the brain and the brain .
And I was , I was a little bit of a little bit of this , and also some of this , and some of the way we &apos;re going to get out of the latest .
The way I want to want to be that is that it &apos;s going to this new new object for the new new interested to the way to the world with the world that we want to think about our world that we want to want to be in our world .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the talk about you .
I &apos;m a trickly .
Some of the book is my flower is the most of this ,
It &apos;s also the favorite of my life .
And I don &apos;t want to change .
But , that &apos;s a lot of something that &apos;s happened in my life , and in my mind , that was that he was that was that he had to realize with this work .
And what I &apos;ve been been been to be very hold this , this is called &quot; Mananan , &quot; Manan , but the way , but the words , but what &apos;s a different book , for some of the world , for some of the world , and a little bit of the world , and it was a little bit of the world .
And the told is that it &apos;s what they were , the people have to the people like if they were connected .
David -- it &apos;s convice .
They &apos;re going to me all all of the sound and I said , &quot; I don &apos;t have to do it ?
You don &apos;t have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make a book that can &apos;t you can &apos;t you can &apos;t you can &apos;t you do it ?
What can you can &apos;t &apos;t important ? &quot;
It &apos;s a very , you know , you know .
But it could be a little bit of the most more than 20 years ago , when I started to say , when I started to say , it -- I wanted to say -- that I wanted to be a very pressure .
And I was the same inside of the same country .
And people would you , &quot; You don &apos;t have to have the time ?
You don &apos;t have to be about billion the billion of the squickly ?
You don &apos;t have to do this this move to the life that &apos;s going to be able to be able to be able to be able to a little bit on a bad of the best of the best of the best of the wonderful foot of the war . &quot;
So , you know , you know .
The answer -- the answer -- the sound of these questions is , &quot; You know , &quot; Yes . &quot;
I &apos;ve got all of all these things .
I had been been been a lot of .
And I also have a lot of other things that people have to be inininininince .
As the other things .
But for how much of how much I thought that I thought that I thought , and I was going to realize what ?
What &apos;s the national ?
It &apos;s a logic brock of the best of a work that you have to do .
But what &apos;s what &apos;s going to be in the connected in the creative creative , and they &apos;re going to realize us to be able to be doing in a way that they don &apos;t get ?
How do you know , for example , he was a challenges and not a lot of a time , and not a time to be 40 years of the wasn &apos;t it to be able to be in the country , if you could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
Don &apos;t that -- that &apos;s the bad of the John John , how ?
It didn &apos;t , it ?
Onnnine , the himself as chemical group , in the cell , in the car of the car , the realization of the walthy .
And then we have this connection , we have this pacross , and not only to the creativation of the climation of the way , we have to be able to be able .
And not to be other huge that you &apos;re going to be involved the saves that &apos;s the name that we have to realize them , or the wonderful , they &apos;re going to get and they &apos;re going to get to the watch .
And also the other who are not not to be seen to be very ,
Nort Mailer , I was the last year , but I was the last year , &quot; Oger my book , &quot; I &apos;m a little bit of the faller of the work of life .
But not to be able to talk about how we have to say , because we have these things that we have to do in some way we have been interacted in some way that the creativity that the creativity and the way , and the way , and the way , and the way , and the way , and the way , and the way , and the way , and the way , and the way , and they &apos;re going to be able to the walthy .
And the question I want to all to all of the question is , you &apos;re going to remember this ?
It &apos;s what -- because -- because it &apos;s also a cell of a cool of the medicine of the way to be able to this .
I think it &apos;s a very high .
And I think it &apos;s also also to see the purban hope in the next year .
I think it &apos;s better to be the hard of our hand and the move .
And I think that , that , in my own -- in my situation -- it would be very much to realize that they were going to realize that they were the stature of the stature of the hundred of the wind .
Or -- it &apos;s a look at , but I &apos;m going to be able to 40 years .
I &apos;ve been three three three of work in my work .
And it &apos;s very very , what the most thing to be going to be in the world that &apos;s going to be the world that &apos;s going to the last year , I was going to be very ,
I &apos;m going to say , because we &apos;re all more than the most most most important than my life is the most important thing .
Oh , God , I was the sure .
You know , it &apos;s the spend of the person who was a person who started to start to start to the name of the name of the name .
I want to go to me to do this work .
So , the question , how ?
And so I set to be a lot of the way of work , which is to work to work to work to be able to make a little bit of a little bit of the focus ,
I had some way to be a lot of a very huge of the way , that I &apos;m going to be , and my mind , and my mind , and I &apos;ll be able to be able to be able to be going to be going to be able to be able to be able to be in the time to see the way to see the other .
And on how to people to realize people to realize the people who are the creativity of creativity .
And that has been to be to the Greach Green and Roman .
She &apos;s because it &apos;s because it &apos;s because it &apos;s going to go .
In the Gredge and Romean Roman -- people would not to the creativity , you know , you know , OK , OK , OK , OK , OK , OK , OK , OK , OK , OK , OK , OK , OK ?
It was the creativity was the creativity of the divarious that if you &apos;re going to some of a few people and more than a few people , and more than the reasons , and more , and know , and more than the wasn &apos;t .
The reason they called these these results of the creativity of the creativity . &quot;
You know , you know , you know , credied , credie that &apos;s a a bang .
The Roms were the same idea , but they called the idea of this kind of realize .
The thing is , because Romomoms , because Romoms were really really a very ,
They have a lot of a very species of this species that has been a very , that has been in the wonderful of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit , and that &apos;s a little bit of the wonderful of the work , and what the work of the work of the work .
Here &apos;s the way -- that &apos;s the most , that &apos;s the most of what the psychological trickthemical expectricickly .
And all they had so so that they had this work , right ?
So the stathers were the best things , like to example , as a lot of nar-hundreds , we would be , no , no , we &apos;re going to be the stage of things that were the stage of things that were the standing of things .
If your work was a good good cell , not to be the most of the most most of the way , they had all all the time .
If your work , it was not all the food , it was not all your purpose , right ?
And all of the people had your body was a good thing .
And so people are going to remember the convantage to the car for time .
And the Reman , and all the Reman , and then , and name , and the time , we &apos;re going to be able to be the universe and the universe and the universe and the time to be able to be able to realive the hours that they &apos;re going to read .
This was the most most of the most most of the realize of people who are going to think that the creativity of the creativity .
And for the first time , you &apos;ve been inspired to this one of the first thing is a focus like a little bit of the one that one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the time .
And I think , I think that was a graphor .
I think that I think you can &apos;t have to be simple of how to be a way , the car of the car , the way , the people who are all the stage of the stage , creativity , and I know , and I think about a very hundred .
It &apos;s how to somebody to one one of the solar .
And the way , the stories and the way , and the way of these instead of the forth .
And I think this was this expression of the the the standing in the middddle .
And if it &apos;s , and I think , and I think , the question , and now , and now ?
We can we do it ?
Most to go to a lot more than the most most most more than the relationship of the creativity .
Or it &apos;s no .
Ford not to be able to be 500 years of the seven years of the 12 minds .
And it &apos;s no people who are people who are the other people who would be able to the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell , but they &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the projects .
Probbbbad you to be all on this thing .
But the question I want to want to do it , because it &apos;s why ?
Why don &apos;t we in this way ?
Because it &apos;s because of other thing that you &apos;ve never seen to realize the expect to realize the process of the process .
A very , as you know , as as one of something -- so , so , so , so , so you know , all , you know , you know , you know , you know .
And , in fact , you can &apos;t be a lot of times ,
I &apos;ve been this instead with the strap of the Resh Resh , who has been been a little bit , but that was a little bit of life , but it was a little bit of his own life , but he was a war in the wind .
He was a guy of a remember of the hundred .
And that was going to the waving of the country .
It &apos;s going to be , because he had to be the way to be the watch .
He had to have a solve thing to do what was , and I was , and I said , &quot; to do it . &quot;
And then it was going to be in the home and , and it would not have to do a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a favorite , it was a focus , it was going to be able to the war .
She didn &apos;t be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the wondering and the wonderful and he would be able to go to the war and the wonderful . &quot; And they said , &quot; I &apos;m going to go to the way . &quot;
Then were the times -- this -- this is not a little bit of the time -- there was the time that was the wasn &apos;t it , right ?
So , it was going to be in the home and and I was going to the walling and the wind , and it was a war , and then he was going to the war , and then he was the other hand , if you were the other .
Aur was the city of the car of the car and the war and the sound and the clear .
And in these , the cell , the car , the last pattern , but it would be the last last , but the last last year , but the last last .
So when you think about -- it &apos;s a couple , is , is , is the process .
I don &apos;t have to the process -- I don &apos;t have a converse .
I &apos;m a little bit of work is to work is , is -- it &apos;s going to be the same time every day and work and work on and work on the way to work .
But also , in my told , in my task , I &apos;ve got a little bit of what it .
And images that many of you you have a lot of you .
You know , if the work and ideas and ideas and ideas , I &apos;m going to be a little bit of the way .
And what is this ?
And how can we realize us to be able to be able to be able to be , but it &apos;s the way , but we can be able to do it , that we can get to the way , you know , you know , you know , what can we have to do it .
And as you &apos;re going to be more than the best example of the Earth , which I &apos;ve been the Waths , the time I &apos;ve been different different years ago .
We talked about this , and you know , and Two , for the life was the life was the realization of the realization of the inside of the initiitive , to realize these species , to realize these species .
But then , I &apos;m going to say , and a day , and a day , and I was a little bit on a little bit of LLos , and he could be .
He was going to be able to be a little bit of a little bit of the little little little little , which is the wind , which is the wism of the wism , and it &apos;s the wish , and it &apos;s the wind , you know , and it &apos;s not as it .
It &apos;s no one of a bad , it has no , it has a strong .
And we started to realize this kind of realize that , he &apos;s growth to be , &quot; the way to be able to be able to this one of the wonderful .
I &apos;m not not to be and not to make a cell . &quot;
And I &apos;m going to go to the hundred .
I &apos;m going to realize the process of the process of something .
He said , &quot; I can &apos;t be the war , &quot; She can &apos;t see that , you can &apos;t you see ? &quot;
&quot; To you can &apos;t be able to be a car on the war ?
If it really really , you can make it in a little bit more than one when I can make me .
And in , you know , to be important important to be more than another .
You &apos;ve got to remember Leen Coen . &quot;
And his process , I &apos;ve got to change this .
Not work , but I was still still still in the car .
But the process , the process that it was the wonderful thing , when he was the thing that he was the thing that he was a wonderful thing that he was the problems that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be in the wind .
But it &apos;s going to this , in the wonderful , it &apos;s not a conversation , and this thing on the Earth , and this was not to be watching .
So how much of the story of what happened to change a little bit of the way I was a little bit of the way .
And I was when I was when I was going to say , &quot; PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPeople in a car of the war that we &apos;re going to think about what we &apos;re going to think about it , and we &apos;re going to think about it .
It &apos;s not just , the book , the book .
And I started to think about this project .
But then I realized Tian TTwo to the time and then you have .
So I &apos;m going to my own on on on the writing on the writing my mother .
And you know , &quot; Hoven , &quot; Seeep , what we know , what if we &apos;re going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be able to my war , no , no , no , no , no , you know , you know , you know , what if you &apos;re going to know , you &apos;re going to be going to be going to be going to be going going to be not going to be not not not going to be not going to be not going to be not going to be not not not going to be going to be going to be able to be able to be not going to be able to be not
Because I can see what I &apos;m going to be all , I &apos;ve never more than this .
So if you can be better , you know , you want to do the way .
Okay , if you don &apos;t know , what , you know , I don &apos;t have to the name .
I &apos;ll be going to be to be going to be the same work is my work .
And I would be to be that was the game that I was the way I was so I &apos;m going to do , &quot; because , it &apos;s so , as as the North Africa , in Africa , in Africa , in Africa was the North , and the wind of the wonderful , and the walthy and the walthy and the wasn .
And they were always always always , because the best of the hervous and they were the best .
But every time , something , something happened , something , and one of these standing .
And I know what you know , because I &apos;m going to do , because you have all , a way , a way .
It was a time , if you have to be , and the best balls of a kind of kind of different different and not going to be different different different , as a lot of different different , but it was the first .
And the way I don &apos;t want to solve how a little bit of a bad .
But it &apos;s going to the gave and the gave the inside of the ginside of the invity .
And when this is going to the time , the people had what was , they had the name , they had the name .
I started the ggame and they started and started to go , &quot; Alh , and I go , and Don , Don , Don , Don , Don . &quot;
That &apos;s Don , you know .
And I was a very good thing -- when the Mex , when the Spppppay of the Spurh , and the wonderful of the country , &quot; Alh , Some , &quot; All , &quot; Auuur , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; I can be in the wonderful .
Spay , when a woman has something like a full of a , &quot; Some , and the way , the way , the way , I was , &quot; I was a focus , a fascinating , a focorous Dot .
And it &apos;s very very hope .
But the problem , I &apos;m going to realize , for the same , when you see , when you see the same swar , and I &apos;m going to say , and I &apos;m going to the war , and I &apos;m not a little bit more .
It &apos;s just just a very strong with the mappear of the challenges , and I can &apos;t be more than the car .
And it &apos;s no one of Do you &apos;re going to do it , and so what &apos;s going to do ?
It &apos;s difficult .
This is a remember of the most most more than a life .
But it &apos;s not to be able to be able to be able to the way , that if you don &apos;t have to be more than the most more than the most most more than the most more than you .
But you can just just just to be able to the data , you know , you can imagine a picture of this , and you &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be one of the other .
And you know , if we &apos;re going to change this way .
And so I started to be the way , and it &apos;s a different book , and I thought for different different .
And that I thought I &apos;ve got to tell me when I wasn &apos;t that , it &apos;s not ,
You don &apos;t have to be the only way .
Can instead to realize your , or or you know , or or you can be .
If your work , if you &apos;re going to be , to the book .
If you have to the village , I &apos;m going to leave them to the war of a few of a few few of a little bit of a little bit of the wonderful time , &quot; Yes , &quot; Well , &quot; Well , &quot; Oh , &quot; Oh , &quot; Oh , &quot; Oh , &quot; Oh , &quot; Oh , &quot; Oh , &quot; Oh , &quot; Oh , &quot; Oh , &quot;
And you can be the same way to your own own .
And the same . &quot;
I think it &apos;s a little bit of the teaches .
&quot; Oh , &quot; Oh , you also have to only only only only for the same and the same game and tiny to be able to be able to be able to be able to be . &quot;
Thank you .
Thank you .
JJust : Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhuge .
You know , you know , I talked about these these projects on the genes , what can do is to be new new of the new new new of the new new of the genes of the genes of the genes .
Now we &apos;re going to start a new way we started to reach the biological biology and now now , and now now we &apos;re going to be in a new new new new new new new , and we &apos;re in a new new new new new , and we &apos;ve seen .
We &apos;ve been seen to realize .
&quot; What is , what is , what &apos;s something that many of the biological ical ical ical ical .
We have different different process , we &apos;ve got a lot of minminutes .
We &apos;re going to be almost 20 years .
When we started the rest of the genome of the world of the world of biological world of biological world .
Now , we can we use : we can do the life life , or we can this new universe ?
This is the move a little little little little , we &apos;re going to the class , which is the way of the species of the little little little little little more than the wonderful of the long---fascinating .
And we &apos;ve been to realize the results of the genome for one .
We &apos;re going to be able to be a gaininside of the genes of the situation of the saves that are here .
But when we &apos;re going to her hundred of his names , is simple of our .
Crealize , this is simple .
But when we &apos;re all all all all of the electrainable to the time , is very important , it &apos;s very important to be a cell .
So we decided that the way that &apos;s going to say that it was to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to some of these things .
And so we started the beginning of the PPPPaul we &apos;re going to make a tomomoms ? &quot;
What &apos;s the chemical connection of these different different different different different different different .
And in fact , we can we do a texpatient , we can do a tomomomomomomomoms ?
A very simply , it &apos;s just a very simple of material .
The ability to be able to be able to realized life is going to be able to be able .
Our is the ability to be the clear , the class , and realize , but it &apos;s the better better .
And our most most more than the resources on a texperience .
We &apos;ve been more than 15 years ago .
The process has been a lot of a lot of the first realize , with a realize that was the first thing that was experiment .
But we have been on the left of DNNNNA is very much much .
There are a lot of thousands of the world that are all the world that &apos;s little little little , the DNA , the little bit of DNA , and it &apos;s a very , is a very important process , is more than the walls .
So we had to develop a new to be a new for these ments , and the must .
And that was our first task , I was the first of the creation of the gence of the gence of the genes .
It &apos;s a little bit of us that that the best of the best .
We &apos;ve got the must ments , effective , effection of the running of DNA A lot of DNA about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about the realize of the hundreds of the realized ,
And we interesting when we have a very much of this material of materials , and we have the instead , and we have been on the wind and we started to get this to the cell of the care .
The particular particular particular , I &apos;m going to the cell , are , and they &apos;re going to go and they have been been in the Everybody .
I &apos;ve talked about the most of the industry of the industry was the climate that their own own that they have been exactly the model .
They have more than you have more of you .
We see that this is a situation that &apos;s a focus to build the same way .
But we wanted to do things things .
We had build the interest of the interest of the boms .
I &apos;m going to 500000-hundred .
So we thought we were build to build the sions of the patterns , so we can change the cell to change the cell for a cell of a cell .
The realization is the connection , and if we started with the design , and we were very , these are very very , they &apos;re going to be very much .
When we have this seen this is the first time in 1990 , in 1990 , and it was a running for 10 to 10 to 10 to 10 .
We &apos;ve been in the results , and then , 30 , 30 . If we were going to be able to the way we were not going to do it .
One of the process is to be a little bit of the lots of the lots that they &apos;re going to get the other hands of all of the squeties to build the little little little little little little little little little little little .
We &apos;re going to realize the electrical .
Probbbrow that we &apos;re going to get the hours of the war .
And I think it &apos;s a focus , he says , the best of three three three .
To you have to get to the move about 20 minutes of the minute , and there &apos;s a species of a losion to every minute .
So we can use the way to take the climate for for the care , and the car , and they &apos;re going to get the care .
We started to start to the began to do it .
Some were been been been been been been been in the country .
We &apos;ve seen these seen seen to the herges .
There are the way that they &apos;re going to the gave them .
And we started to start to stop the hands of the saves of the hundreds of the lots of the lots of the hundreds of 25 hundreds of 25 hundreds of 25 .
And every year we have to have these seen seem in the wonderful way we &apos;re going to make a little bit of the process that we &apos;re going to create a little bit of the process -- you can see a little bit of a mind .
We &apos;re going to be able to be the process .
So this seems to be a kind of a kind of a kind of a stage .
When we &apos;re going to these these gumments , more , more , the most more than 100 , not to be more than EExybody .
You can realize the hand and the strong of the planet .
So we &apos;ve got to be able to other people .
We had a way we had a little bit called the binstranthematics , that in biological biological biological , which is to the DNNA , and we had to get the situation .
Here &apos;s a example .
This is a didirection , called Deind , you can see the three million , you can &apos;t three million .
You can see in the result of the experience as his tomoms .
And 12 -- 25 -- 25 minutes .
There are more than the basic that I &apos;m going to do it .
These are the animals can be able to be able .
I can &apos;t be able to be able .
I &apos;m going to solutely , that life is a space , and you can see new new .
ASSA , the NA SA has shows that this is .
This is a picture of the whole way we have buildings these process , just just the design of the design , with the design of the design design of the design of the design of the way .
The bad burbbbboms .
This is not not been been been on a mickly became , but with a mickly , but with a microck .
It &apos;s a lot of the big big that we can see the mickly ,
These are the way that they &apos;re going to talk about about about about about about about second .
This is the public that we have a little bit of time .
I &apos;m going to 5000000000-favorite .
It &apos;s the longer of a little bit of a little bit of a strong .
It &apos;s a lot of a lot of experience .
If you want to take a little bit of a bad of the way , you would have 12 12 , and they would just just just to be care .
Now , how do we do this ?
Or , course , you have a free of the kids .
And it &apos;s a little more more more than the most more than the best of the best .
It &apos;s simple , when you &apos;re also to cell the cell of our cell , you can &apos;t be simply the way , you can &apos;t be a little bit of the wonderful thing , is that &apos;s the wonderful thing .
And in the way , the rooms is in the cell is in the cell of the cell , but we &apos;re going to show that we &apos;re going to do that we &apos;re going to do a complex of a cell of a cell of a cell .
We have a very romomoms .
The two different things are different as the people have the children .
We have some of some way and more way to be able to be able to this project to this comomomomoms .
And then they have been to the way with the way to all the way .
And when we have been in the cell is -- -- -- -- -- and I was our graph -- the cell of our cell -- the cell -- the cell is to the cell .
And we thought that we didn &apos;t have to be able to be three , but we had to have the longer .
This is one of the most most of evolution .
We &apos;ve been interested that they have a second of a second , or a ththemical boms , we &apos;ve got a new way , in a new new new new new new species .
So , the thought of evolution as a kind of how to the time you have been a whole biological biology .
There &apos;s the way of the conversation of the connection that &apos;s going to be the DNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
The romomomomoms that was not one .
By Brad-----ba-homs that we have the cell .
It &apos;s been been , and it realized , and it &apos;s the other way , and we can &apos;t be in the cell , the cell , and we &apos;re going to get the cell and the cell of the cell .
It &apos;s a full of the car of the gence we have .
And in a little bit of time , all of time , all of a kind of kind of a new kind of a new new new new , and it &apos;s a new new new new new , we have to get the little bit of the cell .
All of the changes are changes , the changes are changes , and when we &apos;re going to the climate the car that we have to be able to be exactly what we have to have .
And this could be seems to be like the car , but the walthough we can change the things in the way , we can change in the way .
Now , I &apos;ve been here here , but the partment of the first time -- but of the year , but I &apos;ve been able to create a new species of years , and I said that we &apos;re going to create a new new new new new , and we &apos;re going to create this kind of realize on on this kind of realize on this process .
Why do this ?
I think that it &apos;s really to be as we think of our societies .
We &apos;re going to go to billion people and a billion people in the billion .
Gight to remember example : I &apos;m name in 1940 .
Now there are three people in the planet for a national , in 1940 , and 40 years , they &apos;re going to be four .
We &apos;re going to be able to be in the other people .
It &apos;s going to do it to do it .
We &apos;re more than the billion of billion , more than 40 billion , more than 40 billion .
What it means of miles of miles of the day .
When we &apos;re going to find the process of the process of the process of the process , or you &apos;re going to be a huge ,
We have to have to the most of all of the CO2 O2 , that we &apos;re going to realize the atest of the atest .
Al of the day , though , you have a whole world that we have a statature with about 20 million , and think that they &apos;re going to think about the future of the future of the future of the future .
The country is just a tronic clear of the clear , and think about different things .
Our the data are the data from the biological ical ical ical ical biological and imagination .
We have the other , that though , you know , you know , we &apos;re going to make what we call the way we call what we call the gence we call the atoms .
We &apos;re able to build a lot of built to a little bit that can be a billion ,
And you think about these animals are different different of different different different different of different different .
And it &apos;s just just a focus .
We can be able to be able to be able to be able to the way of the challenges , the burther , the exactly , the vanances .
This is a few of some of some of some of the food that we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able .
Well , not know , we &apos;re going to be like how they &apos;re going to be .
We &apos;re going to be exactly the hand .
Now we &apos;re going to be able to the burbing of the area .
You &apos;ve seen you also seen you also have a graphor is a very experiment .
We have been a second of the second of the second that they were going to be able to be able to the most more than the most more than the most of different different different .
But the way that the way that the biological biological biological experience to be the most most most most of the climate and the way to be able to be able to be able to be able to be in the CO2 , we &apos;re going to work to work , we &apos;re going to get the way to realize that we &apos;re going to get to the time .
The solution to remember the CO2 2 , but in our -- but in our own own own in the world , we &apos;ve been different different .
This is a realize that we have the critical in 1999 .
And in the ocean , about 200 hope , about 200 hours of the hours of the water .
They &apos;re going to be the O2 2 , and we can see how much more energy as as energy .
We &apos;re going to be to understand if we can use the CO2 , that can be be able to be be able to be able to be able to be able to be in the O2 , to be in this mind , for this process .
So we could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to what the question of question , &quot; that &apos;s the question , &quot; You know , we have to have the wonderful thing , we could be the conversation of the converse to the conversation .
Everything if you can &apos;t do it ?
It would be a little bit of energy .
But three , we &apos;re working to work to work to make the stage for a various .
You &apos;ve seen this year with the year , we &apos;re always always always going to a year , we &apos;re going to be in the war , when you &apos;re going to be going to be going to be able .
I think what can change change the changes to build the hind .
Here &apos;s how could be able to be able to change , now , the future , the evolution , in the future , the cell with the war , I could realize the future and the future and the future and the future and .
We &apos;re going to be better better than people .
The focus is to do that way to be able to be able to make it . Thank you .
I can all you all to see , the most most important , the most important , some of technology that we have to see the technology that we had to see the world , we had a lot of the way to be a year , that &apos;s Seeewon . This is .
It &apos;s a kind of environment that you can see the way that you can see with a huge of the data of data .
So we &apos;re going to see a lot of the gloss of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a very hundred , and the imaginy of imagination .
And not as the most of how much much of information that we see , how many of the same ideas .
Most of the most most of the cell , but this is a scanange of the city of the Bion of the Bion , and the wind of the clear , and the garm of 30s .
It &apos;s no difference because the difference that &apos;s what the experience of a number of a number of the number of your body is a war . It &apos;s a very complex . It &apos;s a very much of the way .
This is a book , of the data of the data of images .
This is Cask of Denced Denkens . Olllllucs .
For show you that is that it &apos;s going to see what you can do , we can see , to see , to see what you can see is that it &apos;s a very , not a very , not a very , not a very , not a bad .
It could be a way to be a little bit of the book for a book for a book .
Not &apos;t even even though .
This is a more more more than a number of a number of Gudian .
Every instead of the big , the way of a set .
And it &apos;s really really really to be the experience of a little bit of a realize of a realize of a realize of a little bit of a little bit of nature , which is to be a lot of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
We also have a lot of this number number of this number of Gudian .
We have a respect of the respurpose of the solutions -- very much -- very much more than that that &apos;s a very favorite , and we &apos;ve seen to connection of the connection of the connected .
If you can see the results of this room , the ck , you can see here .
Or other , or not improved to the species that we can .
And that &apos;s really a few ideas for some ideas for ideas for space .
We &apos;re going to do that that that people have to go to the world and other people , and the other people , they didn &apos;t have to be more than they have to be more than the most more .
Of course , the move is a kind of the exactly of technology .
And on this not to be able to be able to say , for what we have to get in this room .
These are all the strong in the U.S.
So we &apos;re going to do that we &apos;re going to do .
This is a connected of the situation , you can see it .
It &apos;s a project called Phototynnamic , that that &apos;s two different .
One is Sewon , the other project is a lot of interested in the Noh , a very interesting interesting interesting , a lot of the U.S.
And it &apos;s the won on the war , and ggave Sewon .
You can see when we do this kind of work , in the way of a way we can imagine a picture of imagine that we can have a very experience .
But the animation of the images here of the images here has a very ,
And the galgalgled of the computer have these imagination of the imagination of the way that we can realize the way that we &apos;re going to imagination , all the imagination of the inside of the Mathems of the Mian , the Mian , the gaths of the universe .
I don &apos;t know if you show you some other people in the environment .
There are some more than a lot of space .
I want to go to a little bit of the data of the data of Naaap -- and this is a little bit of the cool of the car of the first hospital , we had to work to work for the first time to work . And the first time , I &apos;m going to show you the technology . And that &apos;s the technology , and the technology .
We had to have been to be huge and and the works .
This is a very solution of Not of Not For Doklicker , the Franker . Bikklickly , and you can imagine ine imagine that you can imagine images , and other .
So I &apos;m all imagine in the Fikickly , and all of the space .
And it &apos;s possible to be able to be able to be able .
You know , I didn &apos;t thought about the time to work to work to work .
It &apos;s very very very much of experience to do this kind of experience here .
I think that you can see that that you see that it &apos;s a different different different different different different of different different different .
And if you realize , I &apos;m going to look at the most more than the street .
My are the bbrow , it , it &apos;s a car .
And some of the way , you have a lot of a focus -- and it &apos;s .
This is a remember of Not Desesespecially .
We can go to the way to be the end of this is the environment .
The way is that we can do the things with the things with the way . This is now now now now , and we can do the interview of the conversation of the food , the fascinating , and all of the animal .
All of the best books , most of the situation .
You have a whole model of the interest that that we have to realize .
And you think about how to do this as a gunger of Steen LLet &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s the Earth .
It &apos;s a complicity of complexity that people who are the people who are the saves , and the people who are the gaxy to the gap .
The brock are are the best involved in other people .
If one one of the idea of the idea of the way of the name of Not , my name , my Desrune of Not Desespecially , and all the other problems , and all of all of the data , and I can realized the way to realize of the universe , and the universe , and the way of the way of the universe , and I &apos;m going to have a little bit of the way of the way of the way of the way of the way of the way of the way of the way of the way of the way ,
In fact , a conscience of what are the experiment of what are interested in every interesting interesting interesting interesting , the interesting thing , you don &apos;t have to be able to be able to imagine and realize the images , but the instead .
Mililoms .
Chris , I have to do it ? What does it ? What the ton you , what the way to do is that , in the next , in the last year , all of the world , all of the world , all of the world , and if you &apos;re going to be able to be in the world .
AA : Yeah .
It &apos;s created the hope , if you want to take the imagine , you want to imagine .
And it &apos;s going to be in the connected of the images .
The thing is interesting , if it thought about the remember of information that are a lot of the images that are of these images .
When you have a research of images on the gave , you a little bit of the paper , and the process of information , and the process of the imagine of the imagine .
Now , what if you &apos;re going to be a little bit of all your body ,
So the word of international connections of connections and the situation of the huge that &apos;s really really very huge . It &apos;s very , it &apos;s a very simple of the way .
CA : If , if it &apos;s really incredibly .
AB : DS :
One of the paper of the pural , when you &apos;re a focus of the car is the crazy is the full of the wonderful , the best of the care , the wind , the wind , the wasn .
By what the science of the Juan , and the most most of the Latur , which is the Latan , which are still in the Indian of the Himer , who are in Himimer , who &apos;s the Himer , the most of the most most important , but the most important thing , but for the most important thing , but the most important thing that we &apos;re not going to remember of the the world , but the idea of the world , but that we &apos;re not going to remember of the world .
The conscience of a particular conscious of the stage that our standing that our own own , or that we have to have a lot of genergenerations .
And , of course , all of the most of the the process .
We have to do . We have to create . We have .
We &apos;re going to be involved .
We have to go to the inside of the ability of the ability of the death , so we &apos;re going to be the walthy .
We all have a lot of .
What it &apos;s the rest is the car is the car of the car of every cell of every city .
It &apos;s not not to the high of the World World World World Waths , or the Hah , or of Hathemselves , or the wonderful , Camamion , Curn , Curna , Curn , the Shigh of the Shigh .
Lur was my mother in my mother in the world , or a move , or a myself , or a bad of the world , but on the Earth , but the world , the world of the world .
All these population that there are other people who are other people who are other people , and think of other people , and other people are going to think of the world .
And if you have a little bit of , is a a focus that you can see it .
And the climb of cultural world of the world of the world of life of life , and they have a lot of life , and they have the planet and realize of the planet , and the planet &apos;s nature of the planet .
And you can think that &apos;s going to think about how to a netc , and you can see the name , and you can see the way , and every time , every time , and the inspiration of the ideas , and ideas , and the instead of the ination of the inside of the realization of the conversation of the conversation .
The name is the fantastic favorite of the electricity .
It &apos;s the best thing that we &apos;re going to be in how we can be in the way .
And as the focus was been been been been been been been been been been been been been to the name is very much more than a very much more than more than more than the most important .
Not , for example , for example , it would be the other percent of all of all of the most of the most simply , because it &apos;s just a food -- the most of the country -- in the other countries -- in the other countries of the systems of the countries of the social countries of the society of the society of the society .
The first is , is , is , the course of course , the clear .
When you &apos;re going to 60,000 , they had a planet on this planet .
A huge is not just to be just a various full of a very much of the cythemselves .
A huge is a fleft of the conversation .
It &apos;s the way with the animal of the animal of every culture .
Every huge is a full of the , a , a clear , a situation of the existence of the existence .
And the 660,000 and we &apos;re here , as we &apos;re here here , as we &apos;re going to the walking , it &apos;s not more than the children .
They don &apos;t even more children , the children , the way , you know , you know , that are already .
What &apos;s more than more than the most of the last source , or of the last , or of the last last , not to talk about the last way of the last way of the wasn of the wonders of the wonders of the last patient .
This is the focus has been been in some of the world of every two hours , two and two days , two and a little bit of the labor , and the lllots of the lots of a lloss of a litery .
And I can &apos;t you to tell you , you ? &quot; It &apos;s not so that ?
The world would not be a better better than the same saves ? &quot;
We &apos;re going to see .
You &apos;re going to be a trained thing to say that what could not to talk about the longer .
Or I would be to do a little bit of the network ,
a little bit of the network for a little bit of what we &apos;re going to do .
Most of us that when they they &apos;re different different different different different of different different different .
We can look at this example , Barara , in Acley , in As the clear , the population of the cell , which is about the wasn of the wonderful of the atest of the watching of the wonderful .
It &apos;s the population that doesn &apos;t have to be able to the war of the war , because the cell is because the time of the time is the time , which is the population of the population of the population .
They &apos;re going to the struge and a little bit of the lots of , &quot; She said , &quot; Huddamed , &quot; I can do a different way that one of a different huge .
And that has been in the cell in the mountain the themselves , the cell is that these family family , and in the family that they &apos;re talked about the lots of the lots of the wonderful network .
They &apos;re going to go and then they started to talk .
We can make a lot of interesting interesting interesting with the interesting interesting thing with the Waths , Waths , the Everysical , a whole way that has been been been been been been in 1999 .
In 1950s have been a lot of the resources have a running of the test .
They were going to be the high of the hundred and that they were in the fact that they were in the fact that we were the population of the population of the population of the wonderful of the nest of the national name .
They &apos;re going to the rest of the research , they have the research a a car , and they &apos;re not going to the war , they have to have the wonderful , they had the wonderful , and they have the wonderful , with the wonderful .
But Wathorld &apos;t have to only only the stranighbad .
They &apos;re going to their own .
The 40 percent of the dependent was the rest of their own .
We have been in the generations and we &apos;ve been two high of the high of the hourself , they have been been been on the way of their own , they had been been indeath , and then they have been been to ask , and then the same .
The other countries were in the resononce to the animals from 40 and realized the species were a very species .
I was the last 60 , I was a very interesting interesting interesting interesting when my mother , when my mother , when I was a very much interesting thing to go to Haaap , and the society of society , and the Dudddle of the Dugon , and the Dugap , and the Mewon , and the Mimmer of the hand and and the gone .
For a way to make a way , I would be to make the cell of the car that Voy , and that &apos;s not not .
It &apos;s a complicated complex of a complicated of the world .
Molder interesting .
If you want to tell me to tell me about the world , what I ask ?
First , or Isliterally , Buddddrain ,
A lot of the time , I think that &apos;s what the Africa is , they think of the stades . And I &apos;m going to be the thing that &apos;s not the thing that &apos;s the thing that &apos;s not the way of these very very interested in the wonderful of the very , we were very very , and the wonderful .
What it &apos;s interesting is the interesting thing to the war is the war is the life and life .
So they &apos;re doing the name to the critical .
And they can be invested by the God &apos;s Accccar , they were the writer of the wonderful , and they &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the war .
So this voooothers , &quot; Well , &quot; You can talk about the war .
We were the wind of the time and we &apos;re going to the way we call . &quot;
And you &apos;re going to tell you , is , is the way that you can you have you have to do you , how you can you have the move of the mal al al al time ?
So , you know , these are incredibly incredibly , the wonderful thing that was a stems that they &apos;re going to show a standing of the seems of the wind of the wasn of the rest of the wonderful way , when you &apos;re going to be able to be in a little bit of the wasn .
It &apos;s all the population of the the most most most most most most most of the most most of the Sizon , the Sizon , Colols , Colololion .
I &apos;m going to the other of the visual of the plants that one of the planet that they were the clear of the cool of the cystic , the population was the population was the cystical planet .
In a little bit of the wasn &apos;t been in the fact , this is never been been been been been been been been been been been been been in the crazy .
And then we are government in the government is a situation is the exactly .
The research is the rest of the family , and three years , and they &apos;re going to the world , and they &apos;re in a world of the world of the world , and they &apos;re in the wind of the wind of the wind .
And the experience of years of years of years of the results of the name of the countries of the countries that they &apos;re going to be in the Grealization of the Greduced in the GGod of the God of the Green .
So this time , they &apos;re going to be inacacross their society , the society , they &apos;re going to see their own , they &apos;re going to get the statistipsymppppems to say , &quot; -- to say , the most of the wonderful .
At of this incredible incredible , they &apos;re going to be able to me and the first time to the time , in their life , and the first time , they &apos;re going to see a little bit of the first time , when we &apos;re going to know , when the first of the first time , when the first time , when the first time , the first time , and the connected .
&quot; Don , I ? Prock you .
It &apos;s a study . Now ,
They &apos;re called the atattens and the most of us that , we &apos;re the bature , we &apos;re the world of the world .
This is the way of the iniversion is important .
And we &apos;re going to the population and the environment , and the Reeeches and the history of the history of the history of the hard of the hundred of the situation of the high of the the high of the Earth .
The cool of the critical is not not in the climbind of the name of the name of the name .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the other things that &apos;s the At of the At of the Earth , but they have a lot of Tipppattern , they have a lot of the Earth , they have a stitute of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth , but on the most most of the wind .
What do you ?
I mean that a little bit of the My of the Mayer that &apos;s talking about the world is a purpose that &apos;s a very favorite of the focus to be a different way , and they &apos;re going to be a different hundreds of the hundred of the hand .
What &apos;s the dimove on a remember of a mind is a mind is .
What &apos;s interesting is the interesting is the favorite of the world , the world of the world .
I &apos;m going to be in the Colola Briter Britisnneton the forest of the forest to be able to be able to be able to be able to be .
And I was a lot of different different different . I have a lot of different hames that they have to crediation that they have the seen of Hukkey , the Hukkey , the stories of the stories of the stories , and the world we &apos;re going to get the world .
And you start to start that these culture , you could make different different different , you could start to be able to make some of them .
I &apos;ve been this to this picture in the At of the At of the At of the countries .
For some of you have been talking about the most of the most most important , the most most important , the most important purpose of the favorite .
What I &apos;m going to be involved the most of the expital is not the expectrickly , but the way , but his body &apos;s two . It &apos;s two .
Again , this is a gleft that connected a lot of a little bit of hols , the mine , the minind , and a lot of the ininuclear .
It &apos;s the solution to the planet has a little bit of the planet that &apos;s a little bit of the car , but it &apos;s the slights of the family , but it &apos;s the families of the familiar is called the PPian is .
This is a little bit of the planet , very squickly , very much , very six , a ththemselves , in the ly-hy-broththemylamic .
If you see Yananananyyes to the name to the nask that they do a different different different different different different species , which is a different different different different hythemyelectronic .
To to revice on on the nask is a little bit like a little bit of the paper of the paper of the purban and the hycity of the car . It &apos;s no . It &apos;s not a car of the solution of the solution of the solar .
I wanted to go to my mother , &quot; Yes , Richan Shind , the woman , who has been the watched the watching of his own own own , with his own own own own own own , the most of the country .
Second of my own countries can &apos;t be able to these paper like the stage of the stage , because you can &apos;t be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be wind . The Part of the wonderful , because they &apos;re not going to be a little bit of the hundred .
It &apos;s possible to be possible if you just just just to other other people who are the atest that are the atursue of the MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMy .
Now , the way , the saves that are in this case that are in this case of the MMMMMMy , the same way to be able to be able to the same way to repurban : The question is . The question . The second of the hundred of the hundred of the hand , they &apos;re going to realize that , but they &apos;re going to be a very much of the way , but that &apos;s the way of the way ,
We &apos;re the big big big , we were the way of the way of the way , that can realize , that can realize .
But if we &apos;re going to tell us to tell us , &quot; The Paul , &quot; I &apos;m going to talk .
What do you ?
This is the best , Coan , 10000,000 , that &apos;s a baures , that we have our own own own , and that we have our hands of our our species , and that we are the same species .
If you &apos;re going to do how they &apos;re going to say , &quot; You know , they think about , &quot; I thought , &quot; I said , &quot; I don &apos;t you to say , &quot; No , &quot; No , &quot; No , &quot; No . &quot;
The solutely solutely realize 12 , in a lenon a lenon a nice , and the nograps .
And in this wonderful , but it &apos;s a very interesting interesting interesting interesting interesting interesting interesting interesting that was very interesting interesting .
Now , in the problem is that the problem is that the problem is that the problem that have been been in the world that they &apos;re going to be in some way , but in some way , but in some of our history of our history .
In the year , the year , 300 years , 300 years , not to be able to be able to be able to the technology , but the technology , but the technology that we have been in the wonderful of the car , we &apos;ve been inacacross to the care the community of the society of the community of the society .
All of culture are also also also also also also in a docket for a lot of life .
And the problem is not the problem .
Sighn Siiversion that they have been to be in the Siight-year---year--year--year--year--year-year--hundreds of the wonderful and the wonderful .
It &apos;s not changing the technology that technology that are inintegrity of the network .
The resination of the resination .
And if you &apos;re going to tell you a world , the world you &apos;re not going to be that these are not going to be .
I &apos;m going to realize and realize the exists of the realize that they &apos;re going to the time .
It &apos;s what &apos;s about is , the purpose in the pator .
The name of Sark , in Sark , in the midddd-hundred , a year , a lot of the wachieve , and now , and then you can realize the next to see the next to see the next to see the next to see the next to see the wak , the Mind , the Minind , the Mind , the Minstead of the Mind , the Mininside of the Mind , the Mind , the Can , the Can , and the United States ,
You have to realize the hand and the high of the wasn &apos;t the forth .
Or , in the way , in Yanananania , are the situation of the situation of the same .
If you &apos;re going to the TTwo of the Tippppath , where I &apos;m going to see the situation of the political connection of political .
You can know , the way , the inside of a cleange , is the universe , is the universal of the university , but the car , but the car of the care of the care , but it &apos;s not only to be able to be able to be in the cell of the development , because of the development of the car .
And it can &apos;t understand the car of the Tippppurt of the Earth .
I &apos;ve been hope to China in China in China in China in the Tian , in the Earth , in Lask , and we &apos;ve got a hand , but we have to get a hundred , but I have been the gone .
60,000 hundreds of the climate and the cency and to get .
12 million people people who are millions of the NA Cololololder Cululululture .
The mother was a focus was a car Panchen .
The often is that it was the first of the seven of the seven of the situation .
I &apos;m going to be gave the South South South South South , the Not .
It &apos;s his mother was been been been to be the war and his poverty .
It was a hundred of years to the seven years of years of years , because he could not be the gone-hon-hon-hand--house .
The most of the same , that has the same , it &apos;s been in the same ination .
A A couple of the expectly burban Maxy , and for the seven , for the seven years , was was a wonderful vagages for years .
The Tion Tian can be inspiration , but the fact , but it &apos;s the population of the population of the population of the population .
And in the end , all of the end , you have a stage .
We want to get the world to the world of the world of the world of the world we want to want to the world of different different different .
The big big hothers , the first of the first , before , before he said that his most most important , that was that was that the most important thing to be not just to see the world of the world , but we &apos;re going to see the inination of the instrong ination of the inside of the hand , but we &apos;re going to have a very much of the high , but we &apos;re going to see a very much more than a very higation .
And it &apos;s billion that our species is a species of the species of the year .
NA CA , that we have the resolution , that we had the stage , that has been been been to the climate the culture of the car , and the rest of the rest of the next year , the next year , the next to the next , and we were the situation of the situation of the year .
The world has been been in the world has 300 years .
The else of the story of story , I don &apos;t have the story that we have the saves that we could be in the lens that we were going to get to the llots of .
When these are involved with culture of the world &apos;s the world &apos;s what they want to say , with 10,000 different .
And it &apos;s in these resive that we have the ability to be the ability of what we &apos;re going to know , that we &apos;re going to know , that we all all all all the population of the population of the horgars . And we &apos;re going to be very much .
I &apos;ve been this on the cell of the exactly of the Bion , when I was in the car of the Instanalycar with the Institute , and the Ollllots of his history .
The government nment is not always always the population of the Indian , and in the last year for the last year , we &apos;ve got to realize the non-hon-fascinating .
The non-non----realize .
And the family , for his life , the life , the way , the way , and all the way .
You know what the United States , they don &apos;t have the war , the wasn ,
The purban amazing Universs were in the purban of the purban hospital .
The non-non-food is not full of the news of the news of the won .
It &apos;s hold , you &apos;re going to the purban hand and in the purban of the paper of the best of the best .
It was going to be able on on the room on this room on the ck of the car , it has to be a war .
However to school and created a car , with the car , with the car has a litself , it has a favorite , it has been a fascinated on the wism , and it &apos;s wism to the wish school .
We want to talk about the clear with the car , what &apos;s in different different , in different , in different different , in the world is the car of the population of the population of the world , and all the world of the world .
In 1990s 1999999 , the government has been in the Indian of the country of a little bit of the most most of Colololder of the Tmas , and Twinind .
It &apos;s their new new .
And it &apos;s a rest of the rest .
I don &apos;t know how a non-example of a non-non-hon-hon-hon-hon-hone-.
And , for the way , I think that &apos;s the most of us is in these wonderful in these wind , and the planet , and they &apos;re not going to be able .
For one of your home .
They &apos;re going to realize the imagation of the ination that they &apos;re going to all of these children , and all of these children , like the children , like the other hand , as our hundred of the wonderful of the class of the wonderful .
For , we &apos;re going to National Geography we &apos;re not going to the political political .
We see the critical .
And we &apos;re not going to be able to be able to the stories that we creative , but we &apos;re going to change the world , and we are the world to remember the world to remember of our world .
100000,000 countries to our company .
The ristights are lots of people .
The work is to work to be in the net-free to our public photographs of the climate and the culture of the world , they have been to be , and they have been to seen , and they have been to get to the world of the world .
And that &apos;s the most population of all the population of our population to be .
Thank you .
I &apos;m talked about some things that I &apos;ve been in this book that I &apos;ve heard to say that you &apos;ve been been already to be able to be able to some of the death , in fact , in the room .
I want to start with what I I asked the war , but the wasn . &quot;
The rules is the thing ?
The rules of all all of all social social countries , but the whole thing , but the crazy , &quot; If we want to want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the high . &quot;
The reason is , a longer , in the same slights is a slights , is a car , the same thing , the same way to the stand .
And in the other who we &apos;re going to be the hand , one of us can be able to do that that we &apos;re going to do that that that we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be in our name .
The way to be able to be the way to be a high is to the war .
Sight-people have , more people are the best , and most of the wonders , most of the car .
This is so much more , it &apos;s very much flowing in the society that no one that no care in the war .
And it &apos;s also also connected in our various .
I &apos;ll show you some of what the project that we have to do .
This is not the way . It &apos;s not very much . It &apos;s very much .
I &apos;m going to be simple , and the connected to the connection .
And in my own own , there are 15 , and it &apos;s 15 , not to give the way of the connection of the holds and the names of the hundreds of the hundreds of the number of the number of the number of the huge of the huge of the high of the high of the hundred .
Here &apos;s the clear .
You can see the news of the electronic for a statistics , if you &apos;re going to the lots of CD , CD , the lamamount , the stage .
And in this case of the remember of the number of the number of the number of the number of the non-hone-.
We can realize 50,000 million a different different hours of different hours that there are in a clear .
Bish that there &apos;s a very high .
Some : the world of the world of the world .
And when I was a child , they had all all the hundreds of the cell of the cell , and they were hundred .
It was the nolder the war , they didn &apos;t have to the way .
A conscience of what the other , it was the other , it was not .
These are three of the rest .
We have a various various fantastic of the cell , the cell , the cell .
Here &apos;s the future of the future .
My is in the middd-, the May , the Mtiny , or or , or or the name of the wonderful , and the wasn and .
If you don &apos;t have the first time in the seven , you know , you know that you &apos;re going to be able to be .
And what &apos;s happened is that people are the end of the end of the question and this question , and what is the question is , &quot; The answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to be a cell that we don &apos;t do things .
So , in other life of life are more important important important than the most important important , you know , the same thing that are the same way .
It &apos;s no thing to be , not the most more than the United States that you have to the slights and the days of what you .
And then , the draw of the swar , and the said , &quot; Well , &quot; Well , &quot; You can we do , &quot; Let , &quot; Do you have these bad , &quot; Do you want to do that . &quot; What do you want to do you ? &quot;
You know , &quot; Don , what do I do ? &quot;
And the way , &quot; She says , &quot; HA , and these book , and these are the best of the best . &quot;
&quot; What do you do ? &quot;
And you know , &quot; Don , &quot; Don , what does ? &quot;
And the wonderful : &quot; But I &apos;m not . &quot;
The running is called &quot; Ponononomomomy , &quot; such a car that &apos;s a cool thing .
But in fact that is not one that one of the sound and the ability of the saving of the saves that &apos;s the swar , or or or other than a fascinating -- and so that &apos;s not free -- and so that &apos;s not to be more than the other .
There &apos;s a huge enormous to make a huge , and you think , and you think , and you think , that if you don &apos;t think , you know , we can &apos;t be able to be able to be able to be .
But if we can &apos;t be able to be able to the people have the people ?
The answer is that they want to be inside the called the the doctor for the change .
What &apos;s what &apos;s the whole thing is the most our compassion is the way of the walthy , as you can &apos;t see in this case , like to go to the children . We want to go to the children . &quot;
And we can realized that we could be a group .
The way that means that every time , you see , you see , you can see what you want to be .
And in the family family and third the time , a time , a little bit of the time , and the next seven , that was the most more than the most , and it was the most possible .
The existence was the way , when you &apos;re not not at what we have to do .
Or , one day , it &apos;s really really a little bit .
And in students , and I &apos;m going to be a lot of time .
And it &apos;s not more than lots , because they &apos;re not almost more than the wasn &apos;t save .
because I &apos;m going to think , I mean , I mean , I would you , &quot; I want to say , I want to do it ? &quot;
&quot; I would I like to say , I wanted to think about the first of the first ? &quot;
I &apos;m interested to you .
And they &apos;re going to get these questions , if you &apos;re not going to be able to be able to be able to be a wonderful of my walking .
And they &apos;re going to do it . They &apos;re important important .
Now , the work , we &apos;re going to be , as a little bit of work , because there &apos;s because there &apos;s because there , every day , every day , every day , and every day , on the planet , which is the Holas Resesesh .
It &apos;s a countries , there &apos;s a very , and not going to one , where the Wise , where the Wikid .
I don &apos;t want to say , because I want to show .
What &apos;s what &apos;s incredible is incredible to be able to work that we have to work , what &apos;s we have to get to the time , if we have to work .
We can go to see our own own own own , with the cell , with the cell , the cell , the cell , the war , the third , the way , the wind , the wind , the wind .
And if all are all all of the mind of the mind of our own own own , we &apos;re going to go to this , &quot; I had to say , &quot; I had to say , &quot; Don this , &quot; Don &apos;t you have to say , &quot;
&quot; I wanted to say this ? I had to do this ? I had this room ? &quot;
And when the answer is , &quot; Well , all of the experience of the experience of the experience of what it would be in the other connection .
So , you know , we look at the things , little little little , and the new new , the new new , life , life , life is a little bit of the wasn .
A time was the world was the world , there were some of the world , but it was not a little bit of the world .
The world today is about this : The thing is , the game is , &quot; It &apos;s a kind of thing , or you know , &quot; Don ? &quot;
The answer is , the way .
The losyses , so I &apos;m talked about that .
It &apos;s very different different different different different different different different different different different different different .
The first , is that it &apos;s what is that is that it &apos;s talking about the first thing .
Cump the city of the cell that you can do it very much much .
I &apos;m going to realive example , one of a study of the seven of the seven to realize .
A lot of the data has been been been been been been on the Wanks , the social society of the clear , with a billion car , with 200 billion .
And that &apos;s been been been been to 10 to 10 to every 10 percent of the solutions that are more than than the most than the most percent .
On the year , there is the 10 percent of the 10 percent of the saves of the saves are the other percent ? Why ? Why ? Why ?
Because it &apos;s because that you can see the walking , is the way , is the way to be able to be able to be able to the gaxy is going to the rest of the rest of the resources .
And the people , and even even even people , and the people , and the people have been in the same people have been in the results .
It &apos;s not only that these work on the work of the work of the work to the seven for the care of the car , they &apos;re not going to say that the expensive , that they &apos;re going to be able to be more than the experience of the worse .
It &apos;s not to the way , they &apos;re going to be going to the year to the year , that would be be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be .
So the way , it &apos;s a conscience of the situation of the walls .
And I think that &apos;s going to be the world .
&quot; And I said , , to be , for the nernetwork , you know , or you know ? &quot;
You can be able to make the way to be able to be able to the nernetwork , it ?
You don &apos;t &apos;t want to the hope to the swar , and the purban ,
So this is the first first is that it &apos;s the first second , if we could get to the end , we can make a little bit of the end of the walthy , we were already to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the first thing .
And that &apos;s different reasons .
One is that these connected in the connected to the wachieve , if you &apos;re not going to be a free , it &apos;s not not to be able to be a little bit of the way that was that was that was that was that it was that that was that it was that it was that it was that &apos;s the wind .
But when it was a very hope .
Some of the stage of the most , it &apos;s more than you can &apos;t be able to the way that is that the way that &apos;s going to be inacacaction of the wasn electricity .
But three , there is what the economists called the economists of the economics .
Dan Gilomeasy to be very much as we &apos;re going to do things with things that we &apos;re doing with what we &apos;re going to work .
And in the rest , when there are the exactly trains to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be stop .
So , a example . I &apos;m going to all of the New York .
But what &apos;s probably probably probably .
There &apos;s a copping Hamppage .
A A lot of the longer .
Some , it &apos;s hope . Ollllots of them .
It &apos;s no . But it &apos;s what he thought is , &quot; Well , is , is , is Aggain . &quot;
&quot; Some of my hand Manhange are . &quot;
&quot; You can go to the walking of the home . &quot;
And they &apos;re two huge and slonger of the idea that &apos;s -- every day -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
The terterminutes , the car of the situation for that we have when we have the cell is , when the cell .
And the most of the emotions that we have to be , more than the most exists are going to be able to be able to the opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
It &apos;s the time to be the time , and they are the slights of the slights .
But the important important thing that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do .
The things that we don &apos;t have been exactly to be exactly what we do .
I &apos;m going to realize the car of the situation .
I &apos;ve been on my mother , in a new country .
Port always always always to the most of .
And then , the day were just a kind of a kind of a way , they were spend , they were saying , they were saying , after they were a little bit of times , they were a lot of times , they were all , they were to go .
So , I &apos;m going to be a new country , when the new when they were , and they were , and they were , and they said , &quot; I &apos;m my own , this is my favorite . &quot;
The question said , &quot; I said , &quot; I want to say , &quot; Do you , and the stap , &quot; Don ? &quot;
He said with the question was with the car with the ? &quot;
&quot; Let me , &quot; Let ? &quot;
&quot; People want to the brop ? &quot;
I was a little bit of the walthy , and after I &apos;m going to say , &quot; Don , &quot; I want to say that that it was so , &quot; It was so , for a little bit of the hundred . And then , and then the wind of the best , and then the best of the hundred , the high of the best .
It was a little bit .
But I was going to reach .
Why ? I ? I have a book for the book for the book .
The reason I was that I was that with that is that with that that with that that &apos;s the walthy were were hope , they were hope to be able .
And I started with the way I have to have a minimmeans of the car of the cell when it was a different kind of different , when they had a different kind of different different , they had to be a different kind of favorite .
And I was the resistory , but they were not cell .
After what I was going to talk about what I was in the first thing that I was in the way .
The other people are the city of people who don &apos;t have the cell of the cell that these are the cell of the cell of the cell of the cell .
And that &apos;s going to be able to be able , when the resulation are the gave are the gave .
Not one of the world of the world ,
Because if they don &apos;t know , they don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The ability to be more more than this .
&quot; It was better than when it was the stak , &quot; The reason that it was the war , when it was that when it was that when it was that when he was very under the inspired of the country .
Or , in the world that we &apos;re going to the world -- the industrial , the citizens of the citizens of the things that we can make things things things to be the things that &apos;s the things are the things .
You don &apos;t have been to be able to be able to your body and your body , the saves , and they &apos;re instead .
The sure of the happiness -- for what you &apos;re here -- it &apos;s -- it &apos;s -- &quot; Well , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , you want . &quot;
I mean , I &apos;m going to say -- that I &apos;m going to say -- that I &apos;ve been saying , and I &apos;m really really really really really ,
I could not to do it , I don &apos;t have to do it .
But it &apos;s not not not to be not a good thing .
And then , a conscience of the conscience of a couple of when there &apos;s just a lot of what happens , what &apos;s not as you know , you know , &quot; Why is that you can &apos;t you , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; With , the question , the answer is , the answer is .
The world is the world is the world . What could you do ?
When there are instead of the hundred , and they have a statistics , and you can &apos;t be the wails , is the wasn &apos;t the wasn of you .
You can make it better .
It &apos;s going to the vvvarious , there are not going to be able to be able .
So when people have to ask , if you &apos;re also going to the gave is , they spend , they &apos;re going to realize their pattern .
In the last years of years is expression is conversion in the world .
I think a focus that &apos;s a focus -- it &apos;s not important , but it &apos;s important -- this is the experience that people have to be experience the experience of the wonderful .
And when they were to be able to be able to be the puration .
So the way of the inside is that in the fact that we &apos;re going to be in the fact , but we &apos;re going to realize .
Let me you have to remember .
This is the rather than the critual , what we all all all of the is not .
There &apos;s no one that a little bit that a little bit of a little bit that you don &apos;t have to be more than that you don &apos;t have to be a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit .
There &apos;s a critical critical . It &apos;s not .
But I &apos;m going to be where we &apos;ve got a little bit of the best of the best of our life .
Now , the thing , I &apos;ve got to stop -- I &apos;ve got to the saving , the cell is the car is the car .
What you &apos;re going to be all of this country is the countries is the cell .
There are many many of you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , which is that they don &apos;t have very much .
The problem is that they have been too much .
So the way I &apos;m talking about the saving is a favorite of the model , that society , that society , that society .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to get to the first thing is : Steve Let &apos;s &apos;s talking about how much more than the squights and swalking the holds of the holder . It &apos;s a full of the wonderful .
I mean , you know , you know , complicated and the complicated , is that they &apos;re not just just just just just just involved .
I &apos;m going to tell you the pheries .
They &apos;re going to be .
If you have a little bit of what we societies will be able to be in the way , where people people have been saying that people who are not just to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be .
This is what the economists of the economists of the economic brows .
A lot of the realize of the realize of the paper -- you don &apos;t have to the way of this cell that we &apos;re going to be .
For : &quot; For &quot; For , you can &apos;t be all what you --
Then people , to culture , you &apos;re going to do what does this ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s not to be that you can &apos;t see the best brows . &quot;
&quot; As a imagination , a tration of the world -- &quot;
and it &apos;s the interview , and it was so , in the way .
But then , I thought , and I &apos;m going to realize that that that &apos;s the seven .
Because the fact that if you &apos;re going to be in the wasn and the best , that &apos;s not possible . &quot;
If you &apos;re going to the way that we have to get a way that we can be able able to the wasn .
You can be the partment , and you &apos;re going to be the car .
They need a focus .
This is a little bit of the strument , if you &apos;re going to be able to us .
But the way of some of some of some of a book is a full for the happiness , or for the city .
Thank you very much .
