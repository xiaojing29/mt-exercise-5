The last year I showed these slide to show that the cotta glacial glacial , which for almost three million years has had the size of 48 United States , is restrike of 40 percent .
However , this submove the gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice of the ice .
The arctica is arctic , in a certain sense , the pulsant heart of the global climate .
You &apos;re going to winter and the summer drive .
The next slide slide is going to be a record on the advice of the last 25 years .
The ice loss are drawn in red .
As you see , they expand down to the blue wall .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter , which is the summer of summer .
You can see the ice cosidly dle , of five years or more , it &apos;s like the blood , which is like the blood , which is here from the body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been going to this .
This is a problem because the wild interested in the ocean , where there are huge amount of the arctic quantity of the arctic charcoal that , science , they &apos;re transformed to metane from the microbes .
It &apos;s a whole thing about global inquent atmospheric inquent atmospheric , that amount could radical , surrounce of not return .
In some laghi little little bit deep in Alaska the methane is already rebroads .
The professored Katey Walter of the University of Alaska is recky with a team that winter laptop .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You &apos;re good . The question is whether we &apos;re going to be .
One reason is that this termal scchange from the Greenland .
This is a glacial figures .
The laper had never reached levels .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the south of the Greenland .
If you want to know how the sea level of sea level for the ice of the ice , you know , it &apos;s where the sea is where we reach the sea .
These running are increasing quickly .
At the other part of the planet : Antarctica , the greatest block of ice ice .
The month of the month , the scientists have diclosed that the ice of the ice is in negative , and the Antica Antica , which is the Antarctica , which is particularly required in the science .
Equival 16 feet of the slums of the wind , like in Greenland .
Sull Himalayas , the third biggest block , you see new laghands , which a few years ago , they were seeing new lages ,
40 percent of the world population is going to be able water from that shake .
Sulle Ands : this ice is the source of the water power of this city .
The laptops is increased .
But when it dimines , the same thing happens to be able water .
In California , the snow on the Sierra Nevada is deminuity of 40 percent .
The hangs are in crisis .
The predictions , as you read , are fell .
The growing growing security in the leading sea city city .
The environmental disasters are increasing a rhythm outside the normal and without precedented .
Four times more numerous in the last 30 years of precedentented .
This is a sustainable gars .
If you look at it in the histic context if you look at the consequences .
In the last five years , we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 25 million tons of tons in the ocean , 25 million tons in the ocean .
Look at the area of the Pacific area , from American , and to the American , and on both parts of the Indian subway , where there &apos;s a radical impact of oxygen in the ocean .
Most of global warming , with the deforestation , which is 20 percent of it , is the use of fossil fuel .
The oil is a problem , and the path is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with more emissions , together at China .
And he was proposed to build a lot of other central central .
But we &apos;re assisting a change of direction .
These are the projects in the last few years and some of the high-versity .
At every way , there &apos;s a political lotta in our country .
The carbon industries and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon , which is a hosymle .
That picture me , I remember something --
Natal , in the Tennessee , where I live , there &apos;s a perspective of 3.8 billion pounds of paper scories .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the second biggest flow of scories in America .
It &apos;s happened around Natal .
The published of one of the carbon industries of one of the carbon was this .
Video : I mean , the carbon is a kind of alleground and happy .
It &apos;s abondant here in America , and it &apos;s growing our economy .
Maybe the carbon is and more and more clean .
It &apos;s good price , it &apos;s adorable and the work mastipendious .
At the Gore : From here &apos;s a lot of the West Virginia .
The largest society in minerary minerary , is Massey Coal . This is the amministrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I &apos;m going to art -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosis , Harry Reid -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
At the Gore : So the Protection of Clima Clima has two campaign .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Ator : At COALergy , we see the climate change as a serious threat our business .
So our priority is invest a great amount of money in a effort of money in a effort to make public and confused the verity on the carbon .
In fact , the carbon is not sports .
We think it &apos;s clean -- it &apos;s also good .
So you don &apos;t preoctation of climate change .
Let me do .
Video : Ator : Ator : Carbone -- you &apos;ve heard a lot of them .
So let &apos;s give you a game in a structure in a house to advanced .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little bit rumor , but that &apos;s the sound of the car technology .
The carbon of carbon is between the main climbing clear causes that you see all the technology of the paldation of the plit paper you see all .
Do you have a look at : this is the technology of clean .
At the Gore : Inally , the positive alternative , the positive alters of the national security .
Video : Within America is crisis ; the economy , the national security , the national climate crisis .
The filo that the all of the film all of : our fossil dependence of fossil and oil and oil .
Now , perhaps there is a new , audace solution for using circumstances .
Really America : 100 percent of the power , 10 years .
A piano to repect America to work , make more secure , and help to stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that &apos;s solving our problems .
Really America . You can cover more .
At Gore : That &apos;s the last .
Video : It &apos;s about reduck energy .
One of the fastest ways to remains the dependence of the combustible that are killing our planet .
Comparts : The future is here . I feel , sole , a new energy network .
Some of the way of two : Noves investments for retribute work .
Commove : Actually , America . It &apos;s time to be realists .
At the Gore : A proverbium , he says , &quot; If you want to go fast , you go from it .
If you want to go away , you go together . &quot;
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
The year at TED I did a TED TED I did an introduction on the LHC .
And I promise to get back to you about how the machine works .
So here I am . And then the other time , there were no LHC is is the largest scientific experiment ever ever , you &apos;ve been trying to -- 27 miles of circumstence .
His task to required the conditions that were about less than a billion second from the universe -- to 600 million times second times .
All that &apos;s just environment .
This is the machine unk .
We have these mini-Big Bang inside the resevators .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- is 44 meters and it has a 22 meters .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in buildings , so you can see the proportions .
10 sector of the last year , we have accessed the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was cause of immense festhegs in control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first picture that had all over the LHC , entering in collision , in collision , with a part of the LHC , and by a part of the LHC , and by particles in the resilient the reslevel .
In other words , when we see that picture that picture , the picture that machine worked , which is a great vittory .
I don &apos;t know if it was that we get us to exultate us to Google and he saw that the page page was this .
That means we have had a cultural impact to that scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , and it had to these day-up here -- these dored dored .
These films are 13,000 ampers when the machine works in the most power .
Now , the technicians between you will look at the films and they &apos;ll say , &quot; It &apos;s not truly . &quot;
And they can do that because when they &apos;re very cold the cost , they can be superconducted by surconductor .
So , at less 271 degrees , at a hurt temperature that the space between the stars , these files can bring that run .
In one of the younger of the novemila in LHC , there was a fabrication of phabrication .
So the films slightly , and 13,000 ampounts of suddenly meet , they met a whole thing .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think about these magnets are more than 20 tons , and that are moved of about 30 centimeters .
They &apos;re damaged about 50 magnets .
We had to get them , what we did .
We &apos;ve got them and traveled them and travel .
They &apos;re now returning all of their subject .
By the end of the watch of the LHC is is new to be integral .
We &apos;ll accend it , and we expect to get data to the juice or played , and we continue our adventure to find out what the universe is the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain queeeering the value of science and engineering of the engineering of the engineering . It &apos;s easy to confuture .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so difficult , the fact that we go beyond the value of things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of a Inglese scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , imagine , I imagine , in defense of his pupillo , his pupillo , his pupillo , he said , &quot; Nithing is so dangerous for the progress of the human mind as the required as the require that the ideas of of science , which our tric tric tric tric tric tric triumfoods that are not going to be able to be able to be a new monstore . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start asking , you say to rethink about when , as children , played with the morning .
While you know , how you get them and give them , take them and get them , learned , you know , you know , actually , and you learned about problems and manipulating problems .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand the world around us .
So , from the information of the user user of our interaction with physics , together my consultable Patre , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to ask , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of the mouse as a digital , we could have the only die of the mouse that you move to a desktop , could connon-information to a desktop , we could fall the hands ,
and systemate our full ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , by building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a whole computer , like a biscan .
In a few words , a Siftable is a whole computer , like a biscan .
You can move them with the hand , they can see between them , they can see the movement and they have a screen and a radio .
But above , they &apos;re physicists , like the morning , you can move just further .
The Siftable is an example of a new ecosystem of tools for a new ecosystem .
And as as they become more physicist , conscious of the other , and as they become more physical , of the other people , of the other people of the movement , of the other , how we can exploring new and fun and fun of interaction .
I &apos;ll start with some simple example .
This is Siftable to show you the video : if you incline in a direction , the video , the video will rotate that , if you include from the other hand .
These are interactive , they &apos;re conscious .
If I do it , you &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re around .
If they get circumstate , they see it , and they can act a little bit .
If they get circumstate , they see it , and they can act a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We have realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power to use communicate gests , &quot; a color as if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable , as a century of versity , and I can use them to grew them to grew in that central color in that central , where they misk .
And I can use them to versing color in the central , where they misk .
And if we &apos;re too , we can put a little bit at all place .
They also have a possibility of learning , like languages , like languages , the math and places of logic , where people can provide the people can try to see the results , and you see the immediately .
I &apos;m going to do .
This is a sequence of Fibonacross a size of equations .
Here we have a game of words that &apos;s in the middle of the Boggle and .
Pratically , every turn to every night , you get a letter to one on every Siftable , Pratically , every turn to each Siftable on every Siftable , and you try to figure out of a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you have a new set of letters and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the kids came to the Media Lab , I made a video .
They &apos;re very lived .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to have to people .
You just have to say , &quot; Compons of words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s one of other people who are trying to .
This is our youngest younger , there &apos;s on the right .
It actually wanted to implane them .
They were only morning .
Now , this is an application of an interactive cardboard .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of languages . He &apos;s Felix .
It can inserve the characters in the scene , solid Siftable their associated .
It can inserve the characters in the scene , solid Siftable their associated .
So , he &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : The sun is spring .
David Merrill : Now he brought a treatment in the scene .
Video : The arange treator .
By work ! Yes ! Yes !
So schooling the Siftable and put them close to the characters --
Video : Bau !
To invent their story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a story with final open , and you can decide him as it &apos;s going .
DM : It &apos;s a story with final open , and you can decide him as it &apos;s going .
Video : Volice ice , gets .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a device , realized by recently , to walk and exeded music .
It &apos;s a tool , realized by recently , to walk and exeguing music .
The Siftable is here are against sound , based and battery .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose what we use .
You can also put these sound sound in a sequence of comport .
And you just put it by just touch a sound &quot; and a sequence . &quot;
These are effects that you can control from the vive , like the reverse and filter .
And then the one in a particular sound , and then including to the one .
And then there are the general effects as time and volume , that they &apos;re just applied to the whole sequence .
Let &apos;s look like that works .
Video : We &apos;ll start putting a base in two Siftable . &quot; Siftable , we &apos;re doing this , we add to the extend , we add other base .
Now I put a basis line .
Video : DM : Now I add add of percussions --
Video : And I &apos;m going to put the filter to the bacteria , so I can control the effect of the vive .
Video : I can speed the entire sequence on the whole sequence by one side or the other .
Video : And I &apos;m going to add the filter to the basis to give more expression .
Video : I can realize the sequence . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to planning it before , but I can suddenly make it longer or more correct or or the correct .
And now , finally , I can smoke the entire sequence in the left the Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new men machine , and more like the brain is , and the body &apos;s body like our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the result of this percoral , and also some possibilities that we try to bring out of laboratory .
The concept I want to transmit is coming to this new generation of projects to interact with digital media , that will leading information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the hour of you .
I &apos;m a writer .
By books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also the love and the fashion of my life .
And I don &apos;t exect that it can change .
But , said , something particularly happened in my life and in my career , who bring me to me to realibrate the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this whography called Manway , Prua , Prua , Ama , &quot; which , different reason my precedented books , for some reason I &apos;m going to be a great , sensational bestseller .
And the result is that everywhere in the vada , people treating me as if they were convicted .
Davigate -- condanned , condanned !
They are all over and they &apos;re all worried and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t fear of the way ?
You don &apos;t have fear of continue to write all life without power without power in the lives of creating a book that can important to somebody ? &quot;
What can you get to somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s rassurant , you know .
But it could go to the pese , I remember more than 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a cent .
I &apos;m going to meet the same reaction of the fear .
And people said , &quot; I don &apos;t have successful ?
You don &apos;t fear that the humiliation of the reversation ?
You don &apos;t have fear of this mestirate to all life without any of them , and you never get out and die on a cumulation of all infrants with the mouth of the fill-filled care of filled by ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short response to all of those questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I have fear of all those things .
I &apos;ve always had fear .
And I have a lot of other things that people may not have to involved .
As the full and other things are spaventous .
But , as much as I would write what I thought and I was asked , and I was totally , why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logic that anyone who should be spavented by a job that you feel unclean to do .
But what is there of so particular in the imprised to make us nervous about health of the health care , in a way that other carriers do not do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemist engineer and I don &apos;t remember one time in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if he was asked if he was wasked if he was washing ?
There was -- that never -- that &apos;s the engineer John , how it ?
It didn &apos;t work , you know , you know , ?
Onestly , chemical engineers have not certainly , in the centuries , dadagned the reputation of being alcolized to be high-hand depressive manized manized to be high-handed .
We have enough , we have enough this reputation , and not only writers , but creative of all gender , we have this reputation of being enormous instable .
And not rest more about looking at the conteous trists of the magnific ments that , only in the 21st century , they die young people die , they die young people die .
And even those who are suicidated suicdons are actually displaced by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before he die , in the last interview , he said , &quot; Every book killed me a little more than &quot; one of the extraordinary affermation about their life .
But we don &apos;t bate about the child , when we feel these things that we &apos;ve been interested and accepted the notiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and the ceiling , they &apos;re in some way , and you &apos;re in some way , and you will , it &apos;s going to conduce the hangost .
And the question I want all to do here is : are you agreed with this idea ?
It &apos;s good for you -- because it also looks like a megame of distance to me , not good for anything that supposition .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s also perangerous , and I don &apos;t want to see it &apos;s perpetuate in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our big minds to live .
And I know that , in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start figing out of that I was supposed to be suppositions , surprised the circumstances where I &apos;m in my career .
That &apos;s -- I mean , I &apos;m pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I have still about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that whatever write about this is going to be judicated by the world as the work that &apos;s successful after the world that I &apos;ve been given .
I &apos;m going to be heads , because we are all more or friends here -- probably probably my biggest successes .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know , this is the kind of thinking that &apos;s going to get a person to start bing in the morning , and I don &apos;t want to do that .
I would stop doing this work that we do this work that we do .
So , the question becomes , how do you ?
And so it seems to me , after many reflective reflective , that the way to write is to create a psychological costruck , okay ?
I have to find a security distance between me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxygen , and my natural anxygen , and while I was trying to do it . And as I was looking for all the time , trying to do it , trying to do it through time , trying to find other society to see if they could have better ideas and more and more unsane more and more unsane healthy and more unsane than healthy and more saneous ideas , and I &apos;m trying to do it , trying to do it through the time , trying to
how to help people to remainerent the emotional inerent risks .
And that research led me to the ancient Great and ancient Rome .
Let me go back .
In the ancient Grex and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity is from men , OK ?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit , they would look at the man who came out of a few distant and sell men from some distant and known , for distant distant and head , for distant distant , and severe broads .
The greatest called these &quot; spirits of creativity &quot; demons . &quot;
Socrate , wonderful , created to have a demon that elected wisdom .
The Romans were the same idea , but they called the spirit of a genius .
That &apos;s a great , because Romans didn &apos;t think that a genius was a particularly intelligent .
They would have a genius was this kind of divine that would believe that literally lived literally in the study of an artist , a little bit like Dobby , and that &apos;s like Dobby , and that came out to hidden the work of the artist and model and model to model the work of that work .
Here &apos;s what &apos;s worth about -- here &apos;s the distance of which I talk about -- the psychological costruck that you have to protect you from your work .
And everyone knew that it was so that it was working , right ?
So the antides of the anticlass were protected by some things , like the too much narcism , right ?
If your work was exceptional work was exceptional , you could not take all of them all of the market , everybody knew that you could help from this genioral .
If your work , if your work , it wasn &apos;t all the body , right ?
Everyone knew that was your genius to be an incapable .
And so people have a creativity in the West for a long time .
Then the Renasent came and all changed , and nacque this great idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe , and we put the universe and more space to the misteries that write details , and they don &apos;t have to be able to creatures that they write detail from the divinity .
This was the principle of the rational humanesimum , people began to think that creativity was completely from the idumanescent .
And for the first time in history , you begin to refer to this or the artist as a genius , which is a person in a genius .
And I have to say , I think it was a big herror .
I think that we allow somebody , a simple person to believe that it &apos;s like a deep , the essence and the source of all of the divins , creative , unknown responsibility , and it &apos;s a responsibility to give to the psibility to give the psychroll of human .
It &apos;s like asking somebody to inrow the sun .
Deform and completely distores the full and creates all of these ingestitations on performance .
And I think it was this pression to destroy the artists in the past 500 years .
And if that &apos;s truly , and I think that &apos;s the question is , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe you get back to a more ancient of the relationship of humans and creative .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t sing 500 years of rational thinking about a 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience that would have a suspicture of scientific , inset that they do the notion , you do that they do the people , by sophistory of the projects .
I &apos;m probably not convince you all about this .
But the question I want is , why no ?
Why don &apos;t I think that way ?
Because it &apos;s more sense than any other thing that has ever heard to explain the exasperant exasperant of creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever ever ever ever attempt to do something -- so , you know , you know , you don &apos;t have rationally behavior .
And , in fact , it can be sometimes seemingly paranormal .
I did this meet recently meetal with the extraordinary poetal poetry , who has now 90 years , but it was a few people to the lives in the Virgy , he said that during his infants in the Virgy , working out in the fields , and he heard , in if a poem to the landscape .
He said that it was like a train of air .
And he was coming up to her landscape .
He would be heard that would be , because he would be tremendous under his feet .
He knew he had one one thing to do to that point and it was , &quot; he was about , &quot; run as a matter . &quot;
And so it &apos;s correct to the house and he was inload by this poem , and it would not have to get a piece of card and a faster , while the translated , while the drop , and he would give it to the page .
Sometimes you couldn &apos;t be enough , so corrected and corrected and correct and correct and correct the poetry to get in house and the poetry to go through the landscape , and it would continue to rolate through the landscape , as he said , &quot; one other poet . &quot;
Then there were times -- this piece I &apos;ll never sit -- there were some moments where the statement was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was looking for the card and the poem went through , and he would give a math just as if he was spring , and he said , that it was like if he was driving with the other hand the hand .
He had the poem from the tail and put it in his body and put it in his body and transcritation was page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page and intanks , but the last one .
So when I heard it -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly ugual to my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conducture !
I &apos;m a move , and my way of work is ; you see me in the same horarious every day and work and go through the same horarious , and you go through the goodds .
But even I , in my lestestardaggin , I strike against that thing , sometimes .
And I imagine that many of you have the han done .
You know , even if the work and ideas were giving me from a certain source , I won &apos;t -- I could not know .
And what is this ?
And how can we relate to it in a way that you don &apos;t hold the head , but rather , rather , that makes us healthy ?
And as I think about , the best example of me , the best example that I have is the musician musician , which I &apos;ve been different years ago for a nal day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life has been the incarnation of the artist turned to control , trying to control , to get these kind of tometers , to draw , asking these kind of totally interested in the totally interested in the totally .
But then he invected , he hot , and one day as he was driving on a &quot; highway to Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
He was going to be a quick and all of a sent tract , that &apos;s a little bit of melody , which comes into his head as ispiration , elusive , elusive , and the literally , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the desidery , but not knows how to take it .
It &apos;s not a piece of card , it doesn &apos;t have a critical recorer .
So he began to feel this kind of old old old anxiety of anxized , and I &apos;ll remark obsessed by this personally song .
I &apos;m not good enough , and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of go in the panic , he stopped .
And he got the whole mental process and did something completely new .
And he just watched the sky and said , &quot; Scause , &quot; Scause , I &apos;m not seeing that ? &quot;
&quot; You know , you know , &quot; Would you have a song now ?
If you really want to be , you get to a more than you get care .
You go to other people who are important today .
You know , you know , Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his process of work , changed after that .
Not the work , the work was still hoscure as always .
But the process , and the anxiety that was regiven when he was reading the genius , the genius that &apos;s all of the other problems , and liberated it will realize it to the back where it was realizing , and he had to realize that it had no to be a interiorized and returned .
but it was a little bit of the peculiar , wonderful collaboration between Tom and this external thing that &apos;s not Tom .
So how much I felt that story , I was actually changing a little bit where I was working , and you already saved to me .
This idea , he saved when I was writing , &quot; Manway , &quot; and fall in one of those of the despite cell of the despair where we all work on something and we can &apos;t do it , and we can &apos;t start thinking about something and we can &apos;t think that &apos;s a disaster , which is going to be the worst book .
Not just the worst book , just the worst book .
And I started thinking about driving this project .
But then I remember about the Tom who talked to the air and I tried to the air and I tried .
So I went up to my face in the manoscriture and I got my comments to a hand , my comments to a hand .
And I said , &quot; You know , you know , you both , &quot; World , both , you both know that if this book won &apos;t be very much cold , right ?
Because as I see me I &apos;m putting everything I have , I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want to have better , you have to give you your part .
Okay . But if you don &apos;t , you know , I don &apos;t do anything .
I &apos;m going to go to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I want to favor that was recorded that I &apos;m today to do my part , &quot; because it &apos;s what -- at the end is , OK -- at the end of North Africa &apos;s werts in North Africa , the people would go to the dance of the dance , dancing and hours to hours to hours to hours and hours to the high-hours to hours to hours to hours and hours to the highly hours to hours to the head .
And they were always magnific , because the balls were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every time , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists actually become a transcendent .
And I know you &apos;ve all got you all have to do , because I know you &apos;ve all seen , a performance that .
It was like the time you stop , and the ballerin the walking through a kind of laptop and they wasn &apos;t doing anything of different from the sun , like 1,000 nights before , but everything was walking .
And suddenly , I don &apos;t just like a human .
But it turns out from the divince and under the divinity .
And when this was happening , the time , the people knew what he was , they were called it with his name .
They were congent the hands and they were begins to sing , &quot; Allah , God , Allah , God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curious storic -- when Mom invest the Spain , they took this habits of Spain , they took this habitude with them and pronounce in the centurious centuries by &quot; Allah , Allah , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; you can still hear in the corries .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , &quot; Allah , magnificent , &quot; God , &quot; I &apos;m a God .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes the day after , to the same time , the same thing , when you wake up and discovered that are the 11 of Martednuck , and the scorm of God , there &apos;s no longer .
It &apos;s just a dead with a lot of bad with the ginocy , and maybe they can never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever to get to that height .
And maybe nobody &apos;s going to be the name of God while I play , and what it has to do with his life ?
It &apos;s difficult .
This is one of the most porous recognizes to make a creative life .
But maybe not to force that you can &apos;t believe , if you can &apos;t believe , anzyutt , which the most expects of your being are from you .
But created just that you have data in the data from an unimaginable unimaginable source of this squt in the square of your life that you have to go to something else when you ended .
And , you know , if we think that all change .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s certainly like I thought for different months in the work of the book that I &apos;m going to do it , the dangerous , spavently , perangerous , spavently , spavailous successful .
And what I have to keep when I feel electrized by this is , not achieving .
You don &apos;t go down . It &apos;s just your work .
It &apos;s going to give you your part , whatever you can .
If your work is balar , ball .
If the divine , assume genius , assigned decide to leave some kind of wonderful kind of wonderful , for one moment through your efforts , then &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Alytrains , you do the same dance .
And &quot; OOle ! &quot;
I think , you have to teach it .
&quot; You know , you know , just to you , even for having love and test later , and test tape you &apos;re going to do you do it continually .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I &apos;ve already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what it can meaning and discovery of new genes .
We &apos;re now going to start a new percoral : we &apos;ve began to digitize biology and now to go from that digital code we &apos;re going to go into a new biology , designing and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing .
We always tried to ask big questions .
&quot; What is the life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists , I think they have a various levels .
We tried different approach , reducting it to minimes .
We &apos;re digitizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome is was treated to go from the analogic world of the digital world &apos;s digital world .
Now , let &apos;s ask : can we regenerate life from this digital universe from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome of the smallest genome of those that can authorium in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome for creating one more smaller .
We &apos;re able to get a hundred of genes about 500 of genes that are here .
But when we have a look at his metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our own .
Credetemes , that &apos;s simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it &apos;s very improbable that this can take to a living cell living cell .
So we decided that the only way to design is synthesize this chromosome in a way that we could modify the components for bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of the adventure of the &quot; Plentice we have a chromosome ? &quot;
Can chemistry to make these big molecules that we never have ever able to create before we never able to create before we did that have been able to create before now ?
And , in case , we can make a chromosome chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a chemical piece of inert material .
The speed that we can digitize life is growing up to the life is growing up to the exponential .
Our capacity to write the genetic code , rather , rather than , but it &apos;s improving .
And our most recent recent returning the latest tachment .
We &apos;ve began over 15 years ago .
The process has required many past past , starting with a bioethic reatens before the first experiments .
But we found that DNA is very difficult .
There are thousands of machines in the world that make small secret little secret of DNA , of the long time , the segment is a process of degenerative process : the most herrors is longer long , there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments and correcting the errors .
And that was our first attempt , to start from digital information of the genome of Phi &apos;s genome of Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills .
We designed the fragments , actually , the correction of the errors and get a molecule of DNA of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material chemical material , and we put it in the bacteria , the bacteria , the bacteria have been able to read this genetic and producurne the particles .
The viral particles are then you report from the cells , are come back and destroyed Evi . There are .
I &apos;ve talked about recently with the members of oil .
They remains more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where software can really build the same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the larger things .
We wanted to build the whole chromosome of the bacterium .
They &apos;re more than 580 myths of genetic code .
So we thought we &apos;ve been built in the size of virus , so that we could change the casses to understand what the casses are components of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information , they have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard accurateful for every 10 mile based .
We found , 30 errors . And we used to use that , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence , we would never be able to do that work .
One part of the process is designing sectity to design secrets that they have a severe report with all other sillector to build smaller subject to build smaller subject that work together .
We &apos;re all about unique elements here .
You have probably read that we put the figures .
So , I think that &apos;s a genetic code on four letters : As , CA , CEO , Cs , CEO .
Three of those letters together , and there &apos;s a specific order of letters , and there &apos;s a specific order of letters for every amminoacid .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frasutions .
What we did in the beginning was selling to do that .
Some of them were delused from the fact that it wasn &apos;t poem .
We designed these segments to be just held to be able to help with enentire .
There are enzymes that they &apos;re putting them up .
And we started assembling parts , starting with segments , starting with segments of 15 to seven miles , to make them in a middle of 24 miles to them to come to 72 thousector .
Every step , we made these segments in abundance so that we could sequenced that we &apos;re trying to create a very robust processure -- as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems the tabellon the bket .
When we get to these very long segments , more than 100 middle , they will not grow more directly in E.
It comes to the limit of the modern tools of molecular biology .
So we have considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called homologic recognizes , which in biology is using to reply the DNA to repurpose the DNA to can segments .
Here &apos;s an example .
This is called Deinococcus radiodurans , can make three million rad rad of radiation .
You can see in the superior as his perior as his chromosome is destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s reassembled by the way .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can do completely .
They can live under the vacy .
They &apos;re absolutely sure that life in space , and you moved to find new environments of water .
ASA , NASA showed that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built these processes , just using the lievil with the design appropriate segments to inserate the segments to insert .
The lievil assembly .
This picture was not taken with a electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a very big molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are photograph that they have a period of about six seconds .
This is the published we &apos;ve done a little time ago .
They are more than 580,000 genetic code .
It &apos;s the biggest molecule of a definitely created by man .
It &apos;s a lot of the square high perior to 300 million .
If we stamming it with a career 10 without spaces , they would like 142 pages to get this genetic code .
Now , how do we do that ? How can we activity ?
Of course , you can see a virus is a game from kids .
It &apos;s a little more complicated when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s simplest when it &apos;s cell of eues like our : you can just extreme the nucleo and inserious one , which is practically the process of the process of the process of the clonto .
In the hail , the cromosome is integrated by the cell , but we &apos;ve recently demonstrated that we &apos;re able to do a complete transplant of a cell of a cell to another and activate it .
We have crowed a chromosome of microbial .
The two are different as well as men from topes .
We &apos;ve added some gene gene in more way that you could decide that choose for this croma .
It &apos;s science and then you killed with all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was study -- and you &apos;ll open our software graph -- the new croma -- the new cromosome is going to the new cromosome .
And we thought we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried anyway to spent us more in there .
This is one of the most evolution .
We found that many people added a second , or a third or a third chromosome from some part , adding in a second thousands of new heck , in a second thousand ,
So who think about evolution as a just gene to evolve as a gene that has no grain to the biology .
There are the encies called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell of it .
The cell phone that we have inseritous .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other croma like extraneous material , and we found it with only cell , and we found out with only the cell and the new chromosome .
It &apos;s become blue because of the genes we &apos;ve inserted .
And in a short lelass of time , all the characteristics of a species , and you turned out of all over in a new species , based on the new software that we put in the cell .
All the protein , the membranch , the membranch , and when we read the genetic code is exactly what we &apos;ve transfer to you .
Now , that might seem genetic altering , but by altering the software . We can change the things in a pretty good enough substantial .
Now , I &apos;ve got to explain that here is not talking about genesius -- but we have progress from three million years and a half of evolution , and I &apos;ve already said that maybe we &apos;re going to create new version of the Cambrian explosion this process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s enough to be when we think about our need .
We &apos;re going to get six billion to get six billion people to nine billion in the next 40 years .
Just to give you an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one in 1946 ; there &apos;s 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re having problems , and we &apos;re going to find fresh water and clean , medicine and gas , medicine and gas for six billion people .
It &apos;s going to be more dare about to nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion pounds of oil .
That means millions of barrs a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replaced them , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
We have more about all the way of CO2 emission of CO2 from these materials that ends up in the atmosphere .
In the day of the world , thanks to scientific discoveries all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they are the design components for the future .
The electronic industry is only a dozen about components , and think about how many different things are out .
Our limits here are principlally from biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , thank you to do synthesization , that we call the combinatory genomics .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can make a billion chromosomes a day .
Think about these 20 million different genes of genes or try to make a typical processes to make a processes of optimize , new vaccines , we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for possibility of survival , production or carburn , chemistry or carbon , production vaccines .
This is an instantly of some software program about to be able to sit and design species to computing species to computing and design species to computers .
Well , we don &apos;t know , what they &apos;re going to be .
We know what we know , what they &apos;re the genetic code .
We &apos;re now focus on the carbons of how much generation .
You &apos;ve seen that extractly from the grain of the grain was a very finished experiment .
We have carbons of second generation that will use enough by the sugar to sugar to the higher carbons of higher value as eight-different butanol .
But the only way when biology can have a big impact without more than food , and limiting the cost of food and limiting the cost of it would be transform CO2 in matter , where we &apos;re working to design cells that can reach that scale , and we think we could reach this scope , and we think we could have the first carbons of how much much carbons of how much much carbons of how much much carbons of how much much carbons of how much carbons of how much food and we think of the food and we think about about about 18 months of the first cards of the food .
The solar solar combined with CO2 is a methodom -- but in our discoveries all over the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , about 2500 meters of deep deep the temperature of the water .
It &apos;s in CO2 , using the CO2 by using hydrogen as a source of energy .
We &apos;re trying to figure out if we can put CO2 , which can easily be transported through your tubes , converting that CO2 in carburn that process .
So we think we might be able to think we could be able to increase what the question of base , &quot; What is the life . &quot; We have the life . &quot; We have the modest of replacing the whole oil of replacing the whole oil industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do that TED , where can you do that ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working for using the same methods to create vaccines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with influence , we &apos;re always back back to a year and with a dollar in less when you &apos;re going to find the right vaccine .
I think what you can change by building vaccines .
That &apos;s how the future could start to change , now , the tree , now , the tree , accelerating the evolution with synthetic bacteria , and you finally have the eucarian .
We &apos;re so much from improving people .
Our purpose is to make a long enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the most foundary work , some fundamental work , of the new technology that we &apos;ve taken to a quiet almost a year ago . This is Seady .
It &apos;s a environment where you can interact is at the local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data .
Here we &apos;re seeing a lot of digabyte of digabyte , with a kind of digital zoom , and for a bread , and it &apos;s a bread , dispone-of-up pictures as we want .
And it &apos;s not about how big the amount of information that we see , how big these data , or the images .
Most of digital photographs , but this is for example , for example is a provense from the Bilioteca of of the Congress , and reentrepreneurs in the gam of 300 megapixel .
It doesn &apos;t do any difference because the only thing that we limits the number of a system like this is the number of full on your screen in any time . It &apos;s also a very flexel architecture .
This is a whole book , you don &apos;t have images .
This is the Casa desolate of Dickens . Every column .
And to show you that it &apos;s about the tip and not images , we can do something like this , to see that &apos;s really about a real representation of the head , not a photograph .
It could be a little bit artificial to read a little bit of electronic book .
I don &apos;t have to be advice .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s a number of the Guardian .
Every big picture is the beginning of a seition .
And it really gives you the piece of the landscape of the version of the version of a newspaper , which is for nature , which is for nature a lot of medium .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the Guardian .
We &apos;ve created a fasull fasull to the higher solutions -- much higher than the published in a normal published -- and we put you on the extra extra extra extra extra content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific specific .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hopefully that means to put the pop-up and other porcheries , and they should not be needed .
Naturally , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this isn &apos;t lose time , if not to say that we have contributed to date that camp .
These are all the streets in the United States .
So , we go to something else .
This is actually from the view of the Web ; you can go to see .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a search search for a very interesting computer that was in Noah Snavely , a student of the University of Washington , with the aid of Microsoft Rick Seliski and Rick Seliski &apos;s Research . It &apos;s a good collaboration .
And it &apos;s from the vive , the Seady dress .
You can see that when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from one picture to another picture and have this kind of experience to the multiple experience .
But the space collocation of the images here has a significant .
The algorithms of visualization of the computer recording these imaging imaging , in the way that they corresponding to the real place where the imaging imaging of -- all the near Green on the Montne Roccious , you &apos;re taking the Roccious -- you &apos;re taking the elements of a slide-show of a slide-show of a slide-show of a slide-show of bread , and these things are all the space level .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some much more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data of Noahes -- and this is from a precedent precedent prototype of Photosynth that we did work for the first time , the summer scored -- to show you what I think is really the key behind this technology , the key Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily watching the website .
We had to worry about the legal aspects of legal and so on .
This is a reconstruction of Noththtrial . Nothtries to Flickr Do . Bauckr Din Flickr and you get images of types in magic , others and saying . Each of these arancions represents a picture that &apos;s discovered a picture that &apos;s discovered a picture that &apos;s discovered a picture that &apos;s discovered a picture that .
So I &apos;m all images in Flickr and you were all connected to space in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this way we simplicated .
You know , I would never have thought about finish in Microsoft .
It &apos;s very , very , very , very , very , very ,
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different kinds of different kinds of focus , from the cellular phone to the professional phone to the professional phone , put together in this environment .
And if I can , try to try and look for the more strange .
Many of them are blocked by faces , etc .
Some of the photographs here , there &apos;s a series of photographs -- etlands .
This is a Noththtrial ,
We can go from the physics of the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from yet , the ential memory of how to applies the land , from vision point of view -- and the whole point of visual -- and the data together .
All those pictures become connected , more than the parts .
You have a model of the entire model that emerging .
Think about this as a prold-prolmer &apos;s work in the virtual Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as many people use it , and the advantages that are going to be used to use .
Their pictures are marades with other people .
If somebody &apos;s the idea of contrassigned the name , my picture of Nothtrial . And I can be a photograph of all those data , and I can use the point of all those data , and I can use the point of all of the data for immerging in space , and I can use the photograph social experiencing , and I have a social experience of cross-moil .
Naturally , a consequence of all of that are extremely elaborated with all the interesting part of the Earth , collected not only vistatellite vists and images from satellitariarian and images , but from the memory memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I can you know ? What your software is going to be a certain point , in the next few years , all the next few years , all the photographs shared by anyone in the world will be reading to anyone in the world will be reading to the whole world will be practically connected together ?
BA : Yeah . What he &apos;s basically discovering .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the pictures .
What becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of simantic information that many of these images .
As when you do a research of images on the web , you get a sentence and the head on the web page page has a lot of information about the picture .
Now , what happens if that picture you connect all your picture ?
So the amount of simancient interconnection and the amount of wealth that &apos;s really huge . It &apos;s a classical effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible . Compety-.
BA : You thank you very much .
One of the main acterms , when you travel and one of the research for the power of ethnographic research is the power to live between who have not formented the past in the wind , the driver in the wind , the touches is in the vent floating .
Bastes thinking that Jaguar men , they are still beyond the Lattea , or that the Mths of Inuit are still meaning , or that in Himalaya , the buddisti , the buddisturbing the respire Dharm , to remember the central importance , and the idea that the world we live in the central important , and the idea that the world we live in the world where we live in the world , but it &apos;s just a model , but it &apos;s just a model of reality , but it &apos;s just a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of the adaptative that our stirirst has done , well or a bad , well , or a bad map .
And , of course , we all share the essential .
All we all do . We all proof them .
We are subjects in the beginning .
We need to have to rontate the inexorability of death , so it doesn &apos;t surprising and ballim --
We all have a art .
What hit is the particular rate of all culture .
Not matter that are the Can forests of the Borneo , or the following Haiti , or the People who are Kaids , or the Curt Kaisuit of Saharan , the Curran Ande , or a cameler in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my journey in the desert a month ago , or a month ago , or a hallevator of yak in the value of the world .
All of these people teachers us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of move into the world .
And , if you reflect a moment , it &apos;s a concept that you can give you hope .
Insit , the cultures of the world , they create a non-ray of spiritual life that we have the planet and it &apos;s important for the planet as a biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural spills as an ethnosphere , and you can call the etnosphere , the nosphere , sample , heads , inspirations , inspirations , inspirations , intuitions , inspirations , intuitions , the neighborhood ,
Ethnosphere is the fantastic patrimonium .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how inquisitive .
And because biosphere was graved by the way , as much as the biosphere and unfortunately quiet .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species is about 50 percent of all species is about the extinct of the extinct of the extinct of biological -- in the highest ipothesis in the field of biological hypothesic -- and you don &apos;t even have neighborhood -- that of the cultural diversity .
The whole thing is , of course , is , of course , the language .
When you have 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only composed by a vocabulary or by a series of grammaticals .
One language is the broken of human spirit .
It &apos;s the medium with the animal of all culture is coming into the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a backin the mind , a thousand , a thousand of spiritual possibility .
And 6,000 languages , while we &apos;re sitting in Monterey , at least half the middle of the children .
They don &apos;t have more teached to children , which means , not not to won &apos;t walk , which are already dead .
What is more trists of being flowed by the silence , of being the last to talk about a language , of the wisdom , not have a linguishing the wisdom of the children ?
This is a sleeping of somebody in some part of the world , every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks , and it &apos;s taken in the tomb of a language .
And I know somebody who &apos;s going to say , &quot; Is it &apos;s not that ?
The world would not be a better place if we all the same language ? &quot; And we all talk all of the same language ? &quot; We all talk all of yoruba .
Let &apos;s talk about kogi .
You &apos;ll buy a such thing a tract thing you want to say , not to talk about language .
I &apos;d like to do a journey through the ethnosphere .
a little trip in the ethnosphere to give you a little bit of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , &quot; different ways of existing . &quot; I really mean different ways of existing .
Take for example , this Barasana bian , in Amazon , the population of anaconda , which creates the myth of the high of the latt of the latte of the latte of sacred house in the latte of sacrates .
It &apos;s a population that &apos;s not able to distinguished the color , because the time you have blue cellent in the forest of the forest , which depends the population .
They have a strange language and a main rules , &quot; Sunday , &quot; Do you have to move a person that you have to go a person who talks about a different language .
All of this has gone in the mythological past , though the particularly is that in these extent families that are talking about six or seven languages .
They limited to listen and then they start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribe with which I lived , the Waoran of Ecuador , an incredible population , an incredible population , an incredible population that had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five mesionaries have attempt a constantly common a herror .
They have been able to pick up the photographs that they report them in poses that they would have advice , forest that this population of pluvial forest .
They &apos;ve been collected the picture of a form or a figure , they turned into a shape , they have a bunch , they have been putting the dig , and they killed the five missionaries with the lance .
But Waorans don &apos;t just killed the straniests .
They were killed with them .
54 percent of mortality was caused by them .
We &apos;ve been sitting on eight generations , and we found two dead cases of mortic death , they have a lot of them , they had a lot of them , and then they killed it to invected it , and then they killed it . They said , &quot; You know , Ad all the same .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine from 40 steps and recognizes to the species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned a very interesting compiece when my professor of Harvard asked to Harvard to intrue to intrue in the base of the power of Duvalier and Tonton Maces and Tonton Maces , and I imposed me to the arbie of the power to the arbies .
To give a sense of myracolous , I should have to understand the Vodoun culture , and the Voodoo is not magic .
It &apos;s pretty much a medical complex medical vision of the world .
Many interesting thing .
If I asked you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddism , etc .
A continent is always left out , and thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has no religious feelings . And he investigate is not other than religious , the distilled of these concepts in the way , the way of the naked drive diaspora .
What makes the voot of the vooo is the intense report between life and death .
So , the lives do the spirits .
And the spirits can be invoyed by the Great Acqua , they respond to the dance of the dance and replace temporary temporary to the animate of the vive .
So the voodooists love say , &quot; You white white you go to ask about God .
We give in the temple and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re plenty , is the spirit that you guid you , how do you do the bad of the bad ?
So you have to these incredible events : Wait , you follow the voodoo of trance that touches infuried infurid of the power of mind on the body &apos;s mind on the body was catalyzed in a state of extremely exciting .
I was all the people with which I lived the most extraordinary people are the Kogi of Sierra Nevada Marta , in Santa Marta , in Colombia .
It makes a tyrann-civilization that once they had a living on the carairs of Colombia , the population of the vulnery , the population of the vulation that you ern the carbly care about the carbon .
In a druchip of blood , this population never been conquered by the spagners .
And yet , I &apos;m governments from a closer , but their formation is really extraordinary .
The young people are taken away from the families to three or four , and they live secrets in a good world of good and hombs in a hombrow in the bag for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years in the nine months of gestation that transments transrate into the user of the mother , is now metaphor , are metaphorically in the Great Mther .
So , that &apos;s acculated by the values of their society , values that they predict their prayers and only their prayers are the equilibrium .
At the term of this incredible initiation , they &apos;re suddenly taken out and for the first time , 18 years , they see an alba . And that &apos;s the first bulness of the first book , when the sun buts the value of the first burning , everything that they learned in theory is that they &apos;ve learned in theorety of all the brokilled , and it says , &quot; The pret a steel is going to a step and says , &quot; The pret a steel of the pread of the wind of the pret of the bar .
&quot; I &apos;m going to say , I said ,
It &apos;s just a study . It &apos;s now about you protect it . &quot;
They &apos;re called more brothers and say that we , fractor .
This is an extremely important level .
When we think about Indigene and the environment , we invochieve Rousau and the old story of the old story of the old story of the old old old , which is a razgame in his simplicity or maybe , and we say that these people are more closer to us .
The advice populations are not nor indebolites from the nostalgets .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the disease in the diarium palues in the gelids of the Tibet , but thank you , because of time and the rhythis , created a mistic of the Earth , and they &apos;ve created a more subjects : the concept that the Earth can only live in the world .
What does that mean ?
It means that a little bit of the Ande of the Ande grows that the mountain is a Prit . which is going to drive his destiny is going to be a deep human being depth with the mountain or that a mountain or place with a mountain or place that a little girls in the Montana that a mountain a mountain of a rocopy is a mountain ,
That &apos;s the dimall of a spirit or a mineral cathing is irrilevant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that &apos;s what the relationship between the individual and the world .
I grew up in the forests of the Britannica , believe that the forests serve to be cut .
This made me a different human being different human being from my friends in Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the Hukuk &apos;s dimour of the paradimall of the paradise and the paradise of the paradise , we live in the Hamatsing of the world , the Hamatses that they &apos;re going to be northern the Hamatsslide of the Hamatsis .
If you start considering that these cultures can actually actually , different reality , you can start to understand some of them sensational sensational discoveries .
I &apos;ve taken this picture to open in the noroccurs .
Mayahuge of you have heard about the Eahuge psychoactive stance of the monkey repertorium repertoium .
What makes the fascinating the ayahuge is not the potential drug of substance , but his elaboration . It &apos;s composed by two elements .
From a side , this lian league that &apos;s a series of the carboline , harming and harmful harmful , harmful hallucinogene .
And you can make the only plants , you have a little bit of the bluease that alters a little bit of the house , but it &apos;s myself choia .
This plants of the triptams , very similar to serotonin , dimethoxyltryltryltryltryltrical five , methoxine methoxine .
If you ever see the Yanomami to the susage the susage that they do from a different species , which is methoxyltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltrical .
Tirying that polling on for the nose is a little bit like being disparate by a file fucile of the barol dium of the eyes of electricity . They don &apos;t believe a distorsion of reality ; creates the dissolution of reality ; creates the dissolution of reality .
I was often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who wrote the psychedelic , with his discovery of the hallucinogens in the &apos; 30 in Mexico .
Second my tese tanks can &apos;t class these triptams like hallucinogens because if you &apos;re not telling any of being killed .
It &apos;s possible to absolutely beyond if you unlike the MAO .
Now , the beautile : the billboard , the carbon is inibitors of MAO , the same kind of needs to be able to potential triptams . The question of the way : in a 80,000 species of plants , like these are doing these people to find two deamorphologically not similar , but if you do this , they create a real biochemistry that &apos;s a real biochemical version that &apos;s a lot of time to be superior ?
We use the great euphemism of the experiment and error , which can reveal infruit .
But if we ask the Indian , they &apos;ll say , &quot; People are talking about . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribes , Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuge , which distinguishing in the forest , and our eyes would return into the same species .
If you ask them how they stabilish their task us , &quot; I thought I could think of it , you know , you don &apos;t know everything ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you get 17 variety in a night of lllottop and each one will care with a different .
With this is not laurea to Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than contact to conconcerned about the prints .
Now , &#91; opplauses the problem is that also the ones of us who have to have heart of the history of the history of the history of the history of the history of our real world , and pass .
In fact , the 21st , between 300 years , not remember , in the 1900 , not remember of technological innovations , but rather as we stopped and we embractively and we abulous actively or passively , or passively , and we embracing the world &apos;s problems and cultural of the planet . Now the problem is not change .
All cultures through centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibility .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indian Sioux , they don &apos;t stop Sioux when they put up and fast as they put up as Americans have no stopped to be American when they put from the horse and ceiled .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that they mind the integrity of ethnosphere . It &apos;s the power .
The wall of domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you &apos;ll find that these are not destined that these are not destined to disappearing .
They are creatures and dynamics out of identifiable forces that are beyond their ability of adaptation .
It &apos;s what it &apos;s disbosing in the patria of the Penan --
a population of Sarawak , in the Sarawak , a population that has lived free in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to a generation , and now reduced to the regives of the figures , where you can see the figures , which seems to be a carried that seems to the Bornewspaper to the Mornear Car-Erezon-Everycle , where the horizonest , the horizonest of the horizonest , and you can see the drive the way of the back of the horeship in the house ,
You required stives with the wood woods with the wood .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that you have to the discovery of the gold .
If we move on the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the volt dall of political domination .
As you know the genocide , the physics of a population , is convicted in the universal level , but the ethnic of the world , the distriction of the world , not only condannated , but it &apos;s celebrated in the environments , because it makes part of the development .
And you can &apos;t understand the soffering of the Tibet , until you get from the beginning .
I spent 6,000 miles from Chengu in the West Chengu in the West China in the West , coming to Lhasa with a young , but only came to Lhasa young , but only came to Lhasa , I understand what &apos;s behind the statistics we heard about .
6,000 crows sacrates in policy and centers .
1.2 million people killed from the military Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascrited to Panchen Lama .
which means that it &apos;s been killed to the Chinese invasion .
Her is unclean with Sua Sanity in Sanity during the deal that brought the population in Nepal .
His mother was imprisoned and his colpa was rich .
It &apos;s been taken to hidden in the age of two years , hidden his group because he would not have living without her .
The sister , who made the same , it &apos;s been put in the field of reeducation .
It &apos;s a day , he &apos;s got a raffign clean , and for this transgression , it was put in the seven years .
The pain of the Tibet can be insatitaken , but the redentor of the people are taking .
And then , you can get a choice .
We want to live in the world world world &apos;s world &apos;s the policromatic world or we want to get the policromatic world of diversity ?
The great anthropologist Margaret , before we die said that his biggest couple of them , in our own vision of this vision of the world , we &apos;re not just seeing the whole ama of human imagination is going to be a house limited to a depensive modality , but one day we &apos;re going to wake up to a day , but a day we were able .
And it &apos;s umiliant to remember our species is existed for 60,000 years .
The Revolution Revolution , which has given us the agriculture , which has done us to be able to the cult of the see , and they &apos;re talking about the poem , by creating the next closer , creating the hierarchy of specific , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The industrialized world has about 300 years .
That sths history not suggests that we have to all the challenges that we have to do in the millennia to come .
When I have these cultures of the world is asked what it means to say to be human , they respond to to be human , they respond to to be human voice .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all report the possibility of being what we are : a conscious species , which has to be a way that all the people and all the people can floor to be able to floor . And there are great moments of optimism .
I took this picture on the north of Baffin , when I went to the Baffin , when I went to the hunt hunt with Inuit , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya ,
The canadvice was not always gentile with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to stabilie our prematise , we have them in colonies .
The non-non-refused to go .
The family , templation for his life , he brought all the arms , and all of his attracted .
You have to know that Inuit isn &apos;t the cold , they don &apos;t feel .
The paces of the slings were actually made of fish in the paces of cards .
The non-name of this man did not further from the arctica or of the blizard that was suffiped .
It &apos;s baired out , you &apos;re copying the pin of foca and defecated in your hand . When the failed , you &apos;ve got them , you &apos;ve got them , you work , you &apos;ve got them , you work with a lama .
It &apos;s spring up on the dots of this crows , and when it was solid killed a dog .
He schools schohes and created a brilliant , with the actual casses , he made a slump , he has imbridge another dog and it &apos;s disappeared on the banchisa , and it &apos;s slide in rest .
We want to talk about cavarsela with nothing ?
In 1999 , the canadvanced government reduced to Inuit the total control of a largest of California and Texas a Texas a message .
It &apos;s their new patries . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a independent territory . They They contributing all the minerary resources .
One of the splendidding example of the national state can recognize with his population .
And , finally , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least to who of us was in these slums of the planet , make you don &apos;t realize that they &apos;re not remote .
For somebody &apos;s home .
They know , the seattions of the human imagination that they &apos;re rising the trees . And for us all these children , as the dreams of these children , as the dreams of our children , become part of the hope .
For finally , we have National Geographic , we &apos;re not going to have to nothing .
We believe that polemy --
&#91; Ausi &#93; , &#93; they don &apos;t have persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month our site to 35 million visit .
156 countries transmmmmmmmmmmust .
Our revists are slences from millions of people .
Our work is travel to bring our public in order to bring our public in the way of wonderful cultural reveals from what they saw and hopefully , hopefully they saw and hopology , they &apos;ll hope for the central revealing : the world of an anthroughout of life in a world , and multicultural world to multural lifts , and multicultural world to muralist record , and muralists ,
where the wisdom of all the populations can contribute to our own well-being walked .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things I wrote about this book that I hope reone another that you have heard and I &apos;ll try to evidentiate some of the connections , in case , not note them .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the official dogma . &quot;
The dogram of what ?
The dogram of all the West Cretional society . The dogma official connection : &quot; If we want to male the benefit of our citizens &quot; The way to do it is massyarth of the individual liberty . &quot;
The reason , is from one side , in fact that freedom is in the fact that freedom is precious , useful , for humans .
Actually , one of us is that if we are free , each of us can do all of us to do everything that massive , our well-being , without any one that decided in nambody nambody decide in names .
The way to male freedom is messing .
More choices are libers , more libers are liberty , more than their liberty , most of them is their well-being .
This is , I think , it &apos;s so deply radicted in the society that nobody would dream to put it in the society .
And it &apos;s also deeply radicated in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly great .
I &apos;m lost a simple on the condents for insalate .
In my supermarket , there are 175 condents , without contact on the oil of oil . And 12 acets of oil and 12 acets of oil , you can buy to give you a huge number of your rescue , which you can buy for a number of your research is that nobody &apos;s already to your rescue .
Here &apos;s the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic negotiate one : case , CD leter , CD , radio , radio , radio , radio , radio ,
And in this single negotide , there &apos;s a great number of audio , there &apos;s a great number of audio .
We can do six million different and a half a different half of different combinations that there are a negotiate .
You have to admit that there &apos;s a lot of choice .
Other fips : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the deal phone , you could get all the desire , in the package that they were forned by mom Bell .
You &apos;d born the phone , you didn &apos;t buy it .
One consequence of that , in the phone , was the phone would never romped .
These time , these are gone .
We have a variety of phones , especially between the cellular cellular .
Here &apos;s the cellular cellular .
My favorite is that in the middle , My letters of the nose , and force for the crows .
If you don &apos;t have seen you have seen in the store under the house , you &apos;re certain that will be .
And what &apos;s the end is that people come into the store and does this question . And you know what the answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that &apos;s not too many things .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the busts , you know , the same explosion of choicion .
Asanitary health : Does more in the United States that you go from the doctor and doctor you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do , or B , &quot; Do you have these benefits , &quot; B has these benefits . &quot; So you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Dr. &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; It &apos;s these benefits and risks , and the goods , and these benefits . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebats , &quot; Doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor : &quot; But I &apos;m not . &quot;
The result of the result of the disease , &quot; expression that makes it seems a beautiful thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not a lot of the weight and responsibility to do decisions , which one knows something , which one else knows nothing -- and it &apos;s not almost certainly , it &apos;s not in the condition to realize the patient to take the real patient to take decisions .
There &apos;s a huge marketing products , direct to people like me and you , that if you think about no sense , that if you think about no sense , given we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why are they published ?
The answer is that they want to be that we call the doctor to change it .
Something like this is our very crazy hourever is is a question of choice , as you see in this jump . &quot; We don &apos;t want to force children . Scear their homes . They &apos;ll not want to be an identity : We &apos;ll not want to be an identity : we have to invent .
And we can reinvent how many times we get us .
That means that every morning , to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I mean , in the family and matriage , a time the next few communes , slide , almost most anyone , it was that you would have the most most possible , and you started to get the most of possible .
The only choice was with who , not even when , not even , and not even what to do after .
Egyday , it &apos;s really to play .
I teach in very smart students , and I do do the 20 percent of work in less than a time .
And not because they &apos;re not brilliant , not because they &apos;re not fewer diligent .
Because I &apos;m impensieritites , I mean , &quot; I &apos;m going to go , &quot; I should I do that now ? &quot;
&quot; I should must think about the one ? I have to think about the kids or career career ? &quot;
They are slogorananants .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this implement not the companies that you &apos;re in the asking and not a beautiful vol of my exame .
And they have to do that . They have to do that . They have important questions .
Now , the work : We &apos;re lucky , as Carl South Carl South , because technology allows us to work every minute , from Hotel Randolph .
In the parentesestimate , there &apos;s a angolin , and I &apos;m not going to nobody , where WiFi works .
I don &apos;t say , because I want to use it .
What means , this incredible freedom of choice that we have to do ? It &apos;s continuously deciding , and we have to do or not .
We can go to see our son , we can go to the cell phone in a task , the Blackberry in the other , and the night , task on the ginocketely , on the ginocky .
And even if they &apos;re all spending , every minute that we see our son , we also see our son , we also ask , &quot; I have to answer this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have I ask this email ? I have to habbozing ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , &quot; that makes the experience of the partners of your child very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , as any part of the little , we look at all , little and the materials and life , life is a choices , life is a choice .
Once the world was this : Ovy , there were some possibilities , but it was not a choice .
The world today &apos;s world &apos;s a dilemma is : &quot; It &apos;s a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Scial .
And the positive lacs , so I &apos;m going to talk about negative .
All this choice is two negative effects on people .
The first , paradoxally , is that it &apos;s produced by liberation .
And many options that you choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I &apos;m offing you an example : one study convicted of volunteer .
A college had access to the data of Vanheat , the giant society of the Sun &apos;s worth of the deep company , in 2000 companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage , the percentage of adesion is two percent .
With 50 sources , there &apos;s 10 percent of the adesions that are available to when they &apos;re available to five . Why ?
Because with 50 sources of the source that choose , is maledetails to decide , and the choice is remanded to the indomorange .
And domororous , and again , domororrow , domorrow , of course , domorries , and of course , domorrow ,
You can &apos;t have enough money , they &apos;ll have food for dogs because they don &apos;t have enough money , because they don &apos;t have enough money , it also means that the decision is so hostica that they also lose the complementary of the dator .
They don &apos;t talk about , they &apos;re losing up to five dollars per year from the work , which would be wouldn &apos;t be true to be true to be true to be .
So the paralized is a consequence of having too much choice .
And I think that makes the world like this .
&quot; And finally , for the eternity : ketchup , feelape or maion ? &quot;
You would like that , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the background , and nepurple the wrong , and nepur-conditional condent .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can avoid paralysis , and we &apos;re not not unfurther from the result of how we would be with less options that choose choose .
And that &apos;s for different reasons .
One of these is that with many condents that you choose , if you buy one and you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect , is easy to imagine that you could do a different choice that you could have to be better . And what &apos;s happened to be better . And what &apos;s going on is better . And what &apos;s going on is that the high-defated satisfied the sodduces of the choice , and the soon remains , and the soon the decision , and the soon the decision ,
even when it was a very good decision .
More choices are easier to be fashion whatever detainment of the choice that &apos;s insosatisfacing of the choice .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call cost of costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert asked very well , practices like the value that we do depends on what we do is .
In the rest , when there are many possible options , it &apos;s easy to represent the tools of alternative , you &apos;re not expected of option that you have choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m just with all of those who are not in New York .
But that &apos;s what you would think you would think .
There &apos;s this coppia of Hamptons .
A place of light .
It &apos;s beach . Otyway . Ottype day . It &apos;s all of them .
Nothing . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , maledition , is August . &quot;
&quot; All my neighbors in Manhattan are away . &quot;
&quot; I could talk about the home . &quot;
And he pass two weeks absiled by the idea that &apos;s losing -- every day -- the possibility of talking where it wants .
The cost-opportunity become the sosatisfaction for what we have , even when choice was eccellent .
And the more of the options we have to consider , the more equivalent characteristics will come against as a cost-opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This one of a lot of things .
We talk about the time , and maybe of living slowly .
But the most important point is that whatever you chose , you chose you to do other .
The things that we don &apos;t choose have many attractive attractive , they can make less attractive what we do .
Tirst point : spiral growing up the expectations .
I tried it on my skin , and I try a new jeans .
I &apos;m almost always .
Once the jeans were one of a kind , you buy them and they were dress , they were comfortable , they were comfortable , only after they had them a life and they were washed a lot of times , they began to go well .
So I went to buy a couple , I went to buy a couple , and I said , &quot; I need a couple jeans , this is my cutting . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Look slim , &quot; Let them slim , fasy phit , relaxy and failed ? &quot;
You want them to do it or with your name or with your sons ? &quot; Stonewashed &quot; or &quot; acidwashed &quot; ? &quot;
&quot; Who want to stream ? &quot;
&quot; Some wants to be larger or stretch ? &quot;
I was balordit , and after a little bit I was able to say , &quot; I want the guy that was the only guy , &quot; I don &apos;t have the only guy who was , so for a time I had all of the dieterms of the store , then I had to go out of the store that I ever had .
It was the men . I had all that choice I had the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse for the whole thing is that with all of my expectations were altize , the jeans had to be perfect .
I had a minime I had a minime . I didn &apos;t expect anything when there was only one , but when there was a 100 different kind of them , at least a different kind of hundred , at least a kind of perfect .
What I had busted was good , but not perfect .
After I talked about that choice with what I was trying to insodently confront to the expectations .
The addition of options in life of people don &apos;t do that these are the expectations that they have respect to the ector of the options of options in the extent of the options of options in the life of the options of options in life .
And that &apos;s going to make less satisfying , even when the results are good .
No one in the world of marketing .
Because if they know , they wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more like this .
&quot; You were better when you were worse , &quot; The reason why he was better when you were worse is better when you were worse is that when you were worse is even possible to meet the surprised .
Egyday , in the world we live -- opulents , industrialized citizens with the perfection of perfection -- the massive that we can hope is the things are in the heighborhood .
You never have surprised pieces because your expectations , the expectations , they &apos;re ingiganted .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Well , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , you want . &quot;
I mean , little autobiographic moment , which I &apos;m really moved and my wife is really study .
I couldn &apos;t have to do better , I didn &apos;t have any better .
But , you know , it &apos;s not always good .
And finally , a consequence of buying a couple of jeans scomods is that when there &apos;s only that when you &apos;re not exacts , and you ask you , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot; And the answer is is clear .
The world is responsible . What could I do ?
When there are hundreds of types of jeans , and you buy a insodently , and you ask who is the responsible , is otherwise that you have responsible , it &apos;s otherwise you .
You &apos;d have to do better .
With hundreds of variety , there are no goes for the insuccessful .
So when people are decisions , even though the result is valid , they feel insodently insodented and they give them the holds to them .
In the last few depression is exploss in the world industrialized .
I think a fattor meaning -- not the only one , but -- of this wave of depression is that people have experiences of depression is that the people have experiences of the drop .
And when they have to explain this situation , they think that the color is .
So the final result is that we &apos;re better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the dogram , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely false . It &apos;s not truly .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than they have no matter , but it doesn &apos;t want to be a lot better than it &apos;s better than a little bit .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m pretty sure we &apos;ve been a piece of the level where the choices are better our life .
Now , from the political point of view -- I almost finished -- from political point , the nocle is the following .
What allows all this choice in the industrial society is the material wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is they have too much pocks .
So the facing facility I &apos;m talking about is a malesclusive of modern , the Western society .
And what it makes you repress and array is this : Steve Levitt you talked about how those expensive and comods of the bes of the neighbors . It &apos;s a spread of money .
I mean , these choices and dispendious , and it &apos;s not that they &apos;re just unused .
They &apos;re very addiction .
They do do worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows a lot of choice , it &apos;s going to be able in those where people have too few possibilities , not just would be improving their improving .
This is what economists call a parezing improvement .
A redistribution of the reduction is good for all -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice that &apos;s going to us .
So , you can become everything you want to become everything you want &quot; --
You , people of culture , you &apos;re thinking , &quot; What &apos;s it created the fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t get anything in a glass of glass . &quot;
&quot; A castrated , a truck vision limited vision of the world -- &quot;
And I interpret it , and I interpret in the beginning .
But then , I thought , I realized that what the fish knows the long knows .
Because the fact of the fact of the fact , it &apos;s the fact that if you eat , &quot; all the way that &quot; everything is possible . You get the paralysis .
If you read the mouth in a way that all diminized declining .
You know , you know , you reduced the well-being .
Everyone needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too much strip , maybe even for us .
But the axim of some symbolic symbolic for unhappiness and , I &apos;m temum , for rhines .
Thank you very much .
