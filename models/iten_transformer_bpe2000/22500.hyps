I showed these slide to show that slide to show that the calculations to demonstrate that clean is 48 United States , the size of 48 United States . The next year , is 40 percent .
But this is , I &apos;m going to be the gravity of the problem because not showing the spexisting of the ice .
The artic clear is , in a certain sense , the heart heart of the global climate system .
It &apos;s expanded up and the summer .
The next slide is going to be a quickly record on the last 25 years .
The ice loss are signed in red .
As you see , they expand to the blue .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter , which is the glasses .
You can see that the ice cosid-year-old cost cosidly , of five years or more , it &apos;s like the blood , which five years from the body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been so ,
This is a problem because the interested in the art-free , the entire floor to the ocean artic amount of congelected carbon congelected , which , science , they &apos;re transformed into metane from microbs .
Respect to the totality of the atmospheric inquation , the amount of global warming , that amount could radical , surprising this point of not .
In some of the laghorses in Alaska , in Alaska , and they &apos;re already from the water .
The professority Katey Walter of the University of Alaska was receive with a team pressing a team bad lay lay .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : She &apos;s good . The question is if we will be .
A reason is that this term scale the thermal term scale the Greenland from north .
This is a glacial figures .
The brought never reached livels like .
This is the figures Kangerlush , in the southwest of Greenland .
If you want to know how to sal the level of the sea level of the ice sea of the ice on the short of the sea .
These running are increasingly increasingly .
As the other part of the planet : Antarctica , the greatest block of ice ice ice .
The month scientists have diclose that the ice of ice is in negative , and the gative actual Antartica , and the Antartica , which makes some kind of the subtica , which makes some issoles in the science .
Equives to six feet of the level of acifif-level , like Greenland .
Sull Himalayas , the third largest block , you see new laghands , you see new lagholes , which a few years ago , they were glacier .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population is going to be half the water from that he wife .
Sulle Ande : this ice ice is the source of the water .
The brought is increased .
But when it dimines , the same thing happens to be able to the water .
In California , the snow on the Sierra is deminuit-40 percent .
The hyrices are in the crises .
The predictions , like you &apos;ve read , they &apos;re graves .
The growth security of the city in the world download .
The environmental disaster disaster are increasing out of the normal and without previous .
Sometimes more numerous in the last 30 years of previous 30 years of the previous 75 .
This is a whole thing about all of the sustainable .
If you look at the historic context if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of tons in the oceans every day .
Look at this is the area of the Pacific Pacific Pacific , to the American continent , and on both the Indian continent , where there is a radical impoverimprovement of oxygen in the oceans .
Most because of the global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossil combustible combustible .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with more emissions , together at China .
And he was proposed to build a lot of other centers .
But we &apos;re assisting a change of direction .
These are the projects in the last few years and some of the high-year-old projects .
At every way , there is a lotta politics in our country .
The carbon industries and the oil industries have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon , which is a hospital .
That picture me recursue , I would remember something --
Natal , in Tennessee , where I was a 3.8 billion lloss of 3.8 billion flowers of carbon .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen this about news .
This is the second largest flow of scories in America .
It &apos;s happened to Natal .
The published nature of one of the industries of the carbon was this .
Video : The paper is a little alley , it &apos;s a kind of like leground and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it makes our economy .
My the carbon is more and more and more and more and more and more clean .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and work work work , and they keep the stipend .
Al Gore : At here is a big part of the West Virginia .
The largest society on the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I &apos;m going to be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosis , Harry Reid -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for Protection of Clima has two campaign .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Ator : At COALergy see the climate change as a minute serious mine our business .
So , our priority is invest a great amount of money in a hundred of money in a public effort to make public and confused the truth .
In fact , the charcoal is not sporting .
We think it &apos;s also a good deal .
So , you don &apos;t preoctor of climate change .
Let me do .
Video : Attor : Ator : Carbone -- you &apos;ve heard a lot of you &apos;ve heard a lot of you &apos;ve heard a lot of them .
So let &apos;s give you a toward into a structure at a stream .
Strady ! The machines are a little bit , but this is the sound of the technology of the clean .
The carbon is between the major causes of global warming , but the night-crazy technology of the paper is that you see all change .
You have a look at this : this is the easy technology of the carbon clean .
Al Gore : Inend , the positive alternative to the economic issue and the national security of national security .
Video : Shinent . America is in crisis ; the economy , the national security crisis .
The philos that the lines all : our dependence from fossil of fossil , like the spores and the oil oil oil .
Now , perhaps there is a new , audace solution for using cirs .
Really , 100 percent of energy , in 10 years old .
A plan to put America to make America to make us safer than safety , and help to stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that I &apos;m going to solve our problems .
Really America . Scoover .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It &apos;s about reducing energy to America .
One of the fastest ways to bring up to the dependence from the combustible dependence that killed our planet .
She said , the future is here . I feel , a new energy .
T2 : Nutheless investment for places of the blob retributes .
I feel : As America . It &apos;s time to be realists .
At the Gore : A old old old old African says , &quot; If you want to go fast , you go to the fast , you go to the fast .
If you want to go away , you go together . &quot;
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
The year at TED I did a full of the LHC .
And I promise to go back to you about how the car .
So here I am . And for the ones that the other time , there was no , the LHC is is the biggest experiment ever was such a 30-miles of circumstence .
His compit is to recrecrecrecrecrecrecrecreceive billion second from the universe of the universe -- until 600 million times a second time .
All this is just environment .
This is the car underlying .
We photography these mini-Bang Bang in the resevators .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLATLATLAs -- it &apos;s 44 meters .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAs , so you can see the proportions .
Ten September 10 sectity , we have accested the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was because of immense of festegues in control .
It &apos;s an image of the first phasm of particles who had all over the LHC , and entering in collision , with a part of the LHC , and diffon-land-up , and spread particles inside the resevator .
In other words , when we see that image 10 sector , we could see the car works , we knew that machine was a great vitting .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to make us exultent of more or this , when somebody went on Google and he saw that the page was this .
That means we had a cultural impacts to that scientific impacts .
And he &apos;s a week later , there was a problem with the car , and it had to these phils here -- these dored .
These phils bring 13,000 friends when the car works at the holds of power .
Now , the technicians between you will look at the phils and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . I &apos;m too good . &quot;
And instead they can do it because when they &apos;re very cold , they can be the surface .
So , at less 271 degrees , at a hundred temperature in the way between the stars , these phils can bring that running .
In one of the younger than the novemila in the LHC , there was a fect of fabrication .
So the phils surprising up , and 13,000 friendly , and the 13,000 ampitches improvises .
This was the result .
Now , this is still more impressive if you think these magnetes fishing more than 20 tons .
They are damages about 50 magnetes .
We had to take them , what we did .
We repristined them and traveled .
Now they &apos;re coming back all the substantially in their sub-place .
The end of marzo , the lHC is will be new integrip .
We will happen it , and we expect to get data to get the data or light , and continue our adventure to discover what we &apos;re going to try to find out what the morning is the universe .
Now , of course , in a squeway , these accidents reaccount on the value of science and engineering in frontier of the frontier of the frontier .
I think that the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact of go beyond , I think this is the value of things like LHC .
I &apos;d like to end with the words of a Inglese scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , imagine , I &apos;m imagined to the experiments of his pilller , his pupiler , he said , &quot; Nothing is so dangerous for the respect of the human mind , he said , &quot; Nothing is so dangerous for the human mind that the ideas of science that the ideas of define , which our tries are not in nature , and that our tric tric , and that are tines that are tape in the conquires . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to rethink about when , from children , please , you play caves .
As you get to them and graphs , take them and get them , take them and move them , learned , and you know , actually , and you know , realize problems .
The space is deeply connected to the way we understand the way we understand part of the world around us .
So , from the information of our interaction with physicists of our interaction with physicists , and my holders Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking me , &quot; And if , when we use a computer , and I started asking me , &quot; And if we use a wind computer , we could have the only to the swital , we could make the sure of the digital information with the hands , we could actually bring the hands , we could actually deal with the hand ,
and systemars our placement ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , and build the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer interactive , like a biscoom computer .
In a few words , a Siftable computer interactive , like a biscoom computer .
You can move them with the hand , you can see , &quot; you can see &quot; between them , &quot; and they have a screen and a radio and a radio .
But above , they &apos;re physicists , like the morning , you can just move them .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools for manipulating the digital information .
And as physical becoming more physicists , consciousness of other people , and as as a more physical mine , who become more physical , of other people , how we can explore new things and fun fun fun fun in the other , and we can explore new interaction .
I &apos;m going to start with a few example .
This Siftable is configurated to show you the video : if you cline in a direction , the video will rotate so , if you cline from the other hand back .
These are interactive of other people .
If you go up , you know , they &apos;re interested in .
If they come circumstates , they can act a little bit .
If they come circumstates , they can act a little bit .
They also trust their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the potential to use common data , &quot; to be a liquid . &quot;
In this case , we have three Siftable , as a century of the versor in the hundred of the color in the bottom , where they missing .
I can use them to grew up in the central , where they missing .
If we &apos;re going to be too , we can put a little place .
I &apos;m also beautiful possibilities of learning , like languages , mathematics and games of logic where people can try to try to try and see the results of the results , and see the immediately .
Now I &apos;m --
This is a sequence of Fibonaces that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a game of words that is half between Scarabeo and Bobs .
Pratically , in every Sift-foot , in a case on every Siftable , in a case , in any Siftable , and you &apos;re trying to do a letter on every Siftable , and you try to comport her on a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds remissing , and you have a new letters of letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the kids came to the Media Lab , I did so that I was so that I tried them and turned a video .
They &apos;re very , very , very , very ,
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
You just say , &quot; Let &apos;s say , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s what other people who try it .
This is our bigger tester tester tester , there on the right .
And he actually wanted to implement them .
They were just morning .
Now , this is an application of a interactive carton .
We wanted to build a tiny for learning languages . He &apos;s Felix .
It can put the new characters in the scene , sunning the Siftable .
It can put the new characters in the scene , sunning the Siftable .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : The sun is surprising .
David Merrill : Now he took a treatment in the scene .
Video : The arange treatment .
Boob ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes . Yes ! Yes . Yes ! Yes . Yes ! Yes ! Yes
So schooling the Siftable and put them close to the characters --
Video : Bau !
And by inventing their history .
Video : Hiao !
DM : It &apos;s a story with the open-final history , and he can decide him as you get .
DM : It &apos;s a story with the open-final history , and he can decide him as you get .
Video : Vola on , cat .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , realized recently , to waiting and exequiet music .
it &apos;s a tool , realized recently , to walk and exeguide music .
Siftable here are agenda sounds like base , and the bacteria .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose which use .
You can also put sounds in a sequence of sounds in a sequence of your placement .
And modify it just takes a sound of sound and a sequence . &quot;
These are effects that you can control from the vive , like the reversity and the filter .
The drop on a particular sound and then clines to get it .
And then there are the general effects like time and volume , which are applples to the whole sequence .
Let &apos;s look at how it works .
Video : We will start to start to put a base in two Siftable , &quot; sequence , we &apos;re going to be a series , we extend to the other basic .
Now I &apos;m going to put a basis line .
Video : Now I add of percussions --
Video : And now I &apos;ll put the phild to the battery , so I can control the effect from the vive .
Video : I can speed the entire sequence inating the entire sequence from one side or the other .
Video : And now I &apos;ll add the phild to get the full of the best to dget more expression .
Video : I can realize the sequence . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to plane it before , but I can sudden , it &apos;s longer to make it longer .
And now , finally , I can just sfly the entire sequence inating the entiftable to the left Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is built new man &apos;s faces of the machine and more than the brain work and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the result of this loss , and also some possibilities that we try to bring out out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that &apos;s coming up with this new generation of desigdesigns to interact with digital media media , that will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time I &apos;m going to talk to all of you .
I &apos;m a written .
The books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than this , obviously .
It &apos;s also the love and the fascine of my life .
And I don &apos;t expected that he can change .
But , said this , something particular happened by my life , and in my career , and in my career , who took me to realibrating the whole relationship with this job .
The particular thing is I recently wrote this book , this biography called Mangia , Prua , Ama , &quot; which , a lot of course , my fabulous reason , for some reason I &apos;m going to be a big , in the world and become a great , sensitive , nice .
And the result is that everywhere where the wonderful now , people treat me as if I was condanced .
Davignore -- condanned , condannated .
They &apos;re going to me to be concerned and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t fear more ?
You don &apos;t have to continue to continue for all of life without power without power , and you can make a book that makes someone important ? &quot;
Why can it important to somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s sassuring , you know .
But I could go worse , in part of that I remember more than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a written .
I was going to move to the same reaction based by the pure .
And people would say , &quot; I don &apos;t theme I don &apos;t feel I &apos;m going to get ?
You don &apos;t fear that the humiliation of the refer ?
You don &apos;t have to do this all of life without any living in all of life without any of the none of them , and die on a cumulo of all infrank-filled fallimb ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I have a painting of all those things .
I always had a couple .
And I also have a lot of other things that people could not to inside .
As the algae and other things .
But , as much as I think about what I was , and I &apos;m totally , I &apos;m saying , because ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logic that anyone who debbblows to be spavented by a job that you feel like ,
But what is so particular in the imprising creative to make us nervous about mental health , as a way that other chareter &apos;t ?
As my father , for example , he was a chemicals and I don &apos;t remember one once in his 40 years of activity in which he was asked if he was asked if he was crazy to be able ?
There was never -- that -- that was a little bit of the John engineer , how he goes ?
Not worked , you know , you know , you know ?
Onestly , the chemicals like group have no , in the centuries , in the centuries , in the secreputation of being alcolized holized holized manized hydropping .
We have a writers , we have enough this reputation , and not only writers , but creative of all gender , we have this reputation of being enormous instailable .
And it &apos;s not going to look at the other one that looks at the connects of the magnific ments , only in the 21st century , died young people died young and often for hand .
And the ones that are not suicidated seems to be really dismanmanaged by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , &quot; Every my book killed a little bit more . &quot; A extraordinary food killed a little bit more . &quot;
But we don &apos;t bad it when we heard this because we heard these things so long that we &apos;ve been interior , we &apos;ve been interior and acceptent the notion that creativity and suffering the creativity , and the art , it will always conduce to the cord .
And the question I want to take all of the today is : are you agree with this idea ?
I &apos;m going to you to do this , because even looks from a distance of distance to me , not good for anything that suppose .
I think it &apos;s odiosa .
And I think it &apos;s also perpetuated and I don &apos;t want to see it perpetuated in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encouraging our big minds of creative minds .
And I know that , in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start figing that heard of suppositions , surately , I &apos;m going to be a circumstances in which I &apos;m in my career .
Of course -- I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I have still about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything I &apos;m going to be right now in the world as the work that &apos;s used to be in the way , and the later my last book .
I &apos;m going to be slums , because we &apos;re all more or less friends here -- likely that my biggest success is to my spouse .
Oh , Gesus , who think I was !
You know this is the kind of thinking that that brings a person to start to get a person to start blowed in the nine morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would keep going to keep this work that we .
So , the question becomes , how do it ?
And so I &apos;m like , after a lot of reflective reflective , which is to create a psychological construct , right ?
I have a few way to find a distance of security between me , who I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxiety of what reaction is going to get to get the huge scored on how to do it , how to do it , and I &apos;m trying to see through time , trying to find out of time , trying to find out of the best ideas and more sane and more sances and more saneholds and more several ides more sitely , and more sent holding on what reaction is .
how to help people create creative to deal inerent the inerent inerents of creativity .
And that research to me to the ancient Grex and ancient Rome .
I &apos;m guitemes because I play in a circle and then come back .
In the ancient Grex and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that the creativity came from men , OK ?
It was thinking that creativity was this spirit of divine and sell men from a few slights and known men from a few distant and sackage , for distant reasons and known .
The greatest called these beyond the divity of creativity . &quot;
Socrate , wonderful , created a demon that was wisdom of the wisdom .
The Roman was the same idea , but they called the kind of the spirit without a genius .
The great thing , because the Romans didn &apos;t think that a genius was a particularly smart .
They had a genius was this kind of divine entity , which was a kind of a kind of literally in the walls of a artist , a little bit like Dobby , and that came out of assisted to assistance the work of the hidden artist and model the result of that work .
Here &apos;s ethal -- this is the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological costruth that protection from your work .
And everybody knew that was so that it worked , right ?
So the antice antidies were protected by certain things , like , for example , the too much narcism , no ?
If your work was exceptional job , you couldn &apos;t take all the market , everybody knew that you helped by this genius encourage .
If your fallies , it wasn &apos;t all the time , it wasn &apos;t all the time ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a inable .
And so people have concept the creativity in the West for a long time .
And then the Rink came and everything changed , and everything changed , and nacize this great idea ; we put the human being at the misteras and not to least leaving in the misteries and not to the creatures that they wrote from the divinity .
This was the rational principle of human humanesimum and people started to think that creativity came from the ishdividity .
And for the first time in history , you started to refer to this or the one of the genius as to a genius with genius .
And I have to say , I think it was a big error .
I think that allow somebody , a simple person to believe that I &apos;m like a deep deep , the essence and the surprising of all mysteries , creatives , creatives , and ethernnal and ethernal and ethernal human beings .
It &apos;s like to ask someone to get the sun .
Deform and completely behind the ego and creates all of these expectations on performance .
And I think it was this pression to destroy the artists in the past 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it &apos;s , and now it &apos;s a question of it , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe to be back to a understanding more than the relationship between human and mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t sing 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there is probably people between the audience that would have a bunch of scientific supply about the notion of , you know , you &apos;re going to follow people to do happen ,
I &apos;m not going to convince you all about this .
But the question I &apos;d like to ask is -- why not ?
Why don &apos;t I think that way ?
Because it &apos;s more sense of everything that has ever heard to explain the exasperant impredicbility of process .
A process that , as anyone who ever ever ever though I &apos;ve ever been excited to do something -- it &apos;s not a rationally , you don &apos;t get a rationally .
And , in fact , it can be completely paranormal .
I did this meet recently with the extraordinary poetched , Ruth Stone , who now 90 years , but it was a few of the lives and he said , I was a few of life and he said , in the Virginia , working out in the camps , and he heard it , in the wells , when a poem to the landscape .
He said that he was like a fragorous slums .
And he was coming towards her from the landscape .
He was going to be , because he was tremendous , because he was tremendous of his feet .
He knew he was to have one thing to do to that point and it was , &quot; running like a math . &quot;
And so he was going to go to home and he was willing this poem , and he would not have to make a piece of card and a faster faster enough , and a fast faster it on the page .
Sometimes he didn &apos;t be fast , so correct and correct reversing and correct reverse would come in home and the poetry and the loss , and he would continued to roll through the landscape , looking for , as he said , &quot; one other poet . &quot;
And there was a few times -- this piece I &apos;m never going to expensive -- there was a moment in which the statement , right ?
So , he was running home and he was trying to card and the poem through , and he would go through , and he would go through a math in the way that he was going , and he said , that was like the other hand and the watching hand the offered it .
He was cought the poem of the tail and he was page in his body and he was going to the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfectly perfectly , but the last word on the top of the first word on the top .
So when I heard it -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly exactly the same thing in my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conduction .
I &apos;m a mess , and my way of work is ; I &apos;m wake up at the same time every day and play and go to work and go on and go on it and go out and go on it .
But even I was in my testardages , I stripped that thing , sometimes .
And I &apos;m also imagined that many of you .
You know , even though the work and ideas were giving me from a certain source of the source I could not be as onesestimate .
And what is this ?
And how can we relationship us to not make us lose the head , but , rather , rather , what do you get healthy ?
And as I think about , the best example I have is the best example I have is the Musician musician , which I interviewed in a nice day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life has been the incarnation of the artist &apos;s returned to control , trying to control , to try to control , to move these species of impulses of totally interiorized impulses .
But then he invested , he was driving , and one day as he was driving on a highway in L.A. , he changed everything .
He was going to be fast and all of a sent sent , this is a little bit of melodies , who comes in his head like ispiration , elusive , elusive , and the holds , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the desidency , and the desidency , but not knowing how to take it .
It doesn &apos;t have a paper , it doesn &apos;t have a cut , he doesn &apos;t have a cut .
So he starts to feel this species of anxiety anxion , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;ll remark up up by this characters .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to the panic , he stopped .
I &apos;m going to put the whole mental process and made something new .
And I &apos;m going to look at the sky and said , &quot; Scause , not see I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; You know , it seems to write a song right now ?
If you really want to exist , you get back to a more huge moment when I can take care of you .
Altriments , you go to important someone else today .
You know , Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his work worked in this .
Not work was still hard as well as I always .
But the process , and the weighing anxiety that was reeded when he was prised when he was pressed to him when he was caused to be able to realize it , and liberry it was realizing it , and realizing it was realized and realized .
but it was wonderful , wonderful , wonderful collaboration , a conversation between Tom and this external thing that was not Tom .
And so I heard that story started to change a little bit of how I was working in which I was working , and he saved me .
This idea , I was saved when I writing , &quot; Manway , Ama , &quot; and Ama , &quot; and fall in one of those disaster of the desperation where we &apos;re working on and we can &apos;t start thinking that it &apos;s going to be a disaster , which is going to be the worst book , which is going to be the worst book .
Not only book , the worst book wrote .
And I started thinking about that project .
But then I remember of Tom who talked to the air and I tried to the air and I tried us .
So I went up my face and I go into my face and I would say I have a handbunch of the room .
And I said , &quot; Senent , &quot; Senent , what , we know , if this book won &apos;t be brilliant not be bright ?
because I &apos;m seeing us all I have , not more than this .
So if you want to be better , you have to present you and do your part .
Okay . But if you don &apos;t , you know what , I don &apos;t do it .
I &apos;m going to go to write the same because it &apos;s my job .
And I &apos;d like to do for my hundred that I today , I was presented to do my part , &quot; because , at the end is so , OK -- in the desert of Africa in North Africa , the people would go to the sloth of the sliterally , dancing and hours to the alone of hours and until hours to the alone .
And they were always magnific , because the ballers were professionals and were fantastic .
But every time , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists to become in .
And I know you know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know you have all , in a certain point , a performance .
It was like time , if the time , and the walerin a kind of portal branches , and he wasn &apos;t doing anything about sunnest , as the 1,000 notes before , but everything was all hallery .
And sudden not appeared as a human .
But it turns out from the ded-under illuminated in the divinity of divinity .
And when this was happening , to the time , people knew what was , they were called him with her named .
They were handing the hands and started sing , &quot; Allah , God , Allah , God , Allah , God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curiosa historic night -- when the More invass the Spain , I was asked this habits and pronounce changed in the centuries from Allah , , Allah , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Oh , &quot; Oh , &quot; Oh , &quot; Oh , &quot; Oh , &quot; Oh , &quot; Oh , I still can still feel in the flamenco .
In Spain , when an artist did something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , I said , &quot; Allah , magnific , &quot; I can understand , &quot; incomprehensible , it &apos;s a God .
And it &apos;s great because we need .
But , the problem is coming down the day , for the day , when you see , and you see that there are the 11 in the morning of Martedituitude and I &apos;m going to be the 11 in the morning of God , there &apos;s no longer .
It &apos;s just a death with a big bad to the ginockyia , and maybe never to be able to ask that along .
And maybe nobody &apos;s the name of God , and what is it to do with his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most porous recognizes to make a life life .
But maybe not to be so angosciciciating if you can &apos;t believe , anzythutes , which the most extraordinary expected in your own being come from you .
But created , just that you get you data in a sudden from a unimaginable source of the squiet of your life you have to go to something else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think that way everything changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s because of course , as I thought I was for different months in the book that I &apos;m going to be a huge , the performance , exactly , exactly , exactly the dangerous success .
And what I have to keep me when I &apos;m electrized by this is , not to have .
Not bear . It &apos;s just your work .
It &apos;s going to present you for your part , any one can be .
If your work is balling , ball .
If the wind , absorbed you decide to leave some kind of wonderful kind of wonderful , for one moment through your effort , so you go through your wonderful , then ! &quot;
Altriments , you do the same dance .
And &quot; OOOOle it ! &quot;
I think you have to teach it .
&quot; Hime ! &quot; &quot; to you , only have had to love and human test later , and test tape tops that you &apos;re going to be living .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
You know , I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects on human genome , on what can meaning and the new genes of genes .
Now we &apos;re starting a new perspective : we started digitalize biology and now talks to that digital code we &apos;re both in a new phase of biology , designing and synthesizing life .
We always tried to ask big questions .
&quot; What &apos;s life ? &quot; It is something that many biologists I think they &apos;re trying to figure out out of livels .
We tried a different approaches , reducing it to the minimes .
We &apos;re digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome is going to be treating from the analogic world world of digital world .
Now , we ask us : can we regenerate life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smaller genome that they can authority in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome to create one more smaller .
We are able to eliminate a hundred of genes about 500 that are here .
But when we have a look at his meabolic map , it &apos;s relatively to our .
Cretaining me , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it &apos;s very iminvolved that this can take a living cell of living .
So , we decided that the only way to design was synthesize this chromosome in a way that we could modify the components to bring some of these questions of the fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of the Pan &quot; we synthesize a croma ? &quot;
Can chemistry to make these big molecules that we never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever , in fact , we never could create before ?
And in case , we can make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a chemical piece of inert material chemical material .
The speed that we are able to digitalize life is growing up to exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , instead , instead , but it &apos;s improving .
And our most recent recent recent return to a exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process has been asked a lot of past , starting with a bioetics revision before the first experiments .
But we discovered that DNA very difficult .
There are decades of thousands of machines in the world that produces of DNA , the long-wisdom process , and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the more floor is a longer process : the more herrors there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments and running the herrors .
And this was our first attempt , to go from digital information of the genome of Phi &apos;s genome of Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills kills .
We have designed the fragments , effectively the rors of the errors and get a molecule of DNA about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material chemical material chemical material , the bacteria , the bacteria , the bacteria have started to read this genetic and producing the viral particles .
The viral particles are then you stand up from the cells , they &apos;re going back and they destroy the E.
I &apos;ve talked about recently with the oil industry of oil industry , and they have certainly compress this model .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build his hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the larger .
We wanted to build the whole croma of the bacteria .
They &apos;re more than 580 medies of genetic code .
So we thought we build it in cassesses of virus , so that we could change casses the casses to understand what the components of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accurateful standard was a herror for every 10 mile bases .
We found out , we had a mistake , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence we never would be able to do it .
One part of the process is designing sectity , and you know , 50 letters that they have to all the other segments of 50 letters to build substantiity , and the smaller toward .
We can see a single elements here .
You probably have read that we put us on the phone .
So , I think that we have a genetic code based on four letters : A , C , C , Gs and T.
Three of those letters together code about 20 amminacids , and there &apos;s a specific order to letters for every love .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frash , thought-hand-house code .
What we did in the beginning was selself-it .
Some of them were deluses from the fact that it wasn &apos;t a poem .
We designed these segments to just get them to just bring them up with a fentire fun .
There are full them and put them assigns and put them assigns .
And we started assembly assembly by the parts , starting with seven from five to seven meet , and unclean up to swallows 24 mediats letters to come to 72 meet .
We have produced these segments in abundance so we can set them as as a sequency , we &apos;re trying to create a very robust , extremely robust -- as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems to be a basket play-basket play-basket .
When we get these very long , much more than 100 midle , more than 100 midle , they won &apos;t grow up in E.
It comes to the limit of the modern tools of molecular biology .
So we looked at other mechanisms .
We knew of another mechanism called a homology , which in biology , in biology , which is used to repull DNA can can be able to put the segments .
Here &apos;s an example .
This is organism , called Deinoccurs , it can make three million rad rad .
You can see in the superior as his chromosome as his crazy becomes distruted .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s reassembled exactly like it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can do it completely .
They can live under the vacuum .
I &apos;m absolutely sure life in space , and you &apos;re moving in space , and you can find new environments .
As the real , NASA showed that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule we &apos;ve built this processed , just using the lievening of the segments to put .
The lievil lights assembly .
This image was not taken with a electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a tiny totally big that we can see it with a microscope .
These are photograph that they cover a six seconds .
This is the published we did a little bit of time ago .
They &apos;re 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the biggest molecule of a definitely ever created by man .
It &apos;s a weight sprints to 300 million .
If we stamp it with a career for a 142 pages , they would like 142 pages to transcriting this genetic code .
Now , how do we do it ?
Of course , you can see a virus is a little bit from kids .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when you use the bacteria .
It &apos;s simplest when it &apos;s cells as well as it is cells as as our : you can just extractly extractly the nucleo and put another , which is practically the clonically process of cloning .
In the herself , the archaea is integrated by the model , but we &apos;ve recently demonstrated that we &apos;re able to do a complete traph of a birth of a cell cell from one cells to one other and activating it .
We had a microbial chromosome from a microbial species .
The two are different as well as men from the topes .
We &apos;ve added some gene in a way that we decide what he choose for this croma .
The slide with the full entives in a way to kill all proteins .
And when we put it in the cells was study -- and you &apos;ll open-free our graph graph -- the new croma -- the new croma .
And we started to do that we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we have tried to go more in there .
This is one of the most evolution ecchanisms of evolution .
We found that many of these species have added species have added a second or a third or a third , add in a second thousands of new ones , adding to that species .
So who think about evolution as a only gene at the time that you have no grains of biology .
There are a scientist , called the me , the full of restrial restrial of what they &apos;re going to digerize the DNA .
The croma that was in the cell of it doesn &apos;t have one .
The cell phone that we have inserit-s-on that we have inserious .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other croma , like extraneous material , and we found it with only cells and the new cell .
it became blue because of the genes we &apos;ve inseriously .
And in a short lassides of time , all the characteristics of a species have been loss , and you &apos;ve turned out all over in a new species , based on the new satives , we put in the cells .
All the proteins are changed , membranes are changed , and when we realize the genetic code balance code on what we &apos;ve transfer .
Now , this might seem to be genetic altering , but altering the software DNA , we can change things in a way way we can change things in a lot of the way .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that you don &apos;t talk about genesius -- but I have to go from three million years and a half million years and a half evolution , and I &apos;ve already said that maybe , we &apos;re going to create a new version of this digital process about this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s enough to when we think about our necessity .
We &apos;re going to spend six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to give you an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946 , in 46 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find food , fresh water and pulitital , medicinal and medicinal well-medicinal well-medicinal well-medicinal walking water and a half a half billion people .
It &apos;s still going to be more dare doing it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion measures , more than 30 billion bars , more than 30 billion barils .
That means millions of barils a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replaces , it will be a huge challenges .
We have to have a holding all the time of CO2 emission from these materials that ends up in the atmosphere .
At the day of the scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they are the design components for the future .
The electronic industry is only a dozen thin about components , and think about how many different things come out .
Our limits here are principlally from biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , because of these synthesids of synthesization , able to create what we call a combinatory .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can make a big robot that can make a million croms a day .
Think about these 20 million genes of different genes or to try to get the processes to make the processes to make the processes , or new vaccines , we can change , as a little theam , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standards .
We can choose for possibilities , chemistry , chemistry or carbon , production of vaccines .
This is a few satif-based software programmed on which we &apos;re working for being able to sit and design species to computing .
Well , we don &apos;t know it necessarily as they will be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
Now we &apos;re focused on the carbon of quarter generation .
You also saw you that extractly from the grain of the grain was a very finished experiment .
We have a second and third generation that will use enough to the hythter-horse value , like the either or different types like the either or different types of butaneous butanol .
But the only way that biology can have a big impacts without increasingly increase the cost of food and limitarian availability would be transform CO2 in matery , which we &apos;re working to design cells that we &apos;re working to design cells that can reach this , and we think we can have this scale , and we think we can have the first carbon , and we think of the prints of how much food is about 18 months .
The solar solar combined with CO2 is a methodownload -- but in our discoveries in the world , we found different metodownload .
This is a organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , about 2500 meters of deep the deepness of the water temperature of the water .
It &apos;s from CO2 using hydrogen by CO2 using a molecular source of energy .
We &apos;re trying to figure out if we can ink CO2 , which can be easily being transported through your bes , converting that CO2 in charcoal , to drive this process .
So we think we might be able to be able to be able to increase what the basis that the basis that life is , &quot; We have the focused . &quot; We have the foot , we have the modest fit to replease the whole oil industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , you can &apos;t do it from TED , you can &apos;t you do it from TED , you can &apos;t do it from TED , you can &apos;t do that from TED , you can &apos;t do it from TED , you can &apos;t be sactly . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , you can &apos;t do it from TED , you can &apos;t do that from TED , you can &apos;t do that from TED , you can &apos;t do that from TED , you can &apos;t do
It would be a main the kind of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working for using the same methods to create vaccines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with influence , we &apos;re always behind a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s going to be the right .
I think that what you can can change it build vaccines in anticype .
That &apos;s how the future could start to be changing , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating evolution , accelerating evolution , herating the hometics , and then eucariote eucarian .
We are so much from the improving people .
Our goal is to make a way of living enough enough to try to try to make it . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the most fundamental work , some fundamental work , the new technology that we took to Microsoft in the follow-a-quiet , this is Seady guess .
It &apos;s a environment that you can interaction is at the local level that remote with an enormous amount of visual data .
Here we &apos;re seeing a lot of digital photos with a kind of digital photos with a kind of digital zoo-oxide , dispond , depending on images , as we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these data or the images .
Most of the photographs , but this is a lot of digital photographs , but this example is a suit of the Congress , and it &apos;s entering in the gamma of 300 megapiel .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that it &apos;s going to be a system like this is the number of plxel on your screen in your screen in any time .
This is a whole book , you don &apos;t images .
This is the Casa desolate of Dickens . Every colonnurses a capital .
To show you that it &apos;s about heads and not images , we can make a kind of thing like this , to see that it &apos;s a real representation of the heads , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a little bit to read a book book .
It doesn &apos;t look at the time .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s a more realistic example . The Guardian .
Every big images is the beginning of a sea .
And it really gives you the pleasure and beauty experience of a reversion of a revision of a juggle or a daily drawings , which is for nature a lot of medium .
We also did something with the angle of this number particular number of the Guardian .
We &apos;ve created a fasull fasull resolures -- much more higher than that you use in a normal publishment -- and we put you on the extra published .
If you want to see the characteristics of this authomobile , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really is showing some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that this means to put the pop-up and other non-like switch , they wouldn &apos;t need to be .
Naturally , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don &apos;t want to lose time , if we don &apos;t say that we have contributed to this camp .
These are all the streets in the U.S. . Sovrappost-holds of NASA .
So , we go to something else .
This is actually actually from the website ; you can go to the web ; you can see .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
A is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting search in Noah Soah Soah , a student in the University of Washington , with the aid of Steve Seitz of U.S. of the UW and Rick Seliski &apos;s a very collaboration .
And it &apos;s from the website , drawings from Seady guess .
You can see that when we do this kind of screen , where we can spend from one picture to the other and have this kind of experience in the other way .
But the space collocation of the images here has actually a meaning .
The signature of the computer visualization have recorded these images together , so that they correspond to the real place where the imaging imaging -- all the closes that imaginian -- all the closes to the laghot , the Roccious Montagne Roccial Montagne Rockcial Montagne Rockets , and these things are all the space level , and these things are all the space level .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are much more space .
I want to go to one of the original set of Noah-h--- and this is from a Photosynth Photosynth prototynth , we have done for the first time , the last time , the first time , to show you what I think is really the key behind this technology , Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily the key behind this technology , the website .
We had to worry about legal and so on .
This is a rebuildings of Nothththin Nothththin Dothers . Bauckr Do Flickr Din Flickr and you get images of types in magic magic , others and so on . Egnal one of these connections that are discovered a picture that &apos;s discovered .
So I &apos;m all images from Flickr and you &apos;ve been all collected to space .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate way , we can just .
You know , I wasn &apos;t I thought I &apos;d ever thought I was going to work for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratificant to requires this kind of account here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of different types of fotams , from those professional cellular phone to those professional professional cellular , in this environment .
And if I can , try and try and try to try and look for the more strange .
Most are blown by faces , etc .
Some of the photographs of photographs -- etc .
This is a Nothththin Nothththin Drecorrectly .
We can go from the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do with social environment . This is now taking data from yet , from the entire collective memory of how the land , from visual point of view -- and they connected all those data together .
All those photograph become lined , most of the parts of the parts .
You have a model of the entire land .
Think about this as a proling at the proling of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as a hand that people use it , and the advantages for who uses to use it .
Their photos are married with other people .
If someone comes to the idea of contrast to all these several several several , my picture of Noththers , Noththers of Nothththin , and I can use how to ingress as a point of inground , and I can use as a three-scale methetathmic , using photos of anyone , and having a social experience of the kind of cross-model , and have a social experience of the kind of class and cross-mooth social experience of anyone , and I &apos;m like a chosen chosososososen s-model of the namp ,
Naturally , a consequence of all of this are very very elaborate , extremely elaborate , collected not only from airplanes and satellitarians and satellitarians and satellitarians , but from collective memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand what your software ? What your software will contained us to do is that in a certain point , in the next years , all the photographs shared by anyone in the world will be going to be reading together ?
BA : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is to discover .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of the sea of wish information that many of these images are possible .
As when you make a research of images on the web , you get a sentence and the heb on the web page has a lot of information about the picture .
Now , what happens if that photograph you collect all your pictures ?
So the amount of the amount of interconnections and the amount of wealth that &apos;s really huge . It &apos;s a classic effect . It &apos;s a classical effect .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible .
BA : Thank you very much .
One of the main pleases when you travel and one of the ethnographic research power is the power to live between who has never forget the antic lives between who have never forget the past in the wind , the touching in the floats , the touching in the floating , the roats , is the landscape of plants .
Baste me to think that Jaguar Jaguar , still the Viia Lattea , or that the Mians are still still connected to me , or Himalaya , or in Himalaya , the buddddrop , the good good bang , remember the importance of the central central central , and the idea that the world in which we live in the world that we live in a living , but it &apos;s just a model , but it &apos;s just a model , but it &apos;s just a model , but it &apos;s just a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stirs made , good or mal , but a lot of generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential .
All right . We all do . We all procreating .
We are subjects in the beginning of initiation .
We have to death the inexorability of death , so it doesn &apos;t surprising us if we go and ballie --
We all have a lot of art .
What collights is the third of cancer , the rhythm of every culture .
Not that they are the Penan anests of the Borneo , or the followed Vooo , or the Phert Kenya , or the desert Kenya , the Curnitis , or a settle in the Sahara , or a cameler in the Sahara .
He was my journey of my journey in the desert a month ago , or a hallevator of yak in the values of the world .
All of these populations teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of wonderful moves in the world .
And , if you reflected a moment that can give you hope .
Insive , the cultures of the world creates a nature of spiritual life and cultural cultural life that has been important for the benefits of the planet as as a biosphere , as a biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural girl as a nosphere , and you can call the ethnosphere , the total eal result of all the concepts , hythrow , ideas , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions brought up .
The ethnosphere is the fantastic patrimonioning .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how inquisitive species .
And because the biosphere was graveled consumed , as it happened to the ethnosphere and unfortunately quickly .
No biologist , for example , would say , 50 percent of all species has been on the horgets of all species has been on the extinction , or in the most apocalitting in the highest hypothesis in the highest hypothesis in the most hypothesthesis -- that &apos;s not also near in the most optimistic diversity .
The whole thing is , of course , is , of course , the loss of the loss .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only composed by a vocabulary or a series of rules .
A language is the spray of human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle with the animal of every culture is coming in in the material world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a bind , a bin-mind , a slide of spiritual possibility .
And those 6,000 languages , as we are sitting in Monterey , at least the half is not used in the earth of children .
They don &apos;t come to the children , who want to say , unless you watch , less you won &apos;t wonderful , which are already dead .
What is the most sad of the slenced from the silence , the last one , the last one , the last one , not have a way to be the wisdom of the wisdom or to anticipate the promise of the children ?
This is horring is the somewhere in the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks : the last labs of a language .
And I know somebody who will say , &quot; Isn &apos;t that ?
The world would be no place if we talk all the same language ? &quot; Benish hish , then we all talk all the time . We all talk about the song .
We talk about it .
You &apos;re going to try to be a sudden thing to say , not to talk about their language .
Now , I &apos;d like to do you have a journey through ethnosphere --
a little journey in the ethnosphere for what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us of dimenting that when I say , &quot; different ways of exists , &quot; I really mean , I really different ways of exists .
We take for example this Barasana Barasana , in Amazon , Amazon , the population of anaconda , who creates to the myth of the lats of the lats of the lats of the lats of the lats of the lats of the latts of the lats of the food food , the population of the latts of the lat
It &apos;s a population that &apos;s not in able to distinguished the blue color , because the cell is identified in the time of forest , which depends the population .
They have a strange language and a mathorrial , detail , detail language , &quot; : you have to move a person who talks about a person who talks about a different language .
All this has been saying in the mythological past , yet the particularly , in these families that are talking about six or seven languages , seven languages .
They limited to listening and then they start to talk .
We take one of the most interesting tribe with which I lived with which I lived , the Waoran Eastern Eastern Eastern Eastern Ph.C.
In 1957 , five missionaries have attempt a comfortable contact .
They did come from the photographs that they had had never seen up with their own friends that they had had had had had never seen the bi-sive pluvial forest had never seen anything in bi-dimensional forest .
They collect the pictures from the ground , they turn them to the research of a shape or a shape , they have conclosed it , and they killed the five missionaries with the lance .
But Waorans don &apos;t just killed the straniests .
They killed between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by their own .
We &apos;re risalites at eight generations and we found two of natural death homes and when we insisted to know , they have had that one of them was invecting , and then killed it . They killed it . Really every way , they had a very unknown knowledge of forests .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine from 40 step and recognizes the species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned a very interesting compiece of my Harvard professor , I was assigned if I wanted to go to Haiti to intrue in the secret of the power of Dualier and Tonton Macinside the fast of the fast , and I got me about the fast of the fast fast fast , and I imposed to the zombie of the fast fast ,
To give a sense to the myraculous , I should have to understand the Vodoun and that Voice , and that Voodoo is not magnera .
It &apos;s pretty much a physics of a physics of the world .
Most interesting .
If I asked you to tell me about the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no religious feelings . And instead , he was not religious , and Vooo is not other than the distilled of these very deeper in the ground , in the tragic religious .
What makes the voodoo is the intense report is the intense report between life and death .
So , the vive are naked .
The spirits can be invoccurred by the Great Acqua , and they replace to the rid of the dance and replaced temporary the soul of the vive .
So , you know , you can say , &quot; You can go to the wonderful God , you go to walk up to God .
We give in the temple and become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re playing , is the spirit that you , how can you get you from you , how can you get you from the bad ?
So you &apos;re asking these incredible events : the wonderful events in state of the world that touches ines infuels infuels , infurid of the mind on the body when it &apos;s probably about the body when it &apos;s probably about the body when it &apos;s catalyzed .
I was all the people with which I lived the most extraordinary people are the Kogi of the Sierra Nevada in the Santa Marta , in Colombia .
It &apos;s becomes the tirannation that was a tuneased on the carairs of Colombia , the population of the Colombia , the population would be on the vulnery planture .
In a druged continent of blood , this population never been conquered by the spagners .
And I &apos;m government today I &apos;m government by a close , but their formation is really amazing .
The young people are taken away from the families to three or four years , and they live secrets in a bunch of the floor in the bain the basic bain the basic basic to 18 years .
Two periods of nine years , in the nine years of the nine months of gestation that transcorrunning into the user of the mother , now are metaphor , now are metaphor in the user of the Mther .
So , this time , they get acculate to the values of their society , values that they &apos;re pregnant and only their prayers and only their prayers to be the expenmic balance -- or for the balance .
At the term of this incredible initiation , they &apos;re suddenly taken out and for the first time in their own , 18 years , they see a high of the first bad bad , when the sunning sunning bullands , when the sunlight bulks the values of the beautiful llandscape . The precient plender is conmitted in his hundred , and says , &quot; The pres a behind a step behind and says , &quot; The pret a henters of the valence in the right basic washing a stats of the value of this .
&quot; Go ? Proprium , I said .
It &apos;s study . Now it &apos;s to you protect it . &quot;
They call the most most of them and say that we , frree them , fratelers , we are the pevolved in the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the Indigene and the environment , we invochid Reu and the old story of the vince of the noble nice , which is a razy concept in his simplicity or maybe , and we say these are the people are more close to the Earth of us .
Indigenes are not nor sentimental nor indebolites from the nostales .
There is no space for these things in the world in the Amer or the car in the winds of Tibet , but thank you to the time and rites , they created a mystic mystic war , the concept that the Earth is not about consciously , the concept that the Earth can only because it &apos;s flying as much as infused by the consciousness , because it &apos;s infused by the consciousness .
What does that mean ?
He mean , a little bit of the Ande who grow up the mountain is a Prit As , who will be a foundly human being a deeply different human being depped , and it will have a full full of a little bit different than a Montana who is growing up with a Montana who grow up with a Montana &apos;s a little girl of Montana who grow up to be scale .
Which is the degree of a spirit or a mineral cas it is irrelevant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Columbia credity , who creating that the forests were going to be cut .
And that I got me a different human from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that forests are the dancing of Hukuk and the song of the paradise and the song of the paradise and the song of the paradise , we will living in the northern , spirits that are in the north , the spirits that are in the Hamatory , and the spirits that are in the Hamats-f-foot of the Huk , and the song .
If you start to consider that these cultures can actually create a different reality , you can start to understand some of them sensationally sensationally . We take this planet .
I took this picture to open up in the norororoccasion .
Mayahuash , I &apos;m talking about the Eahuash , the most powerful support of the repertorium repertorio .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuash is not the potential pharmacological potential , but his elements . It &apos;s composed by two elements .
It &apos;s a huge , this lian leages that contains a series of homework , harming harments and harmful , slightly .
And by making the sun-plant smooth , you have a little bit of the consciousness , but it &apos;s mmeasures with a finger business of the family of the caffan family of the caffs of the caffected said ,
This is a contains powerful ptamines , very similar to serotonin the serotonin five , methoxyltryltryltryltryltryltrins .
If you ever see the Yanomami on for the nose to the sush that they do from a different species , which is methoxyltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltrink .
Tiring that pollus on the nose is a little bit like being disappears from a little bit of the diping pines and literally on a mess of electricity . Really . Really . Don &apos;t believe a distortion of reality .
I was often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who took the psychedelic , with his discovery of the fungi , with his discovery of the fungus in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in Mexico .
I &apos;m going to be a sunning of the country can &apos;t class these triptams like hallucinogens , because if you can &apos;t tell anybody to be absored . Second triptams can &apos;t be absorts of course , because I &apos;m money , I &apos;m sure , because I &apos;m money , I &apos;m sure of a funny that is , in the myin-ham-amine-oamine-hy-heroxidassidaseld .
It &apos;s possible to assumption with other chemicals who denatural chemicals who denatural chemicals who denaturing the MAs .
Now , the beautiful : the beauty of MAs , the same kind of MAs MAs , the same kind of necessary guys to be able to potential triptams . The expensive question : in a flexibules of plants , like these are , they &apos;re not in the way , but if you &apos;re going to be a kind of thing , but if you combined in this way , but if you do you do this , creating a way , but the parts ?
We use the great euphenemism of the herror , which can revealing infruit .
But if we ask in the Indians , they &apos;ll say , &quot; The plants talk about . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribes , Cofan , 17 variety of Eahuask , who distinguish netely in the forest , and that our eyes would come in the same species .
If we ask them how they stabilish their tass will tell us , &quot; I thought I was going to say , &quot; I didn &apos;t do everything ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you get 17 variety in a notice of the full and each one will song with a different song .
So , you don &apos;t laurea lot of Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting that country to contact the stams .
Now , &#91; &#91; &#91; applauses &#93; the problem is that even the ones that have to the diges are the homes , but in some way you get the margines of history respect in our world &apos;s history , and pass .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it will not remember for his wars or wats or innovations , but rather as the one was where we stopped and we have abuntivally activally or the passively of the cultural diversity and cultural various actively of the planet . Now the problem is not changing .
All the cultures were involved in a dance for new possibilities .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux , they don &apos;t stop Sioux when they put up in the arc and fast as Americans have no stopped to be American when they put up in the horse and calem .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that are mining the integrity of ethnosphere . It &apos;s the power .
The wall of domination .
And if you give you a look at the world , you &apos;ll discover that these are not cultures are destined to disappears .
They are living and living dynamics out of the hydamic existence that go out of hydamics that go beyond their ability to .
It &apos;s like the disboss in the patria of the Peninside of the Peninside of the think --
a population of Sarawak , in the Sarawak , a population who lived lived lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now reducing the next reducing and the next titution on the reserves of the figures , where you can see the physics , where you can see the Borneo Cinese Moresters , where the navilights , where the naves the Japanese Merion , where the Japanese horizonte , where you can see the navasize of the horial horial horial hores the hories , the hories , and the hores the hores the Japanese figugugugugugugugugu
and you have the stive stive stives with the wood law .
Or in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that are come with the discovery of the gold .
If we move on the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the right wall , you &apos;ll see the right right .
As the genocide , the physics of a population , is condannated in universal level , but the ethnium of living in a population of living , not only condannor condannor condanned , but also celebrated in certain environments , because it &apos;s part of the developing part of development .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of Tibet until until you go from the beginning .
I &apos;m going to have 6,000 miles from Chengu in the Western China in Western China , came to Lhasa with a young colleagues , but only came to Lhasa mer connection , but only came to Lhasa , I realize what &apos;s behind .
6,000 monuments sacred ress in the polluts and cens .
1.2 million people killed from the military Rivolution , Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascrited in Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed to the time in Chinese invasion .
It was a hundred with Sua Santity during the deaspora that has taken the people in Nepal .
His mother was imprisoned and his colpa was reich .
It was taken to hidden in carefs in the age of two nasy nails , because he wouldn &apos;t have living without him .
The sister , who did the same , was put in , in the field of result .
A day has inavvered a day , he was a fashion Mao and , for this transgression , was put in the seven years .
The Tibet of the Tibet can be insationally insent , but the reduced redentler .
At the end , everything reduce a choice .
We want to live in the world world world of the monotony , or we want to take the policromatical world of diversity ?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead , before we die said that his greatest fear was that , in our light-crazy , we &apos;re not just going to see the whole whole gamma of human imagination is going to be a modality , but a day we &apos;re going to see us from a sone-woot sleeping , but a day we &apos;re going to see us .
And it &apos;s uilant to remember that our species is existing for 60,000 years .
The Nolitics Rivolution , who given us the agriculture , who made us socket to the cult of the see , and he replaces the poem of the slim , creating the gerarchy of specific , creating the gerarchy of specialization , and we &apos;re talking about 10,000 years ago .
The industrialized modern world has about 300 years .
That &apos;s a history of history , I &apos;m not suggested that we have to go to all the challenges that we &apos;ll have to go .
When these cultures of the world is asked what it is to say to be human , they respond to to be human , they respond to 10,000 voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all return the possibility of being what we are : a kind of consciousness , which has to make that all the people and all the plans and all the garden . And there are great moments of optimism .
I took this picture on the north of Baffin , when I went to the hundred of the Baffin , when I went to the hundred of the hundred , and this man , and this man , he told me the story of her non-history .
The government was not always gentile with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s , and in the &apos; 50s , we have ink them in colonies .
The non-grandfather got to go .
The family , I &apos;m going to get his life , he brought her , and all his tune , and all his attractic .
You have to know that Inuit doesn &apos;t theme the cold , they don &apos;t feel the freezing .
The slites in origins were made of weighs were made of fish flows .
The non-asked this man doesn &apos;t get to move from the artica or from the blizard , or the blizard that was suffering .
It &apos;s saying out , you get up the balloons in the foca of foca and defense in its hand . When I did the fected , they &apos;re taking them , and they &apos;re taking a lama .
He was reading on the top of this caccount of this caccess , and when it was solid , he killed a dog .
He schooled the dog and created a bridge , with the house cassa sliter , he burn a sliter , he &apos;s burn a other dog , and it &apos;s disappears on the banchisa rest .
We want to talk about cavarsela with nothing ? ♫ ♫ And this , in different ways , Applauses , &#91; Applauss &#93; is the symbol of the resilience of the Indiges of all the Indigenes of all the Indigenes of all the Indiges of the world .
In the 1999 , the government of the government has reduced to the Inuit &apos;s a larger territorum of California and Texas I had together .
It &apos;s their new paths . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a territory territory . They &apos;re all the mineraries .
One of the example of how a nation-state nation-state , you know , he can recognize with his population .
And , finish , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious to at least who was in these walking zones of the planet , make it consumption that they don &apos;t have remote .
For somebody is house .
They are representing the human imagination that are allowing the time . And for us , the dream of these children , as the dreams of these children , as the lovers , become part of the wild of hope .
For finally , we are National Geographic , we &apos;re convince that politicians never arrivers .
We believe that polemy --
&#91; As &#93; &#93; &#91; As &#93; , &#93; we believe that the stories can change the world , and maybe we can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the best institution to tell stories about the world . Every month our site 35 million living .
156 countries our television .
Our revists seven from millions of people .
Our work is traveling in the ethnosphere to bring our public in the ethnostic wonderful , which will be hope as they saw and , hopefully , hopefully bringing the central reveal of anthropology : the world &apos;s market , and we need to find a style living in the diversity , and we need to find a style world , and we need to find a fashion and multicultural lives in the diversity , and myulticultimal revey-lies of the cleg and men stal festingingingingingingers ,
where the wisdom of all the people can contributing our hand-being holding .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things I wrote about this book that I hope requires , I &apos;m going to evidentiate some of the labels , in case , not note .
I want to start with what I call the official dogma official dogma . &quot;
The dogma dogma dogma dogma ?
The dogram dogram of all of all the Western industrial industrial . The official official fitor is connected . &quot; If we want to mess the individual benefits of our citizens . &quot;
The reason is , from a side , in the fact that freedom is in the fact that freedom is precious , useful , essential , useful , for human beings .
As the other is that if we &apos;re free , each of us can act for all of us can act everything that maximizes our well-being , without any one that decida in names .
The way to male the freedom is to be to be a choice .
More people are libers , the more libers are libers , and greater is their freedom , most of them is their well-being .
This is so deeply radicated in the society that nobody would dream to put it in the society that no one would be .
And it &apos;s also deeply deeply in our lives .
I &apos;ll show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly great .
I &apos;m losing a simple notice on the condents for injured .
In my supermarket , there are 1775 condents , without context 10 variety of oil olids and 12 acets acets the 12 acets acets you can buy a huge number of condents in the result of the remarkable condent recording to your surprised .
Here &apos;s the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic stereo to buy a stereo : case , homes , CD , radio , radio , radio , plastra , leter .
And in this single negotial store , there is a big number of audio .
We can make six and a half million different combinations , using the components that there are in a only negotial .
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice .
Other the world of the communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the serve services , the packaged , which was a bunch that I was fornited by mamma Bell .
It was born , it didn &apos;t buy it .
A consequence of that , in the other , was that the phone was never going to be .
These time I went .
We have a variety of phones , almost illimited phones , especially between the cellular phones .
Here &apos;s the cellular cellular cellular .
My favorite is that in the middle , MP3 cut , cut up in the nose , and the bind for the eyes .
If you don &apos;t have seen in the store uneither , you &apos;re certain you , you &apos;re going to be certain you ,
And what &apos;s the end is that people get into the nezes and makes this question . And you know what the answer ? The answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cellular phone that doesn &apos;t make it too much .
So in other aspects of life that are much more important than the buy of the buy , you actually grew the same explosion of choice .
Asanitarian histence : not happens in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor , what you have to do .
Instead , go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; Okay , we could do it , or B , &quot; As &quot; A is these well-history , &quot; B has these well-holds and these loss . &quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Dr. &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A is these benefits and the risks , and B has these benefits . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you read , &quot; Dr. &quot; And she was me , what would ? &quot;
And the doctor : &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result of the disease of malsease , &quot; expression that makes it seems to make a beautiful thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not a fish and responsibility to take a fish and responsibility to take a lot of something , which is the doctor , which is the doctor , whatever knowledge -- and so not in the ideal condition to make decisions .
There is a huge marketing products of drugs , direct to people like me and you , who if you think there &apos;s no sense , because if you think there &apos;s no sense , I can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why do they published them ?
The answer is that they want to domactor called the doctor to ask them to change it .
Something that is our hythesis as our hythesis , as you can see in this junk , like you see in this jet . &quot; We don &apos;t want to make children . &quot; We don &apos;t want to be a more identity : we don &apos;t heritation .
And we can reinvent us how many times we get us .
The means that every morning , to the risk , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I &apos;m a little bit of the family and matrimony , a time time time the common perspective , hundred of almost anyone , was that there was the most possible , and he started to get the most possible .
The only green choice was with who , not even when , not even when , and not even what to do after .
Egyday , everything is really to play .
I teach a very smart students , and I do their 20 percent in less than a time .
And not because they &apos;re not not brilliant , because they &apos;re not less diligence .
but because I &apos;m impensieritites , I mean , I &apos;m going to go , &quot; I would be going to do it now ? &quot;
&quot; Do I &apos;m going to move ? &quot; I have to think about the children or the career or the career ? &quot;
They &apos;re logoring logoranants .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this implement is not the compiting that I &apos;m not going to get a beautiful voting my exame .
And they have to do it . I &apos;m a important questions .
Now , the job : we are lucky , like Carl subtinef , because technology allows us to work every minute , from Hotel Randolph .
I &apos;m parentestimate , there is a anger , and I &apos;m not going to tell anybody , where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use it .
What does that mean , this incredible freedom of choice that we have to continue to work ? Is it continuously , if we need to work or not .
We can go to our son , and we can go to the head , with the cellular phone in a task , the Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , typically , on the ginocky .
And even though I &apos;m all spend , every minute that we see our son , we also see our son , we &apos;re also asking , we &apos;re also asking this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , this makes the experience of partners of your child , very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , from any part , we look at all , little big things and big , the materials and life is a living , life is a question of choice .
Once the world was this : Over , there were some possibilities , but it was not a question of choice .
The world today looks like this : The dilemma is : &quot; Is it a positive , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Scially , we have a lot of the way .
We know , we know all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about that negative .
All this choice comport two effects negative effects on people .
The first , paradoxally , is that produces instead of liberation .
So many of the options that choose choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I offer you an example : a study of the meaning of the floor of the flight pensive .
A colleages had access to the Vankfull of the data , the gigantic society , with about a million climents in 2,000 companies .
What she turned out is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of adesion is two percent .
For 50 source source , there is 10 percent in less adesions of the degree when they &apos;re available to five . Why ?
because of 50 source between which choose , it &apos;s disease , it &apos;s a harmful message to decide , and the choice is remanded to the indomories .
And by domorders , and still domorders , domorrow , domorders , domorders , and of course , domorders , domorders , and of course , domorders , domorders , domorderly , domorrow , and of course , domorges , domorrow , domorders , and of course , domorders to domorders
You can &apos;t just that that these works from old people who are eating food for cans because they don &apos;t have enough money , it also , to say that the decision is so obstic that decision is so obstic that they also lose the complementary of the job of the job .
Not partecipinking , they &apos;re losing , and it &apos;s loss of the job , which would be going to be green .
So the paralysis a consequence of the consequence .
And I think that &apos;s going to make it .
&quot; And finish , for the ethernity : ketchup , senape or maionese ? &quot;
You &apos;d like to take the right decision , if it &apos;s for ethernity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and neppurpose the wrong , and neppuring the wrong .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even though we can avoid paralysis , and we can do a choice , we &apos;re less satisfaced by the result of how we would be with less options .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of these condents in which choose , if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , is easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would be better . And what happens . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us , and the repiduces the choice , and the replaces the slide of the choice , and the sounds the swood suits , and the slide of the decision ,
and also when it was a good decision .
More choice are , more easy displeasy than whatever detained with whatever detained .
And so , there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert asked very well , as a value as the value that we have to the things that we have to the things that we &apos;re going to be .
And in the rest , when there are so many possible , it &apos;s easy to represent the tools of alternative alternative and be less satismile of the option that is choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m a picture with all of the ones that are not in New York .
But that &apos;s what you &apos;d probably think .
There is this coppia coppia .
A place of light .
It &apos;s beavind . Otttyma day .
Nothing . But what he thought is , &quot; Well , what he thought is , &quot; Well , maledition , is Agost . &quot;
&quot; Everybody my neighbor manhatan are away . &quot;
&quot; I could talk about home . &quot;
And it turns out two weeks abstripped from the idea that &apos;s losing -- every day -- the possibility of wonderful parking where it wants .
The costo-opportunity to defense is the software for what we have , even when the choice was except .
And the most are the options that we have to consider , the more the tools you will return out to be against as a conconnection .
Here &apos;s another example .
This visual says a lot of things .
We talk about the living time , and maybe of living slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you chose , you &apos;re going to choose to do other .
The things we don &apos;t choose have a tactivity that can make less attractive what we do .
Tirl : the growth : the growing of the expectations .
I tried it on my skin bought , and I &apos;m going to be a new jeans .
I &apos;m almost always jeans .
And once the jeans were just a kind of , compraving them and wonderful from the beside , they were just loved , only after they had a life and worked a lot of times , started to go good .
So I went to buy a couple of them , when the old old ones were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
The committing me , &quot; Who wants to be fit , relaxy , relaxy and fit ? &quot;
He wants to the certain or your buttons ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stonewashed ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; Would you want to be ? &quot;
&quot; Sow the full of them or strets ? Bt bble bla -- &quot; Continures it .
I was hortheless , and after a little bit of jeans , I want the guys -- that was the only guy that was the only guy who was , so I tried to a little bit of what I tried to be , and I had to use me from the negotions , I &apos;m going to use me from the best jeans who ever had .
It was the very big . I had all that choice I had got the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a book interested in to understand it .
The reason I was worse , with all the time , with all the time , the whole thing was high , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was a minime I didn &apos;t expectation . I didn &apos;t expected anything when there was only one , but when you were 100 different , but when you were 100 different , hundred , at least a guy had to be perfect .
What I had buy was good , but not perfect .
After I talked about that choose to what I was trying to insodently in the confront of the expectations .
The adaddition of the people don &apos;t make the expectations that have respect to the excellence of options in the options of options .
And this product less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
No one in the marketing world , if it makes it .
because if they knew , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth looks like this .
&quot; It was better when you were worse , &quot; The reason for that was better when you were worse when you were worse , when you were worse , you know , when he was worse , I was going to meet the surprised .
Egyday , in the world that we live -- opulent , industrialized , citizens with the perfection of perfection -- the most of the howners .
You never have surprised pleased your expectations , my expectations , they &apos;re ingiganten .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Basis , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , you want to . &quot;
I mean , little self-hydrographical moment , and my wife is really study .
I couldn &apos;t have to do better , I &apos;m not accomplished .
But it &apos;s not always a good thing .
And then , a consequence of buy a couple of jeans switness is that when there is only that when you &apos;re not satisfacts , and say , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , the answer is clear .
The world is the responsible . What could I do you do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a types , and you buy you &apos;re asking who is the responsible , it &apos;s otherwise , it &apos;s otherwise you .
You &apos;d have to do better .
With hundreds of variety available , there are no scusing .
So when people are decisions , even though the results , they feel unlike , they feel insodented and they &apos;re the color their own own .
In the last few years , the depression is exploss in the industrialized world .
I think a full meaning -- not the only one , but the only important -- of this depression is just that people have experiences of depression is too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that color is they have .
So the final result is that in general , we &apos;re better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely falong . It &apos;s not true .
There is no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than it doesn &apos;t have to have a little bit better than it &apos;s better than a little bit better .
There is a critical value , I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m pretty sure we have been from a piece of the level where the choice choices our life .
Now , from the political point -- I have almost finished -- from the political point , the nocle is the following .
What allows this choice in the industrial society is the material wealth .
There are a lot of places in the world , and you know , which the problem is not they have too much choice .
The problem is they have too much poca .
So the factory that &apos;s about is a disease of modern , is a disease of modern , remember that society .
And what it makes it to do and arrand arrand arrand it &apos;s this : Steve Levitt &apos;s how those expensive and sattachules for whbes are useful . It &apos;s a spread spread .
I mean , these choice , complicated and dispendepend , it &apos;s not that they &apos;re just inuseful .
I &apos;m addicting to deleteries .
They do it worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows , it allows a little bit of the result in those where people have too few possibilities , it would not be the better living , but also our impractice .
This is what economists call a paretian arging improvement .
A redistribution retroduction is good at all -- not only to the poor -- not only because of this choice in except that it turns us .
To conclude : you can become everything you want to be what you want to --
You , people of culture , you &apos;ll think , &quot; What does that weight ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t make anything in a glass . &quot;
&quot; Audience imagination , a limited vision of the world --
and I &apos;m going to be interpretation , in the beginning .
But then , thinking about , instead , I realized that the fish knows the long knows .
because the reality of the fact , if you get into the broke , so that , &quot; everything is possible , &quot; you don &apos;t get the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you can get the mouth in a way that everything is to decrease the software .
You &apos;re going to get the paralysis , and you &apos;ll reduck the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too street , maybe even for the fish , and of course for us .
But the axis absence of simbulth-filled symbolic , and I &apos;m in the rovine .
Thank you very much .
