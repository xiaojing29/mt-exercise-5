The year I showed these slide to show that the calculate glacial glacial , which for almost three million years has the size of the U.S.
But it was a lot of the gravity because it doesn &apos;t show the gravity because it doesn &apos;t show the ice of the ice .
The artic glacial is , in a sense , the pulsant cuor the global climate system .
It &apos;s expands and you ritive ritira .
The next slide is going to be a record to the last 25 years .
The ice loss are drawing up in red .
As you see , you &apos;re expand until the blue .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter , which is a ritier ritizen .
You can see that the ice cosid-year-old , of five years or more , is like the blood , which is the blood , which is the blood .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been going to be done .
This is a problem because the interested in the ocean , the terround , where there are huge amount of carbon , where there are huge amount of conged , and they &apos;re transformed into metan from microbi .
I pect to the totality of the cycle of global warming , that quantity could radical , that quantity could radical , surely surrounded this point of not .
In some of the little little little deep in Alaska , the methane is already rebecame a little bit of the water .

If you want to know how you feel the mate of the sea for the ice of the ice on terraferm , here is where you can get the set .
These corrents are increasing .

The environmental disasters are increasing out of the normal and without previous .
Four times more numerous in the last 30 years , I &apos;ve got the last 30 years of the previous 75 .
This is a whole thing to be instaining .
If you look at the storytelling .
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of tons of tons .
Look at the U.S. C. Pacific , by American area , and on the American , and on both the parts of the subcontinent , where there is a radical impact of obygous in the ocean .
Most of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of the human beings .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with the China .
And he was proposed to build a lot of other carbon .
But we &apos;re assisting to a direction .
These are the annaked in the last years and some of the alternative alternative .
Every , there &apos;s a lotta politics in our country .
The carbon and oil and oil are oil , they have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon , which is a host .
That image I remember something --
SNatal , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a perfect of 3.8 billion paper scories of carbon .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the biggest second-----second floor in America .
It &apos;s happened to Natal .
The nature of the carbon industries of one of the carbon was this .
Video : â™« Fross the carbon is a kind of allegro and happy .
It &apos;s abondant here in America , and it &apos;s going to grow our economy .
I mean , the carbon is always more and more publicly .
It &apos;s good , it &apos;s filled , adorable and work work , they &apos;re going to stay .

Video : Ator : Ator we see the climate change as a serious mine as a serious minute of our business .
So , our priority is invest a great amount of money in a public sforce of public secure to make public and confuses .
In fact , the carbon is not sports .
We think it &apos;s just a good profuman .
So you don &apos;t preoccurs of climbing change .
Let me do to do .
Video : Ator : Ator . You &apos;ve heard a lot of you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
So let &apos;s give you a turn in a structure to have a structure of the carbon for how much the carbon is .
Straordinary ! The car car is a little rumor , but this is the sound of the carbon technology .
The carbon is between the major cause of global warming , but the notion of global warming , but the notices of the carbon that you see everything .
Do an an ocket : this is the odic technology of carbon .
Al Gore : Inally , the alternative , the positive to the economic issues and the national security .
Video : My America is in cribes ; the national economy , the national crisis .
The philos that the colleagues all of our connects , as the basic carbon and oil .
Now , perhaps there is a new , audace solution for it .
Really America : 100 percent of the full years .
A flow-up to put America to make us sure more safety , and help to stop the global warming .
Finally , one solution that bastes our problems .
Really America . Scover .

We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
The year at TED I did a little bit of the LHC .
And I promise to go back to the way it works .
So here . And then I figure out the other time , there were no LHC is the biggest experiment , never experiment -- 27 miles of circonference .
Her compit is to requires that were present less than a billion second-second of the universe -- under 600 million times the second .
So , all of this is just environment .
This is the car under the soul of the South Ginevens .
We have to pick these mini-Big Bang Bang in the research .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- is it &apos;s large 44 feet .
This is a spectacular image of ATLAS in buildings so you can see the proportions .
Ten Ten Ten Ten pember , we have access the car for the first time .
And this photograph was taken by ATLAS .
It was because of immense phestegs in the room of control .
It &apos;s an image of the first phasm that had done the LHC , walking in collision , in the collision , with a part of the LHC , and it &apos;s spread particles in the respor .
In other words , when we see that picture 10 secember , the machine that the machine worked , the machine was a great writing .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to exulse of more opping this , when somebody went on Google and vides that the beginning was this .
That means we had a cultural impact impact on the scientific impact .
About a week after , there was a problem with machine , he had to these phils here -- these dorrows .
These phils are going to 13,000 amper when the car works on the massive .
Now , the technical technical of you will look at the phils and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . &quot;
And they can do it because when they &apos;re very cold , they &apos;re very cold phils .
So , at least 271 degrees , at a temperature at the space between stars , these phils can bring that run .
In one of the junk between the LHC , there was a magnetic of the LHC , there was a difect of fabrication .
So the phils surprised , and the 13,000 amphere , and the 13,000 amper , they improvide a resistance resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressionant if you think these magnets more than 20 tons , and they &apos;re moved by about 30 days .
They are danneged about 50 magnetes .
We had to take them , what we did .
We repristed them and traveled .
Now they &apos;re going back to their sub-place .
By the end of marzo the LHC is is new integrate .
We &apos;re going to happen , and we expect to get the data or light , and continuing our adventure to find out what the morning is going to find out what the universe is .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents reach the value of science and engineering engineering . It &apos;s easy to confuture .
I think the fact that is so hard , the fact that is so hard , I think this is the value of things like LHC .
I would like to conclude with the words of an Inglese , Humphysical , the imagine , which , imagine , in difesight of his bael , his blew , his blew was Michael Faray , he said , &quot; Nothing is so much for the human mind as the human mind as the human mind as the human mind as the human mind as the science that the ideas of the human mind that we &apos;re not going to be able to be a new . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start asking , when , from children , played by children , played the morning .
And as you reach them and deal with them , take them and move them , take them and move them , learned , and they learned to think and solve problems .
The space is propecly connected to the way we understand , in the way we understand ,
So , from the information of our interaction with physics , together my consult , together my consult Patts , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking me , &quot; And if we use a computer , when we use a won-free , by having a wild , we could digital , we can digital with the gital , we could die the care of the filled , we can do the further filled with the hundred ,
and systems to our full ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a great computer interactive computer .
In a few words , a Siftable is a great computer interactive computer .
You can move with the hand , they can see , &quot; you can see &quot; between them , &quot; and they have a screen and a radio .
But surprised , they &apos;re physical objects , as the morning , you can move them .
Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of a new tools for manippulate information .
And as they become more physical , consciousness of the movement , of other people , and as a become more physical , of the other people , as we move them , we can explore new and fun size of interaction .
I &apos;m going to start with a few simple example .
This Siftable is configurate to show you : if you incline it in a direction , the video , the video , the video gatherer .
These reverse is consciousness .
If you &apos;re interested in the way , it &apos;s interests .
If they come circonduction , they can agitate it and they can agitate a little bit .
If they come circonduction , they can agitate it and they can agitate a little bit .
They also various their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power to use the point of the data , &quot; a color like , &quot; a color like , &quot; a color like a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable as a century century of the versity in the central central , where they &apos;re misquarters .
and I can use them for the color in the central , where they &apos;re misk .
If we &apos;re going to be too , we can put a little place .
They also have the good possibility of appresses , like languages , the mathematics and juggle of logic where people can try and see it &apos;s results .
Now I &apos;m --
This is a sequence of Fibonacci that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a game of words that &apos;s half between Scarabeo and Boble .
Pratically , every turn up to every turn in the Siftable , Pratically , Pratically , in every turn Siftable , and you can get a literally , and while you try to comport him on a dionary .
And then , after about 30 seconds remisk , and you have a new security of letters and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s what the children came to the Media Lab , I did it , I did it , and I turned a video .
They &apos;re very high .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of thing is that you don &apos;t have to give people many education .
You just say , &quot; Compons of words , and they know what to do .
Here &apos;s some other people who try it .
This is our biggest tester tester , there on the right .
He actually wanted to imploy them .
They were only morning .
Now , this is an application of a interactive cardboard .
We wanted to build a tool for the apart of the languages is Felix .
It can start new characters in the scene , solve the Siftable .
It can start new characters in the scene , solve the Siftable .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : The sole is surprised .
David Merrill : Now he took a treator in the scene .
Video : The tractor .
By work ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes !
So schooling Siftable and put neiffully neighborhood ,
Video : Bau !
And by invent their story .
Video : Ciao !
DM : It &apos;s a story with final open , and it can decide him as it &apos;s going .
DM : It &apos;s a story with final open , and it can decide him as it &apos;s going .
Video : The gat , gat .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a recent , realized realized by recent , to wait and exequires .
It &apos;s a recent , realized by recent , to wait and exegue musical .
Siftable here agate against sound like basis , based and battery .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choices what use .
You can start to go to a sequence of composed to comport these sound in a sequence .
And modificate it just doing a sound , &quot; and a &quot; sequence . &quot;
These are effects you can control from the vive , like the reverse and the phils .
The attacks a particular sound and then inclines to travel it .
And then there are the general effects like time and fly , which is going to be just the interview .
Look at how it works .
Video : DM : We &apos;re going to start putting a basis in two Siftable , &quot; sequence , we extend , the systems , we add the other basis .
Now , I put a line of the basis .
Video : DM : Now I add to the percussion --
Video : DM : And now I &apos;m going to put the bacteria , so I can control the effect of the view .
Video : DM : I can fly fast interview the whole sequence from a side or side or the other .
Video : DM : And now I &apos;ll add the bottom to the best fashion .
Video : DM : I can realize the sequence &quot; to the flight . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to do it , but I can try to try , it &apos;s going to make it longer or more cord .
And so , finally , I can sell the entire sequence inking the Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is built new new man &apos;s machine and more than our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this lost , and also some possibility that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that &apos;s going to get this new generation of designed to interact with media , that will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time to talk to all of you .
I &apos;m a wrote .
Scut books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also the love and the fass of my life .
And I don &apos;t expect that you can change .
But , he said , something particular happened in my life and in my career , who took me to realibrate the internal relationship with this work .
The particular thing is I recently wrote this book , this biography called &quot; Manore , Prega , Prega , Prega , Ama , &quot; which , it &apos;s a little bit of reason for some reason it , for some reason it , and become a great sensational , bestseller .
And the result is that everywhere where where the wall , people treat me like if they were condanced .
Do -- condanced , condanned , condanned !
They &apos;re going to me , everybody worried and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t have to do it ?
You have no fear of continuing to write for all life without power without power without power of a book that can important one ? &quot;
What &apos;s about somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s rassurant , you know .
But it could go worse , part of the remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was a scritical -- I was a scritical .
I met to met the same based by the pure .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t I think I &apos;m not going to have successful ?
You have no fear that the humiliation of the refree ?
You have no pure of doing this mitted to make this message of nothing comes out and die on a cumule of every infrankly , with the bought fallow-full ? &quot;
You know .
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I have a couple of all those things .
I &apos;ve always had a couple .
And I also have a lot of other things that people can &apos;t inate .
As the algae and other things .
But , as much about what I thought and I was a little bit of the thought and I was cut ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logical that anybody has been waiting from a job that you feel hold by a job that you feel like to do .
But what &apos;s about so particular in the imprised creative to make us , in the way that other career than other career .
As my father , for example , he was a chemicals and not remember one time in his 40 years of activity in his 40 years of activity in which he was asked if he had fear the capability ?
There was never -- that block of the engineer John , how do it ?
It was not going to work , capable ?
Onestly , the engineers like group have not certainly , in the century , drawed the reputation of being alcolized .
We written , we have a reputation , and not only a reputation of every gender , we have this reputation of being an instaxis .
And it &apos;s not going to look at the trists of the magnificent of magnific morts that only only in the last century , just in the last century , they died young people and often for them .
And also the ones that are not suicidated to be really disdisdes by their dones .
Norman Mailer , before he died , the last interview said , &quot; Every book killed me a little bit more . &quot; A hundred of des .
But we don &apos;t bad that when we heard this because we heard these things so much long-foot thing that we &apos;ve completely interested in a few way we &apos;ve been interested in some way and the art , it will always , it &apos;s going to be able .
And the question I want to bring all the today is : are you agree with this idea ?
You know , you know , because it also looks like a food centimeter of distance to me , not good for anything .
I think it &apos;s odiosa .
And I think it &apos;s also periculous and I don &apos;t want to see the perspecuate in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our big creative ments to live .
And I &apos;m sure that , in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to get out of that , I was going to be a hard host of the circumstances that are in my career .
That &apos;s a look at the same time , they &apos;re rather young , I have about 40 years .
I have still about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very unlikely that anything write about it will be judded by the world as the work that he used after the spavently successful of my last book .
I &apos;m going to be schik , because we &apos;re all the biggest here -- it &apos;s probable that my bigger is to my high .
Oh , Gesus , who think .
You know this is the kind of thinking that &apos;s the kind of thinking that leads a person to start besides in the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would like to keep doing this work we do this work we do this work we .
So , the question becomes , how it is ?
And so it seems to me , after a lot of reflection , which is to write is to write is to write is to create a psychological costricy-psychological , oken ?
I have a few way to find a distance of security between me , which I &apos;m write , and my natural , and my natural anxial , and I was trying to do it . And , while I was trying to do it , trying to do it , trying to find other society to see if they could have to have better ideas and more than sane and more sane and more sane and more sane and more sub-sane .
how to help people to make people make the emotional inrisks of creativity .
And that research has taken me to the ancient Great and ancient Rome .
Seguitems because he gave up in circle and then back .
In the ancient Grex and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
It thought the creativity was this beautiful , and that came to become a little bit of a few people from a few sources and known , for reasons and health .
They called these these beyond these beyond the creativity of the creativity . &quot;
Socrate , wonderful , creded to have a demone that elargiven from the way .
Roman were the same idea , but they called the the kind of spirit without a genius .
The one is great , because Romans didn &apos;t think a genius was a particular person was a particularly smart .
They think a genius was this kind of divine that has created the literally credeal with the study of a artist , a little bit like the Robs , and that comes out of the work of the artist and model , and that comes out of the work and model , and model the result of that work .
Here &apos;s the way -- that &apos;s the distance of what I talk about -- that psychological costruth that you protect to the result of your work .
And everybody knew that was going to work , right ?
So , the anticism were protected by certain things , like the way , like the way too narcism , right ?
If your work was except for the way , you could not take the market , everyone knew that the market , everyone knew that would help from this genius .
If your work , if your fallies , it wasn &apos;t all of the basic thing , right ?
They all know that was your genius to be a incapable .
And so people concept the creativity in Occidest for a long time .
And then the Renasn Renasn , and nac5 this great idea ; we put the human center , we put the human center , and we put the mistake and no longer space and no longer space to creatures that write the creatures .
This was the principle of rational human human human human , and people started thinking that creativity was completely from the shark .
And for the first time in history , you start to referrate to this or the artist as a rather than a person with genius .
And I have to say , I think it was a big herror .
I think it &apos;s going to allow somebody , a simple person to believe that it &apos;s like a recipatient , the essence and the surprising of all mysternetwork , and ethery is responsibility to the human philososs .
It &apos;s like to ask somebody to income .
Deform and beautiful and creates all of these expectable .
And I think it was this pression to destroy the artists in the past 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think it &apos;s , and I think it &apos;s a question , and now ?
Can we do that different ?
Maybe to go back to a surprising compressing of human relationship and creative .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t sing 500 years of rational thinking of rational thinking about a 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people between the public that would only have a bunch of the notion of the notion , you know , they follow people to do happen .
I &apos;m not going to convince you all about this thing .
But the question I would want to bring is -- why not ?
Why not to think that way ?
Because it has more sense of every other thing that has ever heard to explain the exasperant of the process of creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever ever ever ever ever ever he had to do something -- so , it &apos;s basically all here -- you know , you don &apos;t understand rationally .
And , in fact , it can be completely paranormal .
I &apos;ve done this recently met with the amazing poetry Ruth Stone , who now 90 years , but it was a few years , but it was a very poetic for all of life and said that during his infancient in the camps , and he heard it , when a poem was a poem of the landscape .
He said he was like a fragorous train .
And he was rolling to her from the landscape .
He heard it was going to be under , because he was going to make the land under his feet .
He knew to have one thing to have a sola thing to do that point and it was , &quot; rare like a mathemselves . &quot;
And so it turns out to the house and he was going to have a little bit of a little bit and a full fast , and a fast food , and it &apos;s fast faster , and he would have to take it and full it on the page .
Sometimes he could not be fast enough , so correes and correct and correct and correct the house was going to get home and the lost it would keep rolate through the landscape , trying to rolate through the landscape , trying to do a poet . &quot;
And then there were the same -- this piece of the piece of the moments where it was almost lost dying , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was trying to card and the poetry was trying to do it , and he was going to go through , and he was going to go , and he said , that he was going on with the other hand and the hand and the hand and the hand and the hand the hand the hand the hundred .
He was the poetry and the cound of the coil and he put the page and the transformed the page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be presented on the perfect page and intatta , but the last word before .
So when I heard it &apos;s feeling it , it &apos;s exactly the same thing to my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- they &apos;re not a conducture .
I &apos;m a move , and my way to work is ; it &apos;s my own every day and work and spend it , and he went out and work and spend it surrounds .
But I even have a little bit in my testardaggine , I &apos;ve been stripped against that thing , sometimes .
And I &apos;m also imagine a lot of you .
You know , even if the work and the ideas were given me from a certain fun , I could not know .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relationship us to do us to do us to lose the head , but rather , rather , rather , which do you remains ?
And as much as I look at the best example that I have is the musician musician musician musician , which I &apos;ve interviewed a nal days .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life has been the incarnation of the artist &apos;s returned , trying to control , trying to control , you think , you omean inter-in-in-incarried .
But then he invected , he was driving , and a day as he was driving on a &quot; auteaten , changed everything .
He was wondering and all of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of melodies , which is it comes into his head like , and the head , and the full , and the wants , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the desidence , but it doesn &apos;t know how it .
It has no paper of card , it doesn &apos;t have a cut .
So he starts to hear this species of old old anxioned in him like , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;ll remark up from this charge canone .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to go into the panic , he stopped .
I &apos;m going to move the mental process and made something completely new .
I &apos;m going to look at the sky and said , &quot; Scush , I &apos;m not going to drive ? &quot;
&quot; You know , you can write a song now ?
If you really want to exist , you get back to a better time when I can take care of you going to take me care .
Altricks , you go to important something else today .
You know , Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his process , he worked about this .
Not work , the work was still hoscure as always .
But the process , and the anxized weight was repected when the genius , the genius who was going to have a whole thing else problems and free it back to where you come out , he was realized that he had no thing to be an interior and formented .
But he was a peculiar , he wonderful bizarre , and this strange thing that it was not Tom .
So how much I heard that story to change a little bit of how I was working on and already it was going to save a time .
This idea , he save me when I was write , &quot; Mang , Prega , Ama , &quot; and I , &quot; Ama , &quot; and I said , &quot; and we &apos;re working on something and we &apos;re working on something and we &apos;re going to think it will be a disaster , which is the worst of the worst of the worst .
Not only book , right the worst book .
And I started thinking about to think about this project .
But then I remember Tom who talked to the air and I tried to take us .
So I went to go to my face in the house and I realized my comments to a corner of the room .
And I said , &quot; Sometimes , &quot; What , you know , what , if this book not shared that if this book not will be interested , not be interested in my own , no ?
Because as I see me , I &apos;m going to put it all I have no more than I have ,
So if you want to have better , you have to presented and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , I don &apos;t do it .
I &apos;m going to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I would like to favor who was recorded to do my part of &quot; because -- it &apos;s been doing my part &quot; because -- it &apos;s so , OK -- it &apos;s a little bit -- in the North Africa , people were radunning for the dances of the dancing of the dancing and hours .
And they were always magnific , because the balance were professionists and were fantastic .
But every very , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists , and one of these artists .
And I know you know what I &apos;m going to talk , because I know you &apos;ve got all , in a performance so .
It was like if the time you stops , and the ballery cammind , and he wasn &apos;t doing anything about it , and he was not doing anything before , but it was all the time .
And I think it &apos;s not just like a human .
But it happened from the didrive inside and the divinity .
And when this happened , the time , people know what was called it was , they called it .
They were eased to song , and they started to sing , &quot; Allah , Allah , God , God , God , God , God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curiosa history -- when the Morororororic south of Spain , he took this habits with them and pronounce , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; which you can still feel in the corried .
In Spain , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , the bah , the Allah , magnificent , I &apos;m a God of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need .
But , the problem comes the day after , for the ballery , when you wake up and discovered that are 11 of the morning of the morning of God &apos;s drawling .
It &apos;s just a mal death with a bad mal with ginockyyyia , and maybe not to ask that along .
And maybe no one cancer of God , and what it has to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most porous recognizes to make a creative life .
But maybe not to be so angerous , if you can &apos;t believe , anzyutt , which is the most amazing , which is the extraordinary expect of your own .
But crete simply that you &apos;re going to take you from a unimaginable unimaginable of this squish of your life that you have to go to something else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think that &apos;s going to think .
And so I started thinking , and it &apos;s sure because I thought for different months in the book that I &apos;m going to published , the periculous , the periculous , the performance of my graduate successful .
And what I have to keep me when I fear the electrized from this is , not not fear .
Don &apos;t travel . It just your work .
It &apos;s going to presenting you for your part , any way you can be .
If your work is balance , ball .
If the dump , I &apos;m sure assigned to leave some kind of wonderful , a few days of wonderful , for a moment through your short , then &quot; Okay ! &quot;
Sometimes , you &apos;re the same dance .
And &quot; Oh , &quot; You know , you know .
I think it &apos;s going to teach it .
&quot; You know , &quot; to you have the same , even for the human and test hammer and testing tals tyal tals that are continuously .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
You know , I &apos;ve already talked about some of these things on the human genome , what can meaning and discovery of new genes .
Now , we &apos;re starting to a new perspent : we started digitalize biology and now to talk about that code we &apos;re both in a new biology , designing and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing .
We always tried to bring great questions .
&quot; What &apos;s life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists I think they &apos;re going to have various free to various .
We tried different approach , reduction to the minimes .
We &apos;re digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome , it was going to go from the analogic world of the digital world .
Now , we ask : can we regenerate life , or new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma , which is the kind of genitalium , which is the kind of smaller genome that can autorum in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome of creating a little bit more smaller .
We &apos;re able to eliminate a hundred of genes about 500 that are here .
But when we &apos;re an easy to her map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our own .
I think , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes we can eliminate , one to the time , it &apos;s very improbable that this can bring to a living cell .
So we decided that the only one of designing was to synthesize this croma in way that we could modifying the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of the &quot; Pan we synthesis ? &quot;
Can the chemistry to producing these great molecules that we never could make a lot of them .
And in case , we can make a crazy comosome ?
A chromosoma is just a piece of chemical material .
The speak we are able to digitalize life is growing up to the exponential .
Our capacity of write the genetic code , rather , rather than it is , but it &apos;s better .
And our recent recent returned the bringing on a exponential curve .
We started 15 years ago .
The process has requires , by by a whoever , began with a bioethic review of the first experiments .
But we discovered that DNA is very hard .
There are a thousands of machines in the world that produces are small security of DNA , of 30 to 50 letters and it &apos;s a process , and it &apos;s a process , the segment is longer , more running .
So we had to develop a new method to assembly these fragments and correct the herrors .
And this was our first tental , to talk about digital information of the genoma of Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills kills .
We designed the fragments , actually the correction of the errors and you get a molecule of DNA of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material chemical material , the bacteria , the bacteria , the bacteria , the bacteria and producing the particles .
The viral particles are then requires by cells , they &apos;re back and they destroyed the E.
I talked about recent with members of the oil industry , which they have certainly compress this model .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build his same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things biggest .
We wanted to build the whole crazy of the bacteria .
They are 580 to the letters of code .
So we thought we build it in the size of virus , so we could change the casses of virus , so we could have the casses of a cell cell .
The progeption is critical , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequency this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard was a herror for every 10 mile .
We found out , 30 herror it , 30 herrors . If we had the original sequence we would never be able to do it works .
One part of the process is designing security , 50 lets that you &apos;re going to have a little bit of the other segate segment to build smaller sub-to-to-to-working work together .
We can see the only one elements here .
You probably have the read we read that we &apos;re going to take the hundred .
Think about it : We have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , C , C , CEs and T.
Three of those letters together , and there &apos;s about 20 amminds , and there &apos;s a specific order to every love .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frasured .
What we did we have done in the beginning was autographs .
Some of them were deluses from the fact that it wasn &apos;t a few .
We designed these segments to just help them only to just help them with the full .
There are a scientist that they &apos;re going to be assigned .
And we started to assembly assembly by five to seven from five to seven to seven letters , unenduries in a segments of 24 mile lector to their letters .
Every step of all we produced these seats in abundance so we can sequency that we &apos;re trying to make a minute robust process .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems to be the tabellone of a basket .
When we get to these very long segments , more than 100 midle , they will not grow more than the E.
It comes to the limit of the modern tools of the molecular biology .
So we consider other mecchanisms .
We knew about another mecchanism called the remarkable romology , which in biology , which is going to repull DNA can actually help the DNA can actually help the segments .
Here &apos;s a example .
This organism , called Deinoccurs , it can make three million rad rad .
You can see in the requires as his crazy become distruted .
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembly like it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can do completely .
They can live under under the various .
They &apos;re absolutely sure that life in space , and you move to find new environments of water .
As the real , NASA showed that this is .
This is an image of the molecule we built these processed , simply using the free segments from inserious segments to be .
The lievening them to automatically .
This image was not taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a molecule of course we can see it with a microscope .
These are photograph that takes a period of about six seconds .
This is the published we did little time ago .
They are 580,000 letters of code .
It &apos;s the biggest molecule of a definitely definitely created by man .
It has a molecular molecular sent to 300 million .
If we stampast it with a career , they would like 142 pages to write this gene code .
Now , how do we work it ? How can we active it ?
Of course , you know , you &apos;re a virus is a game from kids .
It &apos;s a little more complicated when you use batterns .
It &apos;s simplest when it &apos;s cell of the euclear cells as the way of our own simply , you can just extract the nucleo and put another , which is practical process .
In the archaea , the cromosome is integrated by the cell , but we recently demonstrated that we &apos;re able to do a complete traphor traph of a cell from one other and activity from one another and of active activity .
We can bring a chromosomosome from a microbial species .
The two are different than the men from the topes .
We added some gene gene in a way we decide what he choose for this croma .
He has science with the scientist so that we killed to kill all protein .
And when we put it in the cell was study -- and you open our graph graph -- the new cell of the cell -- the new cell cell .
And so we thought we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to spush us .
This is one of the most mecchanisms .
We discovered that tantusize species have added a second or a third or third from some part , adding in a thousand of new species of new species .
So who think about evolution as a kind of gene as a gene of modified has not understanding of the biology .
There are the scientist called the &quot; Bished full of the regions that are addiction .
The crowd that was in the cell of it was in the cell .
The cell phone that we have a cell that we have inserit-takes .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognize the other crazy as an extraneous material , and we found it with only cell the cells and the new cell .
it became blue because of the genes we &apos;ve inseriously .
And in a short least , all the characteristic of a species are going to be perse , and it turned out of the new kind of software we going to have in the cells .
All the protecin is changed , membrances are changed , and when we realized the gene code of what we transferred you .
Now , this might seem like the genetic software , but altering the software .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that you don &apos;t talk about this parent -- but to do a new new version of evolution , and I &apos;ve already said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion that will be created by the digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s enough to be obvious when we think about our need .
We &apos;re going to spend six billion and a half a half billion people in the next 40 years .
And just to give you an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now , there are three people on the planet for each other in 1946 , in 46 years , it will be four .
We &apos;re going to have problems now to find food , fresh water and pulital , medicinal and a half a half billion and a half of people .
It &apos;s still more double to do that for nine billion .
We &apos;re going to start more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion barrel .
That means a millions of bariles .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replaces , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to have a full of CO2 from these materials that finds up in the atmosphere .
At the day , because of the scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the design components for the future .
The electronic industry only is a dozen , about a dozen , and think about how many different things are outside .
Our limitations are maybe data from reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , because of these synthetization , we can actually create what we call the combinatory .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can producing a billion crazy of cromosoms a day .
Think about this 20 million genes or to try to get the processing processes or to make the processes to make a little team , or drugs , we can change , because of a little team , and create more biology , and create more biology and creating more biology .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can chemicals on the possibility of survival , production or carburant , production of vaccines .
This is an instantly instantly instantly , we &apos;re working on the degrees we &apos;re working for seeing and design species .
Well , we don &apos;t know , we don &apos;t need how they will be .
We know exactly what they &apos;re doing genetic code .
Now we &apos;re focusing on carbons of how quarter generation .
You &apos;ve seen , you know that extractly from the grain was a very finished experiment .
We have carbons of second and third generation that will use enough by the carbons of carbons of furants than the open or different than the butters .
But the only way the biology can have a big impact without increasingly , the cost of food and limitations the cost of food and limitations would be transforming CO2 in the first , we &apos;re working for design cells that can do , and we can do this purpose , and we can think of the first carbon .
The solar solar combined with CO2 is a metodownload -- but in our discoveries in the world , we found different different metods .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the ocean , at about 2500 feet of deep on the temperature of the water .
It &apos;s going to be CO2 using the molecular hydrogen as as the fourth fourselves .
We &apos;re trying to figure out if we can put CO2 , which can make it easily be transported by the CO2 , which can be transported by the process .
So we think we can be able to be able to increase what the basis that the basis that the basis that the basis that the basis that the basis that we have the modest of re-foot intera .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do that TED , where can you do it ?
It was a main a fun main the fun .
And also , we &apos;re working on for using the same metods to create vaccines .
You saw this year with influence , we &apos;re always forget to a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s going to find the right vaccine .
I think what you can change is build vaccines in anticipate .
And this is how the future could start changing , the tree now , the tree , and we accounts the evolution with synthetic batteries , and finally cells .
We &apos;re going to be so much from the impromise .
Our purpose is to make a long time to try to try to make it . Thank you very much much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the most quickly possible , some of the new technology we took to Microsoft in the following a year ago ago .
It &apos;s a environment where you &apos;re interacting is to the local level that re-remoon with a huge amount of view .
Here we &apos;re seeing a lot of digital photograph with a kind of digital photograph with a kind of fast and I continue , to a quick speak , draw the images as we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big big is that we see , how big big , how big these colraces or images .
Most of the most of the digital photographs , but this is a scanning scanning from Biliotey-megapieling .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing you limit to take a system like this is the number of full the number of full on your screen . It &apos;s also a very flexelecture .
This is a whole book , you know , of the data not images .
This is the Casolate of Dickens . Every colonnurse . Every colonnurses .
To show you that it &apos;s about the heads and not images , we can do something like this , to see it &apos;s really about a real representation of the heads , not a photograph .
It could be a little artificial way to read a book for a book for a book .
I don &apos;t have to be considered .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s a number of the Guardian .
Every big image is the beginning of a set .
And it really is the pleasure and beauty of loving the train of paper , which is a lot of a daily review , which is for nature a mold , which is for nature a molies .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number in the Guardian .
We created a fasull fasull the highest -- much more than that uses usually , in a normal published you in a normal contained .
If you want to see the careful characteristics , you can see it .
Or other model , or even the techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limitations of space on the screen .
We hope that this means to the pop-up , and other downwasn &apos;t to be able .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don &apos;t want to lose time , if we don &apos;t want to say that we have contributed to this camp .
These are all the streets in the USA , you can surveal image of NASA .
So , now we go to something else .
This is actually actually from the Web ; you can go to the web .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
A is Seadady and the other is a very interesting research on on the very interesting computer in Noah Snavely , a student in the University of Washington , with the UW and Rick Seadton of Microsoft Rick Seliski . It &apos;s cool .
And it &apos;s from the Web , Seady gests from Seady .
You can see when we do this , you know , when we do this kind of paper , where we can go from one image to the other and have this kind of experience .
But the space of images here has actually a meaning .
The further of the computer visualization , they have these imaging together , so that corresponds to the recorresponds to the realize the records that -- all the near Greeals on the Montaghi Roccial Montaghi Roccial Roccial World -- are you &apos;re taken . Here you &apos;re taking .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more space .
I want to spend one of the original sects of Noahahodd -- and this is a prictick-prototy-promising Photosynth , we &apos;ve done for the first time the summer -- to show you what I think is really the key technology , Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily the cycle that we &apos;ve got to put the Web .
We had to concerned about the legal aspects and so on .
This is a rebuilt of Nothree Dothers pressed by Flickr . Bast Din Flickr Din Flickr , and you get images of a little bit of dying , other fields and so on . Each one of these things , you can see a picture that &apos;s discovered a picture that &apos;s discovered .
So I &apos;m all of the Flickr and you &apos;ve been all been became a space .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this simplication .
You know , I would never have thought to be able to work for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifiing this kind of accounts here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different kinds of focus : from those of the cellphotoccasions of the cellphotos in SLR , a number significant , a number significant number of significant totally .
And if I can , I try to try to try to look for those more strange .
Most they &apos;re blocked by faces , etc .
Somewhere you &apos;re going to find a series of photographs -- etches .
This is a Nothree Damrecorded correctly .
We can go from the poster to the poster of this environment .
The essential point is we can do things with social environment . This is taking data from beyond -- from the collective interior of how the land , from the view of visual view -- and all those data together .
All those photograph become colleagues , most of the parts .
You have a model of the land .
Think about this as a prolder of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It &apos;s something that is growing in complexity , and the people use it , and the which are going to use it , and the vantages with the use .
Their photograph are married with metadical meadors from other people .
If somebody is the idea of contrass all these saying the name , my photograph of the Nothers of Nothers Dimprovising for all those data , and I can use the point of all those data , and I can use the immerged in that metaphopefully , in that meahead of the choose , and to have a critical experience of class .
Of course , a consequence of all of that are very very hiaborated model of every part of the Earth , and the satellitarious and satellitarious and satellitarious and satellitarious memory .
Thank you very much .
CA : I realized , I realized ? What your software to do is that , in the next years , in the next years , all the world , all the photographs shared by anyone in the world will be practically recorded together ?
BA : Yes . What &apos;s doing in practice is going to find .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , you want , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the basis of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the recurity of the simple information that many of these images .
As when you &apos;re a research of images on the Web , you get a sentence and the heads on the web has a lot of information about the picture .
Now , what if you have the photograph is you college to all your photograph ?
So the amount of interconnection and the quantity of requires that it &apos;s really huge is really huge . It &apos;s a classical classic of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really amazing .
BAA : You &apos;re thank you very much .
One of the major , when you travel and one of the ethnographic research is the power of the machines , the power of the traditions , between who has been taking the past in the wind , the touch of the rain of the floor , the floor , the dumping of the plants .
Bastes thinking that Jaguar , and the world &apos;s Chinese are still still more than the Lattea , or that the Mites of Inuit &apos;s still more than the world , or Himalaya , the good bunch of the Dharm , to remember the central importance of the anthropology , and that the idea that the world we live not in the idea that the world in which we live not in the way we live not exist , but it &apos;s just a model of reality , it &apos;s just a model of reality , but it &apos;s just a central model of a central ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stirs made , well or mal , many generations ago .
And of course , we all share on the essential .
We all all nask . We all project .
We &apos;re seeing subjects of starts .
We have to death the inesorability of mort. So it doesn &apos;t surprising us if we &apos;re going to stay .
We all have a art .
What colors is the particular rate is the particular rate of cancer , the rate of every culture .
It &apos;s not import that are the thinking of Borneo , or the following of the Borneo of Haiti , or the Kenya , or the Kenya , or the Curander-seception , or a cameleras , or a cameleras , or a cameler in the Sahara .
He was my journey in the desert a month ago , or a mth ago , or a hyak of yak in the values of the world .
All these populations teaching us us that are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And if you reflection is a bad thing that can give you hope .
And with the cultures of the world creating a spiritual of spiritual life and cultural that has the planet and it &apos;s important for the planet and it &apos;s important for the planet as biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural girl as a hydroward and you can define the etnosphere , the total , the needs , every , the hydrations , under , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions .
The ethnosphere is the great patrimony of human .
It &apos;s the symbols of what we are and what we can be in how much inquissues .
And because the biosphere was favorite , it was very much more successful at the ethnosphere and unfortunately .
Nobody , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all the species has been on the summit of simply because it &apos;s full is fashion -- in the camp -- in the camp -- in the camp -- and you don &apos;t have near even near with the most hypothesis -- that the most optimistic different cultural .
The inindice of all that is , of course , the language .
When you were born there , they were there there were 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only composed by a vocabolary or a series of rules .
A language is the basic of human spirit .
It &apos;s the medium with which animal of every culture in the material .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a thought , a thought , a thought , an eosystem of spiritual possibility .
And the 6,000 languages , while we &apos;re seitting in Monterey , at least the half of the kids .
They don &apos;t come to teach kids , which means , the less you wonderful , which is already death .
What &apos;s the most trists of being flowed by the silence , the last one , the last one language , the last one , of the wisn &apos;t a linguishing the promiping of the kids ?
This is a fashion of somewhere in the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks and bringing with the tomba .
And I know somebody who &apos;s not better .
The world would not be a better place if we talk all the same language ? &quot; Benish , then we &apos;re all talking about yoruba .
We talk to kogi .
You &apos;ll find a tract thing you &apos;ll want to say not to talk about their language .
Today I would like to do a journey through the ethnosphere --
a little journey in the ethnosphere to give you a massive of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forever , when I say , &quot; different ways of exists . &quot; I really mean , &quot; I really mean ,
We take for example this Barasana , in Amazon , in Amazon , the population of the anaconda , which creates the mixed of the high of the latest in the break of the heads of the horse of the horse of the heads of the heads of the heads of the Barasana , which creates the population of the Bar
It &apos;s a population that &apos;s not able to distinguished the blue color from the green because the cell is the full of the forest , where the population .
They have a language and a maybe a mathorrial , detail , &quot; Do you have to move a person who party language .
So , all of this has radical past , yet the particular arity is that in these families are or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven or languages .
They limiting to listen and then they begin to talk .
We take one of the most interesting tribes with which I &apos;ve lived , the Waoran Ecuador , an Ecuador , an incredible population , a population that has the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , they have a connection of a commitment .
They have been doing the photographs that they retraditional , they would have advice , forest that this population of the pluvial forest .
They have the ground photograph , they turned them to research a shape or a shape , they have conclush that they were the diavoy , and they have killed the favor , and they have killed the five missionaries with the lance .
But Waorans don &apos;t just killed the strange .
They kill they kill them .
54 percent of mortality was caused by their same .
We &apos;re slowed to eight generations and we found two of natural mors and when we insisted to know , they have admitted that one of them was invected , and then they killed it .
The hundred were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was asgned a very interesting comfortable when my professor of Harvard was assigned to Haiti and the Pholish societies and Tonton the basis of the power of the power of the power of the Running and Tonton Musush , and impossessing me to do the zome that I &apos;m used to do the zome that I &apos;m used to do the zome that I &apos;m going to go to Hachieve to Haiti for the zy Rean society .
To give a sense to miracy sense , I should have to take Vodoun culture and the Vodoun is not magnera .
It &apos;s pretty much a complex physics of the world .
It &apos;s interesting .
If I asked you to tell me great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddism , except , except .
A continent is always left out , thinking that Africa , thinking that Africa is always left is left . And he invaded it . And he &apos;s not not the distilled of these religious religious religious religious religious religious .
What makes interesting is the voodoo is the relationship between life and death .
So , the living people do nass .
And the spirits can be invocused by the Great , respond to the ritm of the dance and they replaced the dance of the vive in the way that we can do a short that for a short .
So , I &apos;m going to go to the wonderful voodooynload to talk about God .
We give God in the temple and become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re going to be able to be a huge you , how you can you do the mal ?
So you lit to these incredible events : followed voodoo in the state of trance that touches are touched in a rather strong-force demonstration .
And the people with the people who are the Kogi in the most amazing Kogi in Sierra Nevada Sierra Nevada Santa Marta , in Colombia .
It &apos;s going to be the ancivilization that once was living on the carbon planets of Colombia in the conquist , the population of the cohigh , the population of the carbic planture .
In a continent of blood , this population has never been conquised by the spagners .
But it &apos;s been government today , they &apos;re government , but their formation is really extraordinary .
The young people are taken out of the families to three or four years , and they live secret in a world of good and bombers in a bunch of the bag of the bag of the ice for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years , I choose to reproducing the nine months of gestation that transmit into the mother , now are metaphor , now are metaphor in the Great Mther .
So , this is happened to be acculated to the values of their society , values that their predicts and only their preger , and only their prevent balance .
At termine of this amazing , they &apos;re improvide taking out and the first time in their own , at the age of 18 years , they see a high high . And in that active basic , when the solution , the solution , when the solution of the beauty of the beauty is beauty .
&quot; I &apos;m going to say , I &apos;m going to tell you .
It &apos;s study . Now it &apos;s going to protect it . &quot;
They call it most most and they say that we , frackers , we are the pevolved of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think of Indigene and environment , we invoke Rau and the old story of the old story , which is a razy concept in his simplicity or maybe , or maybe we asked Thoreau and we say that these people are the most closer to the Earth of us .
Indigenes are not not not sentimental sentimental ,
There is no space for these things in the disease of the Aphasian or in the gelids of Tibet , but because of the time and the roughly , they created a mistic of Earth &apos;s not about the concept of the Earth &apos;s not about the concept that the Earth can live because it &apos;s just infected from the human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
He mean , a little little girl who is growing up with the mountain is a spirit of the mountain is a little bit of a full further and it will have a foundly different with the mountain or that we grow up with a mountain or the mountain a little bit of the Montana that growth is growing .
What &apos;s the dimour dimour or a high or a mineral cave .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that &apos;s the metaphor that defines the relationship between individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia creduck that the forests services .
And he realized me a different human being from my friends Kwaakiutl who creduck the forests are the dimour of Hukuk and the download of the paradise and the cannbs that live in the north of the world , the spirits that are in Hamatabath , the spirites that are in Hamatak .
If you start to consider that these cultures can actually actually , you can start to understand some of them , you can start taking some of them , we can start to understand some of them .
I went to the Western Amazon in the norder to be wonderful .
Mayahuash , I would have heard of the Eahuask , the most powerful support of the repertorium .
What it makes the fascinating ayahuask is not the drug of the pharmacological of the room , but his elaboration . It &apos;s about two elements .
At a side , this lian lian lian lian hydrowned series , harmine and harmit , harmine , harmful , harmful , harmful .
And by by the floor , you have a bluaser that altera little bit alterm that alterm , but it &apos;s myself with the floor of the family of the family of the family of the caffeck .
This is a plants of triptamines , very similar to serotonine , methoxyltryptamine-five , methoxyltryptams .
If you ever see the Yanomami , you &apos;ll see the Yanomami , which is a different set of species , which is a different kind of species , it &apos;s contained .
Tiring that policy is a little bit like to be a little bit like to be spared by a fucile of pins and back-hand-hand-hand shape on a move of the reality .
I had often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who wrote the psychedelic is the psychedelic , with his discovered in the &apos; 30 in the &apos; 30 in the &apos; 30 in Mexico .
Secondly my tesests can &apos;t classified these triptams like hallucinogens because if you &apos;re doing not tell anybody who are almost .
It &apos;s possible to assumerly only if you abunger , the MAs MAs .
Now , the beauty : the beauty of the carbbon , are the inibitors of MAs , the same kind of needs . And the resources of the same kind of time , like these are flow-like plant , like these are are doing these people , how they do these days are not similar , like these people are not similar , but if you combined in this way , they &apos;re not spending in this way , they &apos;re superiod of the parts ?
We use the great euphemism of the herror , which can reveal infrured .
But if we ask to the Indians , they &apos;ll say , &quot; Pholding us . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribes , Cofan , has 17 variety of Ehuask , which distinguish nectively in the forest , and that our eyes would be in the same species .
If we ask them how they stabilish their task us , they &apos;re going to say , &quot; I thought I was going to say that ? &quot; I have said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you get the 17 variety in a night of lone and each one will cut with a different different .
With this doesn &apos;t laure-laure-foot , but it &apos;s much more interesting than content that content the stami .
Now , &#91; ophistory &#93; the problem is that also the people who have the dies of us who have the history of the history , but somehow reduces of the history of history , and it turns out .
In fact , the 19th century , between 300 years , it will not remember for his wars or innovations , but rather than the technology , but rather than the stopped and we stopped active , or the way we stopped and we huge the planet . Now the problem is not changing .
All the cultures were involved in a dance for new possibility of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux , they don &apos;t have to be Sioux when they put up and further . And they have they have no standing from the horse and they have been horse and heads .
It &apos;s not the change or technology , or technology that mines the integrity of ethnosphere . It &apos;s the power .
I wall of domination .
And if you give you a look at the world , you &apos;ll find that these are not destinate cultures .
They are creatures and dynamic spins out of the identifiable forces that go beyond their capacity of adaptation .
Sia that &apos;s that it &apos;s a little bit of the thinking of --
a population of Sarawak , in the Sarawak , a population that has lived in the forest and the next reduction to a generation ago , and now reduck on the results of the restrices and the next reduction of the free , where you can see the Borneo to the Meridional Cinese Merional Cinese Merional , where the naves the North Merional naves , where the navailumb the naves , where the named Borite naves the high nore names the neo the way of the Norite the Norest ,
You have to requires with the stys with the broken to the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that are the discovery of those .
If we move on the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the politics .
You know the genocide , the physics of a population , is condaned to the universal level , but the ethnight , the distriction of the style of the population of a population , but it &apos;s not only condan-condan-developed , because it &apos;s makes part of the development .
And you can &apos;t understand the soft of Tibet until you don &apos;t go from the beginning .
I &apos;ve been alone in the Western China in Western China in Western Cina in Western Lhasa with a young , but only only the statistics of Lhasa , but only record to Lhasa , but only the statistics of we hear .
6,000 mountains roughly in policy and cens .
1.2 million people killed from the military Revolution .
The father of this guy was absolutely to Panchen Lama .
The means that it was killed to say that it was killed to the Chinese invasion .
I &apos;m under Santity in Santity in Santity during the death that has taken the population in Nepal .
She was imprised and his column was to be recired .
It was taken to carry in carefully career to the age of two hundred of her nails because he wouldn &apos;t have to live without him .
The sister , who did the same , it was messed in the result .
A day has been inavverted a day has been a raffigant fashion Mao and , for this transgression , was messed to work for seven years .
The Pore of Tibet can be insoppable , but the reduction of the population is from the population is keeping .
At the end , all of it &apos;s reduces .
We want to live in the world world world world world &apos;s a handle or we want to collect the policromatical world ?
The great anthropologa Margaret Mead , before we die said that his bigger was that , in our love to this love love gamma of the world , we &apos;re not just going to see the whole gamma of human imagination , but a day we &apos;re going to wake us to a limitation of thought , but a day we &apos;re going to sleep us to a sonce we &apos;re going to sure that were other possibility .
And it &apos;s a huilant to remember that our species is existed for 60,000 years .
The Neolitic Revolution , which has given us the agriculture , which has done us to the cult of the sea , which has been remarkable to the simply of the clero , creating the gerarchy of specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The industrialized world has 300 years .
And that square history that we have the answers to all the challenges that we &apos;re going to go .
When these cultures of the world is asked what it is to say to be human , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all returned the possibility of being what we are : a kind of consciousness , which has to be what all population and all the people and all the people and all the people can fall .
I went to the north of Baffin , when I went to Baffin , when I went to the history of Baffin , when I went to the Inuit , and this man , he told me the story of his grandmother .
The government has not always been gentile with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to stay our own own , we have them in colonies .
The nonnon-man of this man was refused to go .
And the family , I &apos;m going to take her life , and all the arms , and all his loves .
You have to know that Inuit doesn &apos;t look at the cold , they &apos;re sframework .
The patters of the slites were made of fish were made of papers in the carebs .
The non-grandmother was not made from the arten &apos;t the artic night , or the blizy-blizing .
It &apos;s health , it &apos;s calculated the pins of foca and defens in their hand . When the focus . When the fecket them have congent .
He was based on the room of this crowned crowned , and when it became solid , he killed a dog .
He schools and created a bridge , with the casses , with the toward casses , he has a sliter , he has imbried another dog and it &apos;s bancha , cold , cold telling telling clean .
We want to talk to clear with nothing ?
In the fact , 1999 , the government has reduced to the total control of a crazy area of California and Texas , and Texas mas together .
It &apos;s their new patries . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a territory territory . They controlate all the resources .
One of the splendido like a national national state can recognize with his population .
And , finally , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious , I think it &apos;s been in these zones of the planet , make it not remote .
For somebody &apos;s house .
They become part of human imagination that will be risallow to the alalba of the time . And for all these kids , as the dreams of the kids , as the dreams of the heads of the hope .
Finally , we are National Geographic , we are convints that politicians will never arrive .
We believe that polemical .
&#91; &#91; Applauses is not persuasive , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month to tell our stories . Every month to tell .
156 countries our canal television .
Our reviews are seven from millions of people .
Our work is traveling in the ethnosphere to bring our public in the way , and they will go out of what they &apos;re going to have and hope , you know , they &apos;re hope , they &apos;re going to get it , they will hope to be a focus in the different different different different , and we need to find a style of life in the different pluralista and multicultural world to find a style and multicultural world to find out what they &apos;re going to find out of the different pluralists in the different different different different different different different different pluralists in the different different pluralists of the different different different different different plural
where the gegegegegegegegegeess can contributed to our collective benefits .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things I wrote about this book that I &apos;m going to talk about some of the book that you &apos;ve heard and I &apos;m going to evidence some collegents , in case not notice .
I would like to start with what I call &quot; the dogma dogma . &quot;
The dogma official of what ?
The dogma official of all of all of the Western industrial . The dogma official , &quot; If we want to male the benefit of our citizen . &quot;
The reason , from a side , in fact that liberty is in the fact that liberty is in the same value , is precious , useful , useful , useful , useful , essential for human .
Another is in fact that if we &apos;re libers , each of us can agree to do everything that massive our benefit , without no one who decided in name .
The way to male the liberty is to male .
More choices people are more free , and most free is their liberty , most of them is their well-being .
This , I think , it &apos;s so deep in the society that no one is dreams of a dream would be able to doubt .
And it &apos;s also deply radicated in our lives .
I &apos;ll show you some examples of what progress has possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly great .
I lost a simple note on condent .
In my supermarket , there are 175 condents , without content , without contextreme of oil , and the 12 acets of olive and the 12 acets that you can buy a number of condents in the restaural remarkable to the result that no one of the 175 already .
This is the supermarket .
Then you go to the store of electronic to buy a stereo : case , CD , radio , radio , radio , radio , radio ,
And in this single negotion of electronents , there &apos;s a big number of audio .
We can realize six and a half million combinations using the components that there are only one .
You have to admit that there is a little choice .
Also , the world of the communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all the serve phone , they could have all the serve phone , the basic that were forniture from the mamma Bell .
It was born , he was born , he didn &apos;t buy it .
A consequence of that , the phone , it was that the phone was never going to do .
These are drawings .
Now , we have a variety of phones , especially between the cellphone .
Here &apos;s the cellphone of the future .
MP3 is the favorite , MP3 , MP3 , cut the nose , and forts for the bull-to-roughly ,
If you don &apos;t have seen in the negotiate under , you &apos;re certain that it will be going to be .
And what &apos;s the end is that people are going to get in the nearly and does this question . And you know what &apos;s the answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cellphone that doesn &apos;t do too many things .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the busters , you will be the same explosion of choices .
Asancitarian health health : not happen in the United States that you &apos;re going to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do it , or the other benefits , &quot; As &quot; has these benefits . &quot; What do you want ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Dr. &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; It has these benefits , and these benefits , and these benefits . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you realize , &quot; Dr. &quot; If you &apos;d be me , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; I &apos;m not . &quot;
The result of the result , &quot; the reverse , &quot; expression that makes it seems a beautiful thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not a lot of the fish and responsibility to take a decisions that &apos;s going to have something , which is the doctor , which is the doctor , and almost certainly it &apos;s not in the patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing of drugs , direct to people like me and you , who if you think there doesn &apos;t have any sense , because you think it &apos;s not a sense , because we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why do they published them ?
The answer is that they want to domacin called the doctor to ask them to change the recise .
Something about this is our identity as is our hythemselves , as you see in this jail , &quot; We don &apos;t want to force the kids . &quot; We &apos;re going to do the kids . &quot; We &apos;re not going to do . &quot; We don &apos;t want to be a full hythical .
And we can reinvent us how many times us aggrad .
The means that every morning , to the risk , you have to decide that kind of person wants to be .
I pect the family and mathemselves , a time the next community , a time , it was that it was almost anyone , it was that it was that there was the most possible , and he started to make the most of the present possible .
The only choice was with who , and nothing that was , and nothing about what to do after .
Everyday , all is really to play .
I think about a very smart students , and I think they &apos;re going to work on less than a time .
And it &apos;s not because they &apos;re not not because they &apos;re not not because they &apos;re free .
But because I &apos;m impensieritites , I would say , &quot; Do I would say , &quot; I would say it now ? &quot;
&quot; I should I spose to myself before I first sent to think about the ball or career ? &quot;
They are interrogogogorant .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this implica not to the compititites that segment and not to get a bel wonderful watch .
And they have to do it . They have to do it .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , as Carl Sottoleen us , because the technology allows us to work every day , from Hotel Randolph .
It was parentesis , there &apos;s a angle , and I &apos;m not going to tell anybody , where where the WiFi works .
I &apos;m not I say that , because I want to use me .
What means , this amazing liberty of choice we have to do that ? It &apos;s that we have to continuously , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son &apos;s going to see our son , with the cellphone in a task , the Blackberry in the other , and the night , and the night , on the ginockberry .
And even if they &apos;re all spended , every minute we see our son , we also see our son , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; I have to say , &quot; I have to answer this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? &quot; I have to go this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , &quot; that makes the experience of your son , very different than the way it would be in other conditions .
So , from any of any of the things we look at , little things and big , the materials and style , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : Over , there were some possibility , but it was not a question of choice .
The world today looks like this : The dilemma is , &quot; It &apos;s a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Shurt .
We all have to say them all , so I &apos;m going to talk about that negative .
All this choice is two effects negative effects of negative effects .
The first , paradossally , is that it &apos;s producing instead of free .
And many of the frankly choices , it becomes very hard to do it .
I offer an example , meaning an example : one study conduct on the planet .
A college has been access to the data of Vantual , the giant society of the world , with about a million climbed climbed in 2,000 different companies .
What you have discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of adesion , the percentage of the adesion two percent .
With 50 source of offered , there &apos;s 10 percent of the adesions of the adesions , only five . Why ?
Because with 50 source frames that choice , is maleased to decide , and the choice is remanded to the indomorange .
And by domorrow , and still domorous , domorances , of course , domorous , and of course , it &apos;s never going to be .
You know that you don &apos;t mean , that these works that are going to eat because they don &apos;t have enough enough money , because they don &apos;t have enough money , it also , it &apos;s so host that they allow the complementary of the job of the job .
It &apos;s not teaching , they &apos;re allow-dollars from the work , which would be disposed to be train .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too too many choices .
And I think it &apos;s going to make the world .
&quot; And finally , for the eternity : ketchup , or maybe it &apos;s a huge , &quot;
You would like to take the right decision , if it &apos;s for ethernity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and nepurpure the wrong condent .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can avoid the paralysis , we &apos;re not satisfying from the result of how we would have been with less options in the result of how we would have been with less options .
And that &apos;s a different reasons .
One of these is that with many of the condent , if you buy , you buy a little bit of it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to make a different choice that you could have have a different choice that &apos;s been better . And what &apos;s the alternative imagined us , and the remains the remains of choice , and the remains the software , and the sure of the sure , and the satisfying from the decision ,
even when it was a good decision .
More choices are easy to be able to be able to be able to be insoftware .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has clear very well as the value we &apos;re going to depend things that we &apos;re going to confrontier .
As the rest , when there are many options , it &apos;s easy to represent the career of alternative patterns that &apos;s choice is choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m going to go with all that are not New York .
But it &apos;s what you would probably think .
There &apos;s this coppia coppia .
A place of lussions .
It &apos;s beaviond . It &apos;s all about them .
It &apos;s not eat anything . But what he thought is , &quot; Well , malite , is Agost . &quot;
&quot; All my nearly nearly . &quot;
&quot; I could talk about home . &quot;
And he spend two weeks , assilate from the idea that &apos;s dying -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The cost-opportunity is dealing for what we have , even when the choice was , even when the choice was eccellent .
And the most are the options we have to consider , more the characteristic characteristic characteristic characteristic .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
We talk about the living time , and maybe the time , and maybe the living .
But the most important point is that anything you choices , you get you , you choose you to do other .
The things we don &apos;t choose to do less attractive active thing that can make less attractive what we do .
Tirst : the growth of expectations .
I tried to my skin stars , and I buy a new couple of jeans .
I &apos;m going to almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were a kind of besides and western from the besides , they were slowed , only after they took them a lot of times , they started to go well .
So I went to buy a couple of a couple of , when that old those old were going , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
And he said , &quot; What does does want to be slim , relaxy , relaxy and fit ? &quot;
You want to the cernly or bottons ? &quot; Stonewashed , &quot; or &quot; Do you have a hydrwashed , &quot;
&quot; Lave them streets ? &quot;
&quot; Sight the non-to-bla or streets . &quot;
I was going to say , &quot; I want to say , &quot; I want the kind of , &quot; I want the kind of -- which was the only guy , &quot; He had no idea that was , so for a little bit of what was , and then I went out of the negoth , then I went out from the negoth , I would have ever .
It was the massive . I had all that choice had the best .
But I was worse .
Why ? I wrote a book for caps .
The reason I was worse with the same thing is that with all the expectations were altissim , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was going to have expectation . I didn &apos;t expected to do anything , when there was only a kind of a kind of , but when it &apos;s visual , when it was a horse .
What I had buy was good , but not perfect .
After I talked to the choices that I was trying to be insoon in confront of the expectations .
The adaddition of the people don &apos;t do that expectations that these are respect to the ectcell of the options of the options of options .
And that will producing less square , even when the results are good .
None in the marketing world , if it makes it .
Because if they knew it , you would not know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more than this .
&quot; It was better when he was worse , &quot; The reason &quot; The reason he was better when he was worse , he was worse when he was worse .
Everyday , the world we live -- opulent , industrialized , citizen , the maxption of perfection -- the massive that we can hope is that things are in the heighborhood .
You never have surprised full because your expectations , the expectations , you &apos;re ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- it &apos;s , &quot; Basse expectations . &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , you want . &quot;
I mean -- little autobiographic moment -- which are really sposed and my wife is really study .
I wouldn &apos;t have to do better , I &apos;m not going to do .
But it &apos;s not always good .
And finally , a consequence of buy a couple of jeans is when there &apos;s only that you &apos;re not saying , when you &apos;re not saying , and you ask you , &quot; Why ? &quot;
What &apos;s responsible ? &quot;
The world is responsible . What can I do you do you do you do it ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a task you who are the responsible , and you ask you who is the responsible , it &apos;s otherwise you .
You &apos;d have better better .
With hundreds of variety , there are no scale .
So when people take decisions , even if the result is valid , they feed the short of them and they give the column .
In the last years , the last few depression is exploss in the industrialized world .
I think a meaning full -- not the only one , but important -- of this depression of depression is just that people have experiences of the people are experiences because the standard is too high .
And when they must explain this situation thinking that the color is their color .
So the final result is that in general , we &apos;re better better , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely falong . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit better than it &apos;s better than it &apos;s better than it &apos;s better than it &apos;s better than it &apos;s better than a little bit better than a little bit better than a little bit .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic . I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve been surprised by a piece of the level where the impressed our life .
Now , from political point , I almost finished -- from the political point of view , the nocle is the following .
What allows you to have this choice in the industrial society is the material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is they have too little little bit little .
So the factory I &apos;m talking about is a malesclusive of modern modern , recidwarming societies .
And what it does to do is this : Steve Levitt has talked about how much those things that is going to be a high seats and behind seats for books . It &apos;s a spread of money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and dispendent , it &apos;s not just that they &apos;re just just unuseful .
They &apos;re addicting of the electricity .
They do it worse .
If a little bit of what in our societies , it &apos;s going to be reversed in those where people have too few possibility , it would not just be just a little bit of possibility , it would not just be better , but it &apos;s also our better .
This is what economists call a horgation .
A reduction of reduction is good at all -- not only the poor -- not only because of this choice in the except that you go .
To conclude , you can become all of what you want &quot;
You , people who are you thinking , you &apos;ll think , &quot; What &apos;s it creates that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t make it in a glass of glass . &quot;
A castrated , a limited vision , a limitation of the world -- &quot;
and I &apos;m interpreted this , in the beginning .
But then , thinking about , I realized , I realized that that fish the long-class .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you eat the mock , so that &quot; everything is possible . &quot; You can &apos;t get the freedom .
If you rometwork in a way that everything divent possible diminuits sodisphation .
You bad the paralysis , and you reduck the benefit .
They all need a sfood .
This is almost certainly too much , maybe even for the fish , and it &apos;s certainly for us .
But the assumption of some symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic for the running of the running of some symbolic symbolic symbolic symbol
Thank you very much cuor cuor .
