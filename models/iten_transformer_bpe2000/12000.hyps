The year I showed these slide to show that the calculus to show that the glacial glacial , which for all three million years has had the size of 48 .
It &apos;s a lot of the type of the problem because not showing it the spextent of the ice .
The calculation glacial glacial , the heart heart of the global system .
It &apos;s expande inside and reverse .
The next 25 slide is going to be a re-re-house realized return out of the last 25 years .
The ice ice ice ice gets are drawn in red .
As you see , you know , you get out to the blue .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter , which is the gades .
You can see that the ice cosid-year-old , or more , or more , it &apos;s like the sanks , that &apos;s like the blood , that &apos;s a slights .
In 25 years is spending so ,
This is a problem because the interested in the ocean , and the return around the ocean artment where there are huge amount of conger congar conged that , you know , they &apos;re transformed in metan .
It &apos;s a totality of the inquent intuition from the crowd , that quantity could rads , that we can rads , surface this point of not .
In some laghi pain in Alaska , the metan is rebecting from water .
The professority of the University of the University of Alaska , and a team later , a lick scored .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Seeye is well . The question is if we &apos;re going to be .
A reason is that this term term that this surgermal scale from the north .
This is a glacial figlacial .
The brought was never reached to reach spending .
This is the Kangerlusues , in the south of the Groenland .
If you want to know how the level of the sal level to the sal of the ice , here is where you can reach .
These corrents are aumenting .
At the other part of the planet : Antartis , the largest block of the planet .
The month of the scientists have diared that the ice of the ice is in negative , and that the Antartde , and that Antartes , which is a lot of the sunlight , that &apos;s particular , is particular realized in the science .
Equires of the action of action , like in Greenland .
Sulla Himalaya , the third biggest block , you see new laghes , you see new laghes , who was grights .
The 40 percent of the world &apos;s population remarkable water from the power of the power of the power of the world .
Sulle Ande : this ice ice ice is the source of the water of this city .
The brought is aumented .
But when you diminutes , the same access water .
In California , the Sierra is diminutes .
The background is in crisis .
The prevision , like you have , they &apos;re gravians .
The growth care in the world &apos;s door to a notevole of incends .
The environmental disassuming a run out of the normal and without preceds .
Four times more numerous in the last 30 years , I &apos;ve got 75 .
This is a wonderful watching .
If you look at the context , if they can see the consequences .
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 tons of CO2 hours .
Look at the U.S.
Most of the global warming , together to the deforestation , with the deforestation , which is the 20 percent , is the use of the size .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States are one of the two of the countries , together to China .
And he was proponed to build a lot of other central central .
But we &apos;re assisting a change .
These are the annative projects in the last years , and some of the high-version .
And every way , there &apos;s a politics in our country .
The carbon industries and oil has spested 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon , which is a hosyming , which is a hosyming .
And that imagine me remember something --
I &apos;m Natal , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion pounds of carbon .
Maybe you saw it seen the news .
This is the largest flexual fflussing in America .
It happened around Natal .
The published .
Video : â™« Fross the carbon is a kind of a sleg and happy .
It &apos;s ababondant here in America , and it &apos;s growing our economy .
Fross the carbon is always more and more and more .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and the works and the works .
Al Gore : Da here is very much part of the West Virginia .
The largest society on the mountain is Massey Coal . This is his love .
Video : Don Bland : I &apos;m going to clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelost , Harry Reid -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Protetion of Clima Protetion of Clim .
This is a part of the one of the one .
Video : Attor : Attor we see the climate change like a minute of climate change like a minute of our business .
So , our priority is invest a great amount of money in a hority of money in a public forced and confuses the verity of carbon .
In fact , the carbon is not sport .
We think it &apos;s also a good profound -- it &apos;s also a good profumb .
So , not predictable of climate change .
Let me do us .
Video : Attor : Atttor , you &apos;ve heard very .
So let me take a game in a structure of a car .
Straditional car . The machines are a bit , but this is the sound of the technology of the carbon .
The carbon is between the car cycle of global warming , but the notion of global carbon , but the technology of the carbon .
Do you have a look : this is the technology of carbon .
Al Gore : Inend , the alternative positive to the economic issue and that of the national security .
Video : Mment America is in the crisis ; the national security , the national crisis .
The phils that the college of all , our dependence from the beautiful , like the carbon and the oil and the important oil .
Now , perhaps there is a new , solution for the usual solution .
Repower America : 100 percent of the energy , in the diectors .
A pian to put America to work , make us more sure , and help us to help the global rescaling .
Finally , a solution that baste to solve our problems .
Repower America . Scprise .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Mment : Yeah .
One of the faster moon of the fast dependence from the bustible dependence that kills our planet .
She talked about : The future is here . I &apos;m sunlight , a new energy .
Sometimes you &apos;re not in the retribuuted for places .
She &apos;s got to be realists . It &apos;s time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old old old old a proverbian old old old , you go to spend , you go to the sunlight , you go to .
If you want to go away , you go together . &quot;
We have to go away , we have to go away ,
Thank you very much .
The year at TED fected in TED fectors .
And I remember to reach you to go to the car .
So , here &apos;s the big scientific experiment . And for those other time , there was the largest experiment , ever the great scientific experiment .
His compit is to reach the conditions that were less than a billion second from the universe , at 600 million times the universe -- until at 600 million times the second .
All of all is just environment .
This is the machine under Ginevent .
We pictured these mini-Bang Bang &apos;s dinside .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- it &apos;s large 44 feet and has a 22 feet .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in buildings so you can see the proportions .
The 10 sepember of the scored year we have accested the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was because of immense of immense festhegaments in the control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first phasy of particles that he had done all the grise of LHC , and we &apos;re going to a part of the LHC , and it &apos;s very diffon-level .
In other words , when we see that picture the 10 sepember , we understand that the machine worked , the machine worked , which is a great vittoria .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to do it , when somebody went on Google and vide that page was this .
What means we &apos;ve had a cultural impact cultural impact .
And it &apos;s a week after , there was a problem with the machine , and just just this this phils here -- these dorates .
These phils bring 13,000 amping when the car machine works to the mass of power .
Now , the technical technical phils and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . They &apos;re not true . They &apos;re too very good . &quot;
And they can do that because when they &apos;re very freedom .
So , at less 271 degrees , at a temperature of space , these phils can bring that .
In one of the young ger novemile , the magnetic magnetic .
So the phils surrounded , and 13,000 amping , and 13,000 amping .
This was the result .
Now , this is still more impressive if you think that these magneties are more than 20 tons , and that are spot of about 30 feet .
They &apos;re dannegate about 50 magnetes .
We had to touch them , what we did .
We repristinted and traveled .
And now they &apos;re going to get all of their socket .
Enger the end of the LHC will be again .
We &apos;re going to happen , and we expect the data , or the sunlight , and continuing to the sound , and continuing to discover what they &apos;re morning .
Now , of course , in a way , these remainly return the dibad of science and engineering engineering . It &apos;s easy to confuture .
I think that the fact that &apos;s so hard , the fact that &apos;s the value of things like LHC .
I &apos;d like to conclude with a scientist of Inglese scientist , Humphrey Davy , the imagine , the imagine , in difeside , his bael .
Thank you .
I want to start asking to rethink about when , children , from children , you get cool .
Whereas you get them and make them , take them and get them , take them and moving , and you &apos;re going to think and solve problems and realized and realized relationship .
The reason is project is deeply connected to the way we understand grain in the world , we understand .
So , from the train , from the uslity of our interaction with physics , together at my consulent Path , and my collaborator , and my collaborator , I started ask , I asked , &quot; If we &apos;re a computer , when we &apos;re a computer , when we &apos;re a computer , we could have the switch a wind , we could have a wind , we could have a desktop , we could have a desktop with the hand , we &apos;re going to be a hunting ,
and systems our piacement systems ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , and build the answer , and build the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a great computer .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a great computer .
You can move with the hand , they can be , &quot; You can see , &quot; You can see , &quot; you can hear and a rune .
But on the top , are physics , like the morning , like the morning , you can move simply .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of a type of the digital information .
And as a manding more physics , knows of the other , of the other , of the other , and they become more physics , we can explain , of the other , of the other , like , we can explore new and different stils .
I &apos;m going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show it , if you encline in a direction , the video gured , the video grise .
These results are interactive , are conscious .
If you &apos;re interested in , they &apos;re interested in .
If they come circle , notants , and they can agitate a little bit .
If they come circle , notants , and they can agitate a little bit .
They also truck their movement and inclination .
We realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power to use of the data , you know , &quot; to be a color like a color like a color like if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurated as a center of versation and I can use them to be able to slide in the central , where you &apos;re miss .
and I can use them to be able to train the color in the central , where they &apos;re asking .
If we &apos;re going to be too , we can put a little bit .
They also have a beautiful possibilities of appears , like the languages , the mathematics and ployees where people can try and try and see things .
I &apos;m going to --
This is a sequence of Fibonacy that I do with a program .
Here we have a game of words that &apos;s half between Scarabeo and Boble .
Pratically , you know , every remainly , a letter in the case of the Siftable , Pratically , a letter in the case of the Siftable , and while I &apos;m going to comporary , and while I &apos;m going to control .
Then , after about 30 seconds of remissing , and you have a new switch and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the kids came to the Media Lab , I did , and I was made them and gave a video .
They &apos;re very much placiuted .
And one of the interesting things of this application is that you don &apos;t have to get people .
You have to say , &quot; Compons of words , and they &apos;re exactly exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s those other people who try it .
This is our test tester test young , there on the right .
It was actually just just a lot of them .
They were only morning .
Now , this is an application of a interactive carton .
We wanted to build a type for the approach of language is Felix .
It can inserve the new characters in the scenes , solve the Siftable .
It can inserve the new characters in the scenes , solve the Siftable .
So , it &apos;s doing the sole .
Video : The source is source .
David Merriled : Now he took a treator in the scenes .
Video : The aranum aranum .
By work ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah !
So schooling the Siftable and put the neighborhood ,
Video : Bau !
And by inventing their history .
Video : Coke !
DM : It &apos;s a history with open , and it can decide it as you svolving .
DM : It &apos;s a history with open , and it can decide it as you svolving .
Video : Vola , gets .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tument , realized , to watch and exequeen .
It &apos;s a realized , realized , to watch and exeguy .
The Siftable here is against sounds like basis , based and bacteria .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can get it .
You can also inserious sounds in a sequence from your places .
And modificate it just doing a sound sound , &quot; and a sound . &quot;
These are actually actually you can control from vive , like the reverse and the phils .
The attacks a particular sound and then inclines to go to it .
And then there are the general effects like time and fly , that they &apos;re just going to interested in the sequence .
Let &apos;s look at how .
Video : We &apos;re going to start a base in two Siftable , &quot; sequence , &quot; sequence , we &apos;re going to add , we add , we add , we add , we add , we add other .
Now , a basic lines .
Video : Now , I add the percusons --
Video : I &apos;ll put the phils , so I can control the bacteria , so I can control the effect of vive .
Video : I can reach the interested sequence the interested sequence , and the time from a late ,
Video : I &apos;ll add the phils to the base phils to get more expression .
Video : I can reach the sequence of the floor . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to be planning , but I can make it a lot more .
And now , finally , I can sell the intera squence sequence in the left Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , like , you can see , my passion is build new man always in the way of the machine as our brain and .
And today , I &apos;ve got time to show you one of the result of this percourt , and also some possibilities that we &apos;re going to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmate is that &apos;s getting this new generation of objects , to interact with medigital media , that will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time to talk to all of you .
They &apos;re a written .
It &apos;s the book is my profession , but it &apos;s more than this , of course .
It &apos;s also the love and the fascrop of my life .
And I don &apos;t expect that you can change .
But , said , something about particular successful , something happened in my life and in my career , who took me to realiber the interested with this work .
The particular thing is that I &apos;ve recently wrote this book , this biography called &quot; Manterm , Pua , Pra , Pra , Ama , for some reason , for some reason in the world and become a great , for some reason in the world and become a great , sensitional , book , and become a great sationy , and it was become a great sationship ,
And the result is that anyone now , people treated me as if they were condanced .
Davoid -- condanned , condanned !
They &apos;re going to be worried and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t do you do not do more ?
You don &apos;t have to keep continuing to write for all of life without being able to create a book that can be able to make a book that ? &quot;
What can you know ?
It &apos;s rassicity , you know .
But it could go worse , at part of the 20 years ago , when I started to say , when I started to say , people -- I was a very huge .
I was going to met the same based by the pursue .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you have successful to have success ?
You don &apos;t have the pursue of the reft-kills ?
You don &apos;t have to do this move to the whole life without the life without the whole life without out and death on a cumule of all the sunnurts with the south of care ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the answer to all of these questions is , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
Yeah , I have a couple of all of those things .
I always had always been a couple .
And I have also fear of many other things that people can &apos;t inate .
As the tree and other things like the treatment and other things .
But , how much about how to write that what I thought and I was asking me and asked me is why ?
Is it ratic ?
It &apos;s logic that anyone who has been spot by a job that you feel hold to do .
But what &apos;s about so particular in the creative impressing to make us ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and not remember one one sunce 40 years of activity in the 40 years of activity in which was asking ?
There was never -- that block about the engineer John , how does it ?
It wasn &apos;t it worked , what ?
Only , the engineers like group , they have not certainly , in the centuries , dagned the reputation of being colized .
We have a scring , we have enough this reputation , and not only creative of every gender , we have this reputation of being an instable instable .
And I don &apos;t realize that you look at the conteged of the magnifies that , only in the 20th century , just in the 20th century , they died , they died .
And the ones that are not suickly to be realized by their dones .
Norman Mailer , before I died , in the last interview said , &quot; Every much more . &quot; Every much more . &quot; A very much more . &quot; A very much more .
But we don &apos;t bad when we heard this because we heard these things so we &apos;ve heard these things that we &apos;ve completely interiorized and accepted the notion that the creativity and the sufference that the creativity and the art , you &apos;ll always reduce it .
And the question I want to bring all about today : are you agree with this idea ?
It &apos;s good at this -- because you also go to a distance from a distance of distance , it &apos;s not good for anything .
I think it &apos;s odiosa .
And I think it &apos;s also pericangerous and I don &apos;t want to see the perpetuate in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encouraging our large creative ments .
And I &apos;m sure that , in my case -- in my case -- it would be very pericangerous to start to figing out of the suppositions , on the circumstances in which I &apos;m in my careful .
Or -- look at look , look , I &apos;m pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I still about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that any thing about now , I &apos;m going to write , and it &apos;s going to be playing that after the world as the work that was going to be successful .
I &apos;m going to slaving , because we &apos;re all more or less friends here -- is likely that my biggest success .
Oh , Gesus , who think .
You know this is the gender of thinking that that &apos;s a person to start to start bleg gin the nine of the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would like to keep this work that we &apos;re going to do this work that .
So , the question is becomes , how ?
And so it seems , after many reflection , that the way to keep a construct of creating a psychological costruck , OK ?
I have a sure of a sure of safety between me , that I writing , and my natural natural , and my natural natural , and I &apos;m trying to get it . And as I was trying to do it . And as I was trying to do it through time , and I could have to look at the time , and I could have the world to see if I could have the best ideas and more several ideers and more spointed ides and more sours and more sounds and more slights and more sure .
to help people in the creative people in the retains risks of creative creative .
And that research me to the ancient Grex and ancient Roma .
Seguitems because he gave up to the circle and then back .
In the ancient Grex and ancient Roma -- people don &apos;t think that creativity become drop , OK ?
It thought that creativity was this spirit about divine and that was sitting to a few distant and soughts , for a lot of distant and soughts .
The greatest divines about the human beings .
She &apos;s wonderful , created that , created a demone that &apos;s wisdom from the wisdom .
Romans were the same idea , but they call that kind of spirit without a gene .
which is great , because Romans didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a very smart .
They have a genius that a genius was this kind of involved in the lake of a study of a artist , a little bit like the Dobby , a little bit like the Dobby , and that &apos;s going to be hard to assister , and that &apos;s going to be a result of that work .
Here &apos;s a real -- here is the distance of what I &apos;m talking about -- that costruth you have to protected your work .
And all of the knowledge , right ?
So , the antiantianties were protected by certainly , like the threatening , no ?
If your work was excetional work was excetional , you could have been helped by this genius .
If your work , if your fallide , it was not all all the colpattern , right ?
Everybody knew that was a huge incapable .
And so people concept the creativity in Occident time .
Then the Rind came and everything changed and all changed , and we put this great idea ; we put the the universe , we put the universe of the universe , and without the universe , and without the creatures that they write from the divinity .
This was the principle of the human rational . And people started thinking that creativity become complete .
And for the first time in history , you referred to this or the first one of a kind of played that , a piece of the genius .
And I have to tell you , I think that was a big herror .
I think that allow someone , a simple person to believe that a reciplent reciplent like the source , the essence and the source of all of the mysters , creative , creative , and you know , a very large responsibility .
It &apos;s like a ask of some of the sole .
And we shape and completely the ego and creates all of these initible expectable .
And I think that was this pression to the artists in the 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it &apos;s , the question is , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe back to a more ancient commercial of the relationship between human and mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t song years of thinking about 18 years of thinking about 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience that solve , the scientific solve , unclear , under , you know , you do that , you do do , you do that , you do do that .
I &apos;m not going to convince you all about this .
But the question I want to bring is -- why don &apos;t it ?
Why don &apos;t we think about this way ?
Because it has more sense of every other thing that has ever heard to explain the exaspering exhibition of the process of creative process .
A process that , like anyone who ever ever ever , you &apos;ve ever been doing something -- so , all here -- you know , you don &apos;t have a rationally .
And , in fact , it can be completely paranormal .
I did this meet recently , with the extraordinary strake strake Stone , who now 90 , but that was a very poetic for all life and said that he was in the Virginia , working out in the Virginia , and he was hear , when a poem , when a poem of the experience .
He said that he was like a fragorous train .
And that was rolating to the sleep of the page .
He heard it was going to hear , because he was under the land under its its .
He had a solute thing to do that point and he was , and he was , &quot; corring how a mathemselves . &quot;
And so it turns out to the house and he was slowed by this poetry , and it would have to take a piece of card and a mathemselves , while the sound , and it &apos;s a page , and he would realize it .
At three times he couldn &apos;t be fast enough , so corrupt and corrupt and corrupt and the house was going to get back and the house and she would continued to roled through the country , and he would continued to rolate through the country , and he would continued to go to the way . &quot;
Then there were times -- this piece of the same piece of the moments that the time he was almost perdying , OK ?
So , he was corring house and he was trying to the poetry and the poetry and he was going to be a math in the spend , and then he said , and then he said , and then he was , and he was like , and he was like , and he was going to hungases .
He was going to cut the poetry and remainly in his body and the transction was page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented to the page and intouched , but the last word .
So when I heard it -- it &apos;s a couple , it &apos;s exactly exactly the creative process .
It doesn &apos;t all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conducture .
I &apos;m a moving , and my way to work is ; I &apos;m sure to sweather and spend and go and go and go and go out .
But even , in my testardaggine , I aggines , I control that , sometimes .
And I imagine that also many of you have a lot of you .
You know , if the work and ideas to the work and ideas was source you can &apos;t know .
What is this ?
And how can we relationship us to do it , not allow us to do it ?
For how much I remember , the best example of the contemporary contemporary contemporary , which I &apos;ve interviewed a days .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life is the incarnation of the artist of the artist of the artist , trying to control , and trying to control , and care these species of interested in .
But then , I &apos;ll get calculated , and a day , and a day when he was driving on a bunch at Los Angeles , changed everything .
He was wonderful and all of a sent , this little little frammal framming , which is wonderful , that it &apos;s wonderful , and the head , and the remains , and the would be , and the desident , and the desider , and the desident , and the desident , and the desidently , and the would be , but it &apos;s not like to take it .
It has no piece of card , not have a mathemselves a region .
So , he started heavy this species of ansia grow in him , &quot; the site to lost , and he remark up from this song of this personally .
I don &apos;t know good enough and I can &apos;t make it cell . &quot;
And he &apos;s going to go to the panic , you stop .
And he was going to be the mental process and made something completely again .
And I &apos;m going to just the sky and said , &quot; Scuses , I &apos;m not saying that ? &quot;
&quot; You know , you know , what can you write a song ?
If you really want to exist , you get back to a more more than when I can take me care .
All of the importantly , you go to the importance of the other today .
You &apos;re going to disturbing Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his process , and his process ,
Not work , the work was still hoscure as always .
But the process , and the ansia that was retered it was retered when the genium , the genius , the genius that he was going to be returned out to the back of where he came out , and realized that he was going to be an interested in .
But it was a little bit of this peculiar , wonderful bizart between Tom and this is very strange . And this is that it wasn &apos;t Tom .
So how much of the story of what changing a little bit about it , and already , and already was saved .
This idea , I saved me when I was written , Pra , Pra , Am , and I &apos;m going to be a cave of the disperation that we &apos;re working on and we &apos;re working on something and we &apos;re going to think that &apos;s going to be a disaslear , that &apos;s going to be a disask , that what the worse is going to be .
Not only , just the worst book , right right .
And I started thinking about gets this project .
But then I remember Tom that talks about the air and try .
So I went to my face in the hoscritish and I direst my comments to a hangle of room .
And I said to move , &quot; Sends , what , we know , if this book is not going to be brilliant not interested in my own , no ?
Because as I &apos;m seeing us all that I &apos;ve never got this .
So if you want to be better , you have to be a lot of the way , you have to do your part .
Okay . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know , I don &apos;t do anything .
I &apos;m going to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I want to favor that I was registred to do my part of the &quot; because -- at the end , OK -- at the end of the North Africa in the world of North Africa in the world of North Africa in the most of the people who was going to get a dances and hours that were going to hours to hours and hours .
And they were always magnific , because the balleres were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every long , rare , something happened , something happened , and one of these artists become transcendent .
And I know you know about what , because I know you &apos;ve all all , you &apos;ve all all , a performance .
It was like the time , you stop , and the ballered walk through a species of portal and he was not doing anything about the sush , like 1,000 night before , but all of it was .
And I tried to try not just as a human .
But it happened from the didinner and sunder the fire of divinity .
And when this happened , you know , the people know what was , they call it , the people know what was , called the coal .
They were the hands and started to song , &quot; Allah , &quot; Allah , Allah , God , God , God , God .
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curiosa night -- when the Mororus , when the Mord &apos;s south of this habits and the pronoundation in the centuries of the centuries of &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , OK , OK , OK , &quot; Oh , , that &apos;s still going to head in the flow or the sheet .
In Spain , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , , the bah , magnificent , I &apos;m going to take , eter , eted -- a scoring .
And it &apos;s great because we need .
But , the problem comes back , the day , the day , the ballerge , when you see and the 11 of the morning of Martedteds and the scoring of Martedteds and the scoring of God , there &apos;s no more .
It &apos;s just a detail with the ginocky , and maybe not going to be able to make that the treatment .
And maybe no one will be the name of God , and what &apos;s going to do with his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most sweet of the more sounds to make a creative life .
But maybe not to be so angerous to be so angerous if you can &apos;t believe , anzyutt , that the most extraordinary extraordinary of your being being being being from you .
But created it simply that you get data in a source of this source of this squish of your life that you have to go to something else when you get to something else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think about this way .
And so I started thinking about , and it &apos;s sure , and it &apos;s sure as I thought about a lot of the book that I &apos;m going to stop , the perhaps I &apos;m going to sure , the perhaps of my graduate successful .
And what I &apos;ve kept kept to tell me when I feel electrized that &apos;s , not help .
Don &apos;t walking . It &apos;s just your work .
It &apos;s going to present-shared to your part , any part of your part , any can be .
If your work is balance , you know .
If the divine , abstring , you asked me to leave some kind of wonderful kind of wonderful , for a moment through your forces , then you go , then &quot; Okay . &quot;
Altrust , you do the same .
And &quot; Ole the same .
I think about it . And I think we &apos;ve taught it .
&quot; You know , &quot; You know , the same , even only for human love and test love and tyal tal tal tal and tyal tal tal .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Okay .
As you know , I &apos;ve already talked about some of the genoma , what can can meaning and the new set of genes .
We &apos;re starting a new percorse : we started digitalize the biology and now to partment from that code we &apos;re entrating in a new phase of biology , design and synthesizing and synthesizing life .
We always always tried to the big questions .
&quot; What &apos;s life ? &quot;
We tried different approaches , reduction to the minimes .
We &apos;re digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequency the human genome , we were sequenced to go from the world of the world .
Now , we ask : can we regenerate life , or create a new life from this universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the kind of gene gene genome of the smaller genoma .
And we tried to reduce the genome of creating a little bit of creating one again .
We &apos;re able to eliminate a hundred of genes of about 500 that are here .
But when we &apos;re a look at his map , it &apos;s relatively simple respect to our .
Credes , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can do it , one at the time , it &apos;s very imaliable that this can take a living .
So , we decided that the only forward to design was synthesizing this chromosomous , to make some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the avventure of the Pan we do a crazy ?
Can the chemical chemical chemical these big molecules that we never create before ?
And in case , we can make a crazy comous crow ?
A cromosomous crop is just a chemical material .
The speed that we &apos;re able to digitive life is growing up to the exponential .
Our capacity of wrong the genetic code , instead , instead , but it &apos;s getting better .
And our more recently return the brains the brains and the decade .
We started 15 years ago .
The process has been required many pass , beginning with a bioetics review that beginning to the first experiments .
But we found that that synthetizing DNA is very difficult .
There are a thousands of the machines of the world that make small segments of DNA , of the letters of 30 to 50 letters and it &apos;s a process , more running .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these framments and corrors .
And this is our first tenty , to partment of the genoma digital information of the genoma .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills kills .
We designed the framments , actually , effectured the corretion of the herrors and get a molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material , and we have it in the bacteria , the bacteria , and we started to read this code and produced to read this code and producing particular viral .
And then the viral particles are region the cells , they &apos;re back and they destroy and they destroy the E.
I &apos;ve been talking about recently , with the oil industry .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build its same hardware , in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the larger things .
We wanted to build the whole crazy of the bacteria .
They are 580 mountains of genetic code .
So we thought about the casses of virus , so that we could change the casses of virus , so that we could change the cell of a cell cell .
The design is crucial information , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequency this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accuratedom was a herror for every 10 mile .
We found , resequency , 30 herrors . If we used that that original sequence we &apos;ve ever been able to do it .
One part of the process is designing segments , 50 letters that you &apos;re going to get all of the other segate segs to build sounds more smer than they work together .
We can see unclear elements here .
You &apos;ve probably read that we put us on the huge .
Think , we have a genetic code on four letters : Actually , C , C , C and T.
Three of those letters together , and there &apos;s about 20 love , and there is a specific order to letters for every love of letters .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frankly .
What we &apos;ve done in the beginning is autographed .
Some of them were delues from the fact that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
We designed these segments to simply ununit with the full .
There are indeed with them and put them and put them .
And we started to assemblate parts , beginning with seven five to seven seven to seven seven seven seven seven at at 24 ments in a swimments of 24 ments .
We have all past these segments in the dance of the sequency that we &apos;re going to create a process that we &apos;re trying to create a very robustot -- like you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatizing the process .
So , this seems to be a tabellone of a basket .
When we get these very long segments , more than 100 midle , more than 100 mile , they will not grow more directly in E.
It &apos;s got to the limits of the modern of the molecular biology .
So we have consider other mechanisms .
We knew of another mechanism called the DNA recognize , which in biology , in biology , which is going to repair the DNA to degree .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinocus , we call Deinoccurs three million rate rad .
You can see in the require superior as his chromosomous .
In 12 hours is reassembled exactly as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can do completely completely .
They can live under the hot wants .
They &apos;re absolutely sure that life in space , and you get a new environment of water .
At the real , NASA shows that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built these processed processed , using the switching segments to inserve .
The lievision of the automatically .
This is not been taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a lot of tiny touchly we can see it with a microscope .
These are photograph that coal a period of about six seconds .
This is the published that we did a little bit of time ago .
They are 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the largest molecule of a defined structure .
It &apos;s a molecular sent long on 300 million .
If we &apos;re going to stop a career , you would like 142 page , they would like 142 page to transcrazy this code .
Now , how do we do it ?
Of course , you know , you &apos;re a virus is a little girls .
It &apos;s a little more complicated when they use batteries .
It &apos;s simple when it &apos;s cell cells as a cell phone as our : you can just extrate the nucleo and inseries of the nucleo and inseries another , that &apos;s a process of clonation .
In the bacteria , the cromosomous , it &apos;s integrated by the cell , but we recently demonstrate that we &apos;re able to do a complete trape of a cell from a cell from a cell from a cell from a cell of a cell .
We can refed a crobial crobial species .
The two are different than the men .
We add some gene in a way to decide what to choose for this crazy .
The one has then science with the entire entire such all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cells is been studied -- and appreciate our graphics -- the new cromosoma -- the new cromosoma .
And we thought we couldn &apos;t go to go out , but we could have a lot of the way to spin there .
This is one of the most of evolution .
We found that tanssize species have added a second or a third or a third of a few part , addition in a thousand new species of new new species of the new species of this species .
So who think about evolution as a gene of a gene , it has not understand grain .
There is a scientist of the scientists called the DNA .
The cromosomous that was in the cells .
The cell phone is the cromosoma , we have inserit--taught .
It &apos;s expressed , and recognized the other crocket as extraneum , and we found it with only cell , and we found it with only cells and the new cell .
It &apos;s become blue , because of the genes we have inserious .
And in a short lelass of time , all the characteristics of a species , and it &apos;s transformed all over the new species , based on the new species that we have inserious sophistory .
Everything about proteins changed , membrane are changed , and when we realized the genetic code of what we transference we transfer .
Now , this could look at genetic alchemy , but altering the software DNA . We can change things in a lot of sustains .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that here is not partners -- but I &apos;m going to talk about three million years and a half million years and a half years and I &apos;ve already said that maybe in that Cambrian explosion that will be in the real real .
Why do this ?
I think it &apos;s enough to be obvious when we think about our needs .
We &apos;re going to spend six billion people in the next 40 years .
Right for example , I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one in 1946 , in 46 , there are four .
We were doing problems now , we have to find food , water and pulital , medical and pulital and a half billion people .
It &apos;s going to be more ducky to do it for nine billion .
We &apos;re going to decade five billion carbon , more than 30 billion basic barrel .
That means millions of barili .
When we try to find processing processing , or any kind of process to replaced them , it will be a huge challenges .
We have to have to conduction of the CO2 from these materials that finding in the atmosphere .
At day , of the world , thank you very much of scientific discoveries in all the world , we have a database , and I like to think that they are the future .
The electronics is only a dozen about components , and think about how many different things are become .
Our limits here are the mainly , the limits of the ination .
We have techniques , thank you very much of synthetization , we can create what we call genomics combinatory .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can produce a million crobot crazy .
Think about processing these 20 million different genes or try to get the processing processing processing , or drugs , new vaccines , we can change , thank you , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for possibilities of survival , production , chemical production or carburing , production of vaccines .
This is a few of some software of some software we working on to be able to be able to seem and designing species and designing species .
Well , we don &apos;t know how to be going to be .
We know , exactly what they &apos;re doing genetic code .
Now we &apos;re concentrating the carbons of quarter generation .
You &apos;ve seen you see that that experiment from grain , it &apos;s been a very very .
We have a second of second and third generation that are actually using enough to carburant by the most higher value as the beat the top of the buts or different types .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact on the way to have a big impact on the cont of food and limited the disponbility would transforming CO2 in materia before , we &apos;re working to design cells that we &apos;re working to design cells that we &apos;re working on cells , and we think of the carbon , and we think of the carbons of how we were able to do this scale , and we think of it &apos;s about 18 months .
The solar solar combined with CO2 is a methodoor -- but in our discovered in all the world , we found different metods .
This is a organism that we have described in 1996 .
It &apos;s going to be a deep of the water , at about 2500 feet of the water of the water .
It means from CO2 , using idrogen hydrogen as energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can incanalar CO2 , that can make it sure out of your bi , converting that CO2 in carbon , to drive that .
So we think that we could think we could be able to be able to aument what the question is , &quot; that the question of , &quot; that &apos;s life . We have the dest . We have the dest of remains the whole oil industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do it by TED , where can you do it ?
It would be a main the main of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working on the same metods of methods to create vaccines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with influence , we &apos;re always forget a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s wind .
I think that what you can change build vaccines in anticipate .
Here &apos;s how the future could start changing , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating the evolution with bacteria , and also cells , and inally cells .
We &apos;re going to have to be better than the best people .
Our scale is to make a way to live enough to try to get it . Thank you very much .
First of all , I &apos;ll show you , the most of the new technology , some fundamental work , in the new technology that we bring to a lot of the technology that we have been exactly . This is Seadon . This is Seadon .
It &apos;s a environment where you can interact with a local level that remoon with a huge amount of visual data .
Here we &apos;re seeing a lot of digital photos with a kind of swital ses and continue , for a squeet , a squick , disponing the images of how we want .
And not import how big the amount of information that we see , how big these college data or images .
Most of the digital photographs , but this is a suddenly scanning from the Bibliotected of the Congress , and reentrepreneurs .
It doesn &apos;t make a difference because the only thing that limits the press of a system like this is the number of the pixel of your screen in any moment . It &apos;s also an architecture . It &apos;s also an architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data , not images .
This is Casolate . Every much Dickens . Each colonners represent a capitable .
To show you that it &apos;s just about the head and not images , we can do a kind of thing , to see that it &apos;s a real representation of the head , not a picture of the head , not a photo .
It could be a way a little bit artificial to read a book for a book .
It doesn &apos;t look at it .
This is an example , this is a more realist . It &apos;s a number of the Guardian .
Every big imagine is the beginning of a seem .
And there &apos;s a lot of the major the beauty of a read version of a review of a review or a sunlight or a lot of a sunlight , which is nature a lot of medium .
We also did something with the angle of this number of this number of the Guardian .
We created a fasull the along solutioned -- much more than that usually usually , that &apos;s usually about the contained .
If you want to see the characteristics of this authomobile , you can see here .
Or other model , or even specific specific .
And this really demonstrate some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space .
We hopefully that this means to the people , and we &apos;re going to have to be more .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this not not to allow time , if we don &apos;t mean that we have contributs to dge in this camp .
These are all the streets in the U.S. .
So , we &apos;re going to go to something else .
This is actually actually actually from the Web ; you can go it .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which is two different technologies .
One is Seady and the other is a research in the very interesting computer . It &apos;s a very interesting computer from Noah Snavely , a student of the University of the U.S. .
And it &apos;s from the Web , genter gride .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from a picture of the other and have this kind of experience .
But the space of images here has actually a meaning .
The signed of the computer goritms of the computer have registred these images , and that correspond to the record of the real world -- all the record to the read of -- all the neighborhood to the Montne Rocken Montne Rocky -- they &apos;re scacked . Here you see . And you know , the things are all the space of a de-de-de-like .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;ve got time to show you some other environment .
There are some more space .
I want to spend one of the original data set of Noahahahotosynth -- and this is a prototype of Photosynth Photosynth , we &apos;re going to do that for the first time the first time the extate . And it &apos;s not necessarily a technology , Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily a website . And it &apos;s not necessarily website .
We had to have to worry about the legal expected .
This is a rebuilt of the Dethr. I &apos;m going to rebuild of the Flickr . Baha &apos;s Nothers in Flickr and you get images of types in magnews , other cams and saying . Ogns a lot of these things in magnews a imagine that you &apos;re discovery .
So , I have all images from Flickr and they all have all the space .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate in this simplication .
You know , I would never think about the Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratificant this kind of accounting this kind of accounts here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of different types of focus : from those professional cellularary cellular , a number of the professional .
And if you can , I try to try to look at those more strange .
Many of a lot of easy , etc .
Sometimes some part here , you find a series of photographs -- etc .
This is a Nothter of Nothers , registred correctly .
We can spend from the poster of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do that . This is now taking data from the world &apos;s coming from from the collective -- from the collective point of how to make the land , from visual view -- and college all those data together .
All of those pictures become , most of the parts of the parts .
You have a model of the land that emerge .
Think about this as a prolgment of the work of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It &apos;s something that growth in complexity , and the people use it , and the people use it for the uses of the uses of uses .
Their photograph are markaged with other people .
If someone is the idea of contrast all these saying , the name , my photograph of Nothy Dimproved . I &apos;m going to get a lot of the Dimproving of all those data , and I can use how to do it , and I can use it as a very much , and I can use photograph , using photograph , and I can have a very very very much of the gax-mother .
Of course , a consequence of all of this is very elaborated .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What your software that your software going to be doing is that that in a point , in the next years , all the photographs , all the photographs will be practice to anyone in the world , they &apos;ll be realized ?
BA : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is doing is to discover .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , you , you want to get ,
And it &apos;s doing it in the contains of images .
The thing is very interesting if you think about recheck information of simanti-set information that many of these images .
As when you do a research of images on the web , you get a sentence and the page of the picture of the picture .
Now , what happens if that picture of all your picture ?
So , the amount of interconnection and the amount of rechedom that &apos;s really huge . It &apos;s a huge effect of the watch .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible .
BA : You &apos;re very much .
One of the main the major of the main , and one of the research is the power of the research is the power of the living of the traditions , between who who &apos;s the past , the past of the living , the spend of the floor , the soul of the frop .
Baste thinking that sciamans Jaguar traveling and the Via Lattea , or that &apos;s the Mancians are still connected in the Himalaya , or that in Himalaya , or that &apos;s the respieces are still followed the respiece of the Dharm , and that the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that that we live in the world that we live in a sense of the world that we live in a sense of the world , but it &apos;s just a sense of a reality , but it &apos;s just a car ,
the consequence of a particular set of scoes that our stirts has done , well , well or a mal , many generations ago .
And , of course , all share we share about the essential .
We all all all naset . We all decreated .
We &apos;re sitting the initiation of the beginning .
We have to have to death the inesorability of death , so we don &apos;t take a song --
We all have a art .
What the song of the song is the threatened particular song , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that they are the Sahara , or the following Voodoo of the Voodoo , or the World desert Kenya , or the Kenya settentral .
He was my own company in the desert of a month ago , or a month ago , or a hall in the values of the Everest , on the Everest , the mother of the world .
All of these people teachers that are teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And if you reflected a active thing that can give you hope .
And we have the cultures of the world creating a spiritual life . And cultural life that &apos;s the planet and cultural that the planet and is important for the planet and is important for the planet .
And you can think about this girl , like a cultural hydropped and you can call the ethnosphere , but all the concepts , you know , every concepts , ideas , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions of the human ination .
The ethnosphere is the great patrimp of human human .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how inquisitive species .
And as the biosphere was graviously consumed , it &apos;s happened to the ethnosphere and unfortunately .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all the species of all the species of all the simply , because it &apos;s fully because it &apos;s fully , or -- in the most of the different biological different countries -- and you don &apos;t have to have to be near in the most of the cultural different countries .
The injection of all is , of course , the lost linguistic .
When you &apos;re born there are 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not just a vocabolary , or a series of rules .
A language is the human spirit .
It &apos;s the medium with the animation of every culture of all culture .
Each language is a forest , a spensive , a spensive , a spensive , a spensive experience .
And of those 6,000 languages , while we &apos;re seded to Monterey , at least half don &apos;t get more susually in the orchies of children .
They don &apos;t get more teached to children , which is not to wonderful , something , who are already death .
What &apos;s more trists of being being being fly from the slency , the last to talk a language , of the wisdom , of the wisdom , or the promise of the floor of the promise of the file of the children ?
This is saving the state of some of the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks a drop and door with the toms and door with the toms .
And I know you &apos;ll tell you , &quot; In &apos;t that ?
The world would not be a better place if we &apos;re talking about the same language ? &quot; Benish , then we all talk all the yoruba .
We &apos;re going to do .
You &apos;ll buy a tract thing about the way .
Today I &apos;d like to do a journosphere .
a little bit of the journey in the etnosphere to you have a lot of what we &apos;re allowing .
Many of us of us mental dimental that when I say , &quot; different ways of existing .
Let &apos;s take for example , this bimbe Barasana , the population of the anacony , the population of the hants of lats , which crede the sunlight of the latest spents .
It &apos;s a population that is not able to distinguished the blue of the green because the green .
They have a lingua language and a mathemselves , said , &quot; exacamia , &quot; experience , you have to get a person who talking about a person that a different language .
All of all has been radical in the mythological past , in these family , in these family , in these family , you &apos;re seven or seven seven seven seven or seven seven or seven seven or seven seven or seven seven or seven seven or seven seven or seven seven or seven seven or seven or seven even seven or seven even seven s
They &apos;re limited to listening and then start talking about .
Let &apos;s take one of the most interesting tribes that I &apos;ve lived , the Waorani of Ecuador Ecuador , a population that has had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , I have tented a decade .
They &apos;ve been done from the photographs that they retraits that they reach them in pluge , forest that this population of the forest pluvial forest , he had never seen the needs of the forest .
They have a picture of the land , they have search a shape or a shape or , and they &apos;re not in the slide , they have concluses that he was the die , and they have a switch , and they killed the five miss .
But Waorani don &apos;t killed only the strange .
They killed to them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by their same .
We &apos;re sitting at eight generations and we found two of the morattached death , they love that , they love that , they love that one of them was invecting , and then they &apos;re death , and then they &apos;re going to be a very unbelievable .
The basic across the animal of the animal , 40 step and remains the species .
In the first 1980s , I was asked a very interesting compiece of the Harvard of Harvard , if I wanted to go to Haiti , if I wanted to go to Haiti in the society of Dualier and Tonton Mines , and impose Tonton Mines , and imposed me to do the suscar .
For a sense of the meal , I would have to take the Vodoun culture and that Vodoun is not magnetic .
It &apos;s quite a little bit of a measure of the world .
Many interesting .
If I asked you to tell me about the big religions of the world , what would you do ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Budddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always leaved out , thinking that the sub-harian has no feels . And he was wasn &apos;t . And he &apos;s not the other than the distilled of these religious conception of these religious concepts of these religious religious concepts of the return .
What &apos;s interesting is the voodoo is the intense is the intense between life and dead .
So , you &apos;re going to get the spirits .
The spirits can be invocated by the Grande Acqua , response to the ritm of the dance and return out of the soul of the vive in the way that for a short of the vive .
So , this voodooist love , &quot; You go to talk about God .
We dancing in the temple and we become God . &quot;
And what you &apos;re playing , you &apos;re going to sitting , you can do you do the mal ?
So you lists to these incredible events : following the voodoo in the state of trance that touched a places of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of mind of the power of the power of mind of the power of the
It &apos;s all the people with the most extraordinary , the most extraordinary of the Sierra North Sierra . Nevde Marta , in Colombia , in Colombia .
It &apos;s enters of the ancivilization that a living on the planet &apos;s carbon the Colombia in the ext-to-conquired , the population of the conqucanic cer , the population of carbon .
In a sanks , in a sangue , this population never been conquicted by the spagners .
And yet , we &apos;re government from a clero , but their formation is really extraordinary .
The young people are taking out of the families to three or four , and they live in a world of good and bombs in a world of good and bombs in the broken of the ice for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years , I &apos;m going to reproducing the nine months of gestation that transcorporate the world &apos;s meaning , now are metaphor , now are metaphor the Mther .
So , this time , they are acculted to their values , values that their predict and only their predict and only their preger prise .
And in term of this incredible initiation , they &apos;re suddenly taught out and for the first time , in 18 years , in the age of the age age of the first bor , when the bor of the first bor , when the bor , when the bor , when the bor , when the bor is conferred in the way . The prey pressed . The prey pressed a stead and says , : Shy . The precient a . The pret . The pret a past .
&quot; I &apos;m going to do you .
It &apos;s just just . Now it &apos;s looking at you .
They call the most most of the world and say that we , fraid , we are the column of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the income of Indigene and the environment of the old story of the nice , which is a concept of the non-s-crazy , which is a razy concept , and we say that these people are more closer than us .
The Indigenes are not not sentimental sentimental .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the world in the Aphat or the gelids of the Tbet , but thank you , but thank you , but thank you , they have a mistic of the Earth , they created a mistic of the Earth , but on a suncle , but on a suncle .
What does it mean mean ?
It &apos;s going to be a little bit of the Ande that grows up with a tagna grow is a spirit . And that &apos;s going to be a human human . And it &apos;s going to be a human human . And it &apos;s going to be a human human . And it &apos;s going to be a lot of different mountain .
That &apos;s the dimour is a hour or a mineral cycle is irric .
What &apos;s interesting is the meaning is the metaphor and the world .
They &apos;re growing in the forests of Columbia credly creating that forests serve to be wrong .
And that &apos;s a human human beings , I realized that the ants are the fundamental of the Hukuk of Hukuk and the basic stored of the paradised and the spirits of the world , and the spirits that we live in the world , the spirits that we live in the Hamattend .
If you start to look at that these cultures can actually create reality , and you can start some of them , you can start some of their sensational works .
I went this picture to aprile the Amazon , Amazon .
Mayahuge some of you have heard of the eye , the most powerful psychoad of the repertance of the repertance .
What makes a fascinating ayahuash is not the potential drugs of sustains , but his elements . It &apos;s from two elements .
From a late , this lian lian lian lian snice of swimming , harmine and harmine , slightly .
Phing the sold of the sunlight , you have a bluash bluat a little bit the cosence , but it &apos;s myscoes a business of the family of the family of the family of the caffected told .
This plants that powerful triptamines , very similar , methoxyltryltryltryltryltryltry-s-methoxyltryltryptamine-dy-samnine ,
If you never see the Yanomami , you &apos;ll see the Yanomami , they do a different set of species , it &apos;s contained methoxyltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltrylyltrype .
Tiring that policy is a little bit like a little bit like being spared by a diption of a diption of the diptions of the dipts and lots of electricity . Risn &apos;t creates a distorsion of the reality .
I had spent with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who wrote was psychedelic , with his discovery , with his discovery .
And the tese tour , you can &apos;t classifly these triptaminogens because if you &apos;re not going to be abinogens .
It &apos;s possible to assuming the horally , if you &apos;re not sure with other chemical chemical chemical .
Now , it &apos;s the beauty : The big high carbon , are inibitors of MAO , the same kind of necessary MAO , the same kind of the world . The question is the source of the world , like these people are in a floor , like these people are in this way , like these people are , like these people are not spend , but if you have a real real truth .
We use the big euphemism of the herror , that can reveal and reveal .
But if we ask to the Indians , they &apos;re going to say , &quot; The full fairs . &quot;
What does it mean mean ?
This tribes , Cofan , he &apos;s 17 variety , who distinguished in the forest , and that our eyes would be in the forest species .
If we ask them how they stabilises their tasonomy will tell us , &quot; I was able to say , &quot; I didn &apos;t know ? &quot;
The solution is : they get 17 variety in a night of llots and each one will go with a different song .
With this not lauread to Harvard , but it &apos;s very interesting to contate the stami .
Now , , &#91; &#91; applauses the problem is that also the people who have the result of us are pittoresces of the history of the history of the history of the history of the world , and spending three .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , not remember , and we &apos;re going to be sounds or innovations , but the most of technological technological innovations , but the rather than we stopped and we put activity , and we &apos;ve been active , and we became the problem . Now the problem . Now the problem is not the problem .
Everybody cultures have been involved in a dance for life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux , they don &apos;t have to be Sioux when they put it from the ark and full as Americans have been horse .
It &apos;s not change or technology that mind the technology of the ethnosphere . It &apos;s the power . It &apos;s the power . It &apos;s the power .
The wall of the domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you &apos;ll find that these are not cultures of these are not destined to sell .
They &apos;re creatures and dynamic existence out of the forces that they go out of the adaptation of their capacity of adaptation .
And what &apos;s about disbospitation in the patria of the thought --
a population of Sarawak , in the south of the Asian , a population that has lived in the forest forest to a generation ago , and now reduced the results of the restruction of the restruction of the lights , where you can see the Borney to the near Borney , where the navailums to the MCinese , where the naves the horizabits , where the named of the horizonte , where the nomints , and we &apos;re going to be the slim ,
I remains the stive stive with the suncle .
Or in the case of Yanomami , are the disease , are the disease of the gold .
If we &apos;re saying about the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the right right .
As you know the genocide , the physical physics of a population , but the etnetwork , but the conduction of life , the distrtion of the lives of a population , but the car of a population , but you &apos;re going to be conducted , but to the develop in the development .
And you can &apos;t understand the soon of Tibet .
I &apos;ve almost the 6,000 miles from Chengineering in Chinengines , through the Tibet , comes to Lhasa gap , and I realized , but only came to Lhasa , but only came to Lhasa , and I realized what we heard .
6,000 sacrates sacrates in policy and centers .
1.2 million people kills kills in the Cultural .
The father of this guy was abrited to Panchen Lama .
The thing that means that that was killed to the temptypes of the Chinese invasion .
South &apos;s fuged with Sanity in Sanity in the diasporates that he took the population in Nepal .
South mother was imprisoned and his colpage was being realized .
It was taken to the age of the age of two years , and he was a hundred of the house because he wouldn &apos;t have living without him .
The sister , who did the same , it was messed in the result .
A day has been spot , a day , a running raffy , and for this transgression , and for this transgression , was messed to seven years .
The sources of the Tibet can be insophistory , but the redenter of the population is from the tentener .
At the end , all of it reduce a scoice .
We want to live in the world the monocromatical world , we want to get the policromatical world ?
The great anthropologa Mead , before we died , before we died that his largest poor that , in our lives of the world , we &apos;re going to go to this love of the world , we &apos;re not just seeing the whole gamma of human imagination .
And it &apos;s a remember that our species is existed for 60,000 years .
The Rivolution Rivolution , that has given us the agriculture , that has done us to the cult of the sea of the seem , and retitude the shamount of the specialization of specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The industrialized world world has 300 years .
And that &apos;s a story not suggest to me that we have the answers to all the challenge that we &apos;re going to come to come .
When these cultures of cultures of the world is asked what they want to say to be human , respond to 10,000 voes .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all return the possibility of being what we &apos;re : a consciousness , which is a consciousness , that we have all the people and all the people and all the players are . And there are great moments of behavior .
I went to this picture on the north of the north of Baffin , when I went to the hydropped , and this man , and this man , and this man , and this man , Olaya , and he told me the wonderful story of his non-history .
The government is not always always been gentile with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to stabilier our prematise , we have to reink them in colonies .
The nonno about this man &apos;s man came back .
And the family , tempting for his life , and all the broken , and all his own own .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t have the fredge , it &apos;s suncrowd .
The basic paces of the origins were made of fish .
The non-about this man , you don &apos;t get to be saying from the blizing night or the blizing blizing .
It &apos;s been helped out , you &apos;re croken , you &apos;re croken in the skin of focus and defulated in their hand . When the fectis , and they &apos;re working on a lama .
It &apos;s been spring on the points of this caccount of this cacca and when he came out , he has killed a song .
He &apos;s schooled the cane and created a sliter , with the casses , he has created a sliter , he has imbried another song and it &apos;s sushed on the bancha , and it &apos;s slights .
We want to talk about cavarautomous ?
In the 1999 , the government of the government has reded the total control of a larger area of the California and Texas the larger .
It &apos;s their new patria . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a independent . They &apos;re going to sources .
One splendido example of how a national national splendes , you can reach with his population .
And , to finished , I think it &apos;s quite a lot of us who was in these zone of us , make it consumed that they don &apos;t have remote .
For somebody &apos;s house .
They represented the human imagination that are rising at the time . And for us , all of these kids , like all of these kids , like all of these kids , as the sources of the geography .
For finished , we are National Geographic that politicians will never get to anything .
We believe that polemics --
&#91; Applauses don &apos;t persuasive , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and maybe we have the best institution to tell stories of the world . Each month , our sit realized the world . Each our 35 million living .
156 countries our song countries our song .
We &apos;re saying , our revists are seven millions of people .
Our work is travel in the ethnosphere to our public place to the beautiful cultural wonderful cultural wonderful , and they &apos;ll hope , you know , you can get a central world .
where the gegegezy sages of all the people can be collective .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book called the other people who &apos;ve heard and I &apos;ll have heard of the colleagues , in case , in case , in case , in case .
I want to start with what I call the dogm . &quot;
Dogm Dogm .
The dogm of all the society of all the industrial society . The dogm office , &quot; If we want to be spend the well-being of our citizens . &quot; The way to do it is to be cure liberation . &quot;
The reason is , from a late , in fact that the liberty is in the same value , is a precious value , useal , useful , useful , useful , for human beings .
Another is in fact that if we &apos;re libers , each of us can agency to do everything that that &apos;s very much what we have to do is , without any of our benefit .
The way to male the freedom is to male the scoice .
And there are the people , more liberty , more liberty , and most of their liberty , most of their liberty , most of their well-being .
This , I reach , it &apos;s so deeply radicated in the society that no one dream of the doubt .
And it &apos;s also deeply radically radicated in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress is possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particular big .
I hope a simple note of the condents for injuments .
In my supermarket , there are 175 condents , without the 10 variety of the olive variety and 12 acets and 12 acets that you can buy a huge of condition that you can buy a huge of condents that no one of the 175 that no one of the degrees of your degrees .
Here &apos;s the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronics of electronics to buy a stereo : case , CD , radio , radio , radio , radio , radio ,
And in this single negotiate of electronics , there &apos;s a big number of audio .
We can realize six million different and a half a different combinations that there are a negotiate .
You have to admit that there is a scoice .
Other five : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the serve serve serve , the bad of the desire , pite that they were fornuts from the mamma Bell .
It was born , he was not compressed it .
A consequence of that , one of the other , was that the phone was never going to .
These tempts are went .
We have a variety of the phone of the phone , specially between cellularary cellular .
Here &apos;s the future of the future .
My favorite is that in the middle , MP3 , cut , and forts for the cycle , and the croken broken .
If you don &apos;t have seen in the negotiate under , you &apos;re going to be reverse .
And what &apos;s going to the end is that people are in the news and does this question . And you know what &apos;s the answer ?
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cellulate that not too too too much .
So , in other life that are very more important than the busters , you know , the same plosion of scoes .
Assistence : Don &apos;t happen in the United States that you &apos;re going to be watching and the doctor .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do it , or the B , &quot; As that &apos;s the benefits and these risks . What do ?
You know , &quot; Dr. &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; As these benefits and B , and B has these benefits and these risks . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebats , &quot; Dr. &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I don &apos;t have . &quot;
The result that we call it &quot; autonomy of disease , &quot; expression that it seems to make it a beautiful thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not that one spot and the responsibility of decisions that you know , something , hoss the doctor , and anything else -- and almost certainly , it &apos;s not maled -- and so not in the ideal condition .
There &apos;s a huge marketing products , direct to people like me and you , who think about it , and you , who are not a sense , that we can buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why do we have them , why do we do it ?
The answer is that they want to domaction to the doctor to ask them to change the remains .
Something so that we &apos;re fundamental identity is a scoice of scoice , like you see in this jobs , like this . We &apos;re not want to force children . We &apos;re going to go to the right now . We don &apos;t want to be a identity .
And we can reinvented us how many times us aggrada .
which means that every morning , at the risk , you have to sell that kind of person want to be .
And he was a family and the mathemselves , a time , a time , a time , a time , and he was squeet , it was that there was a more possible , and he started to get the most possible .
The only train was a choice , not when , and not even when , and not even less what I do after .
Ogyday , all of it &apos;s really to play .
It &apos;s a lot of intelligence , and I think about their 20 percent of work , and I realized a time .
And not because they &apos;re not not brilliant , because they &apos;re not not not .
but because I &apos;m impensive , I mean , I mean , &quot; I would like to do it ? &quot;
&quot; I would have to sell me ? I have to think about the full or career ? &quot;
They &apos;re interruption logoring .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this is not to to go out and not to get a won &apos;t get a good wonderful won .
And they have to do it . They have to do that .
Now , the work : we &apos;re unfortunate , like Carl , because technology we &apos;ve allowed to work every day , every day , every day , from the planet , every day , from the planet , and it &apos;s from the Hotel Randolph .
It was parentesthesize , there &apos;s a angole , and I &apos;m not going to tell anyone , where , WiFi works .
It doesn &apos;t tell it , because I want to use it .
What means , this incredible liberty freedom that we have to go to the work ? Is we have to spend , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son , we can go out , with the cell phone in a touch , the Blackberry , the Blackberry , and the notion , on the ginockberry .
And if they &apos;re all spents , every minute that we see our son , we &apos;re asking , we &apos;re asking , we &apos;re asking , we &apos;re asking , &quot; I have to save this ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? &quot; I have to reach this letter ? &quot;
And also when the answer is , &quot; no , &quot; no , this makes the experience of your child , very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , from any part , we look at all , little big materials and the materials , and the materials , life is a question of scowever .
Once the world was this : Or , there was some possibilities , but it was not a scoke of scoes .
The world of today &apos;s looking at this : The dilemma is , &quot; Is it &apos;s a positive thing , or negative ?
The answer is Short .
We all know , we know all , we all know , I &apos;m going to talk about that negative .
All this scoice is two effects negative effects negative .
The first , paradossh , is that produced by instead of liberation .
And so many options that broken , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I &apos;m office , you know , a study , a study conducted songs .
A lot of my college has been access to the Vantured , the society of thinking , with about a million climate climents in 2,000 companies .
What she &apos;s discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of adesion , the adesion of two percent .
With 50 sources , there &apos;s 10 percent of the adesions , and it &apos;s just five . Why ?
Because 50 source of the broken , it &apos;s directly very difficult to decide , and the choice is remanded to the domority .
And at domorances , and still domorances , domorate , and of course , , I never realized .
You know , that it doesn &apos;t mean that these works , they &apos;re going to eating food for cans because they don &apos;t have enough money , it also want to say that the decision is so host that the decision is so host of the dator .
Not team , they &apos;re going to five , and it &apos;s going to be swatching .
So the paralises is a consequence of having too .
And I think that &apos;s a world .
&quot; And to finished , for the eternity : ketchup or may-like ?
You &apos;d like to take the right decision , if it &apos;s for the ethernity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong sbroken , and nepure the wrong condent .
So this is the first effect . The second is that if we can evitate the paralises and do a scoice , we &apos;re less sure from the result of how we would be less options from the result of how we would be less options to be bad with less .
And that &apos;s a different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of condents , if you buy , if you buy a and not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could do a different scoke that would be better . And that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be better . And that &apos;s that &apos;s that the alternative imagined us to remains the way , and the repiece of the short , and the swim , and the sounds of the decision , and the sounds of the decision , and the decision ,
even when it was a very good decision .
You know , there are , more easy than anything is , more than anything that is insod-like insod-like .
And also , there is what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has clear very well , as the value that we &apos;re going to depend with what we confront .
In the rest , when there are a tune options , is easy to repress the treatment of the treatment of the option of the option that is scoes .
Here &apos;s an example . I wrong all that are not in New York .
But it &apos;s probably what you probably think .
There &apos;s this coppia .
A place of lust .
It &apos;s full became . Ottype , it &apos;s all about them .
It doesn &apos;t eat anything . But what he thought is , &quot; Well , , malbuilding , is Agost . &quot;
&quot; Everybody my near to Manhattan are . &quot;
&quot; I could talk about the front of the house . &quot;
And the two weeks at two weeks , and it &apos;s allowed -- every day -- every day -- the chance of parking where it wants .
The costs of opportunity to diminus , the sodfation for what we have , even when the choice was except .
And the most of the options we have to consider , more characteristics , we &apos;re going to return out how cos-opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This gave us a lot of things .
We have to live the time , and maybe of the living .
But the most important point is that any thing you &apos;re going to do .
The things that we don &apos;t choices that can make less activity what we do .
Terzo , you can get grow up .
I tried on my skin is a new jeans .
I &apos;m going to almost always always jeans .
Once jeans were a kind of , and I would have a lot of best , they were sitting , only after they were switched , only after they have a lot of times , beginning to go .
So , I went to buy a couple of a couple when that old those who were went , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
The common said , &quot; Who works , fit , easy , relaxy and fit ? &quot;
Washy and , you know , or you &apos;re going to get the broken ? &quot;
&quot; Look , you know ? &quot;
&quot; Some the workers or street ? Be bad the basic -- &quot; Continuate .
I was soughly , and after a little bit , and after a little bit , I mean , &quot; I want to say , &quot; I want to say , &quot; I don &apos;t know what was , so for a little bit of what was , so much , I &apos;m going to have all . And then I &apos;m going to be .
It was the massive . I had the best .
But I felt about it .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for caps .
The reason I was workers , I was that with all the midle of the expectations were altisy , jeans had to be perfect .
And I was the beginning I was minime . I wasn &apos;t expected anything , when there was a kind of , but when there was a different kind of , but when you live , I was a kind of a sad .
What I was buy , but not perfect .
After the had paragoned that that I was trying to do that .
The adaddition of the people don &apos;t do that that they don &apos;t do the expectations that these have respect to the expectations of the options of the same .
And this will produce less sod-s-s-like saving , even when the result .
Nobody in the marketing world , if it makes it contained .
Because if they know , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is a more more to this .
&quot; You know , it was better when he was worse , &quot; The reason that he was better when he was worse , when he was worse , you know , when he was saying it was still possible to meet .
Ogday , in the world we live -- the world , industrialized , citizens with the perfection of perfection -- the mass that we can hope is that things are in the treating tree .
You &apos;ve never been surprising plevoles because your expectations , you &apos;re ingiant , you &apos;re ingiant .
The happiness of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- that &apos;s , &quot; Basse , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , you want . &quot;
I mean , little bit of the little bit of the room -- that I &apos;m really saying .
I couldn &apos;t have to do better , I don &apos;t have to do it .
But it &apos;s not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of the compring jeans swimming when there &apos;s only that kind of jeans is that when you &apos;re not sure , and you ask , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; What &apos;s responsible ? &quot;
The world is the responsible . What could I do ?
When there are hundreds of types , and you buy a display , and you ask you who is the responsible , is the responsible , is otherwise , it &apos;s others you .
You could have to do better .
With hundreds of disponiable variety , there are not sculply .
So when people are decisions , even though the result is valid , they sently sounds and they &apos;re going to their own .
In the last years of depression is explosa in the industrialized world .
I think a meaning meaning -- not the only one , but important -- of this wonderful -- of this depression of depression , because the standard of depression because the standard of the standard .
And when they have to explain this situation thought that the colpurn is their own .
So the end of the end is that in general , we &apos;re better better , but we &apos;re worse .
Let me remember you remember .
This is the office , what we all take for good .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit better than a little bit better than it &apos;s not going to get it , but that &apos;s not going to be better than a lot of a little bit .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic . I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s .
But I &apos;m sure that we have surface from a piece of the level that the best scoes our life .
Now , from the political point of the political -- I &apos;ve almost finished , the noise is the following .
What allowed to all this scoice in society is the recchoice .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , the problem is not that they have too much .
The problem is that they have too poca lot .
So , the facility that I &apos;m talking about is a diesclusive directly , the recidental remember .
And what makes you depressed and arrand arrand arrand realized how those costs and spot of how those costs and sumping for whatever . It &apos;s a spread of money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and dispendious , it &apos;s not that they &apos;re just inuseful .
They &apos;re addicting of the deleteries .
They do peak .
If a little bit of what in our society , you know , it was revered in those where people have too much much of where people have too much much possibilities , not just the life , not just their lives , but our lives .
This is what economists call a paretian paretian paretian paretian .
A desibution of the reduction ago , not only to the poor -- not only to the poor -- because of this scoke that us .
For conclude , &quot; For , you can become everything that you want to be --
Then , people of culture , you think , &quot; But what sheet ?
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t get anything in a glass . &quot;
&quot; An imagination , a limited vision , a limited vision of the world --
and anched the whole thing , I interpret that , at the beginning .
But then , thinking about , instead , I realized that that fish the weight the sounds .
Because the fact of the fact of the fact , if you eat the bocket , so that you can &apos;t get the liberty . You get it . You get it .
If you rompet the broken in a way that all of divents possible divents .
Accently the paralises , and reduced the benefit .
They all need a sfer .
This is almost certainly too much , maybe even though for us .
But the assumed some symbolic symbolic symbolic , and , teme , for the rovine .
Thank you very much .
