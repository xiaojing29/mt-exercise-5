The year I showed these slide to show that the arcle calculus to show that the arctic glacious , which for almost three million years , has been restrict .
However , this slate gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice of the ice .
The arctic glacial is , in a sense , the pull-heart cuer of global climate system .
You &apos;re going to be expected and the summer .
The next slide is going to be a record on the last 25 years .
The ice loss are drawings .
You can see , you know , you &apos;re expanding up to the blue .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter , which is the summer ritira .
You can see that the ice cosidly , five years or more , or five years , or five years , it &apos;s like the blood , which is the blood .
In 25 years , it was going to be like this .
This is a problem because the interested in the arcle of the artage of the arctic arctic scales , where there are huge amount of congent carbon that , science , they &apos;re transformed to metan hot of the arcle .
Read to the totality of global inquitation , global warming , that amount of global warming , that amount of global inspired , surgery , surgery , surgery ,
In some of the deep bate in Alaska , the methane is already rebecting from water .
The professortic Katey Walter University of Alaska team , and it &apos;s a team , based the scored the scored .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You &apos;re good . The question is if we &apos;re going to be .
A reason is that this term termal scale the term of the north .
This is a glacial figures .
The cared was never reached free .
This is the Kangered Kangered Kangered , in the south of Greenland .
If you want to know how the sal level of the sea level for the gactual sal terraferma , here is where you get the set .
These rops are increasing rapidly .
At the other part of the planet : Antarcle , the biggest block of ice ice ice planet .
The month the scientists have died up the ice of ice is in the ice , and the gative Antarctde , and that the Antarctarctde , which poggs on some sacross some island , is particularly queen ,
Equive six feet of the action of action , like Greenland .
Sull Himalaya , the third largest block , you see the glages , and they were going to see the lages , which a few years ago .
40 percent of the world population is going to be half of the world &apos;s power from the slide .
Sulle Ande : this ice ice is the fundamental water of this city .
The cart is increased .
But when you diminute , it &apos;s the same accept water .
In California , the nnow of 40 percent .
The drive bs are in the crisis .
The predictions , as you &apos;ve read , they &apos;re free .
The growth care in the world &apos;s door to the income to a wind herself .
The environmental disaster , they &apos;re going to be increasingly out of the normal and without previous .
Four times more numerous than the last 30 years , I &apos;m going to previous 75 .
This is a beautiful walking all .
If you look in the context storic context , if they can see it consequences .
Five years , we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 ton the CO2 million tons of tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the horiental Pacific Pacific , to American , to the American , and on both parts of the subcontinent , where there is a radical impal radical impact of oxygen in the oceans .
Most of global warming , together to the deforestation , that &apos;s 20 percent , is the deforestation of it , is the use of fossil .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with the China .
And it was proposed to build a lot of other centers .
But we &apos;re assisting to a direction .
These are the annulled projects in the last few years , and some of the alternative alternative .
And every way , there &apos;s a political lotta in our country .
The industries of carbon and oil are oil , they have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon , which is a host host .
That picture me me me , I &apos;d remember something --
Natal , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion pounds of carbon .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the second larger flow of scories in America .
It &apos;s happened around Natal .
The published nature of one of the carbon industries was this .
Video : &quot; The full the carbon is a alley kind of alley and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it &apos;s going to grow our economics .
Fross the carbon is always more and more and free .
It &apos;s good predable , and adorable and work work work work .
Al Gore : West Virginia , the West Virginia .
The largest society in the mountain is Massey Coal . This is his friends .
Video : Don Blankens : I &apos;m going to be asked -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosis , Harry Reid -- don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima Protetion .
This is one of them , one of them .
Video : Ator : At COALergy see the climate change as a minute serious serious serious climate .
So , our priority is to invest a big amount of money in a public effort to make public security and confused the truth .
In fact , the carbon is not sports .
We think it &apos;s a good profumor a good profumor profumo .
So , not preoctation of climate change .
Let me do to us .
Video : Ator : Ator . You &apos;ve heard a lot of talk .
So let me give a game in a structure in a structure on the watch of the basic .
Straditional ! The machines are a little bit of the sound of the technology of the basic technology .
The carbon is between the main the global cause of global warming , but the notion of the cleaning clean , but the notion that you see all changes .
You have a look at this : this is the hate technology of the basic technology .
Al Gore : Inally , the alternative alternative , the positive alternative issue and the safety of national safety .
Video : My America is in the economy ; the economy , the national economics , the national crisis .
The phils that the college all of our dependence from fossil bears , as the car and oil .
Now , perhaps there is a new , audace solution for it .
Really , 100 percent of power , in 10 percent of the full years .
A plan to put it in the work , make a lot more safety , and help to stop the global warming .
Finally , one solution that bastly basted our problems .
It &apos;s power of America . Scover .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It &apos;s going to be able to red-America .
One of the fastest ways to get the faster of the combud-basic ways that killed our planet .
She talks about it . I wind , just a new energy .
Sometimes two : Noves investment for places of work .
I &apos;m going to be realistic . It &apos;s time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old a bafrican old proverbio said , &quot; If you want to go speak , you go to the fast .
If you want to go away , you go to it back . &quot;
We have to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
The year at TED I did a drive introduction on the LHC .
And I promise to go back to the car about how it works .
So I five . And for those that the other time , there was no , LHC is the biggest experiment , the LHC , 27 kilometers of circumstence .
His compit is to reflies that were less than a billion second of second from the beginning of the universe -- under 600 million times a second .
So , all of that is just environment .
This is the machine under Ginevening .
We picture these mini-Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang &apos;s dinside the rest .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLATLATLAS -- it &apos;s large , and it &apos;s a 22 feet .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLATLAS , buildings so you can see the proportions .
The 10 section of the scored last year , we have accested the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was cause of immense phestegams in the control of control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first picture of the particles that had done all the game of LHC , and both , with a part of the LHC , and it &apos;s a part of the LHC , and particles in the rest .
In other words , when we see the picture of the picture of 10 secember , we understand that the machine worked , which is a great witting .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to do us to exulse that , when somebody went on Google and saw that the page was this .
That means we had a cultural impact cultural impact to the scientific impact .
Actually , a week after , there was a problem with the machine , just had to these phils here -- these phils .
These films are 13,000 lampiterally , when the machine works to the massive map .
Now , the technical technical , and they &apos;re going to look , &quot; It &apos;s not true . &quot;
And they can do it because when they &apos;re very cold to be the surgery of superconducts .
So , at least 271 degrees , at a perature of the space between the stars , these phils can bring that run .
In one of the junture of the younger novemile in the LHC , there was a fect difect .
So the phils surgery , and the 13,000 lamper , and the 13,000 lampitched a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is still more impressive if you think these magnetworks are more than 20 tons , and that are moved about 30 centimeters .
They &apos;re damaged about 50 magnetworks .
We had to take them , what we did .
We &apos;ve been repristed and traveled .
Now they &apos;re going to go back to their subote ,
By the end of marzo , the LHC will be new integrate .
We &apos;re going to happen , and we &apos;re going to get it to the right , and continue our adventure to discover what the morning to discover what the morning to do is the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these indebate , these incidents readed the value of science and engineering . It &apos;s easy to confuture .
I think the fact that the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact of limits , I think it &apos;s the value of things like LHC .
I &apos;d like to conclude with the words of a Inglese scientist , Humphry Davy , which , imagine , in the difested experiments of his blob experiments of his bleael , he said , &quot; Not , &quot; World mind is so dangerous for the human mind that the reening reening to the human mind that the ideas of science that the ideas of science that our tributs are going to be .
Thank you .
I want to start to start to ask when children , you play it , you play climbers .
And as you &apos;re going to get them and further , take them and get them , take them and move them , learned , and you learn , and they &apos;re going to be able to do and spend a space .
The space is deeply connected to the way we understand , so we understand ,
So , from the information , as inspired by the usual usual objects , together at my consult , and the collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to ask me , &quot; And if we &apos;re a switched , &quot; And if we &apos;re a computer , investment to be a computer , we could do the slate on a desktop with the slate , we could get a desktop with the slate , and we &apos;re going to get a further ,
and systems to our placement ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , and build the answer Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable , it &apos;s a great computer interactive computer .
In a few words , a Siftable , it &apos;s a great computer interactive computer .
You can move them with the hand , they can see , &quot; you see , &quot; You can see , &quot; You &apos;re going to see the movement and a radio scredio .
But surprised , they &apos;re physical objects , you can move just move to them .
The Siftable is an example of a new ecosystema new ecosystem to manipulate information .
And as they become more physical , consciousness of the other movement , and as they have more physical , and as they have more physical , to be played to explore new and fun size different things .
I &apos;m going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configurated to show video : if you put it in a direction , the video , the rotate it will rotate it so , if you cline from the other back back .
These are interactive , are interactive of others .
If I &apos;m standing them , they &apos;re interested in .
If they come out of it , you noticed it , and they &apos;re going to act a little bit .
If they come out of it , you noticed it , and they &apos;re going to act a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power to use communicate on the data , &quot; to be a color like , &quot; a color like , &quot; a color like liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable as a century center and I can use them to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able .
and I can use them to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be .
It &apos;s too much , we can put a little bit of a little bit .
They &apos;re also beautiful possibility of appressages , like the languages , the mathematics and games of logic where people can try to see the fast fast , and see it on immediately .
Now , I &apos;m --
This is a sequence of Fibonacres that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a game of words that &apos;s half between Scarabeo and Boble .
She &apos;s got to every watch , and you get a literally on every Siftable , Pratically , in every Siftable , and while you can get a literally , and while he comport to a directionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds of 30 seconds are remissing , and you have a new set of letters and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the children came to the Media Lab , I did done it in a way that they try and turned it up a video .
They &apos;re very much placy .
And one of the interesting things about this application is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of education .
You just say , &quot; Compons of words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s another people who try it .
This is our young tester tester , there on the right .
It actually wanted to implant them .
They were only the morning for him .
Now , this is a application of a interactive paper .
We wanted to build a tool for the apart of the Lui &apos;s languages .
It can put new characters in the scene , solve the Siftable .
It can put new characters in the scene , solve the Siftable .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : The sole is surprising .
David Merriled : Now he took a treatment in the scene .
Video : The arang treater .
By work ! Yeah ! Yeah !
So schooling the Siftable and put them close to the character the character --
Video : Bau !
To inventing their story .
Video : I &apos;m going to be .
DM : It &apos;s a story with final opened , and it can decide him .
DM : It &apos;s a story with final opened , and it can decide him .
Video : Just , gave it .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , realized realized by recently , to wait and exequiet musical .
It &apos;s a tool , realized by recently , to wait and exequiet musical .
The Siftable here are against sound as basis , and battery .
Everyone of these four different variations , and you can choose .
You can also injve these sounds in a comport sequence of comport .
And modified it just takes a sound &quot; and a sequence . &quot;
These are effects that you can control from vive , as the reverse and the filter .
And it takes a particular sound and then inclines to stop it .
And then there are the general effects as time and fly , that they &apos;re just going to be the interested in sequence .
Let &apos;s look at how it works .
Video : We &apos;re going to start to start a base in two Siftable , &quot; sequence , &quot; we &apos;re doing it in a series , the extensive , we add it to the other base .
Now , I put a basis of the basis .
Video : Now , I add to percussions --
Video : And I &apos;m going to put the phils to the bacteria , so I can control the effect of the bloads .
Video : I can speak the entire fy interested in the way , by a side or one side .
Video : And I &apos;m going to add the full full to get more expression .
Video : I can realize the sequence &quot; to the volo . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to plane it before , but I can try to make it longer , make it longer or more cording .
And now , finally , I can smooth the whole smooth , and finally , and I can fly . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is built new man , and it &apos;s a little bit more and more than our brain and body .
And today , I &apos;ve got time to show you one of the result of this percoral , and also some possibilities that we &apos;re trying to get out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is coming to this new generation of objects to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way that we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the hour to talk to all of you .
I &apos;m a writter .
It &apos;s my profession , but it &apos;s my profession , obviously .
It &apos;s also love and the phasize of my life .
And I &apos;m not expected that can change .
But , said , something about particularly successful in my life and in my life and in my career , who took me to recalibring the entire relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently written this book , this biography called &quot; Mangia , &quot; Prega , Ama , &quot; which , Ama , &quot; which , a lot of reason for some reason that , for some reason that , and it became a great sensitive , walking up .
And the result is that everybody now , people treatment me as if they were condanned .
Do real -- condannated , condannated !
They &apos;re all worried about it and they said , &quot; Don &apos;t you know , &quot; You don &apos;t do it ?
You don &apos;t have to continue to write all the life without able to be able to make a book that can actually make a book that can important one ? &quot;
What can you know ? &quot;
It &apos;s rassure , you know .
But it could go worse , part of the gathering I remember 20 years ago , when I was a adolescent -- I was a scritical scritical .
I was going to met the same based by the purpose .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t temes me to have successful ?
Don &apos;t you fear that the key killing you ?
You don &apos;t have to do this all all of life without the whole life without nothing that nothing was going out and death on a cumule of sunnfrants with the boud broads of falling ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
Yeah , I have fear of all those things .
I always had a couple .
And I also have a lot of other things that people may not have to inate .
As the algalae and other things like .
But , how to do it write what I thought and I was saying , and I asked me , I asked me , why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logic that anybody debbate to be spavented by a job that you feel like to do .
But what is it so particular in the imprised creative , to make us nervous about mental health , others do it ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don &apos;t remember one time in his 40 years of activity that was asked if she had lots of activity that was asked if she had layer ?
There was never -- that block of the engineer John , how it &apos;s it ?
Don &apos;t it worked , you know ?
Only , chemicals like group have no certain , in the centuries , in the centuries , dged the reputation of being alcolized .
We written , we have enough this reputation , and not just written a writers , but creative creative reputation of being an enormous mement .
And it &apos;s not going to look at the trists of the magnifies of the magnifies of the magnific ments , just in the last century , they died young to them .
And also the ones that don &apos;t have suicidated to be really disstucked by their dones .
Norman Mailer , before I die , in the last interview said , &quot; Every book killed me a little bit more than the work of the work of their life .
But we don &apos;t bad it , when we feel that because we &apos;ve heard these things so much long that we &apos;ve been interested in some way we &apos;ve been interested in a lot of the notion that the creativity and art , to conduce it , and the art , to conduce the angosses .
And the question I want to take all about it today , is you &apos;re going to do with this idea ?
It &apos;s good , because it also looked at a distance from a distance to me , it &apos;s not good for anything .
I think it &apos;s odiosa .
And I think it &apos;s also periculous , I don &apos;t want to see the perpetuate the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our big minds of creative minds to live .
And I &apos;m sure that , in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start figing to figering that feeling the host of the circumstances that are in my career .
It &apos;s true -- just look , just look , I &apos;m a 40 years .
I &apos;ve got about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything write about it now , it &apos;s going to be right now , and then it &apos;s going to be right now , and I &apos;m going to be successful in my last book .
I &apos;m going to be schippped , because we &apos;re all the larger , my most big successful that my bigger successful is to my house .
Oh , Gesus , that they think .
You know , this is the gender of thinking that it &apos;s going to get a person to start to start to start blow the nine of the next morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would stop to keep doing this work that we do this work that .
So , the question is it becomes , how do it ?
And so it seems to me , after a lot of reflection , which is to do to be able to create a psychological construct , right ?
I have some way to find a safety of safety between me , which I &apos;m written , and my natural anxy on what reaction is going to get it . And as I was trying to do it , and I &apos;m trying to do it , and I &apos;m trying to see if you could get other society to see if they could have the best ideas and more sane and more sances and more sane more sances and more sane and more sances and more slightly the bors and more several ides and more switches and more sure .
to help people to make people believe the inerent risk inerents risk emotional inerents .
And that research me to the ancient Great and ancient Rome .
Seguitself because I gave it into circle and then back .
In the ancient Grex and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem believe that the creativity came from the man , OK ?
It was thinking that creativity was this spirit of divine , and that they came to a few sources and knowledge , for reasons and unknowledge , for reasons and unknowledge .
The greatly called these beyond the beyond the creativity of the creativity . &quot;
She wonderful , wonderful , he was a demone that elargve wisdom .
Romans were the same idea , but they called the kind of spirit , but they called a genius .
which is great , because the Romans didn &apos;t really think a genius was somebody was a particularly smart .
They have a genius was this kind of wind that was this kind of wind , which was the suri of a artist , a little bit like the Dobby , a little bit like Dobby , and that came out to assisted to assisted the work of the artist and model of the work of the work of the work .
Here &apos;s what I &apos;m -- this is , that &apos;s the distance of what I talk about -- that psychological costruth you &apos;re taking on your work .
And everybody knew that was so that it worked , right ?
So , anticient artists were protected by certain things , how to be a lot of narcism , right ?
If your work was except , if you can &apos;t take it all the merit , everybody knew that they had been helped by this genius .
If your work , if your work , it wasn &apos;t all the college , right ?
They all know that was the genius to be a inable .
And so people concept the creativity in the West for a long time .
Then Rind the Rind came and all changed , and nac5 this great idea ; we put it to the humanity in the universe , and we &apos;re all the mistakes and no longer space to make the creatures that write from the divinity .
This was the principle of human human human human , and people started thinking that creativity came to thinking that creativity came out .
And for the first time in history , you started to refer to this or the artist as a rather than a person with a person with genius .
And I &apos;m going to tell you , I think it was a big herror .
I think that allow somebody , a simple person to believe how a real person to believe how the fundamental , the essence and the source of all the divines , creatives , and inknowable to the source of human injudle , and you know , a big philossibility .
It &apos;s like to ask somebody to income the sun .
And it &apos;s fully the ego and creates all these expectations on performance .
And I think it was this pression to destroy artists in the past 500 years .
And if that &apos;s true , and I think it &apos;s the question is , and now ?
Could we do it very different ?
Maybe to get back to a lot more ancient compressed about human relationship between human .
Or perhaps no .
Maybe we can &apos;t song to 500 years of rational thinking about a 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience that was just a sunger scientific suspects on the notion , you know , you following the people seem of their projects .
I &apos;m not going to convince you all about this .
But the question I &apos;d like to take is -- why no ?
Why don &apos;t it think about this way ?
Because it has more sense of every other thing that has ever heard to explain the exasperts of the process of creative process .
A process that , as everybody who ever have ever been excited to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- it &apos;s not good .
And in fact , it can be a lot of paranormal anormal .
I did this met recently , with the extraordinary poeter Ruth Stone , who now 90 years , but it was a few of all life and said me that during his infancient infancient in the Virginia . He was working out in the wait , and he was feeling it , when a poetry .
He said that it was like a fragreous fragreement .
And that was coming up to her to the landscape .
It was going to be , because he was going to be under his feet .
He knew to have one thing to do to do at that point and it was , words , &quot; to run as a matta . &quot;
And so it was going to be followed by this poetry , and he wasn &apos;t going to get a piece of card and a city math , and a fast fast fast , and it &apos;s a fast fast , and he would run it on the page .
Sometimes it couldn &apos;t be fast enough , so correed and correct and correct and correct out of the house and the poetry was going to go through and lost her , and she would continued to rolate through the landscape , trying to do another poet . &quot;
Then there were the time -- this piece of the piece I &apos;m going to be -- there were the moments that was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and was trying to card and the poetry and the poetry and the poetry to go through , and he was going to go , and then he said , that it was like the other hand and , he was going to hold .
He was the poetry out the cade of the tail and he put it into his body and the page .
And these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page and intouched , but the last word on the last word .
So when I heard it -- it &apos;s a little bit , it &apos;s exactly the same .
Not all my process -- they &apos;re not a conducture .
I &apos;m a moving , and my way to work is ; I &apos;m wake to the same horarian every day and swait and go on and over the watch and watching us .
But even in my testardaggine , I &apos;ve been strisciated against that thing , sometimes .
And I &apos;m also imagine that many of you have the han done .
You know , even though the work and the ideas , and they were saying it from a certain fundamental certain the fundamental , I could not know .
And what is this ?
And how can we relationarm to do us to do us to do it , but rather , rather , but rather , rather , what do you do ?
And as much about , the best example of me , the best example of the Tom Waits , which I &apos;ve interviewed the Tom Waits , which I interviewed a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life was the incarnation of the life was the incarnation of the artist , trying to control , to connect these species of impulses , to drive these species of impulses .
But then he said , it &apos;s hot , and a day when he was driving on a walked , and he changed it all for him .
He was wanding and all of a well-like this little brobs , and it &apos;s wonderful , which is it comes in his head , elusive , elusive , elusive , and the head , and the desidst , and the desiderve , but it doesn &apos;t know how to take it .
It &apos;s not a piece of card , it doesn &apos;t have a math , it doesn &apos;t have a record .
So , he started feel this species of old analy to be able to lose , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m saved by this song from this personal song .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And he was walking up to the panic , he stopped .
And I &apos;m going to move the mental process and he did something new .
And I &apos;m going to just just watch and said , &quot; Scushed , &quot; Scushed ? &quot;
&quot; You know , it seems to write a song ?
If you really want to exist , you get a more hit when I can take care of you get care .
You &apos;re going to go to to important something else today .
You know , Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his process , he worked changed after this .
Not work , the work was still hoscure as always .
But the process , and the anxized that was retaken when the genius , the genius that was born , the genius that was nothing else to do problems and liberated it back to where it came out of it , realized , and I realized that it didn &apos;t have to be an interior .
but it was walking this peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and and this external thing that &apos;s not Tom .
And so how much you feel that story to change a little bit about changing a little bit about it .
This idea , he saved me when I was written when I was written , &quot; but , &quot; Ama , and I said , &quot; but we &apos;re all working on something and we &apos;re doing it , and we &apos;re going to think that it &apos;s going to be a disasked , that what &apos;s going to be the worse book .
Not just book , just the book booky written .
And I started thinking about gets this project .
But then I remember Tom who talked about the air and I tried .
So I went up my face in the hoscritical , and I got my comments to a corner of the room .
And I said , &quot; Sent , what we &apos;re going to both , both , both , both , both , you &apos;re going to be very shared , no longer ?
Because as I see us , I &apos;m going to see us all that I have no longer than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to be a lot of them .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , you don &apos;t do it .
I &apos;m going to go to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to favor that I &apos;ve been recorded to do my part &quot; &quot; because I &apos;m going to be a part of the world , OK -- in the deserts of Africa in the deserts of Africa , the people would go to the watch of the wonderful , and the sacross the wake and hours to the alalba .
And they were always magnific , because the balleres were fantastic .
But every long , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became actually transcendent .
And I know you know what I know , because I know you &apos;ve all seen it , a performance .
It was like the time , you stop , and the walking walked through a special species of lad and it wasn &apos;t doing anything about the sun , like 1,000 night before , but all it was winning .
And the improvide not just as a human .
But it happens from the did-inside and sought the divinity of the divinity .
And when this happened , to the time , the times , people know what was called it .
They were going to song , and they started to sing , &quot; Allah , Allah , God , God , God , God , God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curiosa night , when the Maybe , when the Maybe the south of the Spain , took this habits with their own habits and the worked changed in the centuries from Allah , Allah , , &quot; Oh , &quot; Oh , &quot; Oh , &quot; Oh , &quot; Oh , &quot; Oh , &quot; Oh , &quot; which you can still feel in the flamenco .
In Say , when a artist did something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , broads , broads , broads , I &apos;m going to understand , etc , etc , etc -- one scorm of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need .
But , the problem comes back the day after the day , the day , when you wake and wake it , and it turns out that are the 11 in the morning of Martedy and I wrote it &apos;s not more .
It &apos;s just a mortal with the ginockchy , and perhaps it &apos;s not going to be able to be more ascending to that along the height .
And perhaps no one will be going to song the name of God while she &apos;s rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most sweet to make a creative life .
But perhaps not to be so angerous , if you can &apos;t believe , anzyutt , which the most extraordinary exts of your being coming from you .
But I just just just asked you in the data from a unimaginable imaginable inable imaginable of this squish of your life that you have to go to something else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think , it &apos;s all changes .
And so I started thinking , and it &apos;s sure , and it &apos;s sure as I thought I &apos;m going to have a lot of the book that I &apos;m going to stop , the performance , existing , existing , existing , existing , existing , existing , existing , so that I &apos;m going to be followed to be the house , existing periculous , and it &apos;s just going to be following up , and it &apos;s just going to be followered , and it &apos;s peric
And what I have to keep me when I feel electried from this is , not fear .
Don &apos;t wait . It just your work .
It &apos;s going to be presented to you &apos;re on your part , any one can be .
If your work is to ball , if your work is to ball .
If the divine , assume you ask you signed to leave some kind of wonderful , for just through your forced , for just through your forts , &quot; then ! &quot;
You &apos;re going to do the same dance .
And &quot; Oh , &quot; Oh ! &quot;
I think it &apos;s going to do it .
&quot; You know , &quot; to you have the same , even for the human love and test later tal and tape tal tape to be in the same way .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : World .
You know , I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects on the human genome on what can meaning and discovery new set of genes .
Now we &apos;re beginning to a new percoral : we started to digitalize biology and now to go from that code , we &apos;re both in a new biology , designing and synthesizing and synthesizing life .
We always tried to get big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists I think they &apos;re going to get various to understand various flies .
We tried different approach , reducing the minimes of terms .
We &apos;re digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequency the human genome , it was going to spend from the world to the digital world .
Now , we can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the kind of smaller genome that can automot up in lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome for the genome to create a little bit more smaller .
We &apos;re able to eliminate a hundred of genes about 500 that are here .
But when we &apos;re a cycle to his metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple answered to our .
I think , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it &apos;s very imlikely that this can take to a living cell .
So , we decided that the only way to design was synthesize this chromosome , to be able to be modified to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of the &quot; Pan , we can synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Can the chemistry to make these big molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to make these great molecules that we &apos;ve ever been able to make it before ?
And , in case , we can make a craft craft ?
A chromosome is just a piece of inert material .
The speaking that we &apos;re able to digitalize life is growing up to the exponential .
Our ability to write the genetical code , instead , instead , but it &apos;s getting improving .
And our more recent returned to a exponential curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process has require a lot of the past , beginning with a bioetc review of the first experiments .
But we found that that synthetize DNA is very hard .
There are deces of thousands of machines in the world that make small segments of DNA , of the long long time , and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the segment is a long process , and it &apos;s a long process .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments and read the herrors .
And that was our first tenty , to talk about the digital information of the genome of Phi &apos;s genome of Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills kills .
We &apos;ve designed the fragments , actually , effectively of the error and get a molecule of DNA of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting thing is when we took this piece of chemical material chemical material , and we put it in the bacteria , batters , batterns have started to read this genetical code and producing the viral particles .
The viral particles are then you stuck from the cells , they &apos;re going back and they destroy to the Evi .
I &apos;ve been talking about recently members of the oil industry , and they &apos;ve been told that they have certain this model .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build his same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the larger things .
We wanted to build the whole cromosome of the bacteria .
They &apos;re 580 mount letters of genetic code .
So we thought we build it in the casses of viruses , so that we can change the casses to understand what the casses of a cell cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequency this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accuratean herror for every 10 mile .
We found it , and we got it , 30 errors . If we used that we used that original sequence we would never be able to do it .
One part of the process is designing segments , 50 letters that they &apos;re going to be a little bit of 50 letters to build smaller suboundary suboundly , little bit little worlds of the smaller ,
We can see uncleaning elements here .
You probably have lad that we put us on the grain .
Think about it , we have a genetical code on four letters : A , C , OK , and T.
Three those letters of the climbing about 20 amminoid , and there &apos;s a specific order to letters for every amine ammind .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frask , spensive , OK .
What we &apos;ve done is , we &apos;ve been self-doing it .
Some of them have been deluses from the fact that it wasn &apos;t very poetry .
We designed these segments to just put them to the entire just to get them with the entire entire .
There are scientists that they &apos;re releasy to them .
And we started to assembling parts , beginning with the five to seven mile , unendletters , unenduries to make a sisegments of them to make it it over the time to get to 72 mile .
And every step , we have produced these segments in abundance so that we can sequency them to create a very robbust processing a very robustot .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems to be a basket of a basket .
When we &apos;re going to get these very long segment , more than 100 mile , more than 100 mile , they &apos;re not going to be directly in E.
It comes to the limit of the modern tools of molecular biology .
So we &apos;ve been looking at other mechanisms .
We knew another mechanism called the recognizes , which is , in biology , which in biology , biology , which is going to get the DNA to degree the segments .
Here &apos;s one example .
This organism , called Deinoccurs , can make three million rates .
You can see in the slate rest as his own chromosome .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s been assembled .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can do it completely .
They can live under it .
They &apos;re absolutely sure that life in space , and you &apos;re saying to find new environment of water .
In fact , NASA , NASA showed that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built this processed , just using the labor to design appropriate the appropriate design .
The free lievening them .
This picture was not taken to a electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a lot of very big that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that takes a period of about six seconds .
This is the published that we did little time ago .
They &apos;re 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the bigger molecule of a definitely definitely definitely created by the man .
It &apos;s a lot of switch for 300 million .
If we &apos;re going to be a career to 10 without spaces , they would want to get 142 pages to get this genetic code .
Now , how do we do it work ?
Of course , you know , you can get a virus is a little girls .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when you use batteries .
It &apos;s just when it &apos;s simple cells as well as our eucariot : you can just extract the nucleo and inserve another , which is practical process of clonto , that &apos;s a clonto .
In the archaea , the chromosome is integrated by the cells , but we recently demonstrated that we &apos;re able to do a complete trape of a cromosome from one cell of a cell from one one of a cell of a cell of one and activity to another and activated it .
We have a chromosome of a microbial species .
The two are different as the men from the topes .
We added some gene gene in a way to decide that to choose for this chromosome .
The slightly with the scientist , so that we killed to kill all proteins .
And when we put it in the cells was study -- and opened our graph , and opened our graph -- the new cromosoma , cromosoma cell .
And we started thinking that we couldn &apos;t go to beyond , but we tried to spin there .
This is one of the most evolution of evolution .
We found that many species that tants have added a second or a third or a third or a third thousands of new species , addition to a thousand of species of new species .
So who think about evolution as a gene gene at time , it &apos;s not understanding of biology .
There are the scientist of the restriction scientist that addition that addition to digerize the DNA .
The croms that was in the cells didn &apos;t have one .
The cell phones that we have been inserit-ch-chromosome .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other craft as extraneous material , and we got it , and we got it with just cells and the new cell and the new cell and the new cell .
it became blue because of the genes that we &apos;ve been inserted .
And in a short lass of time , all the characteristics of a species are going to be perse , and it turned out to a new species , based on the new software that we inserted in the cells .
All the protein are changed , membranks are changed , and when we &apos;re reading the genetic code that we &apos;ve been standing .
Now , this could seem seem genetics , but altering the software DNA software , we can change things in the manippulate .
Now , I &apos;ve got explained that here is not talking about genese -- but we have a few million years old old old , and I &apos;ve already been doing that , perhaps we &apos;re going to make a new version of the explosion of this .
Why do this ?
I think it &apos;s pretty obvious when we think about our necessity .
We &apos;re going to spend six billion and a half people in the next 40 years .
Right to give an example : I &apos;m born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each of the planet for each one , in 46 years , there &apos;s four .
We &apos;re doing problems now to find food , fresh water and pulital , medical medical and a half of people .
It &apos;s going to be more dare going to do it for nine billion .
We &apos;re going to start five billion carbon , more than 30 billion barils , more than 30 billion barils .
That means millions of barils a day .
When we &apos;re trying to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replaces , it &apos;s a huge challenges , it &apos;s a huge challenges .
And the most of the most of the CO2 emission of CO2 materials that finished in the atmosphere .
And the day of today , thank you for scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they &apos;re the design for the future .
The electronic industry only a dozen about components , and think about how many different things are out .
Our limits here are principlally principlally , biological , and our imagination .
Now , we have some techniques , thank you for these free free synthetization , able to create what we call a combinatory .
We &apos;re able to build a robot that can make a robot that can make a million croms a day .
Think of these 20 million genes or a different genes or try to get to optimize the processes to make a little bit or drugs , new vaccines , we can change , and we can change , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology that in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for possibility of survival , production chemistry or carburant , production of vaccines .
This is a few of some software programmed to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to switch and design species on the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know , we don &apos;t know how they &apos;re going to be .
We know exactly what they &apos;re doing is their genetic code .
Now we &apos;re focus on the carbons of how much generation .
You &apos;re seeing you see that extract from the grain of grain , it was a very finished experiment .
We have carbons of second and third generation that will use enough enough to the sun carbon the high of the highest value as the opens or different kinds of butanol .
But the only way the biology can have a big impact with a big impact without increasing more than food and limiting the food and limiting the satives would be transforming CO2 , before , we &apos;re working to design cells that can do the cell of the car that , and we think of the art of how to do that , and we think of the spring of how to 18 months .
The solar light , combined with CO2 , it &apos;s a meodownload , but in our discoveries around the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism that we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
It &apos;s about 2500 feet of deep , about 2500 feet of deep-deep-founded temperature of water .
It &apos;s going to put out out from CO2 to the molecular power .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can incanalate the CO2 , which can make it easily be transported by your books , converted that CO2 carbons , to drive this process .
So we think we could be able to be able to increase what we could be able to increase what the question is , &quot; We have the fast life is Notherefore , we have the modest industry , we have the modest industry to replacing the whole oil industry .
It &apos;s just . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can you do it from ?
It would be a main the fundamental power .
And also , we &apos;re working to use the same metods to create vaccines .
You see this year with influence , we &apos;re always forward to influence , we &apos;re always going to find a dollar when it &apos;s right .
I think what you can change is actually changing a combinable vaccines .
That &apos;s how the future could start to change , now , the evolution of evolution , accelerating evolution with the synthetic evolution with synthetic batteries , and finally cells .
We &apos;re going to be like to improvide people .
Our purpose to be able to live enough to try to make it . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show , the most quickly possible , some fundamental work , the new technology that we took to Microsoft in a year ago ago ago . This is Seadon . This is Seadon . This is Seadon .
It &apos;s a environment that you can interact with a local level that remote with a huge amount of visive data .
Here we &apos;re seeing a lot of digital picture of digital photograph with a kind of switch of a slide , and I continue , to a speak , disponing pictures like .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these column data or images .
Most of the digital photographs , but this example is a example example of a scanning from the Bibliotecame from the Biliotector of the 300 megapiel .
It doesn &apos;t do any difference because the only thing that limits the presents of a system like this is the number of plxeless . It &apos;s also a very flicky architecture . It &apos;s also a very flessible architecture .
This is a whole thing , you know , not images .
This is the Dickens of Dickens . Every colonnursing a capital .
And to show you that it &apos;s about heads and not images , we can do something like to be like to see it really , to see it really , to see that it &apos;s a real representation of the heads , not a picture .
It could be a little bit a little bit artificial to read a book for a book .
It doesn &apos;t look at it .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s a number of the Guardian .
Every big picture is the beginning of a set .
And it really really , you really like to read and beauty experience of a newspaper of a newspaper or a lot of median , which is for nature a lot of medium .
We also did something with the angle of this particular number of this particular number of the Guardian .
We &apos;ve created a fasult published the higher solutions -- much more higher than that uses use in a published normal contained you to the extra extra extra .
If you want to see the carbon this automobile , you can see it .
Or other models , or even specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space to be screen .
We hope that this means to put the pop-up to the pop-up , and other chases , they should not be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this camp , if not to spend time , if we don &apos;t have contributed to this camp .
These are all the streets in the U.S. Sovrappose of the NASA geospatial picture of NASA .
So now , we go to something else .
This is actually actually , from the website ; you can go to it .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seady and the other is a visual search of the computer very interesting computer very interesting . In fact , a student of the University of the University of Seitz , with the Steve Seitz of the UW and Rick Seliski , and Research Seliski Microsoft Research . &quot;
And it &apos;s from the web , the Web , and it &apos;s further .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from one picture to the other picture of the other and have this kind of experience .
But the space of images here , it &apos;s actually a meaning .
So , you know , visualization of the computer have recorded these pictures together , so that they run to the read light , so that the read -- all the closer Grases , the near glaghes on the Montne Roccial Montne Roccial Montne Roccial , and these things are all the colleagues of a slikely to the rate of the whole space of slies , and these things are all the colleagues .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more space .
I want to spend directly to one of the original data of Noahahotion -- and this is a prototype of Photosynth of Photosynth , we &apos;ve done for the first time , the extent , the squeet the key , and it &apos;s not necessarily the key ey ey , and it &apos;s not necessarily not just just just watching the environments that we &apos;ve got to put in the sweb .
We had to worried about the legal aspects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of Noth-Dothers Do images images to Flickr . Bast Din Flickr , and you get images of types in magic magic and and so on . Evotion , and on these broads , and so on . Every one of these things , you know , you know , you know , you know , and you get out of this model .
So , I &apos;m all got all over Flickr and they &apos;re all college to the space .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this simplicish .
You know , I would never think I &apos;d never thought to end to be working for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratififting this kind of account here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of different kinds of photos of focus in the cellular phones in the middle of the phones in this environment .
And if I can come up , I try to try to look at the most strange .
Many of them are block , etc .
Sometimes there &apos;s a series of photographs -- etc .
This is a Noth-Decrecorded correctly .
We can go from the poster to the physical physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is taking data -- from the entire memory of how to applied the land , from vision of vision , visual view , and they all those data together .
All those pictures become college , most of the parts of parts .
You have a model of the earth that emerge .
Think about this as a prolgment of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as well as people use it , and the advantages to the way to use to use to use it .
Their pictures are marced with metadical metadical .
If somebody comes to contrast all these saying the name , my picture of the name of Nothname , my picture of Nothers of all those data , and I can use a point of floor , and I can use point to the slide of the space , and I can use photographing , and to have a lot of cross-mooth experience of cross-mode from the sound and critical challs .
Of course , a consequence of all that are virtual model of every interesting model of every part interesting part of the land , collected collected , and by images and satellite images and satellitarious memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What your software going to be doing is going to be doing is that , in the next few years , all the photographs , all the photographs from everybody in the world will be reading ?
BA : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is doing is to discover .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of pictures .
The thing is very interesting is about if you think about the recknizes of simple information that many of these images have been able images .
As when you &apos;re doing a research of images on the web , and the heads on the web , it &apos;s a lot of information about picture .
Now , what happens if that picture is a picture of your picture ?
So the amount of simantity , and the amount of reccheiving it is really huge . It &apos;s a classical classical effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible .
BA : You &apos;re very much .
One of the main the main , when you travels and one of the ethnographic research is the power of the ancient of the traditions , between the wind , the spend the past in the wind , the swind , the slide , the drop , and the further .
Bastes to think the months , Jaguar , and the Lattea , or that the Lattea , or the Mitites are still meaning , or Himalaya , or that in Himalaya , to replaced the respile of Dharm , to remember the importance of the central Dharma , and the idea that the world that the world that we live not in sense that there is no sense , but it &apos;s just a kind of really , but it &apos;s just a model , but it &apos;s just a model of actually not just a model of reality , but it &apos;s just a way of the world ,
the consequence of a particular scowever , the adaptative , that our stirles did , well or a lot of generations ago .
And of course , we all share the essential essential .
We all all of them . We all do .
We &apos;re looking at the time .
We have to stop to death the inesorability of death , so we don &apos;t take it up to the heads and ballize --
We all have a art .
What the song is the particular rate is the particular rate of canzone , the dance of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that they &apos;re the Since of the Borneo , or the following Vooo Haiti , or the desert Kaisut , or the desert Kenya , or a walking to Kenya , or a cameleleras the Sahara .
He was my journey of the journey in the desert a month ago , or a hyak high hallevator , on Everest , the Everest , the dea mother of the world .
All of these populations teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , others of moving in the world .
And if you reflected a second , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
And with them , the cultures of the world are beyond a spiritual life . And that &apos;s important to the planet , and it &apos;s important to the planet as a lot of the planet as a biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural girl cultural as a nosphere and you can call the ethnosphere , but the total , until , history , ideas , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , and you can see the ethnosphere .
The ethnosphere is the fantastic patrimonium of humanity .
It &apos;s the simple symbol of what we &apos;re , and what we can be in how inquissue .
And because the biosphere was really really consumed it , others , and it was too much more quickly .
Not a biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all the species is on the extinction of the extinction of the simply , or -- in the most apocalitty -- in the most apocalitty -- and you don &apos;t even near the most optimistic diversity of cultural diversity .
The injection of all that , of course , the lost linguistic perfect .
When you were there 6,000 lingures on this planet .
One language is not just composed by a vocabulary or a series of grammad rules .
One language is the spray of human spirit .
It &apos;s the medium with the animal of every culture is coming in in the material world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a wind , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibility .
And those 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re seitting in Monterey , at least half the hecks of children .
They don &apos;t come to teach children , which is , the children want to say , not wasn &apos;t wonderful something , which are already .
What is there more trists of being fly fly from silence , the last one language to be the last one language , not have a way to transmit the wisdom of the basic wisdom ?
This is horing is the state of somebody in the world every two weeks : every two weeks and a bany broads and door with the tomb and the tomb , and it &apos;s the tomb .
And I know somebody who will say , &quot; Is it doesn &apos;t that ?
The world would be no better place if we &apos;re going to talk about the same language ? &quot; Benish , then we all talk all the hyoruba .
Let &apos;s talk about kogi .
You &apos;ll discover a tract thing to say , not to tell their language .
I &apos;m going to do a journey through a journey through the etnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a massive thing that we &apos;re losing .
A lot of us mental details that when I say , &quot; I mean , &quot; I mean , I mean , &quot; I really mean ,
We take for example this white while Barasana , Amazon , Amazon , the population of anonda , which creates the best of the latest argument of the latest west waste of spended latest sacres .
It &apos;s a population that &apos;s not able to distinguished the blue color , because the cell of the best , because the cell of the forest , where the forest , where the population .
They have a strange language and a mathoral rule , &quot; exogamia , &quot; exogamia , you have to site one person who talks about a person who talks about a different language .
So , all of this has been mythological past , yet et the particularity is that in these families that are talking about six or seven lingures , no one languages no one languages .
They get to listen and and then they start to talk .
Let &apos;s take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived , the Waoran Ecuador Ecuador , an incredible population , an incredible population that had the first contact in 1958 .
1957 five missionaries have tented a commitment contact .
They &apos;ve been written from the high photographs that they read them in poses that they had been advice , forest that this population of the forest pluvial forest had never seen seen anywhere .
They have a picture of the land , they turned it to the research of a form or a shape and , they didn &apos;t find nothing , they &apos;ve been concluses that they were the died , and they killed the five missionary .
But Waorans don &apos;t just killed the strange .
They kill them on their own .
54 percent of the mortality was caused to them .
We &apos;re saving at eight generations and we found two cases of morning and when we &apos;ve been insisted to know , they &apos;ve got to know , they &apos;ve been invected to be an unecting , and then they killed it . &#91; &#91; Raunk every way , they had a incredible knowledge of the forest .
The hundred degrees were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps and recognizes the species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was asked a very interesting comfortable when the professor of Harvard professor , I was asked to Haiti to Haiti to intrucraft society and Tonton Macines , and Tonton Moubles , and I impossessed me to the zome that I use to use to do the zome that to me to do the zome that I use to do to the zome that I &apos;m using to do to the zome to do to do the zoh the zome Haiti to the zome of the zomb
To give a sense to the miraculous sense , I should understand the Vodouble culture . And that Voo , and that Voo hern &apos;t magic .
It &apos;s pretty much a complicated complicated , metaphopefs of the world .
It &apos;s interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , etc , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has no feeling feeling . And he was , and the Vooo , and Vooo is not other than the distilled , in these concepts of these concepts in the tragic tricity .
What makes interesting is the wonderful , is the reintense between life and death .
So , the vive they &apos;re going to get the spiritual .
The spirits can be invocated by Grande Aqua , answered the ritm of the dance of the dance of the dance animates of the vive in a shape that for a shape that for a short ,
So , this is going to go to the watch , &quot; You white white white you go to the God .
We &apos;re going to start in the temple and become God . &quot;
And the moment you &apos;re possitting , is the spirit that you guide you , how can you do it .
So , you listens to these incredible events : following voodoo , the wild-to-touched a rather strong demonstration , infuel force of the power of the power of the mind of the power of the body on the body state of the power of the body was catalyzed .
The people with all the population with the most extraordinary people are the most extraordinary Kogi of Santa Marta , in Colombia .
Discent of the ancivilization that once the carairplanes of Colombia planet , the population of the conquickly , the population of the vulation , the population of carbon the car planture .
In a drug continent of blood , this population never been conquicted by the spagners .
And I &apos;m going to have been government by a clero , but their formation is really extraordinary .
The young people following up to three or four years , and four years , and they live seem in a world of good , and they live in a world , and bombs in the brobs of the ice for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years , I &apos;m going to reproduce the nine months of gestation that transmit in the user of the mother , now are metaphor in the Addle Mther .
So , for all of this time , they &apos;re acculated to values of their society , values that their predicts and only their predict to their prevent , they &apos;re going to be the cosmic equilibrium .
At the term of this incredible initiation , they &apos;re improvide taking out and the first time , in the age of 18 years , see a high alba . And that &apos;s the actional activity of the first bore , when the sun blows the first blowers , everything that have learned in theory , everything that have learned in theories . The past a step behind and says , &quot; The pass a past and says , &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m going to be like , I said .
It &apos;s just just . Now it &apos;s looking . It &apos;s going to protect it . &quot;
It &apos;s called the most people and say that we , frackage , we &apos;re the brothers , we &apos;re the destruction of the world .
This level of intuition is very important .
When we think of Indigene populations and the environment , and the old story of the night , which is a razy concept , which is a razy concept to the owners are closer to the Earth of people are more closer to the Earth of us .
The indebulads are not nor sentimental people are not indebulate from nostales .
There is no space for these things in the disease of the disease of Abon , and the Tibet , but thank you to have a mystic mystic war , they &apos;ve created a mistic intuition of the Earth is not about the concept of the Earth is not just infected , and the concept that the Earth can live out of the world .
What does it mean ?
It &apos;s going to be a little girls who grow up to the mountain is a mountain is a south of Apu that will be a very different human . And it &apos;s going to be a fast fast , and it &apos;s going to be a foundly different , with a little bit different mountain the Montana that growth is a little bit of a male rocket of the world , and you know , a rocket to be screen .
That &apos;s the dimmonths of one spirit or a mineral cy is irrievant .
What &apos;s interesting is the meaning is the measurements of the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Columbia cred-broads , they &apos;re growing up to be wrong .
That has a different human being from my friends Kwakiutl Kwakiutl that make the forests are the Huk dimour of Hukuk and the song of the paradigase of the paradigase , and the nadies that live in the world , explained the Hamatory of the world , explained Hamatory .
If you start to consider that these cultures can actually actually actually , different , you can start to understand some of their sensational sensational sensational sensational sensational .
I went to this picture to open up in the Amazon in the Western Amazon .
Mayahuge some of you have heard of the ayahuge , the most powerful sushed the repertorium .
What it makes fascinating the ayahuask is not the drug potential of the pharmacological potential , but his elements . It &apos;s composed for two elements .
She &apos;s a lady , this lian lian lian amount of the carbon of the carbon , harmin the harmed , and literally hallucinogene .
It turning the sun plant , you have a blueaster that altery alterm a little bit the conscience , but it &apos;s mscowever , with the floor of the family of the family of the family caffects .
This plants , a little bit of triptamin , very similar , a methods to serotonine , methods , methods , methods , methods .
If you never see the Yanomami to the nose to the sushed of a different species , and it &apos;s a different species , anched methoxyltryltryltryltryltryptamin .
Tiring that polly on the nose is a little bit like being sparked by a little bit like to be sparked by a wake of electricity . &#91; Ready , &quot; Don &apos;t believe a distorsion of reality .
I just just often often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who wrote the was psychedelical , with his discovered fungi in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s ,
And I think of my countries can &apos;t classified these triptamin the summer , because if you &apos;re doing , you can &apos;t tell no one of being asked . &#91; Rish triptames , but they can &apos;t be absorbuted . And the triptiny , they &apos;re not going to be absorbed by a scientist that intestine , dead a bunkey , deal with a namine-test .
It &apos;s possible to assumerged to be assume , if you make a chemicals that money are the MAO .
Now , it &apos;s beautiful : the carbon , which is the lian inibitors are inibitors of the MAO , the same kind of needs . The question : in a flow flow of 80,000 species of plants , how do these people are going to find two deadies of plants , how they do these people find these diadeaths , but if you &apos;re combined to this way , they &apos;re superior the slightly .
We use the big euphens of the herror , that can reveal .
But if you ask the Indians , they &apos;re going to say , &quot; Phing us . &quot;
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuge , which distinguished in the forest , and that our eyes would be in the same species .
If we ask them how they stabilish their tasonomy will tell us &quot; I thought I was able to say , &quot; I &apos;m not going to be ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution : you get the 17 variety in a night of lllled , and each one will care with a different song .
With this is not laureduced to Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting that contact .
Now , &#91; &#91; opplauses , the problem is that also the ones that have the dies of us who have the house climbing people , but somehow reduces to the history of the history of the world , and the way to our real world , and the way to the world .
In fact , the century century , between 300 years , not going to be remember for his driver or innovations , but rather as the way we stop and and we absolutely became or the way we stopped and the active destruction of the biological diversity and cultural planet . Now the problem is not the problem .
Everyone culture , through the centuries in a dance for new possibilities of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians don &apos;t have to be Sioux when they put out to be Sioux when they put it up and fast as Americans don &apos;t have to be Americans have been horse when they put it from horse and hot .
It &apos;s not the change or the technology , they &apos;re mind of the ethnosphere . It &apos;s the power . It &apos;s power .
The wall of the domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you &apos;ll find that these are not destiny culture .
They &apos;re creatures and dynamics out out of the existence of the hydamics of adaptation .
And what it &apos;s going to be disbosing in the patria pppatria .
a population of Sarawak , in the asian asian asian , a population ago , a population ago , and now reduced to a generation ago , and now reduced to the rest of the restrices , where the children seems to the Bort Merian Cinese Bornear to Merian Ciny Merian , where the naves the Japanese Meriownaves , where the naves the naves the slie , where the naves the names the naves the slie of the south of the silt of the soughts the silt of the silt of the soughts to the glllder the glder the g
It &apos;s going to reply stive to stop the best forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that are come with the discovery of the gold .
If we move on the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the political domination .
You know , you know the physical extinction of a population , is condanned to the universal level , but the ethnium of a population of a population , but not just condanned , but also cell , it &apos;s not just condanned , because it &apos;s part of the developing world .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of Tibet until you go out .
I &apos;m going to go to the 6,000 miles from Chengagu in the Western China , and the Western Tibet , and I came to Lhasa young college , but only came to Lhasa , I realized what we feel behind .
6,000 feet mountain sacrates and cens .
1.2 million people killed people in the military Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascrited to Panchen Lama .
which is to say that it was killed to the time of the Chinese invasion .
And the guy is figure out with Santity during the diasporates that has taken the population in Nepal .
Soum was imprisoned and his color was recipes .
It was taken to the age of two years , naax of two years , nax under his gonna because it wouldn &apos;t have to live without him .
The source , that has done the same , it was put in the field of reeducation .
A day has been called the calculated a raffuring a Mao and , for this transgression , it was put up on the seven years .
The Tibet of the Tibet can insophy , but the reducer spirit of the population is taking .
She turned out , it all redded to a choice .
We want to live in the world world world to be in the world world , or we want to collect the policromatical world ?
The great anthrologist Margaret Mead , before we die said that his bigger was that , in our own lives in our love to this love love love of the world , we &apos;re not just going to see the whole amount of human imagination , but a day we &apos;re going to see us to be able to sleep to a day , but a day day we &apos;re seeing to be able other possibilities .
And it &apos;s a humiliant to remember that our species is existed for 60,000 years .
The Revolution , Neolitics , which has given us the agriculture , which has done us to be a few seeing the cult of the sea poem of the swall with the next few of the clero , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The industrialized world industrialized has 300 years .
That slights , I &apos;m not suggests that we have the answer to all the challenges that we &apos;re going to get in the millenny millenny to come .
When the world &apos;s myriades of cultures of the world is asked to be human , they say , &quot; they say with 10,000 voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all discover the possibility of being what we &apos;re : a consciousness , that have to be what we &apos;re like to do is , all the people and all the people and all the people can fire . And there are great moments .
I went to this picture on the north of the north island of Baffin , when I went to the balene with Inuit , and this man , and this man , and this man , Olaya , Olaya story of his non-history .
The government was not always gency with the Inuit and the 1950 to stabilies to stabilies our premistabilies , we &apos;ve got them in colonies .
The non-grandfather refused to go .
And the family , for his life , he brought out all the arms , and all his touches .
You have to know that Inuit doesn &apos;t have the cold , they &apos;re sweet .
The slites of the slites were made of fish fly .
The non-hand-hand-in-saying , the arcle night , or the blizem that was .
It &apos;s healthy up , it &apos;s heated , it &apos;s healed the pin the skin of focus and defecated in their hand . When the fecky did it , they work on a lama .
It &apos;s spruried on the points of this cacca cacca crowd , and when I solid , he killed a dog .
He schooled the dog and created a bridge , with the hactical casses , and it &apos;s imposed to be a sliterally , he &apos;s hot up to the banchisa rest .
We want to talk about cavarsela nest ? &#91; Rather &#93; &#93; . And this , in different ways , &#91; Applauses , &#91; Applauses , and all the digits of the population of the world .
In the 1999 , the cancer government has redded by the Inuit &apos;s total control of a territorum of a territorum of the California and the Texexas I went together .
It &apos;s their new patria . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a washing territory . They &apos;re all the mineraries .
One thing about example of how a national national state can recognize with his population .
And , finally , I think it &apos;s rather obvious at least eye , I think it was in these zones of the planet , make it connects that they don &apos;t have remote .
For somebody &apos;s home .
They know , the seats of human imagination that risallow the alba alba . And for us , the dreams of these children , as the team , become part of the geography of the geography of the hy of hope .
For finally , we &apos;re not going to be convints that political are not going to be aren &apos;t arrive .
We believe that polemy --
&#91; &#91; &#91; Applasive &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; &#93; Each , and maybe we &apos;re the best institution to tell stories of the world . Each our 35 million living .
156 countries , countries our television .
Our revists come up leven from millions of people .
Our work is to travel in eththnosphere to bring our public addition to the public wonderful , and hope , it &apos;s hope , and hope , hope , they &apos;re hope , to hope , and hope , and we have to find a focus in the different different different , and we have to find a lifloor of life in a world , and we have to find a buralistic world and multiculticultural to the world to be in a world , and we have to find a hope ,
where the wisdom of all the population can contribute to our own own benefit .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope reped others , and I &apos;m going to evidence some college , in case , not notice them .
I want to start with what I call the &quot; dogma dogma . &quot;
The dogma officer of what ?
The dogma offical of all the Western industrial society . The dogma officer : &quot; If you want to male the benefits of our citizens &quot; The &quot; The way to do it is to male the individual freedom of individual . &quot;
The reason , from a side , from a side , in fact that liberty is in the sliberty , it &apos;s essential , useful , essential , essential , essential , essential , essential , is precious , for humans .
At the other is , if we &apos;re libers , each of us can act to do all that that masses our benefit , no one of us , no one that decide in name .
The way to male the freedom is to male the choice .
More choices people have , more libesise , and most of them is their freedom , most of them is their well-being .
This is , I think , it &apos;s so deep radict in society that no one would be able to put it in the society .
And it &apos;s also deeply radicated in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I lose a simple notice on the conditions for injustake .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without contact 10 variety of oolids , and the 12 acets , and the 12 acets that you can buy to buy a huge number of condent condent that no one of the remarkable condent is to your deal .
That &apos;s the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic negotial to buy a stereo : I hope , CD , radio , radio , radio , radio , radio , amplifier ,
And in this single negotide , there &apos;s a big number of audio .
We can realize six and a different half and a different combinations that there are a negotiate .
You need to admit that there &apos;s a little bit of choice .
Other wild-fields : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all the baby services , and the basic phone , and the bad bell that were forniture by the Bell .
It was born the phone , didn &apos;t buy it .
One of that , one of that , the phone , was the phone was never going to be .
These times they went .
We have a variety of phones , almost illimiting phones .
Here &apos;s the future of the future .
My favorite is the middle , MP3 , MP3 , tapels of nose , and broken for me .
If you don &apos;t see it still seen in the house house , you &apos;re broken certain that , you &apos;re going to get it .
And what happens is that the end is that people are in the news and it &apos;s the answer ? And it &apos;s the answer ? The answer is &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cellular phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
So , other expect of life that are much more important than the aquy , you &apos;re going to be the same explosion .
Assistence : Dr. Don &apos;t happen in the United States that you &apos;re going to go to the doctor , what you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do it , or we could do , &quot; At these benefits , &quot; At these benefits . &quot; And that &apos;s what do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Dr. &quot; What would I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; It has these benefits , and the risks , and the risks . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebats , &quot; Dr. I &apos;m going to do it ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result of the disease , &quot; The &quot; autonomy of disease , expression that make it a beautiful thing .
But it &apos;s not that one to site the fish and responsibility to make decisions from somebody who knows something , hossing , and so that we don &apos;t know -- and so it &apos;s not about -- and so it doesn &apos;t know -- and so , it doesn &apos;t know -- it &apos;s not a real condition to make the patient decisions .
There &apos;s a huge marketing products , drug direct to people like me and you , which if you think about it doesn &apos;t understand it .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why do they published them ?
The answer is that they want to domacine , we call the doctor to ask us to change the recise .
Something like this is our orever high identity is a question of choice , as you see in this jet , as you see in this jump . We &apos;re going to be force . &quot; We don &apos;t want to force the right now . &quot; We don &apos;t want to inventing .
And we can reinventing us how many times us aggry .
which means that every morning , to sleep , to spend that kind of guys you want to be .
And I said to the family and mathy , a time the next community , a time the next common , under it &apos;s almost for anyone , it was that you were able to get the most of possible , and it started to make it .
The only waste was with who , and not even when , and not even what to do after .
It &apos;s really really to play .
And I &apos;m smart students very smart , and I think of their 20 percent in the work for a time .
And it &apos;s not because they &apos;re not brilliant , because they &apos;re not going to be brilliant .
But why are they impensieritites , I mean , I &apos;m going to ask me , &quot; I would I get to do it now ? &quot;
&quot; I should spose me more taring ? I have to think about the field ? &quot;
They &apos;re interrupt .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this implement doesn &apos;t completely get the compitation and not get a bel wonderful watch .
And they have to do it . They have to do it .
Now , the job : we &apos;re lucky , as Carl the sacross us to work every day , every day , every day , every day , from Hotel Randolph .
It &apos;s a angoline , there &apos;s a angolin , and I &apos;m not going to tell no one , where the WiFi works .
I &apos;m not saying it , because I want to use it .
What does , this incredible freedom of choice that we have to do it , we have to continually decide , if we have to work or no .
We can go to our child to see our child , with the cell phone in a task , the Blackberry , the Blackberry , and the night , and the night , on the ginockberry .
And even though they &apos;re all spent , every minute that we see our child to run the partners , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; I have to answer this called ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? I have to go this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , &quot; It makes the experience of your child very different from what would be in other conditions .
So , somewhere we look at , little and big things , and big materials , and the life is a choices , life is a choices .
Once the world was this : Over , there were some possibilities , but it was not a question of choice .
The world today &apos;s like this : The dilemma is , &quot; That &apos;s a positive , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is , it &apos;s going to be .
So , we &apos;re all going to know , so I &apos;m going to talk about negative them .
And this is all about two effects , two effects negative effects on people .
The first , paradoxide , is that it &apos;s going to be walking .
With a lot of options that choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I &apos;m going to offer an example , meaning a study conduct on the planet .
A lot of college , and the data of Vanald data , the gigantic society of the world , with about a million climents in 2,000 companies .
What she found out of the discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in the most , percentage of adesion two percent .
With 50 source , there &apos;s 10 percent of adesions , there &apos;s 10 percent of adesions . Why ?
Because with 50 sourds between what choose , it &apos;s disease , it &apos;s disease , and the choice is coming up to the indomances .
And the domorders , domorgumans , domorange , domorange , and of course , .
You know that it doesn &apos;t mean , these worldwide food for cans because they &apos;re not going to be saying that the decision is so obstic that decision is so obstic that they also lose the complementary complementary dator of work .
They &apos;re not going to be saying , they &apos;re losing to five dollars a year from the work , which would be willing to be them .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too much .
And I think that &apos;s going to make the world .
&quot; And finally , to finished , eet ethernity ? &quot;
You &apos;d like to take right right to take the right decision , if it &apos;s for eternity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the source wrong , and nepurpure the wrong .
So , this is the first effect . The second is that even though we can avoid the paralysis , at the end , we &apos;re less satisfaced from the result of how we would have been with less options to be with less options to choose .
And that &apos;s why it &apos;s a different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of these is that , if you buy a lot of saying , if you buy a lot of picture that you could imagine that you could have a different choice that you could have a different choice that would be better . And what &apos;s happened . And what &apos;s happening is that the alternative imagined by the decision of the scoice , and the slide of the decision , and the decision , and the sweet , and the decision of the decision of the decision ,
even when it was a very good decision .
More choices there are , more easy than any detail of whatever details .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call cost opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has asked very well , as the value we &apos;re going to depend things that we &apos;re going to be .
And the rest , when there are many possible options , it &apos;s easy to repress the career cards of the alternative towards and be less satisfying on the option of option that is choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I wrote with all that I &apos;m not in New York .
But that &apos;s probably what you would probably think .
There &apos;s this coppia Hamptons .
A place of luses .
It &apos;s going to be splendes . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not not eat . But what he thought is , &quot; Well , maledition , is Agost . &quot;
&quot; Everybody my nearly nearly . &quot;
&quot; I could talk about the front of home . &quot;
And the idea that &apos;s two weeks , assiled on the idea that &apos;s driving -- every day -- the chance of parking where it wants .
The cost-opportunity to diminishes the sod-on what we have , even when choice was eccellent .
And the most of options that we have to consider , the most people are going to be returned to us to get up as a construct opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
We talk about the time , and perhaps it &apos;s just the time , and perhaps it .
But the most important point is that anything you choices , you choose to do other .
The things that we don &apos;t choose to do less attractive active active .
Tirst point : exploit &apos;s growing up the expectations .
I tried it on my skin , and I &apos;m buying a new jeans .
I &apos;m just going to be jeans .
Once the jeans were a kind of bought them and wrest on the dress , they were dissions , only after they were a life and worked a lot of time , started to go good .
So I went to buy a couple of a couple when the old ones were going to buy a couple of jeans , and I said , &quot; I need a couple jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
The said , &quot; Who wants to me , &quot; Who wants to fit , relaxy and fit ? &quot;
With it with the certain or both ? &quot; &quot; &quot; Stonewashed &quot; or &quot; acidwashed ? &quot;
&quot; Would you want to street ? &quot;
&quot; Sucder them , or strets ? Bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla .
I was balordit , and after a little bit , and after a little bit , I &apos;m like , &quot; I want the only kind of -- that was the only kind of , &quot; It didn &apos;t know what I &apos;ve got to do . And then I &apos;m going to get all the disease , I wall , I wall , I wall , I wall ,
It was the very massive . I got all that choice .
But I felt about it .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand it .
The reason I was world-stake , and that I was high high haltissim , jeans have to be drawn .
I started waiting , I didn &apos;t expectations of it . I didn &apos;t expected it , when there was only one kind of 100 different , hundred different , hundred different , hundred a kind of perfect .
What I had to do is good , but not perfect .
After the wait , I was asked to what I was trying to insoon on expectations .
The addition of options in life , not do that , they don &apos;t do the expectations that have answers to the eclency of options .
And this will product less sod-sod-s-fully , even when the results are good .
No one in the world of marketing it .
Because if they knew it , you &apos;re not known what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth looks like this .
&quot; You know , when it was worse , &quot; The reason that the reason it was better when you were worked , when it was worse , when it was going to be worse , you know , when it was going to meet the surprised of the surprised .
Everyday , in the world that we live -- opulents , industrialized , citizens with the perfection -- the massive that we can hope is what they &apos;re going to hope is what the heighborhood .
You never surprised to be surprised for your expectations , and expectations , you &apos;re ingiganten .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- it &apos;s , &quot; Basse expectations , &quot; Yes , you want . &quot;
I mean , little bit of the road time -- which are really sposed and my wife is really really sposed and it really really study .
I couldn &apos;t have to do better , I &apos;m not going to do better ,
But it &apos;s not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of buy a couple of jeans scomod-jeans is that when there &apos;s only that when you &apos;re not sure , and ask you , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot;
The world is the responsible . What could I do you do ?
When there are hundreds of types of jeans , and you buy a display , and you ask you who is the responsible responsible , is otherwise you .
You could do better .
With hundreds of variety , there are no screen .
So when people take decisions , even though the result is walked , they &apos;re standing , they &apos;re standing and they &apos;re going to be the color .
In the last few years , depression is exploss in the industrialized world .
I think a meaning , a meaning -- not the only important , but it &apos;s important -- of this wonderful wateres , because the standard people experience of depress because the standard are too high high .
And when they have to explain this situation thought the colpan is .
So the final result is that we &apos;re better better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma offical , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely false . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt doubt that a little bit better than it doesn &apos;t have to do it , but it doesn &apos;t get it to be better than a little bit better .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But they &apos;re pretty sure we &apos;ve been surgery , where the choices choices the choices .
Now , from the political point -- I &apos;ve almost finished -- from the political point of vision , the nocle is the following .
What allows all of this choice in the industrial society is the material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you &apos;re known , what the problem is not they have too much .
The problem is they &apos;ve got too little .
So the face of the fends I &apos;m talking about is a diesclusive diesclusive society .
And what it does to do is , and arrand it &apos;s this : Steve Levitt talked about how those expensive , and they &apos;re saying a lot of money . It &apos;s a lot of money . It &apos;s a lot of money . It &apos;s a lot of money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and dispendent , it &apos;s not just inutionary .
They &apos;re going to be additions .
They do it worse .
If a little bit of what our society allows , it &apos;s been revered in those where people have too few possibilities , it would not just be just their lives , it would not just be the improvide , but also our improvide .
This is what economists call a horgation .
A despite of the reduction of it does not just just the poor to the poor -- it causes of this choice that turns us .
To conclude , &quot; You can become all of what you want to do --
You , people of culture , you think , &quot; What does that do that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t get it in a glass . &quot;
&quot; Sometimes , a limited vision limitated , a limitation of the world -- &quot;
and I &apos;m going to be interpret , in the beginning .
But then , I think about , instead , I realized that the fish long-head .
Because the reality of the fact of the bock , it &apos;s the bock , so that , &quot; You don &apos;t get the freedom . You get the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you can get the switch that all divents possible to dive the satisfying .
You can get the paralysis , and you &apos;re going to be .
Everyone needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too much , perhaps even for the fish , and it &apos;s just sure for us .
But the assumption of some symbolic symbolic for the inhappy and I &apos;m handing , for the roline .
Thank you very cuer .
