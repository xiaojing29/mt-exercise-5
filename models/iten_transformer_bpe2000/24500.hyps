The last year I showed these slide to show that the arthic calculations to show that the arthemselves of 48 percent of the U.S. The 48 United States , the 48 continental .
But it &apos;s a gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice of the ice .
The arthial calculation is , in a certain sense , the pulsant cuer of global climate system .
It expands of the winter and it rities .
The next slide is going to be a rapid rapid carrelated to the last 25 years .
The ice loss are signed in red .
As you see , they expand down to the blue wish .
That &apos;s the ice in winter , which is the glasses of summer .
You can see that the ice cosidenn &apos;s blood , five years or more , it &apos;s like the blood , which is like the blood , which is the blood .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been so .
This is a problem because the interested in the crap the third glacier ocean where there are enormous amount of carbon conger that , science , and they are transformed in metane from microbes .
It &apos;s a totality of the totality of the atmospheric inquantity , that amount could radical , surgery , super-house , super-house , super-house , super-house , super-ritorge of the totality of the totality of the totality of the totality of the atmospheric inquish of the totality of the atmospher
In some of the deep laghi deep in Alaska , the methane is already rebecting from the water .
The professoreard Katey Walter University of the University of the University of the winter team .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : The question is well . The question is if we &apos;re going to be .
A reason is that this term term scale the term of the northermal Greenland from the northermal .
This is a glacial figures .
The led didn &apos;t have reached free .
This is the Kangerly-figured , in the South West of Greenland .
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea level of the sea of the sea of the sea of the sea .
These corrings are increasing rapidly .
As the other part of the planet : Antarctars , the biggest block of the planet .
The month scientists have died have diclosed that the ice of the ice of the ice is in negative , and that the Eddesize of some isoles , which pogs on some issues , which pographic is particularly quick in the science .
Equizer , six feet of the acifive , like in Greenland .
Sull Himalaya , the third biggest block , you know , they &apos;re going to see the laghi , that a few years ago ,
40 percent of the world &apos;s population has been half of the powerful water from that month .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the powerful water of this city .
The led is increased .
But when it dimining , it &apos;s the same accept to the water water .
In California , the nnow is 40 percent of the Nevada is deminuites .
The hyrics are in the crisis .
The predictions , like you &apos;ve read , are graves .
The growing security in the world &apos;s door to a remarkable ring .
The environmental disaster are increasing to a rhythm out of the normal and without preceding .
Four numerous times more numerous in the last 30 years of precedents .
This is an unstanding of all of the insustainable .
If you look at the historical context , if you can see the consequences .
For the last five years we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of tons in the oceans every day .
And look at the area of the Pacific Pacific , from American , and on both the west parts of Indian , where there &apos;s a radical rewards of the oxygen in the oceans .
Most of the global warming , together to deforestation , with the deforestation , that &apos;s the use of fossil fuels .
The oil is a problem , and the charcoal is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with more emissions , together to China .
And he was proposed to build a lot of other central central .
But we &apos;re assisting a change .
These are annuled in the last few years and some of the world &apos;s high-verse projects .
At every way , there &apos;s a lotta politics in our country .
The charcoal industries and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the pality of the pitches , which is a host simult .
That picture I remember something --
Natal , Natal Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion pounds of paper scories of carbon .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen it about the news .
This is the second biggest of scories in America .
It happened to Natal .
The nature of one of the carbon industries of one of the carbon .
Video : My the charbon is a type of a food , and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it &apos;s going to grow our economy .
Maybe the more and more and more publy .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and work work , they keep the stipendent .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest society in the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his amministrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I &apos;m going to be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosis , Harry Reid -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking .
Al Gore : So the Protection of the Clima Protection of Clima has two campaign .
This is one of them , one of them .
Video : ALergy : All COALergy see the climate change as a serious minacks to our business .
So , this priority is to invest a lot of money in a lot of money in a bunch of the public foreign to make public and confuse the truth .
In fact , the charcoal is not sports .
We think it &apos;s clean -- it &apos;s a good profumo .
So you don &apos;t preoctor of the climate change .
Let me do .
Video : Attor : Carbone -- you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
So let &apos;s take a turn into a straight in a street to the bag as a balance .
Straditional . The machines are a little bit of the car of the technology of the car of the clean technology .
The carbon is between the main causes of the main the global warming , but the remarkable technology , but the remarkable technology that you see it all changes .
Do an an eaten : this is the hatch of the paper of the clean .
Al Gore : Inally , the positive alternative positive to the economic question and at that security of the national security .
Video : Minent is in the crisis ; the national economy , national crisis .
The philos that all of this : our dependence from fossil beautiful fossil carbon and oil .
Now , perodd , there &apos;s a new audacy solution for circles .
Really America : 100 percent of the power , in 10 years .
A plan to put America at work , make more safety , and helping to stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that I got to solve our problems .
It &apos;s more than America . You cover more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It &apos;s about reducing energy to America .
One of the fastest ways of dependence of dependence from the combustible that kills our planet .
Since : The future is here . Sink , sole , a new energy network .
She said , two : Noves investment for places of the burn job .
Commust , Really America . It &apos;s time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old proverbio proverwhelming , it &apos;s just like , &quot; If you want to go to .
If you want to go away , you go back . &quot;
We need to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
The year at TED I did a full of the LHC .
And I promise to get back to the way to get you about how the machine .
So here . And so , for those who were no , the LHC is the biggest experiment ever , the biggest scientifiever ever tented -- 27 kilometers of circles .
Her is to refer the conditions that were less than a billion second from the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
This is just environment .
This is the machine under Ginevening .
We &apos;re photography these mini-Bang dang in the resizers .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- it &apos;s 44 meters and has a behind a beeter diameter of 22 meters .
This is an expectacular images of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions .
10 section of the last year we have accested the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken from ATLAS .
It was because of the immense festeger in the room room .
It &apos;s an image of the first particle phask of the LHC , and it &apos;s fashion , and it &apos;s a part of the LHC , and I spreading particles in the resiberately .
In other words , when we see that image the 10 sectember , we realized that the machine worked , which is a great vitting .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to make us exultate more or this , when somebody went on Google and he saw that the beginning was this .
What means we &apos;ve had a cultural impact to be a cultural impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , I had to these films here -- these dores .
These files are 13,000 loves when the machine works at the machine works at the most power of the power of the power of power .
Now , the technical technical of you will look at the philos and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . I &apos;m pretty good . &quot;
And they can do that because when they &apos;re very cold became a lot of become the superconduct-conduct-conduct-conductor .
So , at less 271 degrees , to a temperature at that dollar space , these phils can bring that running .
In one of the youngest novemila in the LHC , there was a fabrication difect .
So the files survey , they &apos;re going to read , and 13,000 ampits suddenly inet a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressionate if you think that these magneties weight more than 20 tons .
They &apos;re damed about 50 magneties .
We had to take them , what we &apos;ve done .
We &apos;ve repristinted and traveled .
Now they &apos;re going back to all the substantial place .
By the end of the LHC is going to be new integro .
We &apos;ll accenate it , and we expect to get the right data or players , and continuing our adventure to find what the people are the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these incidents reaccess to the value of science and engineering of science and engineering . It &apos;s easy to be .
I think that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s so hard , I think it &apos;s the value of things like the LHC .
I want to conclude with the words of an Inglese scientist , Humphry Davy , which , imagine , imagine , in the indefense experiments of his pupillo , his pupillo , he said , &quot; Nothing is so dangerous for the progress of the human mind as the human mind as the science as the human mind that the ideas of science as the science of human mind that the ideas of science is the science of our tric tric tric tric .
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to think about when , children , as children , played up with the morning .
As you reach them and they &apos;re going to reach them , take them and they learn them , learning , learned , and they learned that and solve problems and re-solve problems .
The space is deeply connected to the way we understand part of the world around us .
So , from information , I started by the usual usuity of our interaction with physics , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to ask me , I started to ask me , &quot; And if we use a computer , I &apos;ve started asking me , &quot; And if we use a digital computer , we could have the only mouse as a digital pital , we could have the hands of the hands of the manior , we could have the hands ,
and systemate it to our placement ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable , a lot of a big computer interactive computer .
In a few words , a Siftable , a lot of a big computer interactive computer .
You can move them with hand , they can see , &quot; you can see &quot; between them , you feel their movement and a radio and a radio and a radio .
But surprising them are physical objects , like the morning , you can move them out .
The Siftable is an example of a new ecosystem of a new ecosystem to manipulate the digital information .
And as a physical , knowledge of the movement , of the other people , and as become more physical , of the other people , how we can explore new movement , of other people , how we can explore new and fun is more physical styles of interaction .
I started with some simple example .
This is Siftable is configured to show the video : if you incline it in a direction , the video will rotate out of the back back back .
These are interactive of other people .
If you go , you know , they &apos;re interested in .
If they come circle , they notice and they can act a little bit .
If they come circle , they notice and they can act a little bit .
They also advice their movement and inclination .
And then we realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power to use of the interaction of data , &quot; to be a liquid as if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable , like a century of the vernice and I can use them to be able to be able to be able to be able to be .
and I can use them to be able to be the color in the central , where they misk .
If we &apos;re too much , we can put a little bit at the time .
And you also have beautiful possibilities of learning , like the languages , math and games of logic and places where people can try things are trying to try things very quickly , and see the results of the results of myself .
Now , I &apos;m --
This is a sequence of Fibonaces that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a game of words that &apos;s half between Scarabeo and Boggle .
Pratically , you know , you get a letter to case on every Siftable , Pratically , Pratically , to every turn to every Siftable on every Siftable , and while he &apos;s controls the words of a dionary .
And then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new letter of letters and new possibilities to try to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s children came to the Media Lab , I did in a way that they tried them and turned a video .
They &apos;re very like it was very much .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people many education .
You &apos;ve got to say , &quot; Mpons of words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s other people who try it .
This is our younger tester , there &apos;s the more young .
He actually wanted to implement them .
They were only morning .
Now , this is an interactive application of an interactive cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of the languages of languages is Felix .
It can be able to be new characters in the scenes , solving the Siftable .
It can be able to be new characters in the scenes , solving the Siftable .
So , you know , he &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : The sun is surprising .
David Merrill : Now he took a treator in the scenes .
Video : The arange treater .
By job ! Yeah ! Yeah !
So school Siftable and put them close to be interact with the characters --
Video : Bau !
To inventing your story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a story with final opened , and he can decide him as it &apos;s flies .
DM : It &apos;s a story with final opened , and he can decide him as it &apos;s flies .
Video : Volice on , it &apos;s about it .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , realized of recent , to wait , to wait and exeguide .
it &apos;s a recently , to wait , to wait and exeguide music .
The Siftable is based sounds like base , based and the battery .
Every one of these has four different variations , and you can choose which to use .
You can also put these sounds in a sequence of a sequence of behavior .
And modificate it just doing a &quot; sequence . &quot;
These are actually actually controlled you can control from the vive , like the reverse and the filter .
The acks to a particularly , and then inclines to get it .
And then there are general effects as time and volume , that they applicate to the interests sequence .
We look at how it works .
Video : We &apos;re going to start putting a base in two Siftable . &quot; We &apos;re going to be able , we &apos;re going to take it , we add , and we add other base .
Now I put a basis of based .
Video : Now I add add of percussion --
Video : And now I &apos;ll put the filter to the battery , so I can control the effect of the vive .
Video : I can fly speaking the whole sequence of the whole sequence of time from one side or another .
Video : And now I &apos;ll add the bottom to be expression .
Video : I can reombing the sequence &quot; to the volo . &quot;
So I didn &apos;t have to planning it before , but I can try to be playing , it &apos;s more more cording .
And now , finally , I can sfly the whole sequence of the whole sequence of the Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new man &apos;s interfaces more and more like our brain and more .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the result of this lost , and also some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to transmit is that &apos;s coming to this new generation of projects to interact with digital media , that will take information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time I talk to all of you .
I &apos;m a written .
It &apos;s books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , obviously .
It &apos;s also the love and the phascine of my life .
And I don &apos;t expect that it can change .
But , said , this particular thing happened to my life and in my life and in my career , and in my career , who bring me to realibrating the whole thing .
The particularly thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called &quot; Mangia , Prega , Prega , Ama , &quot; which , diversly , for some reason using my books , for some reason it become a big , feels , for some reason ,
And the result is that everywhere goes now , people treated me as if they were condanned .
David : David : condanned , condanned !
They &apos;re going to be worried and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t fear to do you don &apos;t have more to do you know ,
You don &apos;t keep going to writing for all life without being able to create a book that can important to create a book that can important to somebody ? &quot;
What can you care ? &quot;
It &apos;s a rassurant , you know .
But it could go worse , part of that I remember more than 20 years ago , when I was to say to people -- I was a adolescent -- I was a written .
I met the same thing that is based by the pure .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you to have succeeed ?
You don &apos;t have fear that the humiliation of the refer ?
You don &apos;t have to do this all of life without any fear that anything ever has been out and die on a cumule of every infranker with the mouse of every infrankers with the fallimb ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
Yeah , I have fear of all those things .
I &apos;ve always had fear .
And I have a lot of other things that people can &apos;t inate .
As the floor and other things .
But , as much as it turns out to write what I thought and asked me , I was saying , because ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logic that anyone who have to expect to be spavented by a job that feeling under to do .
But what is so particularly in the imprising creative to make us nervous health is about mental health of mental health .
As my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don &apos;t remember one once 40 years of activity in which he was asked if he had fear engineer to be able to be ?
It was never -- that was that block of the engineer John , like it &apos;s it ?
It didn &apos;t work like that , you know ?
Onestly , chemical engineers have no certainly , in the centuries , in the reputation of being hallowed .
We have enough , we have enough this reputation , and not just writers , but creative of every gender , we have this reputation of being enormous instable .
And it &apos;s not going to look at the trists conteain of the magnifies of the magnifies of the magnifies , only in the last century , they died young people and often to hand .
And even the ones that are not suicidated to be really disfaced by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before we die , in the last interview said , &quot; Every book has killed a little bit more than &quot; one of extraordinary extraordinary affirmation about their life .
But we don &apos;t bad when we heard it because we &apos;ve heard these things so long that somehow we &apos;ve really interior interior and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering it , and the art , it &apos;s going to be in some ways of the art , at the end .
And the question I want to take all of today is : are you agree with this idea ?
It &apos;s OK , that &apos;s going to be that -- because it also looks like me , it &apos;s not good for nothing to be good for nothing .
I think it &apos;s odiosa .
And I think it &apos;s perpecuate and I don &apos;t want to see it it &apos;s perpetuate in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encouraging our great minds of beings .
And of course , I know , in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start figing out that I was host of suppose , surately to be supposed , surprising the circles where I &apos;m in my career .
That &apos;s what -- you look , I &apos;m rather young , I &apos;ve about 40 years .
I have still about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything wrong now in the world , and then it will be judded by the world as the job that was using the last book .
I &apos;m going to be slavery , because we &apos;re all about the largest friends here -- it &apos;s probable to my house .
Oh , Gesus , who think !
You know this is the kind of thinking that &apos;s a person to start to start bing a person to start bing in the nine morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I &apos;d keep doing this work that we do .
So , the question becomes , how do it ?
And so it seems to me , after many reflection , which is to be able to be the psychological construct , okay ?
I have to find a safe distance of safe between me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural natural anxy on what reaction is going to get to get it . And as I was trying to get to to see through time , trying to see through time , trying to find other society to see if they could have the ideas and more healthy and more more healthy and more healthy more and more healthy and more healthy and more feeling and more healthy and more more more more people and more healthy and more severthy of the
to helping people in creative people to reach the emotions of creative creative .
And that research has brought me to the Great and ancient Rome .
I &apos;m guitemes because I play in circle and then back .
In ancient Grex and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that the creativity was from men , OK ?
It was thinking that creativity was this spirit of becomes divine and become the men from some different surgery and known , for the distant reasons and unknown for reasons and health .
The grew called these spirites of the berites of the creativity &quot; demons .
Socry , wonderful , she created a demon the wisdom of wisdom .
The Romans were the same idea , but they called the same idea of spirit without a genius .
which is great , because Romans didn &apos;t really think a genius was someone particularly intelligent .
They believed that a genius was this kind of entity , which was this kind of thing that was created literally in the walls of a study , a little bit like Dobby , and that was like Dobby , and that came out to assisted to work with the artist and model the result of that job .
Here &apos;s an eye -- that &apos;s the distance of which is the distance of which is the distance of the psychological costrucks that protected you from your work .
And they all knew that was so it worked , right ?
So , the anticient artists were protected by certain things , like the too much narcism , right ?
If your job was exciting , you couldn &apos;t take all the market , everybody knew that you could have helped by this genius encourage .
If your job your job , it wasn &apos;t all over your , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be an incapable .
And so people have been fully concept the creativity in Occidest .
And then the Renascies came and all changed , and all changed , and we put this great idea ; we put the human beings and without the universe and not leaving in the mistery of the universe .
This was the principle of the rational humanism and people started thinking that creativity was completely from the hyd-share .
And for the first time in history , he started to refer to this or the first time , you know , like a pretty good genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big herror .
I think it allows somebody , a simple person to believe that a full of the source , the essence and the source of all mystery , creative , unknown and the kind of creative , unknown , and it &apos;s a lot of to be a lot of to give the basic phils .
It &apos;s like to ask somebody to indry the sun .
Deform and completely fully the ego and it &apos;s completely waitable on performance .
And I think it was this pression to destroy the artists in the past 500 years .
And , if that &apos;s true , and I think it &apos;s the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe to be back to a more ancient comprehension of the relationship between human and mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t sing 500 years of rational thinking about a rational psychrational thinking .
And there &apos;s people in the audience that would sold myself to have a scientific pecks of , income , you do that , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to be successful or of their projects .
I &apos;m not going to be convince you all about this .
But the question I &apos;d like to take is -- why don &apos;t it ?
Why don &apos;t it think about this way ?
Because it &apos;s more sense of all other thing that has ever heard to explain the exasperant exasperant exasperant of the process of creative process .
A process that , like anyone who ever ever have ever been excited to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- it doesn &apos;t even be rationally .
And , in fact , it can be completely paranormal .
I &apos;ve done this met recently with the extraordinary poetched , Ruth Stone , who now 90 years , but it was a poetry for all life and said that she during his childhood in the Virginia , worked out in the camps , and feel it , when a poem came from the landscape .
He said that he was like a train of the air train .
And that was coming up to the landscape from the landscape .
He heard it was to be , because he was tremendous under his feet .
He knew to have one thing to do at that point and it was to do that point and it was to run like a matters . &quot;
And so it was going to home and he was indeed by this poetry , and he wouldn &apos;t have to take a piece of card and a faster , and a faster , while he would account it and a faster it on the page .
Sometimes you can &apos;t be fast enough , so correct and correct and correct without able to get to the house and the poetry and the lost home and the lost and he would continued to rolate through the landscape , looking for , as he said , &quot; another poet . &quot;
And then there were times -- this is not going to be able -- there were some moments that was almost perdying , okay ?
So , he was trying to get home and he was trying to card and the poetry and the poetry to the past through , and he was walking a switch as he was going to go , and he said , that it was going to be house with the other hand and the offered .
He was going to be poetry from the tail and put it into his body and he said to the page .
And in these cases , poetry was presented on perfect page and intouched but the contrary , from the last first .
So when I heard it -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly exactly the same thing .
Not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conducture !
I &apos;m a move , and my way to work is ; I &apos;m woke ; I &apos;m woke up and work and go to the way and go to the way up and go on and go out and go out .
But even I , in my testardaggin , I &apos;ve strisciated against that thing , sometimes .
And I think a lot of you have the han done .
You know , even if the job and ideas were giving me from a certain source , I could not be switched .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to do it in a way we don &apos;t lose the head , but rather , rather , that do you get healthy ?
For as much as much as the best contemporary example I have is Musician musician musician musician , which I interviewed different years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life has been the incarnation of the murdered artist &apos;s forward , looking for controlled , to try to control , to try , these kind of totally interiorized impulsis .
But then he investided , he calculated , and one day as he was driving on a highway to Los Angeles , changed everything .
He was going to be fast and all of a sent tract of this little bag melody , that comes into his head like inspiration , elusive and hall-high , and the ver , and the various , and the desiderve , but it doesn &apos;t know how to take it .
It doesn &apos;t have a piece of card , it doesn &apos;t have a cut , it doesn &apos;t have a full record .
So he starts to feel this kind of old anxiety of anxioned , &quot; I &apos;m lose to lose , and I &apos;m obsessionate by this persacies .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t make it . &quot;
And instead of going to go in the panic , he stopped .
He started the mental whole mental process and did something completely new .
And he just watching the sky and said , &quot; Scause , I &apos;m not seeing that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; What seems to be write a song now ?
If you really want to exist , you get to a more than you can take me care of you .
Although , you go to important something else today .
You know , Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his process worked changed after this .
Not the job , it was still hosket as always .
But the process , and the anxiety that was redded when the genius , the genius , the genius out of him causes , and he was libered it back from the back to where he came to , and realizing it was realizing that he had to be an interior and realized that .
but it was a little bit of it , wonderful , wonderful collaboration a conversation between Tom and this external thing that it wasn &apos;t Tom .
So , how much you feel that story about changing a little bit even the way I worked , and he saving me once .
This idea , he saved when I was writing , &quot; Mangia , Prega , Ama , and fadds in one of those cave of the desperation where we &apos;re working on something and we &apos;re working on something and we &apos;re not going to think that it &apos;s a disaster , which is the worst book or never wrote .
Not just the book , right , just the worst book .
And I started thinking about the project .
But I was talking about Tom who talked to the air and try to try to the air and try .
So I went up to my face in the manoscritish and I &apos;ve got my comments to a huge corner of the room .
And I said , &quot; Sends , &quot; Sends , what we &apos;re going to both , you know that if this book is not going to be interested in my , right ?
Because as I see that I &apos;m going to put all what I have , I have no more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to show you and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t , you know , you know , you don &apos;t do it .
I &apos;m going to writing the same because it &apos;s my job .
And I want to do my havor and I &apos;ve presented that I today to do my part of &quot; because it &apos;s so , OK -- at the end of the North Africa , the North Africa , people were walking up to the North Africa , and they went to the wonder of the damage , damage and hours to the alba .
And they were always magnific , because the baleres were professionals and fantastic .
But every once , it was , something happened , and one of these artists had become actually transfer .
And I know you know what I talk , because I know you &apos;ve all likely , a performance that is a performance .
It was like the time , and the time , and the walking walk through a kind of portal and wasn &apos;t doing anything about different from the sun , like 1,000 notes , but it was all all of the time .
And suddenly , I don &apos;t just like a human .
But it happened from the didriver and under the illuminated in the divinity .
And when this happened , to the time , people knew what was , people knew it was called it .
They were were at the hands and started to dogn , &quot; Allah , God , Allah , God , God , God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curioses historical -- when Mom invasero the south of the Spain , I took this habits and pronounce changed in the centuries from Allah , Allah , &quot; to , &quot; Ole , &quot; Ole , &quot; Ole , &quot; the &quot; Ole , &quot; the &quot; Ole , &quot; the &quot; Ole , the world-cycle .
In Spain , when an artist has something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , the Elah , magnific , British , &quot; I , &quot; I realized , a God scorm -- a God scorm of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes down the day , the day , the same thing , when you woke up and discovered that are the 11 of Martedesesday and the scores of God and the scores of God , there &apos;s no longer .
It &apos;s just a lot of the mal with a lot of bad to the ginocy , and maybe never going to be able to be able to be able to get to the height .
And maybe no one name of God while he still has to do with his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the more sweet to make in a creative life .
But maybe not to be so angosciant if you can &apos;t believe , you know , you can &apos;t believe , anzyutt , which the most expected expected in your being come from you .
But created it just that they &apos;re just going to be a full of an inimaginable source of this squish of your life that you have to go to something else when you &apos;ve finish .
And , you know , if we think about this everything changes .
And so I started thinking , and it &apos;s certainly like I thought it for different months in the book at the work of the book that I &apos;m going to take a lot , dangerous , dangerous , so that , I &apos;m going to be following my great great successful .
And what I &apos;ve continued to tell me when I feel electrized from this is , not going to be fear .
Don &apos;t traveling . It &apos;s your job .
It &apos;s going to presented you to presented in your part , whatever it can be .
If your job is balling , bought .
If the wine , I asurdo genius assigned to leave some kind of wonderful kind of wonderful , for just moment through your efforts , then , &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Although , you &apos;re the same dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot;
I think it &apos;s going to teach it .
&quot; You know , &quot; at you , even for you had the human and test later tals and tals tals tals that are continually .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Wow !
And as you know , I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects on the human genome , on what can meant and discovery of new genes of genes .
Now we &apos;re starting a new perspective . We started digitalizing biology and now to go from that digital code we &apos;re both in a new biology , designing and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing .
We &apos;ve always tried to take big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot;
We tried different approaches , reducing it to be minimes .
We &apos;re digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the analogic world of the digital world .
Now , we can regenerate life , or new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smaller genome of the smaller genome of the smaller .
And we tried to reduce the ulterior genome to create one more smaller .
We &apos;re able to eliminate a hundred of genes about 500 that are here .
But when we have a look at his metabolic maps , it &apos;s relatively simple than our .
Credemies , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this can take to a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to design was synthesize this cromosome in a way that we could modify the components to take some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of the &quot; Pan , can we synthesize a cromosome ? &quot;
Can chemistry to produce these big molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create the hour ?
And , in case , can we make a job a cromosome ?
A chromosome is just a chemical material chemical material .
The speed that we are able to deal with life is growing up to exponential rights .
We have the genetic code , rather , invaded , rather , rather llowly , but it &apos;s improving .
And our most recent retaining the latest tached .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process has been required many past , starting with a bioetical review revision , before the first experiments .
But we &apos;ve discovered that DNA is very difficult .
There are decauses of thousands of machines in the world that producing little little sections of DNA , the long time , the letters of 30 to 50 letters and it &apos;s a very long time , the segment is long , more errors there .
So we had to develop a new method to be assembling these fragments and correct herrors .
And that was our first tenty , to start to go from the digital information of the genome of Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
We &apos;ve designed the fragments , actually , the correction of the mistakes and you a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this chemical material chemical material chemical material and we &apos;ve inert it in the bacteria , batteres started to read this genetic and producing the particles .
The viral particles are then you stay from cells , they &apos;re going back and destroyed the Eles .
I &apos;ve talked about recently with members of the oil industry , and they &apos;ve been told that they have certainly understood this model .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build his same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the biggest things in big .
We wanted to build the battery of the bacterium of the bacterium .
They &apos;re more than 580 myths of genetic code .
So we &apos;ve thought we build it in the size of the virus of the virus of the virus , so that we can change the casses of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accurator was a mile for every 10 mile based .
We &apos;ve discovered , 30 errors . If we had that original sequence . If we had that original sequence , we &apos;d never be able to do it .
One part of the process is to design segment of 50 letters that they are overletters of 50 letters to build smaller subounds of the smaller subound-to-to-to-to-letters .
We &apos;re going to see a unique elements here .
You probably have read that we &apos;re going to take a little bit of the grain .
So , I think that we have a genetic code based on four letter : A , Gee and T.
Three of those letters together about 20 letters of the letters , and there &apos;s a specific order of letters .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frasured .
What we &apos;ve done in the beginning was autograps .
Some of the fact that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
We &apos;ve designed these segments to simply held them just unit with enzymes .
There are enzymes that they reped them and put them up .
And we started to assembling parts , starting with seats from five to seven letters , unclean them in a way to form segments of 24 multis a letter to get to 7,000 letter to get to 7,000 myself .
We have produced these segments in abondance so that we could segment them to sequency them that we &apos;re trying to create a very robust .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems to be a basket of a basket .
When we get to these very long segment seats , more than 100 midle based , more than 100 midle based in E.
It comes to the limit of the modern modern tools .
So we &apos;ve advanced other mecchanisms .
We had another mechanism called a recognizes , which in biology is a lot of time , that in biology is to repitch the DNA can can take the segments .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiod-diod-radiod-care .
You can see in the superior as a cromosome as its cromosses .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s first .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be completely .
They can live under a vacuum .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life in space , and you can find new environments of water .
ASA , NASA showed that this is .
This is an image of the molecule that we &apos;ve built this processed , just using the free with the appropriate design of the appropriate segment .
The hythrows that automatically .
This image was not taken with an electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a lot of the task that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that they cover a second period of six seconds .
This is the published we &apos;ve done a little bit ago .
They &apos;re more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the biggest molecule of a definitely definitely created by man .
It has a lot of the soon on 300 million .
If we printed it with a 10 without spaces , it would take 142 page just to turn this genetic code .
Now , how do we do it work ?
Obviously , you can see a virus is a game from kids .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria .
It &apos;s simplest when it &apos;s cells as well cells as well as our : you can just extract it &apos;s nucleo and you can just extract the nucleo and you can just extract the process of clonely clonely the process of it .
In the hereas the cromosome is integrated by one , but we &apos;ve recently demonstrated that we &apos;re able to do a complete transplant of a cell trapition of a cromosome from one one cells from one one cells and activating it .
We &apos;ve got a phone of the microbial cromosome .
The two are different as men from the men .
We &apos;ve added some gene in a way that we could decide to decide that chromosome .
And then it &apos;s science with the enzymes in a way to kill all protein .
And when we put it in the cells was study -- and you &apos;ll be a study of the software , the new cromosome croms -- the new cromosome .
And we were actually thinking that we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to spush more in there .
This is one of the most evolution of evolution .
We &apos;ve discovered that many species have added a second or third cromosome from some part , from some part , address in a second thousands of new , the species .
So who &apos;s thinking about evolution as a just gene at the time that modified doesn &apos;t understand a lot of biology .
There &apos;s scientists called &quot; the restrial scientist of restrial restrial that addition digerish DNA .
The croms that was in the cells didn &apos;t have one .
The cellula-cromosome cellula-cromosome cellula-cromossoms .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other croms like extraneous material , and he got it , and we found it with only the cells and the new croms and the new croms .
it became blue because of the genes we &apos;ve inserious .
And in a short lelass of time , all the characteristics of a species have lost , and it turned into a new species , based on the new software that we put in the cells .
All the protein are changed , membrane , membrane is changed , and when we read the genetic code of exactly what we &apos;ve turned out .
Now , this may seem genetic alchemy , but altering DNA software we can change things in a way .
Now , I &apos;ve got explained that here is not talking about this genesius -- but to be able to be able to be able to create a new version of evolution , and I &apos;ve already said that maybe we &apos;re going to create new species of the explosion .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s enough obvious when we think about our need .
We &apos;re going to go from six and a half billion people to have to 9 billion in the next 40 years .
Right to give you an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one in 1946 , in 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re going to find fresh problems , fresh water and pulital , medicinal and wealthy for six and a half of people .
It &apos;s going to be more to do it for nine billion .
We &apos;re going to get more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion barrasses of the oil .
That means millions of barils a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replaced them , it will be a huge challenge .
And in the most of the same thing of CO2 emission of these materials that ends up in the atmosphere .
And the day of today , because of the scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million of genes , and I like to think they are the design design for the future .
The electronic industry only has a dozen about components , and think about how many different things come out .
Our limitation is principlally from the biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , thank you very quickly , we can create what we call the combinatory genomics .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can produce a billion croms a day .
Think about this 20 million of different genes or try to get to optimize the processes to produce the processes to produce opens , we can change , through a little team , and we can change , because of a little bit of molecular biology , and create more more biology than the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard standard .
We can choose for survival , chemistry or carburn , or carburant , production of vaccines .
This is an anea of some of software program that we &apos;re working for being able to sit and design species to the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know that , we don &apos;t need to be .
We know exactly what they &apos;re doing is their genetic code .
Now we &apos;re focus on the carbons of how much generation .
You &apos;ve also seen you extract from the grain was a finished experiment .
We have second and third generation that will be using enough of the high high high value as the open or different types of butanalish .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increasing a big impact of food and limitate the cost of food and limitate the CO2 in the machine , which we &apos;re working to design cells that can be transforming this , and we &apos;re going to design this , and we can think of the purpose of quarter generation in about 18 months .
The solar solar combined with CO2 is a methodom -- but in our discoveries in the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism that we &apos;ve descried in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , about 2500 feet of deep-foot ocean temperature of the water temperature of the water .
It &apos;s using the CO2 using hydrogen by the CO2 by the way .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can incanalate the CO2 , that can be transported through the tasks , converting that CO2 in carburn , to drive this process .
So we think we could be able to depend with what we could increase to increase what the basis of life , &quot; Why is &quot; life , &quot; Noes , we have the obid of the oil industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can you do ?
It would be a main of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working to use the same methods to create vaccines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with influence , we &apos;re always back to a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s about it &apos;s the right vaccine .
I think it can change by building vaccines in anticipate .
So , this is the future could start to be changing , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria , and finally , I was , you know , you know , honey , and finally cells .
We &apos;re so much like that from improving people .
Our purpose is to be able to try to try to try to try to try to try . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;ll show you , the most quickly possible , some fundamental job , new technology that we took to Microsoft in the followed to a quiet of exactly one year ago .
It &apos;s a environment where you can interact is local level of a local level of visual data .
Here we &apos;re seeing many of these things that we &apos;re going to see this digital photos with a kind of costant and continuous , for a bread , dispond , desponing the images as we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these data or images .
Most of the digital photographs , but this is a scanning scanning from the Biblioteca standing of the Congress , and it reentrepreneurs .
It doesn &apos;t do any difference because the only thing that &apos;s the only thing that &apos;s the number of a system like this is the number of full in your screen in any time . It &apos;s a very flexel .
This is a whole book , you know , not about the data .
This is Dickens . Every hard colonnaked . Every hard . Every hard .
To show you that it &apos;s all about the text and not images , we can do something like this , to see it &apos;s a real thing about the text of the head , not a picture .
It could be a little bit artificial way to read a electronic book .
It doesn &apos;t look at the judge .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s a lot of the Guardian .
Every big imagine is the beginning of a setion .
And it really gives you the please and beauty experience of a daily read of a daily reverse or a daily daily , which is to nature a lot of medium .
We &apos;ve also done something with the corner of this particular number of the Guardian .
We &apos;ve created a higher advertising -- much higher than that you use in a normal normal publishment -- and we &apos;ve inserious about extra extra extra .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific specific specific specific .
And that really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the limitations of space .
We hope that means to put the people in the pop-up and other door , and other door door , they should not be necessary .
Of course , mapping is one of the most obviously obviously for this kind of technology .
And I don &apos;t want to lose time , if we don &apos;t say that we have contributed to date in this field .
These are all the street in the U.S. . Sovrappose of NASA .
So now we &apos;re going to go to to something else .
This is actually the reason on on the web ; you can see it .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seady , and the other is a very interesting research by Noah Seady , a student of the University of Washington , with the help Steve Seitz of UW and Rick Seitz of Microsoft Research . It &apos;s a very hard collaboration . It &apos;s a very hard .
And it &apos;s from the Web , I was a lot of Seady ,
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can spend a picture of the other and have this kind of experience to the other and have this kind of experience .
But the space collocation of images here has a meaning .
The computer &apos;s visualization of the computer have recorded these imaging imaging together , so that they corresponding to the real place where the imaging imaging the real neighbors in which the imaging -- all the neighbors of the Roccious Montanagne Roccious , you &apos;re scacked . And then you see the elements of a slikely , and these things are all the space space . So this is all the space .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some much more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data set of Noahahhahohhosynth , that &apos;s a prototype of Photosynth , we &apos;ve done to work for the first time , the first time , the summer exactly the key , I think it &apos;s really the key behind this technology , Photosynth . And it &apos;s necessarily hynth .
We had to worry about the legal expects and so on .
This is a rebuild-up of Nothththers , Doththers , it &apos;s a rebuild of message . Bauckr , and you get images of types and so on . You get images of types and so on . Every one of these arancies , and so on . Every one of these arancies a picture that &apos;s discovered .
So I &apos;m all images from Flickr and they &apos;ve been all blown up to this way .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this way simplicism .
You know , I &apos;d never thought to end up for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratify to get this kind of access here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of a different types of types of focus to the phone of the cellphone to the phone of the phone to the professional .
And if I can , try to try to look at those more strange .
Many are blocked out , etc .
Somewhere you find a photographs of photographs -- etches .
This is a Nothththers of Dethrecorded .
We can go from the poster to the vision of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is taking data from the whole hot of how to applied the Earth , from the vision point of view -- and it &apos;s standing all those data together .
All of those pictures become connected , most of the parts of the parts .
You have a world of the whole whole land that emerge .
Think about this as the proldest of the work of Stephen Lawler &apos;s worth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as well as people use it , and the vantages that are using it .
Their pictures are married with other people .
If somebody comes to contrast all these saying the name , my picture of the name , my picture of Nothtries of Nothtries to be clearly clear of all that data , and I can use point of inground , and I can use the picture of the space , in that meathairly , using the photos of anyone , and I have a lot of moil .
Of course , a consequence of all of that are extremely elaborate of every interesting part of every interesting part of the Earth , and that are not just vists and satellitary images and satellitary images and satellitary images and satellitary images and satellites .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What your software is going to contain us to do is that it &apos;s going to be going to do is that in the next years , all the photographs shared by anyone in the world will be practically connected together ?
BA : Yeah . What &apos;s doing in practical is to find .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the bottom of the images .
What becomes very interesting is if you think about the wealth of the sea of sea that many of these images .
And as when you do a research of images on the web , you know , a phrase and the head about the web page has a lot of information about the picture .
Now , what happens if that picture is all your picture ?
So , the amount of simantly interconnections and the amount of wealth that &apos;s really huge . It &apos;s a huge effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really amazing .
BA : Thank you very much .
One of the main pleases when you travel and one of the research of the research of the research of the research , the past of the traditions , between those who have the past in the wind , the past in the wind , the drive in the wind of the rain , the flows , the drive in the wind leaes , the daes in the wind flows .
Bastes thinking that the Jaguar , still beyond the Via Lattea , or myths , or myths , or myths , or that in Himalaya , or that in Himalaya , the buddd-connection of Dharm , to remember the central important , and that the idea that the world we live in the world we live in the world that we live in the world we live in sense , but it &apos;s just a model ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stirs has done , well or mad , well , or a lot of generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential of the things .
We all all nose . We all procreating .
We &apos;re subjects in beginning .
We have to death the inesorability of the morte , so it doesn &apos;t surprising us if we &apos;re standing and --
We all have a art .
What it &apos;s the particularly is the particular rate of canone , the ritm of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that they are the thinking of the Borneo or the Dedoo of the Voodoo of Haiti , or the Sahardly Kaisut , or the Kenya , or a Kenya , or a melting camels in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my journey in the desert a month ago , or a month ago , or a hallevator of yak in the values of the world .
All of these people teaching us are other ways of thinking , there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of move in the world .
And , if you reflect a second , it &apos;s a concept that it can give you hope .
Insive , the cultures of the world creating a spiritual of spiritual life and cultural life that it &apos;s important for the planet and it &apos;s important for the planet as a biosphere as a biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural girl as an ethnosphere and you can define the thnosphere , the total nosphere of all the concepts , under ideas , inspirations , inspirations , from the stuff of the consciousness of the consciousness .
Ethnosphere is the great patric .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how species inquisitive .
And because the biosphere was favored by ethnosphere is successful at eethnosphere and much more quickly .
Nobody biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species is about extinction , or the extinction , just because it &apos;s falalitting in the highest ipothesis in the most of the biological diversity -- and you don &apos;t even even get close of the hypothesis -- that the most optimistic diversity .
The injury of all that is , of course , the lost linguistic loss .
When you were born there 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not only composed by a vocabolary or a series of grammmmmmmmmmmmmuts .
One language is the Spraising of human spirit .
It &apos;s the medium of every culture of every culture is going to be in the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a bind , a thinking , an ecosystem of spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re sitting in Monterey , at least the half of the kids .
They don &apos;t come more teaching kids , which means , not not wonder that you don &apos;t walk something , which are already died .
What is more trists of being flowed from the silence , the last to talk a language , the last to talk , not to transmit , not have a way to transmit wisdom of the children ?
This is horing is the state of somebody in some part of the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks .
And I know somebody who will say , &quot; Isn &apos;t it better ?
The world wouldn &apos;t be a better place if we &apos;re going to partil the same language ? &quot; Benish , then we &apos;re all going to be a cantonese .
We talk to the kogi .
You &apos;ll be a tract of a tract thing like to say , not to talk about your language .
I &apos;d like to do you have a journey through the ethnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a massive journey of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , &quot; different ways of existing , &quot; I really mean different ways of existing .
We take for example , this Barasana Barasana &apos;s bird , the population of anaconda , the population of anaxana , which creates the myths of the lats of the lats of the lats of the lats of the waste in the lats of the lats of the saces of the watching sacred .
It &apos;s a population that &apos;s not able to distinguish the blue color blue from the verse because the celests is identified in the forest , which depends the population .
They have a strange language and a maximimimprovement , &quot; Languion , &quot; Look , &quot; you have to move a person that park language .
All this has radical past , though the particularly , the particularity is that in these families that are talking about six or seven or seven or languages no practices .
They &apos;re limited to hear and then they start talking .
We take one of the more interesting tribe with which I &apos;ve lived , the Waorans of Eastern Eastern Eastern East Eastern Eastern Can , which has the first contact in 1958 .
In 1957 five means have touch a touch of fact , they &apos;ve been made a factor .
They &apos;ve done from the photographs that they were retrading them in poses that they had had had had had never seen that this population of the forest pluvial forest .
They &apos;ve been holding the ground , they turned them to research a form or a figure , or a full , they have concluses that they were taken that they were the diables , and they killed the five missionaries .
But Waorans don &apos;t just kill the stranies .
They kill they kill .
Four percent of mortality was caused by them .
We &apos;re sitting at eight generations and we found two cases of natural morts and when we &apos;ve insisted to know , they admit to know , they &apos;ve got to be an amazing eckilled , and then they killed it . And then they killed it the same . They had a incredible knowledge of forest .
The hunters were able to recognize the urine urine animal from 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned a very interesting compiece when my professor of Harvard &apos;s professor asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti in Haiti secret of Duver and Tonton Macineoutes , and imposed to be the fast of the fast of the fast power to do the bag that for the fast of the speed of the fast arbes .
To give a sense to the miracular , I should have to understand the Vodoun culture Vooo and that Vooo is not magic .
It &apos;s pretty much a measured of a measuphysics of the world .
Very interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that Africa &apos;s sub-Saharan Africa has no religious feelings . And he investigation is not the other distilled of these very profound religious concepts of these very deep religious religious religious .
What makes interesting is the vooo is the intense relationship between life and death .
So , you know , you &apos;re going to get the spirites .
The spirites can be invoded by the Great Acquired , they respond to the dance of the dance of the dance of the vive in a way that for a short of the vive in a short way that for a short deal .
So , the voodooists love to say , &quot; You can go to the wonderful God .
We &apos;re going to give in the temple and become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re sitting , is the spirit that drives you , as you can do you do the bad ?
So you &apos;ve got these incredible events : followed voodoo in the state of the tranks that touches touches infuocated a demonstration of the power of mind on the body &apos;s mind when it &apos;s catalyses in a state of extremendous extremely exciting .
I was all the people with which I lived the most extraordinary people who lived the most extraordinary of the Sierra Nevada Santa Marta , in Colombia .
It &apos;s ancivilization that was lived in the carairs of the carairs of the cools of the conquist , the population , the population was willing to the massictures that &apos;s herge on the massicrock .
In a drug continent of blood , this population never been conquered by the spagners .
And I &apos;m government today are government by a cler , but they &apos;re actually extraordinary .
The young people are taking away from the families to three or four years , and they live secret in a world of good bombs and bombs in a world of the ice for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years , to proposed to reproduce the nine months of gestation that transments transmator , now they &apos;re metaphor , now they &apos;re metaphor in the Great Mther .
So , this time , they are acculated to the values of their society , values that predicting their preger and only their prayers and they &apos;re just going to be the cosmic balance -- or to say , or to say , the ecological equilibrio .
Al the term of this incredible initiation , they &apos;re suddenly taking out and the first time , 18 years , they see a high of the first bad of the bad of the first bad , when the sole the bad writing , when the sun buts the bad of the beauty of the beautiful late . The pret past a wonderful way and says , &quot; The pret behind a behind and says , &quot; behind a behind the wateres of the behind the values of the beautiful butes of the butes of the value .
&quot; I &apos;m going to be ? I &apos;m going to tell you .
It &apos;s study . Now it &apos;s about you protect it . &quot;
They call it more more players and say that we , brothers , we are the destruction of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think of the Indigene and the environment , we invoke Reu and the old history of the vage of the vage of the vage of the old old old Thoreau and we say that these are more close to the Earth of us .
The Indigenes are not not unsentimental feeling from the nostales .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the peak of the Aphat or in the vinents of the Tibet , but because of time and the time and rites , they created a mystic mystic of the Earth is not about the concept of the world that the Earth can only be consciousness , but on a lot of the Earth can only because it &apos;s influence is infused from the human consciousness .
What does it mean ?
It &apos;s a little bit of a guy of Ande who grows in the Ande who grows in the mountain is a spirit of the Apu that will be a deeply different human . And it will be a deeply different and it will have a different mountain or that a mountain or that a mountain a Montana who grow mountain .
which is the demonstration of a spirit or a mineral huge is irrift .
What &apos;s interesting is the measured is the metaphor that defines between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Columbia creating that the forests serve forests to be cut .
And that I realized being different from my friends from my friends Kwakiutl &apos;s dimour friends that are the Hukuk &apos;s dimour of the paradish of the paradises of the world , spirits that have in the northern the norths of the world , the Hamatey &apos;s beginning .
If you start to consider that these cultures can actually actually be different , you can start to understand some of them , you can start to understand some of them discoveries .
I &apos;ve taken this picture to open in the North Amazon .
Mayahubbed about the ayahubask , the most powerful sushubasic of the repertoire .
What makes the fascinating the ayahubasn &apos;t the potential drug of the pharmacological potential of it . It &apos;s two elements .
From a side , this lian lady of a lian ighborhood of a series of history of history , and sleeping , sleeping , and sleeping ,
Take the only plants is a plant phumo that hold a little bit the consciousness , but it &apos;s mysceled with the flows of a house of the family of the caffas Psychoia .
This plants powerful , very similar , very similar to the serotonin the serotonin , dimethoxyltryltryltryltryltryltrine-field .
If you ever see the Yanomami to the nose the types that are doing from a different species , anched , it contain in half a a lot of species , it contains in the middle of species .
Tiring that pollution is a little bit like being disappeared by a while distores of a distores of the bear wind and literally on a ming of electricity .
I was often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who had scraped the psychedelic .
Second my ten tese can &apos;t classified these triptaminogens like hallucinogens because if you &apos;re doing you &apos;re doing , you can &apos;t tell anybody to be slowed . It can &apos;t be absolutely not be suned because they &apos;re money for a enzyme that &apos;s money in a enzyme , deters , deal with the intestine , deters , dead worthoxygen .
It &apos;s possible to be absolutely only if you make other chemicals that denaturing the MAO .
Now , the beauty : the beauty of the beautiful , are the same plant , are the same kind of MO , the same kind of necessary to be able to powering triptames . The question is spontaneous , in a flow of 80,000 species of plants , like these are two morphological morphologically , and they don &apos;t make these things like , they make a biochemical version that &apos;s high high perior of parts ?
We use the great euphemism of provide and the error , that can reveal infrured .
But if we ask Indians , they &apos;ll say , &quot; plants talk about . &quot;
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuask , who distinguished in the forest , and that our eyes would be in the same species .
If we ask them how they &apos;re going to say , &quot; I thought , &quot; I thought , &quot; I thought I was going to tell us , &quot; I didn &apos;t know ? &quot;
The solution is : it &apos;s taking the 17 variety in a notice of the full and each one will care with a different tone .
With this is not laurea to Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting that contact the prints .
Now , &#91; I applauses the problem is that the people of us who have to be painted people who have to be pointed , but somehow reducing people in the history of history of the history of the history of the history of the history of the history of the history of the history of the history of the history of the history of the history of the history of the history of the history of the history of the real world &apos;s history of our .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it will not be reminded for his wars or technology , but rather like the age we stopped and we stopped and we stopped actively actively or masses accepted or masses of the planet . Now the problem is not changing the mass of biological diversity and cultural of the planet . Now the problem is not changes .
All of the cultures have been involved in a dance for new possibilities .
And the problem isn &apos;t technology .
The Indians don &apos;t have to stand to be Six when they put it up up in the arc and they were so as well as the Americans have no stopped to be Americans when they put from horse and horse .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that threatentegrity of ethnosphere .
The wall of the domination of the domination .
And if you look at the world , you &apos;ll discover that these are not destinate cultures are not destinate cultures .
They &apos;re living in creatures and dynamics out of the history of history that go out of history .
It &apos;s a little bit of the thinking of the thinking of the thinking of the thinking of the thinking --
a population of Sarawak , in the Sarawak , a population , a population that has lived free in the forest to a generation , and now reduced to a generation and the next reduck in the reduces , where you can see the physics of the phylenes that seems to be able to be able to be able .
you have to replaces the stids with the wood wood .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that are the discovery of the discovery of the gold .
If we move on Tibet mountains of the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the right right right right now .
As you know the genocide , physical extinction of a population , is condanted to the universal level of life , but the reduction of life , not only is condannate , but it &apos;s even about it , it &apos;s not just condanted , but it &apos;s not just conducting in the developing part of the development .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of the Tibet until the beginning .
I &apos;ve lost the 6,000 miles from Chengdesis in the Western China in Western China , coming to Lhasa with a young colleagues , but only came to Lhasa , I realized what &apos;s behind the statistics of we hear .
6,000 feeding sacred sacred and cens .
1.2 million people killed from military the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was absolutely to the Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed to the Chinese invasion .
Her is uncle with Santity in Santity in Santity in the Nepal .
Her mother was imprisoned and his colpa was to be rich .
It was brought to the high of two years , hidden the age of two years , under his ground because he wouldn &apos;t have living without .
The sister , who has done the same , it was put in in the field of reducation .
And one day , he has inaved a fascinating fascinating Mao and , for this transgression , was put in the forced work for seven years .
The TIbet can be insatic , but the redesified of the population is from the taken .
And then it turns to a choice .
We want to live in the world world world &apos;s mocromatically or want to account the policromatical world of the policycle world ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before we die said that his bigger &apos;s bigger that , in our going to this vision of the world , we &apos;ll just see the whole ama of human imagination is human imagination is a limited limitation , but one day we wake us to a deal with a landscape , but a day we &apos;ll wake us to be able .
And it &apos;s an uilant to remember that our species is existed for 60,000 years .
The Rivolution , Neolitics , who has given us the agriculture , which has done us to be remarkable to the cult of the sees of the sciaman , and by the neighborhood with the next cler , and we &apos;re talking about 10,000 years ago .
The industrialized world industrialized has about 300 years .
And that is a story not suggest that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to deal with the millennia to come .
When these things about the world &apos;s cultures are asked what it means to be human , they say , &quot; human , they say with 10,000 voes .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all rediscover the possibility of being what we are : a species that we &apos;re like , a species that have to be what we &apos;re all the people and all the people and all the people can fiord . And there &apos;s great moments .
I &apos;ve taken this picture on the northern extremity of the island of Baffin , when I went to the hundred of bales with Inuit , and this guy , and this man , and this man , and he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The government has not always been totally tyle with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to stabilier our own prematia , we have to reduced them in colonies .
The non-man of this man was refused to go .
The family , though for his life , he brought away all the arms , and all his attracted .
You have to know that Inuit doesn &apos;t feel the cold , they don &apos;t feel it .
The slites were actually actually actually flip of the basic paces were flied in the bag .
The non-man of this guy is not being med by the arctimic notice or the blizard that was suffering .
It &apos;s became away , he &apos;s calculated the bag of the babs of the bag . When I did the full they were conged , it works , they work creating a mothers .
He was spruted in the room of this clean crow caves and when it became solid , he killed a dog .
He schools and created a bria bria bria , with the hactical casses , he has a sliter , he has imbried a slate , and it &apos;s disappeared on the banchisa , and it &apos;s squeeeeeer .
We want to talk about cavar with nothing ? &#91; Raising &#93; . And this , in different ways , in different ways , Applauss , it &apos;s the symbol of the Inuit and the world &apos;s indicated and all of the world .
In 1999 , the 1999 , the government has redded to the Inuit &apos;s a largest of a territory of California and the Texmen together .
It &apos;s their new patries . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a territory territory . They contructing all the mineries of mineraries .
One splendido of how a national national state can recognize with his population .
And , finally , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious obvious , at least people who was in these wilds of the planet , makes it not remote .
For somebody &apos;s house .
They have been presented by the human imagination that are rising at the time . And for us all of these kids , like every dreams of these kids , like every dreams of our children , become part of our children , become part of hope .
For finally , we are National Geographic , we are convints that politicians will never be about anything .
We believe that polemy --
&#91; Applauses are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the best institution to tell stories about the world . Every month to tell stories about the world . Every month , our site is 35 million lights .
156 countries our phone , we transmit to our phone .
our revists are slights from millions of people .
Our work is traveling in the ethnosphere to bring our audience in the wonderful places that they &apos;ll be able to be sitting away from how they saw and hopes , they &apos;ll be hoped and hopes , they &apos;ll be a fast further in the diversity , and we need to find a lifestyle in a world , and we need to find a lifestate in a world of the diversity , and multicultural world to a lifestate and multiculticulticulticultural reveals in a world of the world of the diverse and men and multicultical revealts
where the wisdom of all the people can contribubuting our homes .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things I wrote about this book , I &apos;m going to talk about other people who have heard and I &apos;m going to evidence some of the connections , in case , in case , not note them .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the dogm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
The dogm of what ?
The official dogm of all of the Western industrial society . The dogma official dogm , &quot; If we want to male the benefit of our citizen &quot; &quot; The way to be the individual liberations . &quot;
The reason is , from a side , in fact that freedom is the same value , is precious , is precious , for the essential , for humans .
As the other is in fact that if we &apos;re free , each of us can act to do all that what masses our well-being , without no one that decided in name .
The way to male the freedom is to male the choice .
More people are , more people are free , more , and most of them , and most of them is their well-being .
This is , ritengo , it &apos;s so deeply radically roped in the society that nobody would be able to put it in the doubt .
And it &apos;s also deeply radical in our lives .
I &apos;ll show you some examples of what progress has possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I just lost a simple note on condents .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without contact the 10 variety of oil oil .
Here &apos;s the supermarket .
And then you go to the electronic negotide a stereo : case , the leter , CD , radio , radio , radio , radio , plastra ,
And in this single negotide , there &apos;s a big number of audio .
We can realize six and a half million different combinations using the components that there are only one negotiations .
You have to admit that there &apos;s a lot of choice .
Other fither of the communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all the phone of the phone of the phone of the phone &apos;s mama Bell .
It was born the phone , it didn &apos;t bought it .
One of that , in the way , in the other , was that the phone was never never .
These times they went .
We &apos;ve now have a variety of phone , almost the phone , especially between the cellphone .
Here &apos;s the future of the future .
My favorite is the middle , MP3 , tapels of the nose , and blood forts for the ground .
If you don &apos;t have seen in the house negotiate under the house , you &apos;re certainly looking at .
And what happens is that people get into the gozes in the gozes and does this question . And you know what is the answer ? The answer is &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cellphone that doesn &apos;t do too much things .
So , in other expected of life that are much more important than the acquired of the same explosion of choices .
She health health of health : you &apos;re going to be in the United States , you have the doctor and doctor you say what to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do , or B , &quot; Do &quot; &quot; A has these benefits and these risks . What do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Dr. &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A has these benefits and these benefits , and these benefits and these risks . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebed , &quot; Doctor she was me , what would it do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result of the result of the malseem , &quot; expression that it seems to be a beautiful thing .
But in fact , it &apos;s not a lot of the weight and responsibility to make decisions from somebody who knows something , which is the doctor , whatever it is not -- and so it &apos;s not the same -- and so it doesn &apos;t know -- and so it doesn &apos;t know --
There &apos;s a huge marketing products of drugs , directly to people like me and you , that if you think about it doesn &apos;t have any sense , because we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why do they published them ?
The answer is that they want that we call the doctor to ask to ask it .
Something like this is the hythesis is our hythesis is a question of choice , like you see in this jet . &quot; We &apos;ll however history . They &apos;ll cut their seven at at the moment . &quot; We don &apos;t want to be more identity : We need to invent .
And we can reinvent us how many times us .
which means that every morning , to the risk , to be able to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I &apos;m putting your family and the matriage , a time time the common , a lot of the perspective , almost anyone , it was that he started to be able , and he started to make the most possible .
The only real choice was with people , not even when , not even when , not even even , and not even though ,
It &apos;s really really to play .
I teen to a very smart students , and I do their 20 percent in less than a time .
And not because they &apos;re not not not sbrilliant , because they &apos;re not less diligent .
Why are I &apos;m impensierites , I mean , &quot; I should I say , &quot; I should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; I should think about the more tard-? &quot;
They &apos;re logorant interrupt .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this implement is not completely the compitor or I don &apos;t get a beautiful voice to my exame .
And they have to do it . I &apos;m important to ask .
Now , the job : We &apos;re lucky , like Carl subtineful , because technology allows us to work every day , every day , from Hotel Randolph .
By parentesesis , there &apos;s a angle , and I &apos;m not going to tell anybody where , WiFi works .
I don &apos;t say , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , this amazing freedom of choice we have to continually decide , and that we have to continually decide , if we need to work or not .
We can go to see our son to be to see our son to be a touch , with the Blackberry in the other , and the night , and the night , typically , on the ginocy .
And even though they &apos;re spending , every minute that we see our son , we also see our son , we &apos;re also asking , we &apos;re also asking this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , &quot; all this makes the experience of the partners of your child very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , as much as we look at , little things , small things , and great materials and life is a lot of life is a question of choose .
Once the world was this : Over , there were some possibilities , but it was not a question of choice .
The world today is a positive : The dilemma is , &quot; Is it &apos;s a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Shurt .
And we know all , so I &apos;ll talk about that negative .
This is all about two negative effects of two negative effects of people .
The first one , paradoxally , is that it produces free .
And many of the options that choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I offer you an significant example : a study conducted study conducted in the plans .
A college has access to the data of Vanlook , the gigantic society , with about a million of the world-climents in 2,000 companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of adesion , the percentage of adesion .
Five sources , there &apos;s 10 percent of the less adesions of the degree of it available to only five . Why ?
Because with 50 sources , which I choose , it &apos;s maleasy to decide , and the choice is remanded to the indomorange .
And domories , and still domories , domorders , domorders , and of course , domored , of course , domorders , and of course , domorders , domorries , and of course , domorange , domorances , domorange , and of course , domories , and domored to domorders .
You can &apos;t have enough , it means that these various works from the various food for cans because they don &apos;t have enough money , it means that the decision is so obstic that they allowed the complementary of the dator of the work .
Not participating , they &apos;re allowing five dollars per year from the work , which would be willing to be going to be it .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think that makes the world like that .
&quot; And finally , for the eternity : ketchup , or maionese ? &quot;
You &apos;d like to take the right decision , if it &apos;s the right nity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong source , and nepurple conditions .
So , this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can avoid the paralysis , we &apos;re less satisfying out of the result of how we would be with less options .
And that &apos;s a lot of reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions , which choose choose , if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have to make a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that alternative imagined us induce us the high of the choice , and the repilot of the fairly , and the dimining the defation of the decision , and the defense is the decision , and it &apos;s not perfect the decision , and it &apos;s not perfect the
even when it was an optim decision .
More , there are , more to be , more to displaced than any details that it &apos;s insodd-inso-like option .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has asleleft very practical as the value that we have to depend with things that we confront .
First , when there are so many options , it &apos;s easy to representing the equipment of alternative characteristics , and be less satisfying of the option that is choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m a scuspull of New York .
But that &apos;s what you probably think you &apos;d be .
There &apos;s this mouse to Hamptons .
A place of lussize .
It &apos;s all about it .
It &apos;s not not not anything . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , malediition , is Agost . &quot;
&quot; All my neighbors in Manhattan are away . &quot;
&quot; I could tell me about the home . &quot;
And it &apos;s two weeks and assilate from the idea that &apos;s losing -- every day -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The cost-opportunity is declining the sodd-opportunity for what we have , even when choice was excellent .
And the most of the options that we have to address , the more attractive characteristics will be constructed as a conto-opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
It &apos;s about living the time , and maybe of living .
But the most important point is that you choose , you &apos;re choose , you &apos;re choose of them .
The things that we don &apos;t choose have a tactivity that we can make less attractive what we do .
Tirgly : the spiral growing of expectations .
I tried it on my skin bought a new couple of jeans .
I &apos;m going to almost always jeans .
And once the jeans were one kind of bought , and bought it was wrespected , they were dissions , only after they were washing them a lot of times , began to go well .
So I went to buy a couple when I bought a couple when the old old , and I said , &quot; I need a couple jeans , this is my typically . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Who wants me to be slim , relaxy fit , relaxy and fit ? &quot;
It wants to the ground or with the ground or bottons ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; aciwashed &quot; ?
&quot; Would you have straight ? &quot;
&quot; Sow the basic various or stretches ? &quot;
I was burn , and after a little bit , and after a little bit I could say , &quot; I want the guy that was the only guy that was , so for a little bit of what I tried to be , so I tried to try all the disease , and I had ever .
It was the best . I had all the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand it .
The reason I was worse worse is that with all that choice , the jeans were high , the jeans had to be perfect .
I had a minime , I didn &apos;t expectations of excited to expected anything when there was only a kind of fears , at least one , and at least one should be perfect .
What I was buy was good , but not perfect .
After I paragoned that choose with what I was looking for the expectations .
The addition of the people don &apos;t do that they don &apos;t have to expectations that these have respect to the ectcell of the options of options .
And that will be less satisfied , even when the results are good .
Nobody in marketing world .
Because if they knew it , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth of this .
&quot; It was better when he was worse , &quot; The reason it was better when he was worse , it was better when he was worse , it was even possible to meet the surprising source .
Egyday , in the world where we live -- opulents , industrialized , citizen industrialized , the maxpection of perfection -- the most of the things are in the heighborhood of expectations .
You never have surprised pleased because your expectations , expectations , they &apos;re ingiganten .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- it &apos;s , &quot; Basse expectations , &quot; Yes , you want . &quot;
I mean -- little autobiographic moment , which I &apos;m really moving and my wife is really study .
I couldn &apos;t have to do better , I didn &apos;t have to be able .
But it &apos;s not always a good thing .
And then , a consequence of buy a couple of jeans scomfortable to be a couple of jeans is that when you &apos;re not satisfy , and ask you , and ask you , and ask you , and ask you , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot;
The world is responsible . What could I do you do ?
When there are hundreds of types of jeans , and buy a insodd-up insod-up , and you ask you who is the responsible , it &apos;s the responsible , you &apos;re going to be .
You could have done better .
With hundreds of dispond variety , there are no scenes for the insuccess .
So when people are decisions , even though the result is valid , they feel unfairly insodently and they &apos;re going to hit .
In the last years of depression is exploss in the industrialized world .
I think a meaning -- not the only one , but the important -- of this honor , but that &apos;s important -- of this depression of depression is too much high .
And when they need to explain this situation thinking that the color is them .
So the final result is that we &apos;re better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the official dogm , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely false .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than it &apos;s better than it doesn &apos;t take it it to be a lot of choice , but it doesn &apos;t be better than a little bit .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m pretty sure we &apos;ve been surgery , the way the choices that choices our life .
Now , from the political point -- I &apos;ve almost finished -- from the political point , the nocle is the following .
What allows all this choice in industrial society is the wealth of it .
There are many places in the world , and you know about it , and you know , which the problem isn &apos;t that they have too much choice .
The problem is they have too much little bit .
So the faces I &apos;m talking about is a malbeing talking is a malbeing of modern , recidly society .
And what it does to do is , and arrand it &apos;s this : Steve Levitt talked about how much those cost-to-to-to-sian , and sat men for whbes .
I mean that these choices , complicated and dispendent , it &apos;s not that they &apos;re just useful .
I &apos;m going to be address .
They &apos;re doing worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows , it was reversed in those people where people have too few chances , it would not be just their life to be better , but it &apos;s also our improving life , but it also wouldn &apos;t be better , but it also .
This is what economists call a paretian improvement .
A redesibution of the reduction is good at all -- not only the poorest -- it causes of this choice in except that it &apos;s going to be mentioned .
To conclude , you can become everything you want to be what you want to be --
You , people of culture , you think , &quot; What does that believe that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t be anything in a glass of glass . &quot;
&quot; Audience imagination , a limited vision of the world --
and I &apos;ve interpret that , in the beginning .
But then , I thought , instead , I realized that that weight the long .
Because the fact of fact is that if you &apos;re maniping the books , so that &quot; all the time , &quot; it &apos;s possible . You can &apos;t get the free .
If you can take the bucks in a way that all become possible declining .
You know , you know , and you &apos;re going to be .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too much , perhaps even even though , it &apos;s just just for us .
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic symbolic and , theme , for the rhytheld .
Thank you very much .
