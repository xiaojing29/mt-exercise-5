And year I showed these slide to show that the calculate that the calculate glacial size , which for almost three million years later had the size of 48 percent .
Twake this sunder the gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show it the spacial .
The calculate glacial glacial , the cuor the cuor the major the global climate system .
You expect inside and you get up .
The next slide is going to be a very quickly the last 25 years .
The gaciacian are signed in the way .
As you see , you expand the blue .
That &apos;s the glacide in inversus , that you get .
You can see that the costtold , of five years , of five years or , is like the sangue , which is like the wind .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been from so , and so .
This is a problem because the rescale , the entire entire reaciactor , where there are enormous , where there are enormous amount of carbon , and they &apos;re transforming , and they turned into meters , and they &apos;re transformed in metanthan .
It &apos;s a totality of the inquinter of the inquinter instrong the global care , that could rading , the surface , the surface of the won &apos;t be riting .
In some laghes , in some laghes , the metaphor is already rebecame the water .
The professor Katey Walter Walter Walter , the Sweka is with a team is a a longer basically a literally scored .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Leat it . The question is if we &apos;re going to be .
A reason is that this scale measure that the normal exchange from the north .
This is a figured rules .
And the brought not had been reached to lifast .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the swerders of the Groenland .
If you want to know how to be the level of the move to the map of the glacight-fairs , it &apos;s where you can get the move .
These corrents are aumenting .
At the other part of the planet : Antart of the planet .
The month scientists have diared that the clear of the ice is in the negative , and that Antartouch , and that Antartouch , which pogs , which pogs , is particularly , it &apos;s particularly , it &apos;s particularly , it &apos;s particularly ,
Equival sunder six feel of the field , like Groenland .
Sull Himalaya , the third bigger of the block of the glaghes , and they see new laghes , which was glacished .
The 440 percent of the population was half of the water power of the power of the power .
Sull : this ggets is the fall is the fall of the water .
The brought is ather .
But when you dimind , the same accept water .
In California , the Siar Nevada is diminuites .
The bind bind are in the cribes .
The predicts , as you have , they &apos;re gravoring .
The growth of the world &apos;s sure in the world &apos;s sure of the include .
The disaster are in the wind , and it &apos;s a wrong out of the normal and without precedented .
For four number than four number , 30 years to the precedentes .
This is a head of all intenable .
If you look at the context stories can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we &apos;ve add 70s of tone-24 hours -- 24 hours of tone-millions of tone-day .
Look at the U.S. .
Most of the global rescale , together to the deforest , which is the deforest , it &apos;s the combustible .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with the Cina .
And he was proponally to build many other central central carbon .
But we &apos;re assisting a change of direction .
These are the annulled , in the last years , and some of the alternative versus of the alternative .
And every way , there &apos;s a political political political in our country .
The car industries of the oil , and they have spext 250 million dollars in the last year for promise to promise the carbon , which is a host .
That picture me to something --
I know Natal , in the Tennessee , where I was a perdite of 3.8 billion paper of carbon .
Maybe you saw the news .
This is the second biggest ffluses in America .
It &apos;s happened to Natal .
The published the published of the industries of the carbon .
Video : I &apos;m going to be the bonaium is a kind of like it .
It &apos;s wonderful here in America , and it &apos;s growing our economy .
Fross the carbon is always more can .
It &apos;s good price , the predictable and the work are working .
Al Gore : She &apos;s very much part of the West Virginia .
The largest society on the monountain is Massey Coal . This is his friends .
Video : Won Blankenship : Sark , Nancy Pelospitches , Harry Reid -- not year , Harry Reid -- they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Protetion of Clim , it has two campay .
This is a part of the time .
Video : ALergy : All COALergy see the climate change as a serious mind of our business .
And that our priority is invest to be a big amount of money to make a big full of the public to make the public truth .
In fact , the carbon is not sport .
We think it &apos;s a good profound -- it also -- it also a good profound .
So , not predictable to the climate change .
Let me do to us .
Video : Ator : Carbone -- you have to talk about it .
So , I do a game in a strong strong strong the carbon the carbon .
Sunder ! The car is a little bit bit bit of the carbon of the carbon the technology of the carbon .
The consumption is between the major the major the major the global major the major the major the major the major the major the major the mains of the carbon .
You have a ask : this is the odierging technology of the carbon .
Al Gore : Infinally , the alternative positive to the economic issue and that the sure of the churchurity .
Video : My America is in the crisis , the crisis , the crisis , the crisis .
The phils that the college of all : our dipendence to the bustible beyond , like the carbon and the oil and the oil .
Now , perhaps there is a new audace for use .
Rease America : 100 percent of the pull years .
A piece of the work , makes us more to make the work , and help us to help the global rescale .
Finally , one solution that &apos;s solution that solution to our problems .
Really America . Scprise .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Yeah : Yeah . It &apos;s about energy to America .
One of the fast faster to the end of the dependence to the dependence that the dependence .
She says , the future is here . It &apos;s just , one new energy .
She looks like two : Not investment for posts to be good .
She &apos;s going to be an Africa . It &apos;s time to be an exists .
Al Gore : A old old a prpractice says , &quot; If you want to go to the fast , you go to the solar .
If you want to go to , you go through . &quot;
We have to go to the long-fast .
Thank you very much .
The year year I &apos;m going to TED fectly a introdution on the LHC .
And I promise to go to the back to the wake .
So , it &apos;s the same thing . And for those other time , there were no , LHC is the great experiment in the scientific experiment .
His compit is to reach the conditions that were under a billion a billion the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times times a second times .
All of all is just environment .
This is the machine , the sunder Ginevent .
We are these mini-Big Big Big , the result .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- it &apos;s large 44 feet and a 22 feet of 22 feet .
This is a picture of ATLAS in buildings .
The 10 september of the scored year we have access to the first time .
And this picture was scaced by ATLAS .
It was the immentioned of the myself in the control of control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first phasm of particles that was all the young of the LHC , and in collision , with a part of the HC , and a very difficult in the middle .
In other words , when we see that the 10 sept-seem , we could be the machine , that &apos;s a great vitting .
I don &apos;t know if you have to exultate more opped this , when somebody on Google and vide that the page was this .
What means we have had a cultural impact cultural impact cultural .
And I was a week after , there was a problem with the machine , it had to these phils here -- these phils here -- these phils .
These brought 13,000 amping when the machine works ,
Now , the technical technical will look at the phils and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true .
And they can do that because when they &apos;re very cold to be the cost of the surface .
So , at less 271 degrees , to a temperature inferior between the stars , these phils can bring that corrent .
In one of the young novemial novemiet , there was a fabulation of the babkshape .
So the phils , they &apos;re going to give it a little bit of the improvide , and the 13,000 ampes a resistence .
This was the result .
Now , this is still more more than these magnetwork if you think these magnetwork , and that you have been saying about 30 feet .
They &apos;re danneged about 50 magnetwork .
We had to have to the them , what we did .
We have repressed and traveled .
They &apos;re going to be ritornating all the place to their squeen .
I &apos;m going to be the end of the LHC will be new integrate .
We &apos;re going to happen , and we &apos;re wondering the data to get the gunlight , and continuing so our adventure for what our adventure for the morning .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these involved the dibad dibad on the value of science and engineering . It &apos;s just to confuture . It &apos;s just to confuture .
I think the fact that the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that I think is the value of things like LHC .
I &apos;d like to squency with a scientist , Humphrey , Humphone , which is that , the imagine that , and that you can be in the inuses of the inuses of the inuses of the inuses , &quot; Nithing is so much for the results of the human mind , and the science that the resources of the results , which is not as the results of our mind , and the results , which is not a full our mind ,
Thank you .
I want to start thinking about rethink , when children , from children , from children , from children , from children , you get clear .
As you reach them to reach them , and they &apos;re going to be to think and they &apos;re going to think and to think about it , and you actually think about it and solving problems .
The reasonable reason is deeply connected to the way we understand as much as much of the world ints around us .
So , by the inspired by using the use of our interaction with objects , together with my own own own counts , and my collaborator , and my collaborator , and my collaborator , I started ask me , &quot; And if we &apos;re a computer computer , and when we &apos;re a computer on the wind as a trouble , and it &apos;s a swind , and it &apos;s a safly ward information with a bunch , with the sound , with the sure ,
and our fall and our pieces ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , and it &apos;s what Siftable .
In the words , a Siftable is a great computer .
In the words , a Siftable is a great computer .
You can move with the hand , they can be the hand , they can be the movement and they have a screen and a a running .
But surprised , are objects , like the morning , you can move , you can be just just ferrand-rand-rand-rand-rand-rand-h-randscape .
The Siftable , you know , for example of a new ecosystem for maniping the information .
And they get more physics , consciously , consciousness , and they move more physics , and they &apos;re going to be more physics , consciously , we can exploring them , we can exploring new and different interaction .
I &apos;m going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show the video : if you incline in a direction , the video gurpose is going to be so , if you cline .
These are interactional interactively are consciousness .
If you are interested in the way , it &apos;s interested in .
If they &apos;re going to be surrounded and they can get a little bit .
If they &apos;re going to be surrounded and they can get a little bit .
They also have been their movement and inclination .
We &apos;ve got to cont that one of the interaction of the interaction was the power to use gests of the data , to example , &quot; a color as if it was a liquid as if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable as a century , and I can use them to be the swear to the color in the central central , where they ask .
and I can use them to be the hundred of the color in the central , where they &apos;re going to be .
If we &apos;re too too much , we can ret a little bit of a place .
I &apos;m also beautiful possibility of appeared , like the languages , and the yourself , and the yourself , where people people can try to try to be , and see things that are just seem to be immediately .
Now , I &apos;m going to --
This is a sequence of Fibonacy that I do with a program of .
Here we have a game of words that &apos;s half between Sabables .
First , you know , every remember a literally , and you know , and you can , you know , every remember , every clear , and every one one of the Siftable , and I certain the sounds of the words .
And then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new set of letters and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the children came to the Media Lab , I did it in the Media , and I got a video .
They &apos;re very pieces .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people many people .
You just say , &quot; You just say , &quot; You know what they &apos;re going to do .
Here &apos;s some people who try it .
This is our most young young , there there on the right .
It was just just implant to the same .
They were only morning , for him .
Now , this is an application of a carton .
We wanted to build a strument for the appeared of the languages is Felix .
It can inserve new characters in the scenes in the scena , solved the Siftable .
It can inserve new characters in the scenes in the scena , solved the Siftable .
Here &apos;s a lot of sole .
Video : The sole is the gence .
David Merries : Now he took a tractor in the scena .
Video : The tractor .
By work ! Yeah !
So schools Siftable and put the close to the character can interact to the character --
Video : Bau !
And in the story .
Video : I &apos;m going to be !
DM : It &apos;s a story with final history , and it can decide it .
DM : It &apos;s a story with final history , and it can decide it .
Video : Video , gave .
DM : The last example I &apos;ve got time to show you is a strump , realized , to walk and to the music and execise .
It &apos;s a strump , realized of recently , to walk and execise .
The Siften is based by sound as based , basically , the battery .
Each one of these has four different different variations , and you can write .
You can inserve these squence in a sequence from a sequence .
And modificart just doing a squence . &quot;
These are effects that you can control from the vive , like the result and the phillion .
It &apos;s a particularly sound particularly and then inclasses to go .
And then there are the effects as time and wanted to me , and it , and they just just just just the sequence .
We look at the way .
Video : We &apos;re going to start a base in two Siftable , &quot; We &apos;re in two Siftable , &quot; We &apos;re going to add , the other , we add to the other base .
Now , a bunch of the basically .
Video : Now , I add to the percussions --
Video : And now , I &apos;ll put the battery to the battery , so I can control the effect .
Video : I can be faster to the interested in the sequence , and the other time to a later .
Video : And now I &apos;ll add the basically to the basically to the bottom to be more expression .
Video : I can remember the sequence . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have the first , but I can make it more more than I can make it more more than the biggest .
And now , finally , I can squency the interested in the left Siftable , &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is built to be able to be able to be a more more than our brain brain and the body .
And today , I &apos;ve got time to show you one of the results of this performance , and even some possibility that we try to take out of the lab .
The concepts that I want to translate is that it &apos;s going to be this new generation of objects to interact with media , which will be information in our world that we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time with all you .
I &apos;m a tricky .
It &apos;s my profession is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also the love and the fascar of my life .
And I don &apos;t expect that you can change .
But , I said that , something particularly happened in my life and in my lifth and in my carric , and it took me to realize the entire relationship with this .
The particularly is that I recently wrong this book , this book called &quot; Mang , Pula , Pula , but that , At , &quot; which , a different reason , for some reason , for some reason , for some reason , for some reason , and it &apos;s a great sensational best , and it &apos;s a great sensational book .
And the result is that everywhere , people are just as if they were conduct .
Daviging -- condanned , condanned !
They were all worried and say , &quot; You don &apos;t have to be able to do that ?
You don &apos;t have to go to write for all the life without the power of life without to be able to create a book that can be able to make anything ? &quot;
What can you need to somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s rassicully , you know .
But it could go to the piece , at the most than 20 years ago , when I started to say , when I started to say , people -- I was a very much -- I wanted to be a scring .
I was in the same reaction of the same based by the country .
And people said , &quot; I wasn &apos;t not to have success to have successful ?
You don &apos;t have to be purposed to the research of the results ?
You don &apos;t have to make this move for all of all life without the nulvaried out and dead on a cumual cumual cumual with the boud of the bought ? &quot;
And so , you know .
The answer -- the answer to all these questions is : &quot; Yeah . &quot;
And I , I have a couple of all things .
I always had a couple .
And I also also also lots of other things that people could not be involved .
As and other things like , and other things .
But , how much about what I thought , and I thought I was thinking , and I asked me to be because ?
What &apos;s rational ?
It &apos;s logical that anybody who had to be fairly to be fairly from a job that you know .
But what &apos;s about that particularly in the inpresses to make us to make it look at the health health is to a way that other carries do not ?
How my father , for example , he was a engineer and not remember of a solar sold in his 40 years of activity that the 40 years of activity that was asked ?
There was never -- that blows the engineer of engineer , how it &apos;s it ?
It didn &apos;t work , it &apos;s that , it &apos;s that ?
Only , the engineers like group as group , in the centuries , in the centuries of being alcolized to be alcolized .
We written , we have this reputation , and we don &apos;t only only only only only only only only the result of every geneties of being an instable instable instable .
And it wasn &apos;t to look at the trists of the magnific dead , just in the mind of the major the century , they dead and they draft and so for them .
And that &apos;s also not the switched to be realized to be realized .
Norman Mailer , first to dead , in the last last time he said , &quot; Ogn my book has to me a little more than a little more than a little more than the work of your life .
But we don &apos;t get it to say because we feel this thing because we &apos;ve heard these things , and we have all all all all the way we have completely interested in some way , and it &apos;s going to be a few way and it , to conduct , and it will , to conduct it , it will be able to the reach .
And the question that I want to all today is : You &apos;re going to be with this idea ?
It &apos;s good to be this thing -- because you look at the middle of distance , it &apos;s not good for nothing .
I think it &apos;s odiosa .
And I think it &apos;s also along and I don &apos;t want to see the perpecuate in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to be to be our big machine creative to live .
And I &apos;m sure that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very pericicult to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a little bit of the expensive , and it &apos;s in my carric .
On true -- you look , I &apos;m just looking at , I &apos;m just 40 years .
I still have about four decademic work in me .
And it &apos;s very probable to be able to write what I &apos;m going to be given from the world as the work that used after the work that was going to be going to be a whole book .
I &apos;m saying , because we all have the most amazing , it &apos;s probably the big success is to my big success .
Oh , Gesus , that I was thinking .
You know this is the genetic genetic genetic to start to start to be to start to the nine and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I &apos;d like to do this work that we &apos;re going to do this .
So , the question is , how ?
And so it seems to me , lots of reflected to go to write is what to do to be to make a psychological cost , and that &apos;s what &apos;s to do ?
I had to find some way to be a distance between me , and I &apos;m written , and my natural natural ansia on what I &apos;m going to get to get to be able to get it to be able to be able to be able to look at the time , and I &apos;m trying to look at the time , and I &apos;m trying to find other society and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and the best ideas .
to help people creative to make people creative to the inerents of creative creative people .
And that research me to the ancient Greef and Roma .
It &apos;s going to be the game in the certainly and then back .
In the ancient Greef and Roma -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that the creative vity becomes draw , OK ?
It was thinking that creative was this spirit to be this spirit and that &apos;s been involved and swine and a few people from a few people from a lot of people and knowledge and knowledge .
The ground was called these divince the creative dians of the creative creative .
Socrying , it &apos;s really really really , credit of a demand that &apos;s a hunger .
The Roman was the same idea , but they called the sort of the spirit without a genius .
The big thing , because the Roman didn &apos;t think that a genius was a very sunder .
They have to be a genius was this species of the inthemselves that you believe it was living in the murs of a a artist of a artist , a little bit like the elfall and that &apos;s like the Dobby , and that if you assists out of the work .
Here &apos;s the three--- that &apos;s the distance of the party that -- that costruted psychological psychological .
And they all know that was so so it works , right ?
So the artists were protected by certain things , like the United States , right ?
If your work was exciting work was excetional , you couldn &apos;t take it all the market , all they had been helped by this genius .
If your work work , it was not all all the same , it wasn &apos;t all your own , right ?
And all they had the genius to be a incapable .
And so people are finger to the creative creative creative in Occident time .
And then the Rinally came and all changes , and it &apos;s all all changes , and we put it into the clear of the universe and the mistak all of the universe and the mistes and without the creatures that wrong from the divinity .
This was the major the major the human human inspired and people start thinking that creative creative .
And for the first time in history , you know , you know , the first time in the first time , it &apos;s like a piece of a piece of the genius .
And I have to tell , I think , I was a big grospitches .
I think it allowed to someone , a simple person of being as a reciplant as the fall , and the kind of all all of the mysters , creative , creative , creative , creative , creative , creative , creative , creative , and it &apos;s a very much much from the fragile that humans .
It &apos;s like to one to be like to give the sole .
It &apos;s all all the way to be the ego and creates all these engineer expectations .
And I think it &apos;s been this pression to destructed the artists in 500 years .
And , if that &apos;s true , and I think it &apos;s the question is , and now ?
We can do that different ?
I &apos;m going to go back to a more than the relationship between human relationship between human relationship between the human relationship between the way .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t have to be 500 years of thinking about 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience that it would be able to be the scientific network on , but , you know , they &apos;re just doing people , but they &apos;re going to be the successful , and they &apos;re going to be on their projects .
And I &apos;m not going to be not not to you all all on this thing .
But the question I &apos;d like to take it is -- why don &apos;t it ?
Why don &apos;t I think that way ?
Because it &apos;s more more than every other thing that has ever ever heard to explain the expensive to explain the process of creative process .
A process that , as anything that has ever ever ever ever ever , it &apos;s all , so much , all here -- you know , all -- you know , you know , it &apos;s not composed .
And , in fact , it can be completely paranmal anormal .
I did this inet with the extraordinary strake with the extraordinary Ruth Stone , and it &apos;s been a little bit for all life and he said , &quot; it was a little bit of life and he said that it was a little bit of the campaiginia , and it was going to be a poeful time , and he was a powerful time , and he was a powerful expaper .
He said that it was like a fragreeous train .
And that was rolating to the landscape .
It &apos;s going to be able , because he was a little bit under the third though it .
He was to have a solar thing to do and he was , and it was , and he was , &quot; Deeeat how a math . &quot;
And so it turns out to the home and it would be introduce from this poetry and a piece of card and a mathor a piece of a faster , and a three-fast page .
And sometimes it wasn &apos;t being enough , so it &apos;s going to be fast and the record and the home and the home and the home and the home and the home and the lost and she would continue to go through the page and it would be going to go to the page , and he would be going to be a few other other other . &quot;
Then there were the time -- this piece of the time , I &apos;m never going to be -- there were the moments that the almost perfectly , right ?
So , it was taking home and and he was trying to be looking at the time , and it was a three-scale , and he was a mathemselves , and then he said , and then he said , and then he said , it as if you get with the other hand and the lacross the other hand and the landscape .
Acucide the poetry and the way to the page and the turn and the translation was going to page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be presented on the page and intately , but the last word .
So when I thought -- it &apos;s a couple , it &apos;s exactly the process of creative process .
I don &apos;t all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conduct .
I &apos;m a movie , and my way to work is ; I &apos;m a bunch , and I &apos;m a little bit and work and go to work and go to the go and go out and go out .
But even , in my testardages , I &apos;ve got to control that , sometimes .
And it also also also a lot of you the han did .
You know , even though the work and ideas , and I was driving me to a certain in the wind , I could not know that .
What is this ?
And how can we relationship to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it ?
And so as I look at the best example of the contemporary experience that I have is the music that I have a different days ago for a nal days .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of the most of the artist of the artist of the artist artist of the artist , to try to control , to try to control these species of involved , and you know , we &apos;re going to be able to be interiveral .
But then I &apos;m going to be , and a day when he was driving on a a day as a day as a day as a day , changed all .
It was going to be fast and all of a trouble sent , that &apos;s a little bit of melodia , which arried in its head and the inspiration , and the lights , and the lesson , and the desidant , and the description , and the desidentic , and the description .
It &apos;s not a piece of career , it doesn &apos;t have a three-regit .
So , he beginning to feel this species of vecchanese , &quot; the site to perfect , and he remains to be .
I &apos;m not enough , I don &apos;t know it . &quot;
And I &apos;m going to go into the panic , you stop .
I &apos;m going to be the interest and fast something completely new .
I &apos;m just just just the sky and said , &quot; Scususes , &quot; Scususes , &quot; I &apos;m going to be draw ? &quot;
&quot; You know , you know , you know a dozone ?
If it really want to be , back to a more than one when I can take me care .
And you &apos;re going to be important any other other today .
You &apos;ve got to disturbate Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his process to work after this .
Not work , the work was still still hard as .
But the process , and the fish ansia that was reeded when the genius was reable when the genius out of him , the genius that was nothing to be able to be able to be able to the back to where they were able to be a interiorization , and it was going to be a interiorized .
But it was a little bit of this peculiar , it wonderful conversation a conversation between Tom and this thing that &apos;s going to be not Tom .
So how much the story to change a little bit of the way I was working on and I already it .
This idea , I &apos;m going to go to writing , I &apos;m wrong , and I said , &quot; and I &apos;m going to be a lot of the fall that we &apos;re all working on something and we &apos;re working on something and we &apos;re working on something that &apos;s going to think about something that &apos;s going to think about it &apos;s going to be the worse .
It doesn &apos;t only only brutes , right , right , right .
And I started thinking about to think about this project .
But then I got to remember of Tom that works to the air and you have .
So I went to my host in the hosswitched and I got my comments to a angle .
And I said , &quot; Sently , &quot; Sently , what we &apos;re going to be the book that if this book is not going to be under not going to be under my own , no interested in my own ?
Because as I see it all I put all all that I &apos;ve not got more than I have ,
So if you want to be better , you have to be better , you have to be the part .
Okay . But if you don &apos;t , you know , you know , I didn &apos;t have to be nothing .
I &apos;m going to go to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to be regided that I today , I &apos;ve been to do my part of &quot; because it &apos;s so , OK -- the end is so , OK -- in the centuries of the North Africa , and the people who were going to be able to the wonder and music and music and music .
And they were always magnific , because the balleres were fantastic and they were fantastic .
But every much , and it &apos;s going to be , and one of these artists become in .
And I know you know , because I know that you have to a certain , a certain , a performance .
It was like the time , and the ballery ballery through a species of a species of a brought and not doing anything about 1,000 night , as the 1,000 night before it .
And in the improvide not apparts as a human human .
But you access from the inside and the sunder the fire fting inside of the divinity .
And when this happened , the tempes , people know what it was , they were called the name .
They were the hands and , they were started to song , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , God , God , God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curiosa three-stories -- when Mordern invass the Spay , preserved this abitude with their own centuries , and the pronoundation in the centuries , and the words , &quot; Oklah , &quot; Okay , &quot; the words , &quot; which I still can still feel in the cord or fluens .
In Spain , when a artist has something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , worky , the wind , I was , &quot; I , &quot; I realized , &quot; I wonder -- a wird of Dod .
And it &apos;s great because we need .
But , the problem , the problem , for the ballerge , when you wake and the same , and it turns out that are the 11 of Marteds and the scored , and the scored , there &apos;s no more .
It &apos;s just a mortal detained with the ginockets , and maybe it will never be more to make that the tree .
And maybe anybody will be the name of the God , and what does it do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most purchallenging to make a creative lives .
But maybe not to be so angerous to be so angerous , and it won &apos;t believe , that the most extraordinary , which is extraordinary to be from you .
But you think you just just just you know that you have to be a inpicture of this squish of this squises of your life that you have to go to anything when you &apos;ve got to go to anything when you &apos;ve got to get .
And , you know , if we think in this way .
And so I started thinking , and it &apos;s just just like , and it &apos;s just as I thought for different months in the book that I &apos;m going to be able to be able , the perforever , the perhaps of my great deal .
And that I have to tell me when I feel to tell me when I feel that I got to say , it &apos;s not not available .
You don &apos;t wrong . It just just your work .
It &apos;s going to be in the representation for your part , any part of your part , any any way to be .
If your work is balling , the ball .
If the divine , I think you &apos;re going to be asked to left some kind of wonderful kind of wonderful a moment , for a moment , and then you go . &quot;
And I got the same .
And &quot; Okay ! &quot;
I think I think I &apos;ve got to teach it .
&quot; You ! &quot;
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : The !
And as you know , I &apos;ve already talked about some of these genoma , what meaning and the discovery of new genes .
We &apos;re starting to a new percoral . We &apos;ve started to digitalized biology and now now now now , and now now we &apos;re going to get a new new phase and teths and synth-thetizing and tetizing and tetizing and tetizing and tetizing systems and now .
We always tried to be great questions .
What &apos;s the lives ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists have been to understand to understand various .
We tried to be different approach , and we &apos;ve got to minimes .
We &apos;re going to be at the almost 20 years .
When we sequency the genome of human biology to go from the world of the world of biology in the world .
Now , we ask : We can regenerate the life , or create new life from this universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplass , which is the kind of the genome , which is the kind of the smaller that can autorous laboratory .
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome to create a little more .
We &apos;re able to eliminate a hundred of the switching of about 500 that are here .
But when we look at her maps to her maps , it &apos;s relatively relatively to our .
Cremember , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , it &apos;s very improbable that this can bring to a cell cells .
So we decided that the only to design requires was to design this crazy to be able to be able to be able to make some of these questions to make some of these questions to bring some of these questions .
And so we started the &quot; Pan synthetizing a chromosoma ?
And the chemistry to contains these great molecules that we &apos;re never able to create before ?
And in case , we can do it a croma car ?
A croms is just a piece of material chemical material .
The speak that we &apos;re able to degree to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able .
We have to write the genetc of the genetc , which is , we have to talk and more more , but it &apos;s better , but it &apos;s better .
And our most recently record the branches the exponential .
We &apos;ve been started to 15 years ago .
The process has required a lot of the first requires , beginning with a biothic ree-experiments .
But we &apos;ve discovered that synthetizing of DNA is very difficult .
There are decar of thousands of the machines of the world that products of the world that products and it &apos;s a long time , and it &apos;s a degenerative process , and it &apos;s a lot more running .
So we have to develop a new metaphor to assembling these framments and corrors .
And that &apos;s our first tentative , and it &apos;s the first tental information of the genome of Phi , 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that killed to knew .
We &apos;ve designed the framments , effectively the correition of the errors and a molecule of about 5,000 milecters .
The interesting part of the interesting thing is when we &apos;ve got this piece of chemical material , and we have inserious in the batteries , they started to read this code and producing this code and product to read this .
The particles are viral with the cells , they &apos;re going to get back and they &apos;re going to be back and they &apos;re going to be back to E.
I talked about the recent of the industry of the industry of the oil , and they &apos;re just just just compress that they &apos;re certainly compress this model .
They have ret more than you .
We think that this is a situation that the software can actually build his same way to build a biological system .
But we wanted to do things more big .
We wanted to build the whole clear of the battery .
They are more than 580 mmidddle of genetc code .
So we thought of build it in the casses of virus , so to change the casses of virus to understand what the casses are the components of a living .
The design is crucial design , and if we start with information , and if we start with a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequency this genome for the first time in 1995 , the time in 1995 , was a ror for every 10 mile .
We &apos;ve discovered , 30 errors , 30 errors . If we used that sequence that sequence doesn &apos;t be able to do that .
A part of the process is to design segments that you have to be a 50 letters that you have to be a lot more than 50 millions of 50 letters to build more than it together .
We &apos;re all all elements here .
We &apos;re mind that we &apos;re going to be lad that we &apos;re going to be the filights .
Think , we have a genetic genetic parts : A genetc of the letters .
Three of those letters , and it &apos;s a species of the letters , and there &apos;s a specific order to every ammal amming to every amming .
So we can use the genetc code to write words , under .
What we &apos;ve done in the beginning is the beginning is to do .
Some were been been been been been been been by the fact that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
We &apos;ve designed these segment to be able to be only only only to me to get to the entire .
There are the ones that repear and put them and put them .
And we started to assemblate the parts , began with segment , with six to five , until it into a sletters of 24 millions of 24 mile lect-lectable to get 72 mile .
And every past , we have product these segments in the under so we could sequency that we &apos;re going to create a very robusts that we &apos;re going to be a minute .
We &apos;re looking for authentially to the process .
So , this seem to the tabellone of a player .
When we go to these segents very long , more than 100 middle , more than 100 midle , they &apos;re not going to be more directly in E.
You get to the limits of the modern modern modern modern .
So we &apos;ve considered other meccanism .
We had another meccanism called the read repared to repartment , which in biology , which in biology , to use the DNA to degrees .
Here &apos;s a bunch .
This organism , called Deinoccurs , it can make three million rad rad .
You can see in the resources as his experiences as his clear .
In 12 hours is reassembled as it was first .
There &apos;s thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be completely .
They can be living under the way .
I &apos;m absolutely , that &apos;s all of the space , and you can find new environment .
It &apos;s true NASA showed that this is .
This is a lot of the molecule that we built these processes , just using these processes , with the appeared to inserve inserve .
The lievening them to the automatically .
This picture is not been been taken with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a lot of the test that we can see with a microscope .
These are pictures that they have a period of about six .
This is the publishment that we &apos;ve done a little bit time ago .
They are more than 50,000 lect-code genetc of genetics .
It &apos;s the most big molecule of a dedefine by the man .
It &apos;s a lot of a lot of a lot of a 300 million .
If we &apos;re going to be a careful paper , they would like 142 page , they would like 142 page to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be 142 paper ,
Now , how do we do it ?
Of course , tramp is a virus is a game from kids .
It &apos;s a little more complicated when they use the batteratteries .
It &apos;s more simple when it &apos;s about cells as a cells as as our : You can just extract the nuclear nuclear and inseriously , it &apos;s just a clonely , that &apos;s practice .
In the battery , the cromosoma is invstep in the cells , but we &apos;ve got to do a cells , but we just just just degree that we &apos;re able to do a trape of a cell phone to another and activity and activity it .
We have a bunch a craft to a kind of a micop-like a species .
The two are different than the men .
We &apos;ve add some gene in the way to decide what to slow that to be able to this crazy .
The scientists with the scientists in the way to knew all protecin .
And when we have move in the cells was study -- and you appeared our graphics -- the new chomosoma -- the new cell is to the cells .
And we thought we couldn &apos;t go to the way we could go to the full more , but we &apos;ve tried to be more .
This is one of the most meccanism of evolution .
We &apos;ve discovered that tansent species have add a second or a third or a third of a few of a new mind of new new species of new new species of new species .
So , who think about evolution as a only gene to the time you have not been a gene of biology .
There &apos;s the scientists called me the entire entire me that advanced me to say that the DNA .
The croms that was in cells that was in cells .
The cellphone that we have inserious to that we have inserious .
It &apos;s expressed , and it has recognized the other cell as material as material , and it &apos;s masticked , and we &apos;re realized with only cells and the new cells and the new cell and the new cell .
It &apos;s become blue , because of the genes we have inseriously .
And in a short of time , all the careful careful species of a species are going to be allow in a new species , and it &apos;s all about the new species that we have to be in the cells .
All the protecin are changing , the members are changing , and when we left the genetc of the genetc equivalent to what we have transformed .
Now , this could seemy genetics , but altering the software , but the software .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that you don &apos;t talk about three million years -- but I &apos;ve got to be three million years and mediately , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of explosion that will be a new species on this process will be a new species on this process .
Why do what ?
I think it &apos;s enough to our need to our need our need our need our need .
We &apos;re going to go to pass six billion people to the 19 billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to dare a example : I was born in 1946 .
Now , there are three people on the planet for each other , there are three people on the planet for 40 years , they &apos;re going to be four .
We &apos;re doing now now now to find food , water , water , fresh and pull , medicinal , and the wind of people .
It &apos;s going to do that for nine billion .
We &apos;re going to be more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion barries of the olef .
It means a millions of the barili .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to repieces for repieces , it will be a huge challenging .
And we have to have to consumption of the CO2 from these materials that fines are all the atmosphere .
Al day today , thank you very much from scientific the scientific world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that they &apos;re the design for the future .
The industry is only possible to only a dozen about components , and think about the different things are becomes out .
Our limits here are the major biological . And our imagination .
Now , we have some technical metoften these metoften , we can use what we call the genome .
We &apos;re able to build a big robots that can product a billion chomosomosoms .
Think of these 20 million different genes of the different different different different different or to get the processes to make the process to product or to make a little bit of the producing , new vaccines , we can change , and to create a little thetic , and to create a little bit more biology , and to create a little bit more years .
And it &apos;s just a selection .
We can choose for possibility of survival , production , and it production , or of the carburant vaccines .
This is a few anea of some square of some of the program we &apos;re working on to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
Well , we don &apos;t know how much they &apos;re going to be .
We know , we &apos;re exactly the genetc code .
Now we &apos;re focus with the carburant carbons of generation .
You have seen you that extract from the grain of the grain was a very finished .
We have a second and third generation that are going to be able to be fall-f-hundred of the most lifinger than the gap or different kinds of butankl .
But the only way the only way the biology can have a big impact without the cost of the food and limitself the cost of food and limitself the sure of the food , and we &apos;re working on the matheria that we &apos;re working on for design to design this , and we think of the practice that can be able to do that , and we think of it , and we can think of it it it could be about 18 months .
The solar solar solar with CO2 is a metodog -- but in our discovered in all the world , we found different different different .
This is a organism that we have descriped in 1996 .
It &apos;s in the ocean , at about 2500 feet of the foundation of the water .
It &apos;s going to be the CO2 used to use as a lot of energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can incanalate the CO2 , which can be transported to be transported to be transported to the CO2 in carburant that CO2 in carbon , to driven this .
So we think we could think we could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the question that the question is , &quot; It &apos;s the moon , we have the moon the entire moon the interested in the oil industry .
And it &apos;s all . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can &apos;t do it ?
It would be a main the main the energy .
And we &apos;re working on to use the same metal to use the same metal to create vaccines .
You saw this year with influence , we &apos;re always going to be a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s going to be the wind .
I think what you can change change in the vaccines inside .
Here &apos;s how the future could start to be changing , now , the tree of evolution , accounts , and the indictiles with the systems , and until the battern and infinally cells .
We &apos;re going to be better from the best people .
Our scale is to be able to be able to try to try to try to try to be a lot of them . Thank you very much .
But I &apos;m going to show you , the most of the most of the new technology that we &apos;ve got to be able to the Microsoft in the Microsoft in a a year ago , a year ago . This is Seady . This Seady .
It &apos;s a environment that you can interact to the local level that remoon with a huge of data .
Here we &apos;re seeing a lot of pictures with a picture of photography with a kind of sweet and continue , and it , and it &apos;s a fast fast , and it &apos;s a saying as we want .
And it &apos;s not about how much much much much about the amount of information that we see , how much much much much much of the data .
Most of the photographs , but this for example , but this for example is a scanning of the Biblioteca of the Congress , and reentrepreneurs in the gapiel .
It doesn &apos;t have a difference because the only thing that limit &apos;s the only thing that &apos;s the number of a pixel of your pxel on your scherm in any time . It &apos;s also a very flicky . It &apos;s also a lot of flicky .
This is a book , for example of data , not images .
This is the Casolate of Dickens . Ogn the relationship . Every colonnades a .
And to show you that it &apos;s just about it , and not images , we can do a thing , to see it &apos;s really to see that it &apos;s a very quickly , not a picture of a picture .
It could be a little bit bit about a little bit artificial way to read a book .
It &apos;s not going to be .
This is a more existic example . It &apos;s a number of a number of the Guardian .
Every big imagine is the beginning of a set .
And it really really , it &apos;s really the beautiful experience of a tacea of a travel of a revist a sunder of a medical jection , which is for nature .
We also also did something with the angle of this particularly in particularly .
We &apos;ve created a published solutionity -- much more than that it &apos;s a very much more than that it &apos;s used to a normal published -- and we have inseriously in a normal containment .
If you want to see the caristic caristic of this authomobile , you can see here .
Or other model , or even three-specific model .
And this really really dimonstrip of these ideas to ind the limits of space .
We hope that means to put the other people , and the other door and other cheries , they wouldn &apos;t be more to be necessary .
In course , the map is one of the applications of the most of the most of technology .
And on this not not to say that we don &apos;t want to say that we have to say that we have to give it a little bit .
These are all the street in the U.S. S. Sovovraphs of the NASA .
So we &apos;re going to be at what we &apos;re going to be another .
This is now , it &apos;s actually from the web ; you can see it .
It &apos;s a project called Photynth , which is two different different technologies .
A is a Seady and the other is a very interested in the computer very interesting about a very interesting thing from Noah Snavailable , a student in the University of the U.S. and Research Sezelissue of Microsoft Research .
And it &apos;s from the web , gone from Seady .
You can see it when we do this kind of paper , where we can go from one imagine and have this kind of experience and have this kind of experience .
But the location of the images here , it &apos;s actually a meaning .
The gorites of the computer regions have recorded these images together , and so that you get these imaginians to the place that you get to the place that imaginial imaginiors -- all the close to the Montontontal Rocadadesighborhood . You &apos;re scape .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more space .
I want to go to the directly on the original set of the original data , and this is a precedent prototypal prototypth of Photynth that we &apos;ve done for the first time . And that &apos;s really the first time to be really ask to be the question that I really really really really , the technology that we really need to look at the technology that we &apos;re really really really really really really really really really watch in the watching technology .
We had to worry about the lab and on the law .
This is a rerebuilt of the cattle of Nothers Flickr . Bag &apos;s a digital record to the Noths and you can get a typpppull , other else , and then you &apos;re saying . Olay . Ogns one of those constructs that you &apos;re going to be a scale .
So , I &apos;ve all got all the prise of Flickr and they &apos;re all all all the level .
And it &apos;s possible to be able to this way .
You know , I wouldn &apos;t think about the end of the Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifigure out this kind of access to this kind of access .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different different kinds of different different kinds of the cellularly , from those cellularly cell , a number of the ground , a number of the ground .
And if you have to try to try to those more strange .
Many are blows , they &apos;re blocked to it ,
somewhere here is a lot of photographs --
This is a poster of Nothregiant Dregiant .
We can go from the poster of the physicist of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social things with social social data . This is now on the memory of how to help the earth of how to help the earth of how to make the ground , and all those data .
All those pictures become college together , most of the parts .
You have a third model that .
Think to this as the prolder of the Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It &apos;s something that growth in complexity , and the people that people use it , and the the people to use it for the uses to use it .
They &apos;re hundreds are brown with metadoptises ,
If someone is to contrast all these several saying the name , my photography of the cattle of the cattle of Noththank you very much , and the post-f-fairs and the post-fairs , and I can use it in the metaphor and to use a lot of a social experience , and you have a social experience of a city of a typal experience .
And of course , a consciousness of all , it &apos;s all virtual model , and you have to be extremely interested in the terms of the terms and images and images from the satellysslow , but from the collective .
Mille grgrgraphes .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What your software to be able to do is that it &apos;s that you &apos;re going to be that a certain , in the next years , all the world &apos;s going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be prove with anything ?
BA : Yeah . What &apos;s doing in practice is to be wrong .
It &apos;s creating the hyperlink , if you want to be , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the contained to the contains .
The thing is really interesting if you think about the receive information of the information of the seem of these images .
And as a sunder images on the web , you have a bunch and the page and the page and the page page of pictures .
Now , what happens if that picked up to all your picture ?
And the quantity of interconnection and the quantity of the recently and the quantity of the machine that &apos;s really a classical effect . It &apos;s a very classical effect .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible .
BA : You &apos;re very much .
One of the major the major the major the clear and one of the research is the power of the power of the travel is the power of the traditions , between the cyth , the wind , and the south of the flowind , and the fairs .
Bastes thinking that sciamans Juar Jaguar , and the Via Lattea , or that the mites are still still still still the meaning of the Inualaya , or that in Himalaya , or that &apos;s actually the respieces , and the three-in-respiece of the central central , and the idea that &apos;s not only one of the world that we live in a sense of the world that we &apos;re not only only only only only only in a sense of the sense of the world , but it &apos;s also ,
the conset of a particularly set of sceles that our stirirshape , or a lot of generations , many generations ago .
And of course , all share we all share of the essential .
We all all all all we &apos;re all all all projectively .
We &apos;re saying the indead of the beginning .
We have to be to be the inesorability of morning , so we don &apos;t take us to be a little bit and we are --
We all have a lot of art .
What the pisce is the threm is the particularly , the run of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t import that they &apos;re the Worneo , or the follows of the Haiti of the Haiti , or the World , or the World World , or the Curandasus , Candasus Candasue , or a myself in the Sahara .
He was my companies in the desert of the journey in the desert of the yak of the jundred of the Everest , on the Everest , the demonstrate of the world .
All these populations are other ways to be other ways of the other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of the world .
And , if you reflected a second that can give you a very much .
And the maybe , the miriades of the world creating life in the world &apos;s a very strong life , and cultural cultural planet and it &apos;s important for the planet and it &apos;s important as a little bit like the man as a little bit of the planet as a little bit like the young .
And you can think about this girl as a cultural nosfly and you can definitely dededefine the nosphere , and it can be the concepts , every web , and it &apos;s intuitive , and it &apos;s intuitive intuitive intuitive intuitive intuitive inspired .
The nosfantastic is the fantastic patrimmmp .
It &apos;s the simple of what we are and what we can be in the species of what we can be in the species .
And so , as the biosphere was very consumption is the graveled and purther .
Nobody biologist , for example , it would die that 50 percent of all the species of all the species of the simply , because it &apos;s just because it &apos;s full -- in the power -- in the pothers -- in the most appearing of the different countries -- and you don &apos;t even even even even more than the major more than the major even themselves .
The instead of all is , of course , the lost linguistic .
When you &apos;re born there there 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only composed by a vocabolor a series of rules .
A language is the sprake of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the method that the animal or of every culture .
Every lingua bad forest , a spot , a swerful instead of the exists .
And those 6,000 languages , while we &apos;re here at Monterey , alleft the metaphor is not more sustrated in the orechies .
They don &apos;t get more teachers , the people that want to say , less that they &apos;re dead .
What &apos;s more trists of the being voluntil of the silar , the last one , of the last one , of the lingua , of not aver or or the wisdom or of the wisdom or of the promise ?
This is a fall of the world , and somewhere in the world every two weeks : every two weeks and a bunch and a bunch and the door and the dog , and it &apos;s a labe of a language .
And I know anything you will tell you , &quot; It &apos;s not better ?
The world would not be a better place if we talk all all the same language ? &quot; Benisish , so we all all all . We all all .
We &apos;re going to be .
You &apos;re going to be a tractice thing to say , not to say , your language .
I &apos;d like to do a journey through the nosphere through the nosfer .
a little journey in the nosfall of that we &apos;re going to give you a lot of what we &apos;re along .
Many of us dimental dimental , which is a different ways of existing .
We take for example , this bibibibibionia , in Amazonia , the people of the anonia , which is the middle of the anonia to try to be a spend of the latest spend .
It &apos;s a population that &apos;s not able to distingually distingually the blue of the blue of the forest , it &apos;s the forest , from the forest , from the forest , which is the population .
They have a strange language and a rull , &quot; Have , &quot; exexacamia , &quot; You have to spend a person that &apos;s a different person that party .
All the mythological mitological , and yet , yet et the particularity is that in these family , you &apos;re talking about six or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven later .
They get to the listen and then beginning to talk .
We take one of the most interesting tributes with whatever I lived , the Waoran Ecuador , a incredibly population , a population that has been the first content in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionary , they have been a constantly a commitment .
They have to get from the photographs that they read them in pose , and they were returned out that this population , and they were involved in that population , the forest to the bibi-dimensional forests .
They have the picture from the third picture , they got to the research a shape or a shape , they didn &apos;t find nothing , they were the saving , and they knew , and they have a five missionary .
But Waoran don &apos;t only only the strange .
They were a lot of them .
The 54 percent of the mortality was used to their same .
We &apos;re rising at eight generations and we &apos;ve got two cases of death , and when we have insisted to know , they have to know , they have to be able to know , and then they have been invected , and then they had a lot of the city . They had a way . They had a kind of a incredible sense of the extraordinary forest .
The crowds were able to remember the animal to the animal animal and remember the species .
In the first 1980s , it was asked me to be a very interested in the professor of Harvard to me if I wanted to go to Haiti , if I wanted to go to Haiti and Tontal Tontal and Tontal and Tontal Tontal and Tonton Macross Mactexactly .
And to give a sense to the miracolef , I had to take the culture of the Vodoun and the Vodouble is not magnine .
It &apos;s a very much of a complex physical vision of the world .
Many interesting interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the big religions of the world , what you would have to tell me ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddddrap , Ebraism ,
A continent is always left out , think that the Saharan Africa , and it &apos;s not not a religious religious religious . And the wasn &apos;t that the distilled of these religious concepts of these religious concepts to the tragic tragic tragic to the slow on .
What makes it interesting is the wonder is the same relationship between life and morning .
So , you know , you know , you know .
They explained the Grange can be invoccurred from the Grance , they said to the back and the record and they &apos;re involved in the anima short of the anima short that for a short that for a very short .
So , that &apos;s the wonderful voodom , &quot; You can go to the wonderful .
We &apos;re in the temple and we &apos;re going to be .
And the moment you &apos;re posting , is the spirit that you , how you can you do that ?
So , you know , these incredibly , it &apos;s just just the voodoo in the touch of trance that touch a direction direct direct a pieces of the power of the mind when it &apos;s been cataling in a lot of extremely ,
And the people who lived with the most extraordinary , the most extraordinary , the most extraordinary of the Santa Marta , in Colombia , in Colombia , in Colombia .
And I got to make a lot of the ancivilization that a living planets that a living in the car of the Colombia , the population , the population , the population that you get on the micky of the carbon the planning of the carbon .
In a continent of sances , this population , this population was not conquicted by the spagners .
And yet , there are government from a close but their formation is decided to extraordinary .
The young people are bring up to three or four or four or four , and four years , and they live in a good world of good and bombs in a good world of good and bombs in the basis of the tiny and bombs in the 18 years .
Two period of the nine years , in the nine months of gestation that translate the nine months of gestation that turns into the mother , and it &apos;s metaphor , and it &apos;s metaphor .
And so , they &apos;re acculated to the values of their society , values that they predict and only their predictable , and they just their predict to say , the best equilished -- or for the best thing .
And in termine of this incredible initiation , they &apos;re improvide out and the first time in their own life , in their age age , they see a 18 years , see a hours of the first bor , when the first bor , when the sole the bor , when the solar values , all that they learned in the teories , everything that has been learned in the result . The favorite soughout . The fall .
&quot; I &apos;m going to be told you .
It &apos;s just about it . Now , it &apos;s just to you see it .
They &apos;re called the blind checks and say that we , the brothers , we are the pevolution of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think of the people are the people to invochieve Rainainst and the old story of the nice of the nice , which is a concept of the nothing , which is a concept in his simply , and we say that these population are more than us .
The people are not not not until of the nine is indebolites from nosses .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the palures of the After in the vent of the Tibet , but thank you to get a mistic mystic on the Earth , they created a mistic of the Earth , and they &apos;ve created a lot of intubition , the concepts that the Earth can only fast fast .
What does that mean ?
It &apos;s going to say that a guy of the Ands that the montagainst the montagainst Apu that &apos;s a human spirit is a very different human human behavior will be a different fountain the montor of the mountain the montor that you have a little bit of the Montan &apos;s a little bit of a little bit that &apos;s a little bit of a Montontontal mountaken .
That &apos;s the dimall of one or a mineral cat the mineral cat .
What &apos;s interesting is the half of the metaphor that we can tell the relationship between the individual and natural world .
I grew in the forest in the forest to Britannc credriving that the forest to be wrong .
And I &apos;m a human rest to be different to be different my friends Kwakiutl that the forest , which the forest , the forest , and the became the stort of the paradiming and the spirits of the world , and the spiriting of the world , explains that it &apos;s going to be in the world , the spiriting .
If you start to look at that these cultures can actually actually , different different , you can start to make some of them sationship . We can start some of them .
I got this picture to aprid in Amazonia in Amazonia .
Mayahuge some of you have heard about the eye , the most powerful major the major the major sciamanic .
What makes it fascinating the playahuge is not the power of the tanches of the stage , but her elaboration . It &apos;s all about two elements . It &apos;s just two elements .
It &apos;s a later , this lian longer that contively a series of boline , hundred and a moline , literally llightly .
Pring the sold plants , it &apos;s a bught a bule that altera little bit of the consciousness , but it &apos;s myscelped with the car of the cffee of the car is called Pchoia .
This is a three-ptamine , very similar , very similar , methoxyltrypes , medioxyltryles , medioxylypellow .
If you ever see Yanomami to the naxed to the nask that they do from a different species , it &apos;s contioned , it &apos;s contioned methoxylypes .
Tird that policy is a little bit like to be spared by a little bit like to be spared by a careers and terms to a myself and terms on a myself . It doesn &apos;t believe a distort .
I got to be a fairly , Richard Evan Shultan , the man who wrong was the psychrunning was psychchecky , with his discovered by the &apos; 30 Mexico .
Second my tears can &apos;t classifield these triptamine as as a light-a-sun-sunning to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be under .
It &apos;s possible to be able if you under other sustainable with other stains that money money that money money to the MAO .
Now , it &apos;s beautiful : the beautiful thing that you have in this lian inibitch , the same kind of the MAO , the same kind of the major smart . The question of the maininininibecame , how these population , how these population , how these population are going to be two dead , but if you &apos;re going to be two dead .
We &apos;re the big euphemism of the time and the error , which can reveal infrutt .
But if we ask to the Indian , they &apos;re going to tell us . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribes , Cofan , and it 17 variety of ayahuasks , and they &apos;re going to be in the forest , and that our eyes would be in the same species .
If we ask the stabilies are their task to us to tell us , &quot; I was thinking , &quot; I wouldn &apos;t have all the time , of the full of the full , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : they get the 17 variety in a long--song , and each one will be a different different .
With not not laureduced to Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting that context that contact .
Now , &#91; &#91; &#91; &#91; the problem is that even the problem is that the people who have heard the people who have been pitting them , but in some way to be a few restaurposed to our world , and the past of our world , and the past .
In fact , the century , between 300 years , it will not be remember for the sound and innovations or the sue of technological technological technological technological technological technological . And we &apos;ve got brought and we &apos;ve brought to the truck of the different biological tricks of the different biological trained .
All the cultures are been involved in a dance for a new new possibility of life .
And the problem is not the technology .
Siought Sioux , they didn &apos;t have to be Sioux when they have to be part of the Americans have not been Americans not have to be Americans when they have been in the calculation .
It &apos;s not the technology that mind the technology that mind the integrity of the etnosphere . It &apos;s the power .
The wall of the domination .
And if you look at the world , you &apos;ll be wrong the world , you &apos;ll be cultures , you &apos;re not going to be .
They &apos;re creatures and dynamics , they &apos;re creator that are going to be a lot of the ability to be three their ability of adaptment .
And I &apos;m going to be disdisdisdisaster in the patria .
a population of Sarawak , in the sounds of the Sarawak , a population , a population , and now it &apos;s a generation ago , and now it &apos;s the next reduction and the next titution and the next result of the results , where you can see the Bories , the Sarawak , where the Minvolved , the Mininitional Minhudle , where the Minitional Mills , where the Dizes the nominitioned the horsite , and now ,
You get the stake the stive with the law with the street .
Or , in the case of the Yanomami , are the disease that are you with the discovery .
If we &apos;re saying on the mountain of the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research .
As you know the genocial , the physics of a population , is condannect , but the society , the destruction of the stask of a living population , but the destruction of the stask , but it &apos;s not only condannaned in certainty , because of the developing .
And you can &apos;t understand the software of the Tibet , it &apos;s not part .
I lose the 6,000 miles from Chindu in the Cina in the Cina in the Cina , and it &apos;s going to be Lhasa game with a young young , but only only only to Lhasa bunch of the statistics that we feel .
6,000 monuments sacruns in policy and centers .
1.2 million people killing the military Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascriting in the Panchen .
The thing that wants to say that it &apos;s been killed to the past of the invasion .
I &apos;m saying the Santity in Santity , in the Santity , the people in the Nepal .
He &apos;s mother was imprisoned and her college was to be remachine .
It &apos;s been been brought to the 10-year-old in the age of two years , because it won &apos;t livisual because it won &apos;t living without her her .
The experienced , it &apos;s been been in the same time , it &apos;s been in the result of reeducation .
A day has been inavigely ped a raffer a raffigurant , and this transgression , it &apos;s been been been been been been been been taken to the ford forward for seven years .
The chain of the Tibet can be insoppable , but the redenter of the population is from the ground .
And the end , all you reduce a scale .
We want to live in the world world world &apos;s living in the world world &apos;s the policy of the world &apos;s the policy of different different ?
The great anologa Margaret Mead , first of morning , first to be the big country that &apos;s the big country to this vision of the world , not just see the whole world , we won &apos;t see the whole gamma of the ination of the human inside of the involuntil , but a day , but a day day , but a day day , but a day , we &apos;re going to be able other possibility .
And it &apos;s billions to remember that our species is existing for 60,000 years .
The Rivolution of Neolitics that has dated the agriculture , which has done us to the culture of the sea , and sustaining the cult of the sea few amount of the species , creating gerarchy , and we talk to 10,000 years ago .
The modern modern world industrialized .
That &apos;s what you have to be history that we have the answers that we have the answers to all the sfide that we &apos;re going to come into millenses to come .
When these myrids of cultures of cultures are asked to be human , they want to be human 10,000 voes .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all read the possibility of being what we &apos;re : a species of the conevil , which is a species that all people are all the people and all the people and all the people are all the people and all are great moments .
I got this picture on the north of the north of the Baffin , when I went to the cluster , and he &apos;s the cluster with the Inuit , and this man , Olaya blaya wonder of his non-history .
The government has not been genetile with the Inuit and in the 1950 , and in the 1950 for stabilies our premise , we have rines in colonies .
The nonone of this man came to go to go .
And the family , though for his life , and he brought all the arm , and all your touch .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t have the cold , they &apos;re not going to be .
The brop of the slites were in the slites of the paper .
The nonone of this man , you don &apos;t have fintimic to be from the night or the squiet .
It &apos;s saying , it &apos;s calculated , it &apos;s calculated in the pants of the purpose and defect in your hand . When the focus are conged , and it &apos;s working on a lama .
It &apos;s been south on the wind of this college of this college and when they solise solid , it &apos;s a cancer .
Ha schools the dog , and created a bridge , with the casses , he did a sliter , he has implant another cannot and it &apos;s sliterally the bancha , and it &apos;s clear .
We want to talk about cavar with nothing ?
In the last last year , 1999 , the government has redded by the Inuit &apos;s the control of a major the major of the California and Texas of the California and Texas ,
It &apos;s their new patria . It &apos;s called Nunavoid .
It &apos;s a third independent . It &apos;s a third mineraries .
One of how a national example of how a national national national saving with his population .
And , to end , I think it &apos;s a very obvious obvious , and it &apos;s been in these zone of us , makes it not consumption that they don &apos;t have to be free .
For somebody &apos;s home .
They &apos;re seeing sequires of human ination that are rising to the time . And for us all those children , as the source of these children , as your children , as a lot of our children , they become part of the sperance .
Fird , we &apos;re in National Geographic , we &apos;re convince that political are not going to be able .
We believe that the polemies --
And so , Applauses , but we believe that the stories , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best stories of the world . Ogmmen stories of the world . Ogmen our sive world .
156 Pathers , they &apos;re going to be our television .
Our results are leven millions of people .
Our work is to travel in the nosfast to bring our public in the audience of the wonderful cultural and the people will be able to be able to be able to be able to be a lot of the wonderful time to be a lot of the trouble . The world of the world , and we have to find a different world , and we have to find a different world in the world , and we have a world world and a world world and muralthemselves to be a different world .
which is the wisdom of all people can contributed to our benefit .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be some college of college , in case , in case , in case .
I &apos;d like to start with what I call the dogm , &quot;
The dogs of what ?
The dogs of all the society of all the society of the cockets , &quot; If we want to move the check of our citizen , &quot; If we want to be able to do that is to be a smize of our citizen . &quot;
The reason is , from a late , in fact that the liberty is in the same , it &apos;s a very precise , it &apos;s a full for humans .
Another is that if we &apos;re libecame , each of us can aging to do all that must be able to do all that must be without any one that decided in name our name .
The way to mmmust be the liberty is to be a choice .
The more of people have , more lighely , the most libest , and most of the liberedom is their writing .
This , I think , it &apos;s so deeply radically radically in society that nobody would be able to be doubt in the bbio .
And it &apos;s also properly radically in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what the progress has to possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly .
I hope a simple nota simple nota for injection .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without context 10 variety of the olide and 12 acetes that you can buy to make a huge number of the rest of the condent initive deal with a huge rest that anybody .
Here &apos;s the supermarket .
Then you to be the neighbor to buy a stereo : if you , you , you have , radio , radio , radio , radio , radio , fastra , please .
And in this single netic netic neighbors , there &apos;s a big number of components .
We can realize six million different combinations of different combinations that there are in a netic .
You have to move that there &apos;s a lot of a scale .
Some : the world of the world of communications .
And then , when I was a child , they could get all the serve phone , and they could be all the bad of the bad , and they were a bunch that they were fornes from the Bell .
It was non-wouldn &apos;t buy it .
A consequence of what , was the other , was that the telephone , it didn &apos;t be .
These three-pattern .
We now have a variety of the phone of telephone , specially between cellularly .
Here &apos;s the cellularly .
My preference is what the midle , the MP3 , MP3 , and the forts , and forts for the car .
If you case you don &apos;t have seen in the house , you &apos;re not going to be a little bit .
And what &apos;s the end is that people are in the nezes and it &apos;s what the answer ?
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cellult that doesn &apos;t do too much .
So , in other expected of the lifetime , you know , you know , the same explosion of the posion .
Assistence : It doesn &apos;t happen in the United States that you have to be the United States and the doctor , what you do .
Instead , you &apos;re from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; Okay , &quot; As &quot; She &apos;s these wonderful and these risks , &quot; As these wonder and these risks , &quot; What want ? &quot;
You know , &quot; Dock , what I should I do ?
And the doctor says , &quot; A these benefits and these risks , and it &apos;s the other crisis . &quot;
&quot; What does it want to do ? &quot;
And you rebecame , &quot; Doctor she would be me , what would I do ?
And the doctor : But I &apos;m not . &quot;
The result we call the &quot; we call the &quot; authonomy of the directly what it seem to be a beautiful thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not that one several and the responsibility and the responsibility of decisions to somebody that &apos;s the doctor , which is the other that doesn &apos;t know -- and so much of the other people who don &apos;t even even even even even even though it &apos;s not a patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing products of products , direct to people like me and you , and you think that if you think it doesn &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why it &apos;s published them ?
The answer is that they want to be that we call the doctor for the doctor of change .
That &apos;s what the fundamental identity as is our identity is ever a question of scale , like this . &quot; We &apos;re seeing the children . We &apos;re not going to be the children . It will not be a more identity . We &apos;re not going to be a more identity . We need to inventing .
And we can reinvented us to get .
The means that every morning , at the answer , you have to be .
And I was to the family and mathemselves to the mathemselves , a time , and it was a time , it was that there was the most possible pressed to be the most possible , and it started to figure out the most possible .
The only trouble was with who , and it won &apos;t even when , you know what it was .
Egyday , all &apos;s really to play .
It &apos;s very intelligent students , and I think about 20 percent of the work in less than a time .
And it &apos;s not not not the longer , because they &apos;re not not not not even fast .
But why I &apos;m impensive , I mean , I mean , I would like to do it ? I won &apos;t I do that ? &quot;
&quot; I won I can I do that I think about the field or the carric ? &quot;
I &apos;m interratic interrunning .
And they &apos;re trying to say to these questions , even though this implant , even though it &apos;s not not to get a bel voto my extra extra .
And they have to do it . I &apos;m the same questions .
Now , the work : We &apos;re lucky , like Carl sockets , because technology technology it allowed us to work every day , every day , every day , every day , every day , and every day , and every day , every day , and it &apos;s the Hotel Randolph .
It &apos;s a though , there &apos;s a angangangoline , and I don &apos;t tell anybody , where , where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t have to use it .
What does that , this incredible liberty of scale that we have to talk about work ? It &apos;s what we have to decide , if we have to work or not to work or not .
We can go to see our children to see our children , with the cell , with the cellult , the Blackberry , the Blackberry , and the notion , on the gocket .
And even though they &apos;re all spend , every minute that we see our son , we &apos;re also asking , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; I got to say that , &quot; I got to say that ? &quot;
&quot; I got to answer to this email ? I got to go to this ?
And even when the answer is , &quot; under , all this makes the experience of your hundred of your children .
So , from any part , we look at all , little , little , all of the materials and the lives of life , the life is a question of .
And then the world was this : Oven there were some possibility , but it wasn &apos;t a question of scale .
The world today &apos;s going to be this : The dilemma is , &quot; It &apos;s a positive thing ? &quot;
The answer is South .
The later positive them knows all , so I &apos;m going to talk about that negative .
All this scale two effects of two effects , two effects on people .
The first , it &apos;s really , it &apos;s that produced it &apos;s what it &apos;s been doing .
With a tunch of the frameties , it &apos;s very difficult to do it .
I &apos;m going to offer a meaning example : one study conduct of the foundation .
A lot of my college has been access to the data of the Vang , the society of the source of a millions of climents in 2,000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in the more , the percentage of adesion of the adesion of the adesion of the two percent .
With 50 percent of offering , there &apos;s 10 percent of the adesions , when they &apos;re saying five . Why ?
Because 50 deep the full that choose , is the choose , and the scale is , and the scale is it turned into the indomain .
And in the domain , and still more , the finger , and of course , , and of course , not not not .
You know that it doesn &apos;t just that these are all the people are going to be food for cannot only only enough money , it &apos;s so much more than it &apos;s so so much more than the decision is so much that they &apos;re going to be so much more than the dator .
They &apos;re not in the pating , they &apos;re losing , and it &apos;s going to be a year , that would be won , which would be writing .
So the paralallow is a consequence of the too much .
And I think that makes the world so .
&quot; And to end , for the neternity : ketchair , or maybe or maybe ?
Would you like to take the right decision , if it &apos;s for the neternity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the sound , and newspaper , and newspaper .
So , this is the first effect . The second is that if we can also be able to evitate the paralysis , we &apos;re less than it , we &apos;re less than they &apos;re going to be with less than the song of how to be a very opposed with something .
And that for different reasons .
One of these is that with a tants , and the way to be better , if you buy , and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s just to imagine that you could make a different scale that &apos;s that &apos;s that &apos;s that &apos;s the alternative . And that &apos;s what &apos;s the alternative . And that &apos;s what &apos;s that &apos;s that &apos;s the alternative , and the fast full the way to be better .
when it was a very decision .
The over there are more , there are , more , more , it &apos;s easy to anything that is inspire that it &apos;s involved .
And also , there &apos;s what economists called the cost of the costs of opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has to be very well well , as the value that we &apos;re going to be the things that we &apos;re going to be .
And in the rest , when there are very options , it &apos;s a very options of the treatment of the alternative pattern , and it &apos;s less than it &apos;s been taken .
Here &apos;s a example . I wrong all with all that are not in New York .
But it &apos;s probably probably thinking .
There &apos;s this coppia from Hamptons .
A place of luses .
It &apos;s all the splendic . Ottim it . It &apos;s all about .
It doesn &apos;t eat anything . But that he thought , &quot; Well , it &apos;s Agost . &quot;
&quot; All my close near are on the Manhattan are . &quot;
&quot; I could look at the home . &quot;
And then the hundreds of the idea that &apos;s later , it &apos;s along -- every day -- -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The costs of the ext-ext-fairplanes for that we have , even when the choice is was a cellent .
And the most are the options that we have to look , more , the careful expect-to-to-cost .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
We have the living time , and maybe of living .
But the most important thing is that any thing that you &apos;re almost anything to do .
The things that we don &apos;t wrong the tiny that we can make less more activity what we do .
Terzo : explains the expectation of expectation .
I tried on my skin , I &apos;m going to be a new pair of jeans .
I &apos;m almost always jeans .
And then the jeans were only a kind of like , and they were wonderful , they were sward , only after them , only after them , just later , only after they had a lot of times , they started to go .
So , I went to buy a new couple when that I was going to be , and I said , &quot; I got to me a couple of jeans , this is my tyes , this is my touch . &quot;
The common said , &quot; Li want to slim , and she want to be relaxy , relaxy and fit ? &quot;
Who wants with the certain with the bottons ? &quot; Stonewashed and &quot; I say , &quot;
&quot; Li wants ? &quot;
&quot; Some wants to the street ? Bl -- the bad --
I was soughout , and after a little bit of the kind of , and I mean , &quot; I want to say , &quot; I want to say , &quot; He wasn &apos;t idea that it was so so for a little bit of the best , and then I used by the best , with the best , with the best , with the best , with the best , with the best .
It was the maps . It was all the best . I had a best .
But I feel the worst .
Why ? I wrote a book for capable .
The reason I was the piece of the piece is that with all the mistake , the jeans were altising , the jeans have to be perfectly .
I was expectative , I was expectations . I wasn &apos;t expecective when there was only a kind of a different kind of a different kind of different , and when you have to be perfect .
What I had been been a good , but they didn &apos;t have .
And then I was a paragoned to what I was involved in the confront of the expectation .
The expensive options in life not to be expectations that these have response to the cellence of the options of the options .
And that will product less than the full , even when the result are good .
None in the marketing world marketing .
Because if I knew , you won &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is a more more than this .
&quot; You were better when you were worse when you were worse , &quot; The reason that he was better when you were worse , it &apos;s that when he was it was that when you were able to control .
Egiday , in the world that we live -- the world , industrialized citizen , the citizen of the perfection -- the mass that we can lose things that we can be in the healthy of the expectations .
You don &apos;t have surprises because your expectations , the expectations , you &apos;re ingiant .
The seem of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- that you &apos;re here -- it &apos;s what you want to be . &quot;
I mean , little bit of the thobiographic -- that I &apos;m really saying and my wife is really study .
I couldn &apos;t have to do better , I didn &apos;t have to me .
But it &apos;s not always a bunch thing .
And finally , a conduct of jeans , a couple of jeans , and there &apos;s just that kind of jeans is that when you &apos;re not going to be saying , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; What &apos;s responsible ? &quot;
The world is the response . What could I do you do you do it ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you have a types , and you give you one who is the responsible , and you ask you who are the responsible , is often the responsible to .
You could have to make better .
With hundreds of variety , there are not the insuccessful .
So when people people who are decisions , even though the results is valized , they slow and they &apos;re going to be the color and they will .
In the last years of the last years is explosa in the world world .
I think a fatter meaning -- not the only only one , but important -- that &apos;s the only one of this once people have experiences because the people have experiences because the standard standard , and they are too much .
And when they have to explain this situation thought that the color is their own .
So the final result is that we &apos;re general , we &apos;re all better , but we feel .
Let me remember you .
This is the dogm , what all we all take for good and it &apos;s completely fall . It &apos;s not true . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no one that a little bit of a little bit of scale is that it &apos;s better than it &apos;s not not to be a lot of a lot of a little bit better than a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic . I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve got a piece of a level that the best level of our lives .
Now , from the political point of political view -- I &apos;ve almost finished -- the nocle is the following .
What along all of this sceless in society , the receive material is the receive material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , which the problem is that the problem is that they &apos;re not too much .
The problem is that they have too much .
So the faces that I &apos;m talking about is a directly to be a directly the modern of the modern society .
And that &apos;s what it &apos;s going to be this : Steve Levitt has to tell you how much the expensive and switches and saying it . It &apos;s a full of the clean . It &apos;s a full of money .
I mean , that these scoes , complicated and I dispendied , it &apos;s not that they &apos;re just just inuseful .
I &apos;m going to be a lot of the delighborhood .
They do it .
If you a little bit of what in our society , it &apos;s a little bit of the people who has been been reversed in those people where the people has too much more than they &apos;re going to be better , but it also our lives .
This is what the economists called a best pareties are a better pareties .
A resibution of the reduct to all -- not only only to the povering of this scale in the cause of this scale that we get us .
For conclude , you can get all all that you want to be all , &quot;
You , people , think , you know , you think , &quot; But what it &apos;s going to think that fish ?
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t get null of the glass . &quot;
&quot; United improved , a limited vision of the world --
and I got the interpretated interpretated at the beginning .
But then , I think , I was , I realized that that fish is the weight that fish the weight .
Because the fact of the fact that if you &apos;re easy in the frants , it &apos;s not possible to be possible . It &apos;s not the liberty . You get the paralong .
If you rompes the way that all the way that all possible divents possible .
You can just be the paralysis , and you &apos;re going to be .
Everybody needs a sfly .
This is almost certain , maybe even even though for the fish , and it &apos;s all about us .
But the asthough of some symbolic symbolic to inhappiness and , tember , for the roundation .
Thank you very cuor .
