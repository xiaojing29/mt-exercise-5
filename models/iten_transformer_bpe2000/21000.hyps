The year I showed these slidemonstrate glacial glacial glacial glacial , which for almost three million years , has had the size of the 40 percent .
However this is the gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show it in the ice of the ice .
The arten tyal climate is , in a certain sense , the pull of the global climate system .
You &apos;re going to winter and reversing ritive exped .
The next slide slide is going to be a remarkable read of the last 25 years .
The ice draw are drawing are signed in red .
As you see , they expand until the wall .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter , which is the glasses .
You can see that the ice ice ice , I &apos;m going to be drawn , of five years , it &apos;s like the blood , which is the blood of the body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s gone out of this .
This is a problem because the interested in the arten , the ground of the artage of the artage of the artic carbon congent that , sciousness , and they &apos;re moving , and they &apos;re moving into the microbes .
I &apos;m standing to the totality of the atmospheric inquitation , that amount could radical , that amount could radical , surgery this point of not .
In some laghi little little deep laghes in Alaska , the metan is already rebolling out of the water .
The professorse Katey Walter University of Alaska is a team in a team in a team laptop .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : She &apos;s good . The question is if we &apos;re going to be .
A reason is that this term scchange the Greenland from the north .
This is a little glacial figures .
The brought didn &apos;t reach livels .
This is the Kangerlush , in the South West , in the South of Greenland .
If you want to know how the sal level of the sea level of the ice of the ice of the ice on the terrain here , it &apos;s where you get the sea .
These rents are are increasing rapidly .
At the other part of the planet : Antarcyblock of ice ice ice ice the planet .
The month is the scientists have diclosed that the ice of the ice is in the negative , and the Edarctica , and that the Eartide , which pogs on some islands , which is particularly the slide .
Equival six feet of the acifies , like in Greenland .
Sull Himalaya , the third largest block , you know , they see new laghot laghes , who was glackage .
40 percent of the world population is going to be able to be able to be able to the stage .
Sulle Ande : this ice ice is the source of the water power of this city .
The carcarcartoon is increased .
But when you diminishes , the same water .
In California , the neve Nevada is diminuity of 40 percent .
The background are in the crisis .
The predictions , as you &apos;ve read , are favorable .
The growing growing safety in the world &apos;s door to a remarkable increase .
The environmental disasters are increasing to a rhythm and without precedented .
Four times more numerous in the last 30 years , the last 30 years of precedent 75 .
This is a whole sustainable to sustainable .
If you look at it in the historical context if they can see the consequences .
In the last five years we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of tons in the oceans every day .
Look at the area of the Eastern Pacific Pacific , to the American , and on the West , and on the Indian , where there &apos;s a radical impoverments of the obsible in the oceans .
Most of global warming , with global warming , with the deforestation , which is the use of fossil of fossil .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with more emissions , together at China .
And he was proponed to build a lot of other central central central central .
But we &apos;re seassisting to a change .
These are the annarrow in the last few years and some of the alternative verge .
At every way , there &apos;s a political lotta in our country .
The carbon industries and oil are spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon , which is a host , which is a host .
That picture me remember something --
Natal , in Natal Tennessee , there was a perfit of 3.8 billion sleters of paper scories .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen this on the news .
This is the second largest flow of scories in America .
It happened to Natal .
The published public public public industries was this .
Go : The carbon , the carbon is a kind of happy and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it grows our economy .
Fross the carbon is always more pulized .
It &apos;s good predable , adorable and the work .
Al Gore : From here is a big part of the West Virginia .
The largest society in the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his friend .
Video : Don Blankenship : Sarry , Nancy Pelosis , Nancy Pelosis , Harry Reid -- not know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Protection of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is one of them , a part .
Video : Ator : At the COALergy see the climate change as a minute serious serious as a serious series of our business .
So , our priority is invest a big amount of money in a hundred of money in a public straight to the public and confused the truth .
In fact , the carbon isn &apos;t sports .
We think it &apos;s clean -- it &apos;s also a good profumo .
So not preocupon climate change .
Let me do .
Video : Ator : Ator .
So let &apos;s take a game in a structure in a structure in a basic basic basic basic .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little bit , but this is the sound of the car technology of basic technology .
The carbon of carbon is between the cause cause of global warming , but the night of the cause of clean carbon , but the needed technology that you see changes all .
You have a look at : this is the odierged technology of the basic clean .
Al Gore : Inally , the positive alternative , you know , the national issues to the national issue .
Video : Comment America is in the crisis ; the national economy , national crisis .
The phils that the colleages : our dependence from fossils , as the sports and the oil and oil .
Now , it &apos;s a new , audace solution for it .
Repower America : 100 percent of the full full years .
A plan to repect America to make more sure , and help to stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that &apos;s solution to solve our problems .
Repower America . Soots of more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Comment : It &apos;s about reducing energy to America .
One of the fastest ways to get the dependence of the dependence of the combustible that they killed our planet .
Comparse : The future is here . I &apos;m wind , a new energy network .
Sometimes two : Noves investment for places of the retributes .
Comments : I mean , it &apos;s time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A proverbial proverbial , they say , &quot; If you want to go to the focus .
If you want to go away , you go together . &quot;
We have to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
The year at TED I did a feck in the LHC .
And I promise to go back to the back to the car you about how the car works .
So , here is . And for those people who didn &apos;t have , the LHC is is the largest experiment , the largest experiment , ever tented -- 27 kilometers of circle .
Her compiece is to required the conditions that were less than a billion second from the universe -- under 600 million times a second time .
And that &apos;s just environment .
This is the car in Ginevening .
We &apos;re going to picking these mini-Bang Bang in inside the reevators .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- it &apos;s called ATLAS -- it &apos;s 44 feet .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in buildings so you can see the proportions .
The 10 section of the last year we have access to the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was causing of immense festea in the room of control .
It &apos;s an image of the first particle phases that he had all the LHC , in collision , in collision , with a part of the LHC , and diffon-literally in the resevent .
In other words , when we see that picture that picture , we see that the car worked , the machine worked , which is a big writing .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to do more or that , when somebody went on Google and videal with that the page was this .
That means we &apos;ve had a cultural impact to that scientific impact .
And I mean a week later , there was a problem with the car , I had to these phils here -- these dored dored .
These are 13,000 lampers when the car works at the massive works at the massive power .
Now , the technical technical of you are going to look at the phils and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . &quot;
And instead they can do it because when they &apos;re very cold .
So , at less 271 degrees , at a temperature to that the space of the space , these phils can bring that run .
In one of the younger of the novemila in the LHC , there was a difect of fabric .
So the phils , they &apos;re going to read , and the 13,000 ampits of frightening to instrike a resistance resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think these magnetes are more than 20 tons , and that &apos;s moved about 30 feet of about 30 feet .
They &apos;re damaged about 50 magnetes .
We had to have to take them , what we did .
We returned them and traveled them .
Now they &apos;re going to go back to their submitted to their submit .
the end of the marzo the LHC is will be again .
We &apos;re going to happen , and we &apos;re waiting data or light , and we &apos;re going to happen to be able to discover what the morning is the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents reaccing the debate on the value of science and engineering . It &apos;s easy to be .
I think that &apos;s so hard , it &apos;s so hard , the fact that I think is the value of things like LHC .
I would like to end with the words of a Inglese scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , imagine , in the defense , in the defense , his pulety , his pulicle &apos;s bleb , he said , &quot; Nothing is so dangerous for the rest of the human mind that &apos;s ideas of the mind that the ideas of science that ideas of science that ideas of the mind that the ideas of our means ,
Thank you .
I want to start asking the people to rethink about when , from children , playing , you please clear .
As you figure out how to reach them and deal , take them and get them and moving them , learned to actually think and solve problems and solve problems and manipulating relationship .
The space is deeply connected to the way we understand how we understand the world we understand .
So , from the inspired information from using physical objects , together at my consultor , together at my consultor Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to ask me , &quot; And if we use a computer , and if we &apos;re going to ask me , &quot; And if we &apos;re a computer , we can have the gital computer , we could just digital , we could have the further up with the information ,
and systemate it to our piacement ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , and built the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a great computer interactive computer .
In a few words , a Siftable is a great computer interactive computer .
You can move them with the hand , they can see , &quot; among them , feel their movement and they have a wireless and a radio and a radio .
But above , I &apos;m physical objects , like the morning , you can just move them .
The Sift-full example of a new ecosystems to manippulate the digital information .
And as they become more physical , consciousness of the other , of the other people , and as we get more physical , of the other people , as we move them , of other people , as we can explore new and the fun .
I &apos;m going to start with a simple example .
This Sift-configured to show you the video : if you incline in a direction , it will rotate it so , if you cline from the other hand back .
These are interactive regions are consciously consciousness .
If I &apos;m dealing them , they &apos;re interested in .
If they come circle , they see it and they can get a little bit .
If they come circle , they see it and they can get a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
And then we realized that one of the interesting interesting implications of the interaction was the power to use communities , &quot; to &quot; a color as if it &apos;s a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable , as a century of versing and I can use them to grew the color in that central , where they missed .
And I can use them to grew them to grew color in the central , where you measure .
If we &apos;re going to be too , we can put a little place .
I &apos;m also beautiful possibility of learning , as the languages , the math and games of logic , where people can try the people can try the fast and see the results of the results of immediately .
Now , I &apos;m going to be --
This is a sequence of Fibonacross I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a game of words that is in the middle and Bobs .
Pratically , every turn to every Sift-letter , in the Sift-standing , in every Sift-ratically , every switch in the case of every Sift-standing , and while certain party .
Then , after about 30 seconds remischiate , and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
And here &apos;s the kids came in the Media Lab , I did so that I &apos;ve done them and turned out a video .
They &apos;re very very , very , very , very , very ,
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people many education .
You &apos;ve just got to say , &quot; Compons of words , and they &apos;re exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s what other people who try it .
This is our younger test , there &apos;s a little bit of there .
It actually actually wanted to impivoices .
They were only in the morning , for him .
Now , this is an application of an interactive carton .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of languages .
It can start to create new characters in the scene , by the Siftable .
It can start to create new characters in the scene , by the Siftable .
So , it &apos;s going to be the sun .
Video : The sun is source .
David Merrill : Now he brought a treatment in the scene .
Video : The arancient .
Basically work ! Yeah !
So schooling the Siftable and put them closer to be able to interact the person---
Video : Bau !
And by inventing your story .
Video : Ciao !
DM : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide him as you spend him as you spend .
DM : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide him as you spend him as you spend .
Video : Volice , it &apos;s just .
DM : The last example I &apos;ve time to show you is a tool , realized of recently , to waiting and exeguys .
It &apos;s a recently , realized by recently , to waiting and exeguys .
Siftable here are agged from sounds like base , and the bacteria .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose what use .
You can also start to become these sounds in a sequence of comport to your piacement .
And modify it just to touch a &quot; and a sequence . &quot;
These are actually you can control from the vive , as the reverse and the filter .
The acks in a particular sound and then clines to get to the ground .
And then there are the general effects as time and volume , that they are applying to the interest sequence .
We look at how it works .
Video : We &apos;re going to start in a base in two Siftable , &quot; sequence , &quot; we &apos;re going to be able to a series , we add , we add it , we add the other base .
Now I &apos;m going to put a basis .
Video : Now , I add the percussions --
Video : And now I &apos;m going to put the bacteria , so I can control the bacteria .
Video : I can speed the whole sequence of the whole sequence of the whole sequence of time from one side or another .
Video : And I &apos;m going to add the bottom to get the basis to get more expression .
Video : I can realize the sequence . &quot;
So I wouldn &apos;t have to be planning it , but I can try to do it , it &apos;s going to be a longer .
And now , finally , I can smoke the whole sequence of the Siftable to the left Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is built new man &apos;s interfaces of the machine , and more like our brain and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of this percorse , and also some possibilities that we &apos;re trying to get out of the lab .
The concept that I want to transmate is that I &apos;m going to get this new generation of designed to interact with digital media , that will bring information in our world we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time to talk to all of you .
I &apos;m a writer .
The books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also the love and the fass of my life .
And I don &apos;t look like that it can change .
But , said this , something particular happened to recently in my life and in my career , who bring me to the whole whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is I &apos;ve recently written this book , this biography called &quot; Mang , &quot; which , fun , fun , and I said , &quot; but I &apos;m saying , for some reason I &apos;ve got to get a big , a few reason , besides , besides , besides .
And the result is that everywhere in the time , people treating me as if I were condances .
It &apos;s condanned , condanned , condanned !
They &apos;re going to be very worried and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t fear to do better ?
You don &apos;t fear to continue to check for all of life without being able to be able to create a book that can care ? &quot;
What can you care to somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s rassuring , you know .
But I could go worse , I remember that I remember more than 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a written .
I met the same incontrol the same reaction .
And people said , &quot; I don &apos;t themes to be able to get successful ?
You don &apos;t fear that the humiliation of the refection ?
You don &apos;t fear of this mestimating for all of life without the living in the cumule of all the infrants with the mouth of all with the bank with the mouth of care ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the answer to all of these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yeah , I have a few things .
I &apos;ve always had a couple .
And I also have a lot of other things that people don &apos;t have to inate .
As the algae and other things are spaventer .
But , as much as I think about what I thought and I was wonderful and I &apos;m wonderful , because ?
Isn it rational ?
It &apos;s logic that anyone who have to be spavented by a job that you feel like to do .
But what is this particular in the empty in creative creative to make us nervous health is to the mental health of mental health ?
And as my father , for example , he was a chemist engineer and I don &apos;t remember one time in its 40 years of activity in which he was asked him to be engineer ?
There was never -- that &apos;s the block of the engineer John , how do it ?
Not worked , you know , you know , ?
Onestly , chemicals are not certainly in , in the centuries , in the centuries , the reputation of being alcolized manized maniputation .
We have this reputation , we have this reputation , and not only creative , but creative of every gender , we have this reputation of being enormously instabsolutation .
And it doesn &apos;t rest to the other people who are the dead of the magnificent of the magnificent ments that only in the 21st century , they died young people , they died young people died .
And even those who are suicidated to be actually sure from their dons .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , &quot; Every book , I &apos;ve killed me a little more than &quot; a little bit of the work of the work of your life .
But we don &apos;t bad when we heard it because we &apos;ve heard these things so long that we &apos;ve got completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and the suffering and suffering are in some way , and it &apos;s going to be in some way , and it &apos;s going to be in a walking .
And the question I want to take all of the today is : are you agree with this idea ?
I &apos;m going to want to be able to be this thing -- because it &apos;s looking at me not good for anything that &apos;s going to be able for anything .
I think it &apos;s odiosa .
And I think it &apos;s also periculous and I don &apos;t want to see the perpetuate it in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our big ground towers in creative ,
And I know that , in my case -- in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start figing out the surface of the surroundation that I &apos;m in my career .
That &apos;s a lot of young , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;ve about 40 years .
I still have about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything wrong in the world , then it will be judge from the world as the work that I &apos;ve spaventous successful .
I &apos;m slickly , because we &apos;re all the time , I &apos;m likely that my largest success is to my bigger .
Oh , Gesus , who think !
You know this is the kind of thought that bringing a person to start besides in the country and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would stop to keep this work that we &apos;re going to do this work that we &apos;re going to do this work that we &apos;re going to do this work that we &apos;re going to stop to to do this work that we &apos;re going to do this work that we &apos;re going to do this work that we &apos;re going to do this work that we &apos;re going to keep in this work that we &apos;re going to keep doing this work that we &apos;re going to do this work that work that we &apos;re going to do this work that work that we &apos;re going to do this work that we &apos;re going to keep .
So , the question is , how do it ?
And so it seems to me , after a lot of reflection , which is to be to create a psychological costruck , okay ?
I have to find a safety of safety between me , who I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxiety on what reaction is going to get back and , as I was looking for all the year , and I was looking at through time , trying to start through time , trying to find other societies to see if they could have the better ideas and more sane and more sane .
how to help people to create creative people to refends the emotional inerents of creativity .
And that research to me to the ancient Green and ancient Rome .
Exectively because I gave me in a circle and then back .
In the ancient Grex and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity to the human beings , OK ?
And they thought the creativity was this spirit of divine and sell men and sell men from a few slights and known , for distant reasons and health .
The greatly called these divines of the creativity of creativity .
Socrate , wonderful , creded to have a demone that elar wisdom wwisdom from the far .
The Romans were the same idea , but they called the same idea of spirit , but they call the genius .
which is great , because the Romans didn &apos;t think that a genius was really smart .
They have a genius was this kind of entity divine that has created literally lived in the walls of a artist , a little bit like Dobby , and that was in the Dobby , and that was going to be born to hood and moon the work of the artist and moon the work of the artist and moon that work .
Here &apos;s eye -- here is , that &apos;s the distance of which I talk -- that psychological costruck that you have the result of your work .
And they all know that he worked , right ?
So the anticient artists were protected by certain things , like , for example , not ?
If your work was exciting was exciting , you couldn &apos;t get all of the market , everybody knew that helped by this incorporation .
If your work , if your fallies , it wasn &apos;t all college , right ?
Everyone key that was your genius to be an incapable .
And so people are concept to create creativity in the West for a long time .
And then Renasent came and all changed , and all changed , and nac5 this great idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe and more and leaving to the creatures and more to leave to the creatures that are written by the divinced .
This was the principle of the rational humanity and people started thinking that creativity was completely from the ishared .
And for the first time in history , you started to refer to this or the artist as a genius as a rather than a person with the genius .
And I have to say , I think it was a big herror .
I think that allow somebody , a simple person to believe that a regipient of the source , the essence and the source of all of the divines , creative , unknown , and inknown to the psize of a big philable to the fragile to the psize of human .
It &apos;s like to ask somebody to get the sun .
Deform and completely the ego and creates all of these ingestimated expectations on the performance .
And I think it was this pression to have destroyed the artists in the past 500 years .
And if that &apos;s true , and I think it &apos;s , and I think it &apos;s the question is , and now ?
Can we do it very different ?
Maybe you get back to a more ancient comprehense of the relationship between human and mystery .
or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t song to sing 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience that solleverage of scientific nices on the notion of the notion of the noticing people , and they &apos;re going to be able to be a lot of the things .
I &apos;m probably not convince you all about this .
But the question I would like to ask is -- because not ?
Why don &apos;t I think that way ?
Because it &apos;s more sense of all the other thing that I &apos;ve ever heard for the exaspering of the indicbility of creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever ever ever attempt to do something -- so , it &apos;s basically , everybody here -- knows , you don &apos;t get rationally .
And in fact , it can be a very paranormal .
I &apos;ve done this met recently meet with the extraordinary poetary poeted . It &apos;s now 90 years , but that was a poetic for all life and said that she lived in his rural Virginia , it worked in the fields , and he felt it , in the wind , and he felt it , in if a few extricky the landscape .
He said that he was like a fragorous game .
And that was coming back to her drive to her landscape .
And he felt that he was going to be under the earth under the ground of his feet .
He knew to have a solar thing to that point and it was , words , &quot; run as a matters . &quot;
And so it &apos;s going to be able to come to the poem , and it wouldn &apos;t have to have to get a piece of card and a fast faster , and a fast faster , and it &apos;s fast , and it &apos;s faster , and he would be further , and it &apos;s going to get it on the page .
Sometimes not could be faster , so it &apos;s going to be able to get back and correct and correct the home and the poem and the poem and the loss the landscape and it would continued to rolate through the landscape , as he said , &quot; other poet . &quot;
And then there were sometimes -- this piece I &apos;m never going to size it -- there were the moments that was almost dying , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was walking for the card and the poem through , and he was walking a city in the walk , and he said , that he was going to be gathered with the other hand the hand the hackage .
He was going to cut the poem of the coil and he put the basic and the transformer on the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page and intackle , but the last word to the first word .
So when I heard it -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly the same .
Not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conducture .
I &apos;m a mouse , and my way to work is ; I &apos;m wake , and I &apos;m wake up to the same horary every day and go out .
But even I , in my test , I &apos;ve been test in my test , I &apos;ve strised against that thing , sometimes .
And I think many of you have a lot of you .
You know , even if the work and the ideas to be gone from a certain fundamental source , I could not be able to know it .
And what is this ?
And how can we relationship us to do not make the head , but rather , rather , rather , that make us sure it ?
For how much about , the best example , the best example I have is the musician musician , which I &apos;ve been interviewed for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of the life was the incarnation of the artist &apos;s the incarnation of the artist , to try to control , to try to control these species of impulses .
But then he invected , he was walked , and one day as he was driving on a &quot; authrow , changed everything for him .
He was going to be faster and all of a sent witch of melodia , which is wonderful , and it &apos;s high , elusive and hall-head , and the hall-head , and the wonderful , and the desidery , and the desidery , but not known as to take it .
It doesn &apos;t have a piece of card , it doesn &apos;t have a climate .
So he starts to hear this kind of old anxiety , &quot; I &apos;m going to spend , and I &apos;m sure to lose , and I &apos;m sure obsessed by this characters .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to go in the panic , he stopped .
And he was going to be the mental whole process and made something new .
And I &apos;m just going to look at the sky and said , &quot; Scause , I &apos;m not seeing ? &quot;
&quot; You know , it seems to write a song right now ?
If you really want to be able to be a more than when I can get care of care .
She &apos;s going to care that you can get to important to something else today .
You &apos;re going to be Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his process of work , he changed after this .
Not work , the work was still hoscure as always .
But the process , and the anxy , and the weighing it was redded when the genius , the genius who had no other problems and libered it back to the back of where it was coming back to where it came out , realized that it didn &apos;t have to be a interiorized , and it was realized .
but it was wonderful , wonderful , wonderful , a conversation between Tom and this external thing that it wasn &apos;t Tom .
So how much I felt that story started to change a little bit of the way I was worked and I &apos;d already saved me .
This idea , he saved when I was writing , &quot; Mang , and Prega , Ama , &quot; and drop in one of those disperation that we &apos;re all working on something and we &apos;re going to start thinking that we &apos;re going to be a disaster , which is going to be the worst book or never written .
Not only , the worst book , right ?
And I started thinking about to think about this project .
But then I remember Tom who talked to the air and I tried to the air and try .
So I went to my face in the hoscritish and I diressed my handle in the corner of the room .
And I said to fill , &quot; Senenses , &quot; Senends , what &apos;s going to be slightly the colpackage , not ?
Because as I see I &apos;m going to see all I &apos;ve got , I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want to be better , you have to represented you and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , I don &apos;t do it .
I &apos;m going to start to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I would like to favor that was recorded that I today to do my part , &quot; because -- at the end , so , OK -- at the end of the North Africa &apos;s deserts in the deserts of the North Africa &apos;s wonderful and hours .
And they always were magnific , because the baleres were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every so , I get , I mean , something happened , and one of these artists actually become transcendent .
And I know you know what I know you talk about , because I know you &apos;ve all seen , a performance so .
It was like the time , you stop , and the balleres through a kind of brains and wasn &apos;t doing anything from the sun , as the 1,000 notes before , as the 1,000 notes before , but all it was halling .
And suddenly , I don &apos;t appeared as a human .
But it happened from the deddate and under the divinity .
And when this happened , to the time , people knew what was , they were called him .
They were hands and the hands and started cancer , &quot; Allah , Allah , God , Allah , God , God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curious storic -- when the Morer invasero , the Morer invass in the Spain , I took this habits with them and pronounce changed in the centuries of &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , &quot; which you can still hear in the flow .
In Spain , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , magnificent , the Allah , magnificent , &quot; God , &quot; Poke -- one scored -- one goes of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need to have to be .
But , the problem is coming back the day , for the balleres in the day , when you wake up and discovered it that are the 11 of Marteds and I &apos;m going to talk about it .
It &apos;s just a dead dead with a mal with mal graph , and it &apos;s probably never more to get to the the tree .
And maybe nobody &apos;s going to cannot be a name of God while I &apos;m going to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most porous recognizes to make a creative life .
But maybe not to be so angosciating if you can &apos;t believe , anzyutt , which is the most extraordinary expected in your being come from you .
But created it just that you have data in the same source of this squish intuition of this squish source of your life that you have to go to something else when you &apos;re finished .
And , you know , if we think that &apos;s going to think that way .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s because I thought about for different months in the work of the book that I &apos;m going to be a present , dangerous , dangerous , spaventy , spaventy , spaventy , and I &apos;m going to be able to be the very successful .
And what I have to keep to tell me when I feel electrized by this is , not going to be pursue .
Not bear . It &apos;s just your work .
It &apos;s going to presentate you to presentate you for your part , any can be .
If your work is balance , balling .
If the divine , aburd you assigned to leave some kind of wonderful wonderful , for only through your street , then you can go , &quot; and then you can . &quot;
She &apos;s the same dance .
And &quot; Ole you ! &quot; You know it .
I think I think I think you have to teach it .
&quot; You know , you know , only for the same for the human had and test love and test table to be a table to be presenting .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects on the human genes , what can meant and discovery new set of genes .
Now we &apos;re starting to a new percorse : we started digitalize biology and now to talk from that digital code we &apos;re going to go into a new biology , designing and synthesize .
We &apos;ve always been trying to bring big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; It &apos;s a lot of biologists I think they &apos;re trying to figure out to various livels .
We tried to have different approach , reducing the minimes .
We &apos;re digitalizing almost 20 years .
When we sequence the human genome was moving from the analogic world of biology in the digital world of the digital world .
Now , we can ask : can we regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smaller genitself from the smaller gene .
And we tried to reduce the ulteriorly creating a little more smaller .
We &apos;re able to get to eliminate a hundred of genes about 500 that are here .
But when we &apos;re looking at his meabolic map , it &apos;s relatively to our own .
Take this , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one is very unlikely that this can take a living cell .
So , we decided that the only way to design was synthesize this cromosome in a way to be able to make some of these questions of the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of the &quot; Pan , we can synthesis ? &quot;
Can the chemistry to produce these big molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create before now ?
And in case , in fact , we can make a cromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemical material chemical material .
The speed we we &apos;re able to degree with digitalize life is growing to the exponential .
Our capacity to write the genetic code , instead , rather , but it &apos;s better .
And our recently region the exponential curve .
We started 15 years ago .
The process has required many past past , starting with a review , before the first experiments .
But we found that that synthesis that we have to synthesis .
There are a few thousands of cars in the world that are small segments of DNA , of 30 to 50 letters and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the segment is longer , the segment is longer , more herrors there .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these framments and correcting the herrors .
And that was our first attempt , to talk about the digital information of the genome of Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the framments , actually , the correction of the errors and get a molecule of DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemistry and inert it in the bacteria , the bacteria have started to read this genetic code and producing this genetic code and producing the particles .
The viral particles are then you stuck from the cells , they &apos;re back back and they destroyed the E.
I &apos;ve talked about recently with members of the oil industry , which they have certain that they have certain of course , I &apos;ve been talking about this model .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build his software in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the greatest things in larger .
We wanted to build the whole cromoss of the bacteria .
They are 580 myths of genetic code .
So we thought of buildings that in the size of virus , so that we could change the casses to understand what the casses of the living casses of a living cell .
The program is crucial , and if we start with digital information , these must be very accurate .
When we sequence this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accurateful standard was a herror for every 10 mile .
We found out , 30 herrors . If we had done it , 30 herrors . If we had never been able to do that work .
One part of the process is designing seat longs of 50 letters that are going to be very much of the other segment of 50 letters to build smaller substitute to build smaller subtitions .
We &apos;re going to try to unique elements here .
You probably have read that we read that we &apos;re going to read that we &apos;re going to read that we &apos;re going to read that we &apos;re going to read that we &apos;re going to read that we &apos;re going to read that we &apos;re going to read that we &apos;re going to read that we &apos;re going to read that we &apos;re going to read that we &apos;re going to read that we &apos;re going to read that we &apos;re going to read that we
Think of it so : we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , Good and T.
Three of those letters together , and there &apos;s a specific cause , and there &apos;s a specific order to read for every aminous amminacid .
So we can use genetic code to write words , frasures .
What we &apos;ve done in the beginning was autographed .
Some of them have been deluses from the fact that it wasn &apos;t poem .
We designed these segment to be able to be able to just together with encies .
There are functioned them and they stop them .
And we started assembling the parts , starting with segment from five to seven myself , unclean together to make a switch , and until the letters of them to get to 7,000 letters .
Each step we have produced these sequences in abundance so we can sequence them , we &apos;re trying to create a very robuy processing that we &apos;re trying to create a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems to be the tabellone play-basket playbe .
When we get to these very long segment segment segment , more than 100 mila , they &apos;re not going to grow in the E.
You get to the limit of the modern biology .
So we &apos;ve looked at other mechanisms .
We knew of another mechanism called the remarkable reombing , which in biology is using to repair the DNA degree to get the DNA can can actually get the segments .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinocus , called Deinoccurred , can be able to be three million rad rad .
You can see in the square of the superior as his cromoss of the cromoss .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s been reassembled as before .
They have thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can get completely .
They can live under vacuum .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life exists in space , and you &apos;re saying to find new environment of water .
At the NASA showed that this is .
This is an image of the molecule we &apos;ve built these processes , just using the lievil with the design appropriate segment to inserve .
The lievil lights the automatically .
This is not taken with a microscope with a microscope , but with a microscope , with a microscope .
It &apos;s a typically great that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that they cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the published we &apos;ve done a little time ago .
They are 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the biggest molecule of a definitely define .
It &apos;s a weight to a 300 million .
If we &apos;re going to be a career with a cartoon , they would like to get this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ?
Of course , you know , you &apos;re a virus is a game from kids .
It &apos;s a little more complicated when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s simple as well as it &apos;s cells as well as our euck , as our euclear , you can just extract the nucleo and inseries to another , which is practical process .
In the bacteria , the cromosome is integrated in the cell , but we &apos;ve recently demonstrate that we &apos;re able to do a complete croms from one cell of a cell cell of a cell of a cell of a cell cell to another and of activity .
We got a microbial chromosome of microbial species .
The two are different than the men from the topes .
We &apos;ve added some gene in a way to decide what you can chromosome for this cromosome .
And then he sscience with the funny way to kill all protein .
And when we put it in the cell was study -- and you &apos;re going to appreciate our graphic graphic graphic graphic graphic graphic .
And so we thought we couldn &apos;t be able to go , but we tried to spushed to spushed .
This is one of the most evolution .
We found that many of a second species have added a second or third or a third of a cromosome of the second new ones of the new new ones of the new ones of the species .
So who &apos;s thinking about evolution as a just gene at the time that you have not understood of the biology .
They were the encicies called &quot; restrial &quot; that addition to digerve the DNA .
The cromosome that he was in the cell of it doesn &apos;t have one .
The cell phone that we have inseritous cellate that we &apos;ve inseritous .
And it &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other croma as material , and he &apos;s got it , and we found it with only cell , and we found with just the cell and the new cromoss .
it become blue because of the genes we &apos;ve inserious .
And in a short lelass of time , all the characteristic carpet , and it &apos;s transformed all in a new species , based on the new software we going to put in the cell .
All the protein are changed , membranes are changed , and when we &apos;re reading the genetic code to what we &apos;ve turned out to what we &apos;ve turned out .
Now , this might look like genetic alchemy , but altering the software DNA software .
Now , I &apos;ve got explained that here is not talking about genesis -- but to try to talk from three million years and a half years of evolution , and I &apos;ve already said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the Cambodies that will be able to create new species on this digital process .
Why do it ?
I think it &apos;s pretty obvious when we think of our necessity .
We &apos;re going to spend six and a half a half of people in the next 40 years .
Right to give you an example : I &apos;m born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one of the planet .
We &apos;re going to have now to find fresh fresh fresh , medicinal and clean , medicinal well-half billion people .
It &apos;s still going to be more dare to do that for nine billion .
We &apos;re going to start more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion barils , more than 30 billion barils .
That means a half a million barils a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replaced them , it will be a huge challenging .
We have to have to hold of all the emission of CO2 from these materials that you &apos;re going to be in the atmosphere .
At the day of today , because of the scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the design components for the future .
The electronic industry only has a dozen about components , and think about how many different things are come out .
Our limitations here are principlally in biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , because of these synthesis of synthesization , able to create what we call combinatory .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can make a big robot that can make a million croms a day .
Think of this , 20 million different genes or to try to get to optimize the processes to produce the processes to produce optimize , we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can chemistry for possibility of survival , chemistry or carburing , and carburing vaccines .
This is an instantly instantly , some software program that we &apos;re working for being able to sit and design species to the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know necessarily as they &apos;re going to be .
We know what they &apos;re exactly the genetic code .
Now we &apos;re focus on the carbons of how quarter generation .
You &apos;ve seen eetanol from the grain of the grain was a very very finished experiment .
We have carbons of second and third generation that will use enough from the birth of the high high value as the open or different butanol of butanol .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increasing the cost of food and limitation is the constantly the food and limitation would be to transform the CO2 in the first , we &apos;re working to design cells that can get to the cell , and we thought we can work this scale , and we thought we can get the first carbons of quarters of how much of the fourth generation .
The solar light light bined with CO2 is a metodom -- but in our discoveries in the world , we found different metodds .
This is an organism that we have described in 1996 .
It &apos;s going to be in the deep ocean , at about 2500 feet of depth of the water .
It &apos;s going to put from CO2 using molecular idrogen as a source of energy .
We &apos;re trying to figure out if we can incanalate the CO2 , which can be transported through the typical CO2 in carburn , to drive this process .
So , we think that we could think that we could be able to increase what the question is , &quot; which is the base of &quot; which is &quot; life is Nes , we have the modesobies -- we have the modest industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do that TED , where can you do it ?
It would be a main the main of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working for using the same metods to use the same metods .
You saw this year with the influence , we &apos;re always back to a dollar , and with a dollar when it &apos;s going to be the right right .
I think that what you can change in the combinable vaccines in anticipate .
And that &apos;s how the future could start to change , now , the tree , the tree of evolution , accelerating the evolution with synthetic bacteria , and then finally cells .
We &apos;re going to so much from the improvement .
Our purpose is to make a long long enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the most of the new technology that we &apos;ve brought to the new technology that we &apos;ve brought to Microsoft in the following in a year ago . This is Seadon .
It &apos;s a environment that you can interact with a local level that remote with an enormous amount of visual data .
Here we &apos;re seeing very much gabyte of digital photograph with a kind of expensive zoom , digital ses , disponing images as we &apos;re going to be .
And it &apos;s not really the amount of information that we see , how much are big these colraces of data or images .
Most of digital photographs , but this is a provense scanning from the Bibliote-scanning scanning , and it reentrepreneurs .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that it &apos;s the number of a system like this is the number of full in your screen in any time . It &apos;s also a very flow .
This is a whole book , you know , not not images .
This is the Casolate of Dickens . Every colonnail is a capital .
For to show you that it &apos;s about head and not images , we can do something like this , to see really , to see that it &apos;s a real representation of the head , not a picture of a picture .
It could be a little artificial artificial for a book or electronic book .
Not the jump .
This is a more realistic example . This is a number of the Guardian .
Every big imagined is the beginning of a seat .
And it really gives you the piecters and beautiful experience of a revist of a revist of a newspaper , which is for nature a mold , which is to nature a mold .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of this particular particular number of this particular particular .
We &apos;ve created a fasull the high-resoluitional contains -- much more higher than that you use in a published normal content -- and we &apos;ve inserious content .
If you want to see the carteristic carpet , you can see it here .
or other models , or even the specific specific specific specific .
And that really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the limitations of space on the screen .
We hope that this means to the pop-up to the pop-up and other door , they should not be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this won &apos;t want to lose time , if we don &apos;t want to say that we have contributed to this camp .
These are all the street in the U.S. . Sovrappost-hand , and you know , NASA .
So now we &apos;re going to go to what else is .
This is actually actually actually from the Web ; you can go to the web ;
This is a project called Photosynth , which is two different technologies .
A is Seadragonflies and the other is a very interesting searching computer searching in Noah Snavely , a student of the University of Washington , with the help of Steve Seads and Rick Seliski Microsoft Rick Seliski Microsoft Rick .
And it &apos;s from the Web , the Seady Seady .
You can see that when we do this , you know , when we do this kind of screen , where we can spend this kind of experience and have this kind of experience to multiply .
But the space collocation of the images here has actually meaning a meaning .
The algoritms of the computer visualization have recorded these imaging together , so that they &apos;re scacked to the real place to the register to the regions that -- all closer Grases the Roccial Montagen Roccies . Then you see the elements of a slights of a slide-stable slide slikely , and these things are the elements , and these things are all the space .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more space .
I want to spend directly to one of the original data set , and this is from a Photosynth prototype of Photosynth that we &apos;ve done for the first time , we &apos;ve done the first time , I &apos;m going to be the key , I &apos;m really the key . And it &apos;s not necessarily the key . And it &apos;s not necessarily the key .
We had to have to worry about the legal and so on .
This is a rebuildings of Nothers of Nothers .
So I &apos;m all images from Flickr and they &apos;ve been all became in space .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this simplication .
You know , I &apos;d never thought to end up in Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifying to realize this kind of account here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of different types of focus , from those of the cellular cellular phones to the ground of those graps in this environment .
And if I can , I try to try to look at the most strange .
Most are block , except .
Somewhere you &apos;re a photographs -- etc .
This is a Nothers of Nothers .
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the entire memory of how to apply the earth , from vision vision , visual point of vision -- and college point of visivoices together .
All those pictures become college together , greater than the parts .
You have a model of the earth that emerge .
Think of this as the prolence of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as well as people use it , and the people who are using it , and the vantages to use it .
Their pictures are marced with metadical methemselves .
If someone comes to the idea of contrassigned all these saying the name , my picture of the Nothers , my picture of Nothers of all those data , and I can use as a point of inexperience for all those data , and I can use the photograph , using the photograph , using the photograph of anyone else , and have a social experience of class and the crazy and cross-model .
Of course , a consequence of all that are very very extremely elaborate , very elaborated with the earth , and switch is not only achievement and slies and slums , but from the memory memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What your software is going to contained us to do is that , in the next few years , all the photographs shared by anyone in the world will be practically connected ?
BA : Yeah . What it &apos;s doing is to practical .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want to be , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the images .
The thing is very interesting if you think about the recognize of seeing information that many of these images are possible .
As when you do a research of images on the web , you get a sentence and the head on the web of the picture .
Now , what if that picture is you connected to all your picture ?
So , the amount of interconnection , and the amount of the rechedom that &apos;s really huge is really huge effect . It &apos;s a classical effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible .
BA : You &apos;re very very much .
One of the main pleased piecers when you travels and one of the research , is the power of the powerful antic antic antic antic antic antic antic antic antic antic antic antic antic , the wind is in the wind , the wind is in the floating , the wind is in the flowing of the plants .
And the fact that the months Jaguar , and still beyond the Viia Lattea , or that the myths of the Inuit &apos;s still still still connected meaning , or Himalaya , to remember the food of the Dharm , to remember the central importance of anthropology , and that idea that the world we live in the world we live in the world we live in the world we live in the world we live in the lives , but it &apos;s just a model , but it &apos;s just a model , it &apos;s just a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stirs , well or mal , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential beaten .
We all all naked . We all procreated .
We &apos;re subjects in the beginning .
We have to deal with the inexorability of death , so it doesn &apos;t surprising and ballie --
We all have a art .
What college is the particular is the particular rhythm , the rhythm of every culture .
Not matter that are the Than forests of the Borneo , or the following of the Haiti , or the World War , or the desert Kaisut in Kenya , or a melting camels , or a cameleras , or a cameleras in the Sahara .
He was my journey in the desert of a month ago , or a month ago , or a hyak of yak in the values of the world .
All of these populations teachers that are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , others of moving in the world .
And if you reflection , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
Insive , the myriadic of the world are a spiritual life of spiritual life and cultural and cultural heads that planet and it &apos;s important for the planet as biological biological biological as biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural girl as a cultural holding ethnosphere and you can call the ethnosphere , under ideas , inspirations , inspirations , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions brought to the al-consciousness .
The ethnosphere is the fantastic patrimonio of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how much inquisitive species .
And because the biosphere was favorable to the ethnic and unfortune too much more quickly .
Nobody &apos;s biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all the species is about the extinct , because it &apos;s false , or in the most apocallow-up , in the field of biological diversity -- and not even closer also , in the most of the hypothesis -- that of the most of the hypothesis .
The inindice of all is , of course , the lost linguistic loss .
When you were born there there are 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only a vocabolary or a series of rules , or by a series of rules .
A language is the sprake of the spirit .
It &apos;s the medium with which is the animum of every culture in the material world .
Every language is a forest , a bind of mind , a thought , a thought , a ecosystems of spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re sitting in Monterey , at least the half of the children .
They don &apos;t get to teach kids , which means that not wonderful , not wonderful that you don &apos;t wonder .
What is more trists of being fly in the silence , to be the last one , to be the last to talk about a language , not have a language , not have a way to be able to transmate the wisdom of the children ?
This is a horging is the someone in some part of the world every two weeks : every two weeks , a dancy , and it brings and and brings with the last tomba labs of an ancient language .
And I know somebody of you say , &quot; Isn &apos;t it better ?
The world wouldn &apos;t be a better place if we &apos;re going to talk about ? &quot; Benish , then we &apos;re all going to be yoruba . We &apos;re going to be cancer .
We &apos;re going to talk about .
You &apos;re going to be a tract thing to say , not to talk about your language .
I &apos;d like to do you make a journey through ethnosphere --
a little journey in the ethnosphere for what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , &quot; when I say , &quot; I really mean , &quot; I really mean , I really mean , I really different ways of exists .
We take for example this Barasana Barasana , in Amazon , the population of anaconda , which creates the myths of the hest high of the latest waste in the west sacred of the west sacrate .
It &apos;s a population that &apos;s not in the people who don &apos;t be able to distinguished in the green , because the cell is the time of the forest , where the population .
They have a strange language and a mathemselves , &quot; and a maybe , &quot; exogamia , &quot; you have to spose a person who talk about a different language .
All this has gone in the mythological past , the particularity is that in these families that are talking about six or seven lingures that are talking to the mathemselves of the mathemselves .
They &apos;re limited to hear and then they start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribes with which I &apos;ve lived , the Waorani Waorani &apos;s Ecuador , an incredible population that has had the first contatts in 1958 .
In 1957 medical meassionaries have touch a commercial contact .
They &apos;ve done by the photographs that they retraditional them in poses that they had to retraditional , forest that this population of pluge pluge pluge .
They told the ground picture , they &apos;ve got them in the searching , and they don &apos;t find nothing , they have concloser that they were going to be a directly , and they killed the five missionaries .
But Waorans don &apos;t just killed the straniests .
They were killed with them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by them .
We &apos;re sitting to eight generations and we found two of natural death , and when we insisted to know , they &apos;ve got to know , they &apos;ve got to invected so that they &apos;ve been invected , and then they killed it .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal of 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned a very interesting compiece when my professor Harvard professor who was asked in Haiti , and I wanted to go to Haiti in the secret of the power of the power of Dualier and Tonton Mosaces , and imposed me to the zombies , and I &apos;m sure me to the zombies of the speech ars .
For to give a sense of the miraculous , I should have to understand the Voom culture .
It &apos;s pretty much of a complex measured physics of the world .
Most interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan has not religious feelings . And instead , and it &apos;s not the other than the distilled concepts of these very profound religious concepts in the tragic deep slavery .
What makes the voodoo is the intense is the intense of life and death .
So , the vive they &apos;re going to get the spirits .
And the spirits can be invocused by the Grande Aca , they answer to the rhythm of dance and replace temporary to the animates of the dance of the dance of the dance .
So , the voodooists love say , &quot; You can go to the wonderful God .
We &apos;re going to start in the temple and we &apos;re God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re willing , is the spirit that you , how can you do the mal ?
So , you &apos;re assisted to these incredible events : following voodoo in the state of trance that touch infuel .
The people with the most extraordinary who lived the most extraordinary people are the Kogi in the Sierra Nevada Santa Marta , in Colombia .
Stirange of the ancivilization that once , when they live on the carcarbon airs of the conquist , the population , the population was going to be on the massive massive .
In a continent of blood , this population never been conquered by the spagners .
And I &apos;m government today I &apos;m government , but their formation is really extraordinary .
The young people following up from the families to three or four years , and they live secrets in a world , and they live secret in a world of the basic gets to the base of the ice for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years of the nine years of gestation to reproduce the nine months that transmit into the user of the mother , now are metaphorically in the Again .
For all this time , they are acculate to the values of their society , values that they predict their prevent , and only their prayers to the cosmic equilibrium -- or better to say the ecological equilibrium .
At term of this incredible initiation , they &apos;re improvise , and for the first time in their first time , at 18 years , they see a high of the first best , when the sun basic bor the first best , when the sun burning ban , all that they &apos;ve learned in theory is conferred in all of its theory . The predict is to the prevent beautiful .
&quot; I &apos;m going to say , I said ,
It &apos;s studied . Now it &apos;s to protect it . &quot;
They &apos;re called fractor and say that we , fractor , we are the holds of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about indeed with indeed populations and the environment of the old history of the old history of the old history , which is a razy concept in his simplicity or perhaps we &apos;re going to say that these people are are closer to the Earth of us .
Indigenes are not nor sentimental nor indebolites from the nostalged .
There is no space for these things in the Aphysical palures of the Aphasian vent gelids of Tibet , but because it &apos;s the time , they created a mystic war not on the concept of the Earth is not a best inen sure near , the concept that the Earth can only live because it &apos;s infected by the consciousness .
What does it mean ?
It means that a little girls who are going to be growing that the mountain is a spirit of a spirit that will be a depth of a depth of human being a very different human . And it &apos;s going to be a foundly different with the mountain or that place to a Montana who grow in a Montana who grow a mountain in a Montana , which is a mountain .
which is the dimour of a spirit or a mineral ceasy is irrievant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that &apos;s interesting is the relationship between individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Columbia , who regives that the forests serve to be cut .
This is a different human being in the Kwakiutl Kwakiutl who creates the forest that the forest is the dimour dimour dimour dimour dim-history , and the history of the paradise and the cannery that are going to extreme the north of the world , exploitation that Hamatse .
If you start to look at that these cultures can actually actually actually make a different reality , you can start to understand some of their sensitive sensitive .
I &apos;ve taken this picture in the West Amazon Amazon .
Mayahuge some of you have heard about the Eahuge , the powerful sushing of the repertoium of the repertoire .
What it makes the fascinating the ayahuge is not the potential of the substance , but it &apos;s the elaboration . It &apos;s a two elements .
From a side , this lian lian lian lady of a series of that , a hymine and harmin , harmin and harming , slightly .
And by the sun , you have a bluban , which alterm a little bit of the coast , but it &apos;s mmeans choices with the leaves of a house of the family of the family of the family of the caffection .
This plants of triptamines , very similar to serotonin , dimethoxyltryptamines , methoxyltryltryltryptams .
If you never see the Yanomami tyrare on for the sushing that they do by a different kind of species , which is methoxyltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryer .
Tiring that policy for the nose is a little bit like being disappeared by a fucile carric diping and landing on a sea of electricity . &#91; Rison &apos;t believe a distorsion of reality .
I was often often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , man who took the man who took the cheaper was psychedelic fungi , with his discovered fungi in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the Mexico .
And I mean my tese text can &apos;t classifly these triptams like hallucinogens because if you &apos;re doing not told .
It &apos;s possible to assumerly only if you sure it in other chemicals that money in the MAO .
Now it &apos;s the beautiful : the little carbs that are in this lian inibitors of MAO , the same kind of necessary to be the same as a flow of the triptams . The question question is spontaneous , in a 80,000 species , they &apos;re going to be like these are , but they &apos;re going to be like this , but if you combined in this way , but if you combined to this way , they &apos;re going to be perior the set ?
We use the big euphemism of the herror , that can reveal infrured .
But if we ask the Indians , they &apos;re going to say , &quot; The plants are talking about .
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Coften , Coften of Eastern , who distinguish networks , and that the reentreyes would be in the same species .
If we ask them how are stabilish their task tons , &quot; I thought I thought about the further , you don &apos;t know it ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot; I said , &quot; No .
The solution is : you get the 17 varieties in a notice of a bull-dom and each cannot have a song .
With this is not laureds to Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting to contact the printing practical .
Now , &#91; &#91; applplauses &#93; the problem is that even the ones who have the holds of the indeed people are putting them in the history of the history of the history of the history of the history of the history of the real world , and pass .
In fact , the century , between 300 years , not remember the woods or the war innovations or the technology , but rather as the one we stop and in the active innovations , but rather as we stop and we have abuntil the mass of diversity and cultural parts of the planet . Now the problem is not the change . Now the problem is not change .
All of the cultures were involved in a dance for new possibility of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux don &apos;t stop to be Sioux when they put up and further as the Americans don &apos;t stop to be Americans when they put up up and calculate .
It &apos;s not the climbing or technology that threatences . It &apos;s the power . It &apos;s the power .
The wall of domination .
And if you look at the world , you will find that these are not not cultures .
They &apos;re creatures and dynamics out of the hydynamics that are going to be in their own ability of adaptation .
And it &apos;s disboss disboses in the patries of the Than --
a population of Sarawak , in the Sarawak , a population that has lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to a generation ago , and the next titution on the restrict of the restrict of the fully , where you can see the physical physical physical means to the Bornearly , where the naves the naves , where the naves the naves , the horian orizonte , where you know , the named the naves the names the names the napants of the hores the named the named the names ,
and reping the stives with the stives with the wood slums .
Or in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that are the disease of the gold .
If we move on the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;re going to see the wall of the political domination .
As you know the genocide , the physics of a population , is condanned to the universal level , but the ethnic of a population , not only is condannect , not only is condanted , but it &apos;s also cell in certain environment , because it &apos;s part of development .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of the Tibet .
I &apos;ve lost the 6,000 miles from Chengaged in the West Choccidental Tibet , coming in in Lhasa with a young college , but only came to Lhasa , I &apos;ve got got to realize what we &apos;re going to talk about .
6,000 monuments sacrates in policy and centers .
1.2 million people killed from the military the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was absolutely to Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed to say that was killed to the Chinese .
Her is Figenter with Sanity in Sanity in Sanity in the Nepal .
Souther mother was imprisoned and his cold was to be recicipes .
It was brought of nails in career in the age of two years , nails under his gonna because it wouldn &apos;t have living without him .
The sister , who did the same , it was put in the field of reducation .
A day , he &apos;s got hot of the Mao , and for this transgression , and for this transgression , was put in the seven years .
The Tbet of the TIsn can be insure , but the redenter of the population is from the tener .
And then , it all reduces , it &apos;s reduces .
We want to live in the world world &apos;s world to realize the world of the policromatical world of the policromatical world ?
The big anthropologa Margaret Mead , before we die said that his largest pure was that , in our world , we &apos;re going to see the whole amorous amorous amount of the whole gamma imagination of human imagination is going to be able to be a limited limited , but a day we &apos;re going to waiting to be able to become there .
And it &apos;s a remember that our species is existed for 60,000 years .
The Rivolution Neolitics , who gives us the agriculture , which has done us to the cult of the sees of the seed , by the slighting poem with the next few of the clero , creating the gerarchy , creating the gerarchy , and we &apos;re talking about 10,000 years ago .
The industrialized world has 300 years old .
And that slide history not suggests that we have the answer to all the challenges that we &apos;re going to have to get in the millenny to come .
When these myriadic cultures of the world &apos;s gone to say , &quot; As with 10,000 voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all required the possibility of being what we &apos;re : a consciousness , that we &apos;re a consciously , that we &apos;re all the people and all the people can floor . And there are great moments .
I &apos;ve taken this picture on the north of the island of the island of the Baffin , when I went to the hundred of balene with Inuit , and this guy , Olaya , and I told me the story of his nonno .
The government has not always been gency with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to stabilie our prematise , we have them in colonies .
The non-grandfather was refying to go .
The family , tempting for his life , he brought up all the arms , and all of his attractic .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t themselves the cold , they &apos;re sweeping .
The slites of the slites were actually made of fish walking in the skin of caribs .
The non-hand this man doesn &apos;t full night , or the blizing artic night to the blize that was suffering .
It &apos;s hot , you &apos;re going to be the focus in the skin and defecated in the fecated in the hand . When the fecks are congeled , and you work it it &apos;s congent them , and they work it creating a lama .
It &apos;s spring salive on the points of this cluster and when it was solid , he killed a dog .
She had a high school and created a little bit , with the roughly casses , he has created a slip , and it &apos;s banched a banchisa , and it &apos;s slighting in the rest .
We want to talk about cavarsely with nothing ? &#91; Rish &#93; . And this , in different ways , &#91; Applauses &#93; is the symbol of the resilience of the population of the world .
In the oprile 1999 , the canader has redded to the Inuit &apos;s the total control of a larger territorum of California and Texas med .
It &apos;s their new patries . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s an independent territory . They &apos;re going to contrary resources .
One is a national example of how a national national national state can recognize with his population .
And , finish , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious to the people of it was in these switches of the planet , make it remote that they don &apos;t remote .
For somebody &apos;s home .
They represented seats of human imagination that are the same time . And for us all , the dreams of these kids , as the dreams of these kids , as the dreams of geography .
For finally , we National Geographic , we are convinced that political political will never get to nothing .
We believe that polemies --
&#91; Applauses &#93; &#93; &#91; Applauses , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the best institution to tell the world . Every month to our sit sit region we &apos;re going to have .
156 countries our television .
Our reviews are lectures from millions of people .
Our work is to traveling to bring our public in the audience of wonderful cultural and wonderful , and hope , and hope , hope , they &apos;re hoping , and hope , they &apos;re hoping , and we have to find the central world of anthropology : the world of existing in the diversity , and we have to find a style living in a world and multicultural world to be in a pluralister and multicultural world to be in a world .
where the wisdom of all the people can contribute to our collective benefit .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things I written in this book that I &apos;m going to talk about this book that I &apos;ve heard and I &apos;m going to try to evidence some colleages , in case I don &apos;t note it .
I would like to start with what I call the officer . &quot;
The dogma dogma dogma dogma dogma dogma dogma dogma dogma dogma dogma dogs .
The dogma dogma dogma of all the West industrial societies . The dogma officer : &quot; If we want to male the benefit of our citizens &quot; The way to do it is to male the individual liberty . &quot;
The reason is , from a side , in the fact that liberty is in the fact that liberty is in the same value , is precious , for humans , for humans .
At the other is that if we &apos;re libers , each of us can act for the other connection to do everything that massive our benefit , without no one that decided in names .
The way to male the liberty is to male the choice .
More people have , more libers are , more libers , and most of them is their liberty , most of them is their well-being .
This , I think , it &apos;s so deeply radical in the society that nobody would be able to put it in the society that in the doubt .
And it &apos;s also deeply radical in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress can be possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m losing a simple note on the conditions .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without contate the 10 variety of oil , and 12 acets of oil and 12 acets acets of the balses that you can buy for a number of conditional conditional condent in the restauring region .
That &apos;s the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic negotiate to buy a stereo : I &apos;m sure , plify , free , plastra , leter .
And in this single negotiate of electronents , there &apos;s a big number of audio .
We can make six and a half million different means in the components that there are in a only negotiate .
You have to admit that there &apos;s a lot of choice .
Other the fields : the communications world .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all the serve telephone phone phone , the pact that I was straight from the mom Bell .
And you get back to the phone , not bought it .
A consequence of that , in the other , was that the phone was never going to be .
These time I went .
Now , we have a variety of phones , especially between the cellular cellular phones .
Here &apos;s the cellular cellular cellular .
My favorite is that in the midddle , MP3 , tapels of the nose , and the nose for the crowd of the crowd .
If you don &apos;t have seen in the store under the house , you &apos;re going to be in the house .
And what &apos;s the answer is that people are in the waiting and it &apos;s this question . And you know what the answer is &quot; No .
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell that doesn &apos;t make too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the aquires , you actually grew the same explosion of choices .
Assistence : Not happen in the United States that you &apos;re going to be in the United States and doctor , doctor , what you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do it , or B , &quot; As &quot; Could you do it , &quot; B has these benefits . &quot;
You say , &quot; Dr. &quot; You know , what should I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A has these benefits and the risks , and the risks , and these risks . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebats , &quot; Dr. You know , she was me , what would it do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result of the result of the malsequate , &quot; which is that it seems to be a beautiful thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not that a few people can &apos;t be a patient and responsibility to somebody who knows something , which is the doctor , to someone else who don &apos;t know -- and so it &apos;s not in the condition to learn the patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing products , direct to people like me and you , who if you think about it doesn &apos;t have any sense , because we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why do we published them ?
The answer is that they want to be called the doctor to ask to change the recipe to change the recipe .
Something so fundamental identity as it is our hythical identity is , as you see in this jail . &quot; We don &apos;t want to be force their sevening .
And we can reinventing us how many times we can get us .
which means that every morning , to the risk , you have to decide that kind of person want to be .
I &apos;m standing to the family and mathemselves , a time time , and the common perspective , square , and it was that you can get the most prespossible , and he started to get the most of the prespossible .
The only choice was choice with who , not even when , not even , and not even what do after .
Everyday , it &apos;s really to play .
I &apos;m seeing students very intelligent students , and I do do their own 20 percent of work for a time .
And it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less sharing , not because they &apos;re less diligent .
but because I &apos;m impensierites , I mean , &quot; I would say , &quot; I would say , &quot; I would say , &quot; I should be doing it now ? &quot;
&quot; I should move more tards ? I have to think before the children or career or career ? &quot;
They &apos;re logorant , logorant .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this implement is not completely to the compitation that I won and not get a beautiful waste to my exame .
And they have to do it . They have to do it .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , as Carl , because the technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from every day , from every day , from Hotel Randolph .
And I &apos;m parently , there &apos;s a angolin , and I &apos;m not going to say , where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t say , because I want to use it .
What does mean , this incredible liberty liberty liberty lives we have to continuously deciding , continuously in every moment , if we need to work or not .
We can go to the head of our child , with the cell phone in a tank , the Black-to-to-day , the notebook , and the notes , on the ginocket .
And even if I &apos;m all spents , every minute that we see our child , we &apos;re also wondering , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; Do I say , &quot; Do I say , &quot; Do I say , &quot; Do I say , &quot; Do I say , &quot; Do I say , &quot; Do I say , &quot; Do I say , &quot; Do I answer this ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , &quot; it makes the experience of partners of your childhood from what it would be in other conditions .
So , as we look at all , we look at , small , big materials and the lives of life is a choices , life is a choices .
Once the world was this : Over , there were some possibilities , but not all of the choice .
The world today is this : The dilemma is , &quot; The dilemma is , &quot; Is it ? &quot;
The answer is Some .
We know all have to know , so I &apos;m going to talk about negative .
All this choice is two effects of negative effects on people .
The first , paradoxide , is that it &apos;s produced to be instead of the liberation .
And so many of the pursue that you choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I offer a meaning example : a study conduct of the full flights .
A college has had access to the data of Vanlook , the giganties of the deep sources of thinking , with about a million climents in 2,000 companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of adesion , the percentage of adesion .
With 50 sources , there &apos;s 10 percent of offering , there &apos;s 10 percent of adesions to five . Why ?
Because with 50 sources of framework , it &apos;s malethy to decide , and the choice is re-manded to the indomorate .
And domorders , and still domororders , domorange , domorous , of course , domorous domances never .
You know , that doesn &apos;t just mean that these are going to be eyed for canes because they &apos;re not going to be money , to say that the decision is so obstic that decision is so obstic that they also lost the funds of the labor .
Not participating , they &apos;re allowing up until five dollars from the work , which would be willing to green them .
So the paralysis is a consequence of the choices .
And I think that &apos;s going to make the world .
&quot; And finish , for the eternity : ketchup , or maionese ? &quot;
You would like to take the right decision , if it &apos;s for ethernity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and nepural condent condent .
So , this is the first effect . The second is that if we can avoid and do a choice , we &apos;re less satisfying out of the result of how we were unless options with less options that choose to the way .
And that &apos;s for different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of the conditions that waste , if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could make a choice that you could do a different choice that would be better . And what &apos;s the alternative imagined us to the scale , and the repit repid the choice , and the swasting repit of the decision , and the satish sh slightly the decision ,
even when it was an optim decision .
More choices are , it &apos;s easy to displacered anything that is insod-up choice .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call cost-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has asked very well pressing to the value that we &apos;re going to depends that we &apos;re going to talk about what we are confront .
In the rest , when there are so many options , it &apos;s easy to represent the tools of the alternative , and be less satisfying of the option that you &apos;re choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m a picture with all of the New York .
But that &apos;s probably what you would think .
There &apos;s this coppia of Hamptons .
A place of light .
It &apos;s beavind splendida . Otyma day day .
Nothing . But what he thought is , &quot; Well , malite , it &apos;s Agost . &quot;
&quot; All my neighbors are so on . &quot;
&quot; I could talk about the parking in front of the home . &quot;
And he spending two weeks and assiled from the idea that it &apos;s loss -- every day -- the possibility to talk where it wants .
The cost-opportunity is decline for what we have , even when the choice was , even when the choice was except .
And the most are the options that we have to consider , the most of the carteristic carpet .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
And we &apos;re talking about the living , and maybe of the living .
But the most important point is that anything you &apos;re going to choose , you &apos;re going to choose to do other .
The things that we don &apos;t choose to be a tactive active active active what we do .
Tirst point : the growing growing of the expectations .
I tried it on my skin buying a new jeans .
I &apos;m going to be almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were a kind of bought , and they were wrested , they were comfortable , they were comfortable , only after they took them a life and washed them a lot of times , they started to go well .
So I went to buy a couple of jethers , and I said , &quot; I need to go , and said , &quot; I need a couple jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
The common ses said , &quot; Ley slim , fit , relaxy and fit ? &quot;
With them with the certain or with the bottons ? &quot; Stonewashed , &quot; or &quot; acidwashed , &quot; or &quot; acidwashed , &quot;
&quot; Would you have street ? &quot;
&quot; Sow the basic or street ? Bl bla bla basic basic .
I was hordit , and after a little bit I &apos;ve got to say , &quot; I want to say , &quot; I want to have the only guy who was the only guy who was , so I tried to all the disease , then I tried to use the sticks , then I went out with the best , and then I &apos;ve ever had .
It was the massive . I had all that choice I had got the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a book , I &apos;ve written a book .
The reason I was worse worse is that with all the mies of my expectations were altism , jeans have to be perfect .
I started in the beginning I had minimes . I didn &apos;t expected anything when I was just a kind of 100 different , but when I saw , at least a kind of hunt , at least a guy had to be perfect .
What I was copying was good , but not perfect .
After I talked to the choose to what I was in the confronted to the expectations .
The adaddition of options in the people don &apos;t make the expectations that these have respect to the eck of the options of options .
And that product is going to make less sod-full , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the marketing world if I realized .
Because if they knew what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more to this .
&quot; You know , you know , when it was worse , &quot; The reason that they were better when you were worse , it was going to be worse , when it was still going to meet the surprised of the presses .
Everyday , in the world we live -- opulent , industrialized citizens with the perfection -- the massive that we can hope is that the things are in the heith of the heighborhood .
You never surprising places because your expectations , my expectations , they &apos;re ingiganties .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Basse expectations , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , you want to . &quot;
I mean , little time , I mean , little autobiographical -- which I &apos;m actually saying and my wife is really study .
I wouldn &apos;t have to do better , I won &apos;t have to be able .
But it &apos;s not always a good thing .
And then , a consequence of the by-jeans scomods , when you &apos;re just that jeans , when you &apos;re not satisfied , and you say , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot;
The world is the responsible . What could I do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a types , and you buy , and you ask you who is the responsible , it &apos;s otherwise you .
You could have better .
With hundreds of dispone-, there are no scratch scale .
So when people are decisions , even if the result is valid , they feed the holds are insoon and they &apos;re going to get the color .
In the last few years , the depression is exploss in the industrialized world .
I think a meaning that a meaning -- not the only one , but the importance -- of this wave of depression is just that people have experiences of the depression because standard are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation thought that the colorful is .
So the final result is that in general , we &apos;re going to be better , but we &apos;re worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the officer , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely false . It &apos;s not true .
There is no doubt of choice that a little bit of choice is better than it &apos;s not going to be able to be better than a little bit better than a little bit .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we have overed by a piece of the level that the choices that we have a little bit of our life .
Now , from political point of view -- I &apos;ve almost finished -- from political point , the nocle is the following .
What allows this all of the industrial societies is the material to the material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , which is not they have too much choice .
The problem is they have too pocket .
So the facility I &apos;m talking about is a malesclusive of modern , recidital society .
And what it does depressing and array is this : Steve Levitt talking about how much those cost-to-care and switch seats for books . It &apos;s a recognize of money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and dispendependent , it &apos;s not that they &apos;re just useful .
I &apos;m going to be a deleteries .
They do worse .
If a little bit of what in our societies allows a little choice of choice , in the people where people have too few possibilities , not just their lives .
This is what economists call a paretian .
A redesibution of the reddit is really well for all of the poorly -- because of this choice in excess that &apos;s going to be holding us .
For conclude , you can become all you want to become all you want --
You , people of culture , you &apos;re thinking , &quot; But what does it create that weight ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t get anything in a bocket . &quot;
&quot; A imagination , a limited vision , a limited vision of the world -- &quot;
and I &apos;ve interpret that , and I &apos;ve interpret .
But then , thinking about , I realized , I realized that that weight the long long-care .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you &apos;re managed to the bocks , so that you can &apos;t be the freedom . &quot; You can &apos;t get the paralysis .
If you read the broke in a way that all divent possible dimining the sod-full .
You &apos;re going to be the paralyses , and you reduced the benefit .
They all need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too street , maybe even for us .
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic symbols and , I &apos;m in the rovine .
Thank you very much .
