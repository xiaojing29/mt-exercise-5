Last year , I showed these slides to show that the cotta glacial , that for almost three million years had the size of 48 continental continental continental continental continental continental .
But this submit , the gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the seven-up .
The arctic glacial is , in a sense , the pulser heart of the global climate system .
It expanding inverter and it comes summer .
The next slide is going to be a rapid carrelated on the extensive years .
The ice losenium are drawn in red .
You see , it expand , it all the way to blue .
That &apos;s the ice in winter , which you get exacted .
You can see that the cost ice ice , you can see that the blood , five years or more , it &apos;s like the blood , which five years from the body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been like like this .
This is a problem because the interests that interested in the arctic glaciers around the arctic , where there are enormous amount of carbon that , shake , move , they &apos;re turned , they &apos;re turned out to the microbes .
I &apos;m putting to the totality of the atmospheric inquency , that amount could radical , surgery , super, super, super-wasn , super-win-house .
In some laghi best in Alaska , the metane is already rebecting from the water .
The professoreage Katey Walter University was received with a team at a team that pressed last .
Video : Wow !
One reason is that this term exchange the word .
This is a fighting glacial .
The card was never reaching livels like this .
This is the Kangerlussuait , in the southwest of the Greenland .
If you want to know how the squid level for the squid switch , and it &apos;s where it reaches the sea .
These rhns are increasing quickly .
On the other part of the planet : Antararctica , the greatest block of the planet .
The month , scientists have declared that the balance of the ice is in negative , and that the Antarctica , which is the Antararctica , which is particularly about some submarine islands , which is particularly rapid in the shelt .
And it &apos;s only six feet of the watching across , as in Greenland .
Sull Himalaya , the third largest block , you see new laghi , that a few years ago , which a few years ago , and they were glacked .
40 percent of the world population is going to be the filled water from that swim water from that swim .
Sulle Ande : this ice is the source of the powerful water of this city .
It &apos;s increased .
But when it goes , it &apos;s the same happening to water .
In California , the snow on Sierra Nevada is decreases .
The hydries are in crisis .
The predictions , as you read , are fell .
The growth of the world is a remarkable increases .
The environmental disaster are moving up to a normal and without precedented .
Four times more numerous in the last 30 years from the previous 75 .
This is an unsustainable thing .
If you look at it in historic context if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day .
Look at the area of the Pacific area , to American , and on the west , and on both parts of Indian subcontinent , where there is a radical impoverments of oxygen in the ocean .
Most of global warming , along the deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossil fuels .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States are one of the two more emissions , with China .
And it was proposed to build a lot of other central centers .
But we &apos;re seeing a change .
These are the annaked in the last few years and some of the alternative verizy-alternative .
In any way , there &apos;s a political floor in our country .
The carbon industries and the oil industries have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon , which is a hosymen .
That picture me up to something --
Very Natal , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion lboys .
You may have seen it on the news .
This is the second largest flex flow of scories in America .
It &apos;s happened around Natal .
The nature published of one carbon industries was this .
Video : My carbon on the carbon is a kind of allegro and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it &apos;s going to grow our economy .
It &apos;s always more clean is more and more clean .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and work in the stipendent .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The largest societies on the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Don Blankenship : Won Blankenship -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosis , Harry Reid -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Protection of Cliar , he was two campaign .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : At COALergy : ALergy see the climate change as a serious tines of our business .
So , for our priority is invest a big amount of money in a basic effort to make public effort and confuses the truth .
In fact , the carbon isn &apos;t hit .
We think it &apos;s clean -- it &apos;s also a good profumo .
So not preoctation of climate change .
Let me do .
Video : Ator : Carbone . You &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
So let &apos;s look at a carbon in a struggle to advanced .
Straordinary ! Mominework is a little sound , but this is the sound of the car technology .
The carbon of coal , is between the major causes of global warming , but the carbon technology of clean clean clean that you see change everything .
Take a look : this is the hate hate technology of clean clean .
Al Gore : Inally , the positive alternative alternative , and the national security .
Video : Same is in the crisis ; the economy , the economy , national security climate crisis .
The filter that connects all : our dependence of fossil combustible , as the carbon and oil .
Now , it &apos;s a new , audace for a circumstances .
Repower : 100 percent of high energy , 10 years .
It &apos;s a plan to put America to work , make sure more safety , and help to stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that &apos;s going to solve our problems .
Repower . You &apos;re reading more .
Al Gore : That &apos;s the last .
Video : It &apos;s about reduck energy to America .
One of the fastest ways of bring up the combustible that kills our planet .
Comparish : The future is here . I feel , just a new energy network .
She &apos;s got two : Noves investments for places of work .
Comming : I &apos;m going to be realists .
Al Gore : A old proverbium proverbigs says , &quot; If you want to go speed , you go to it .
If you want to go away , you go together . &quot;
We need to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED I did an introduce on LHC .
And I promise to go back to you about how the machine works .
So I realized . And for those that the other time , there was no , the biggest experiment that ever was tried to -- 27 kilometers of circumference .
His task is to required conditions that were less than a billion second from the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
And that &apos;s just envirous .
This is the car under Ginevenra .
We picture these mini-Bang Bang in inside the relevators .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- is 44 feet .
This is a spectacular image in AS in buildings , so you can see proportions .
Ten September 10 year we &apos;ve got accent the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by AS LAS .
It was cause of immense failures in the control of control .
It &apos;s an image of the first phasm that had done all around LHC , walking into collision , and in a collision , with a part of the LHC , and it &apos;s hard in the seven-levator .
In other words , when we see that picture , we see that picture , we realize that the machine worked , which is a great vitter vitter .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to do more or this , when somebody went on Google and he saw that the beginning was this .
That means we had a cultural impact to the scientific impact .
And it was a week later , there was a problem with the car , I had to these files here -- these dored files .
These files bring 13,000 loves when the machine works .
Now , the technicians between you will watch and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . &quot;
And they can do it because when they &apos;re very cold became the coolle practice .
So , unless 271 degrees , at least temperature to that space between the stars , these files can bring that run .
In one of the junture between novemisle in the LHC , there was a fect fabrication .
So , the files surprising slightly , and the 13,000 frightened amping a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think these magnets are more than 20 tons , and that &apos;s more than 20 tons , and that &apos;s moved about 30 inches .
They are damaged about 50 magnets .
We had to take them , what we did .
We resisted and traveled .
Now , they &apos;re coming back all of them in the sub-place .
And the end of marzo LHC will be new integrated .
We &apos;re going to happen , and we &apos;re going to get data or swimming or slue , and we keep our adventure to discover what are the morning is going to look at the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these accidents readed the value of science and engineering the value of science and engineering . It &apos;s easily hyourself .
I think that &apos;s so hard , it &apos;s so hard , it &apos;s the fact that I think is the value of things like LHC .
I &apos;d like to close with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , imagine , in the defense of his bathrow , his pupille , his pupils , his pupiler was Michael Faraday , he said , &quot; Not is so dangerous for the progress of human mind as the riences of human mind that ideas of science as the next to us . &quot; And that we &apos;re going to nature , and our triejuggs ,
Thank you .
I want to start wondering , when , from children , you playing , from children , you playing ,
Whereas you reach them and go and go and go and go and go and move them , and you learn and move them , and they &apos;re going to think about realize and manipulating problems .
And the reasoning reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , from information , as an inspired by our interaction with physical objects , together at my consultable . And my hand Jeevan Kalanithi , I started wonder , and my hands , and I started asking me , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of the mouse as a digital , we could die , in the watch as a digital desktop , we could run a desktop ,
and systems our ployment ?
And the question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , and build Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big computer interactive computer as a beautiful .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big computer interactive computer as a beautiful .
You can move them with the hand , can see it , &quot; you can see between them , &quot; and they have a screen and a rator .
But above , I &apos;m physical objects , like morning , you can move just just just deal with them .
Siftable is an example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physical , and , and as they get more physical , and as they become more physical , and more physical , of other people , how we can explore new and fun stils of their moving , we can explore new things .
I &apos;m going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configurated to show : if you just incline in a direction , video , it will rotate , if you just closer from the other hand .
These are conscious of other other people .
If you go , you know , you &apos;re interested in .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can get a little bit .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can get a little bit .
They &apos;re going to have their movement and inclination .
We realize that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power to use common gesture , &quot; a color like , &quot; a color like a liquid color as if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable , we have three Siftable and I can use to use them to look at the central color in that central , where you measure .
and I can use them to be true in that central , where you &apos;re missing .
It &apos;s too much , we can get too , we can stay a little place .
And there &apos;s also beautiful possibility of learning , like languages , the math and games of logic where people can try to try things quickly , and see the results of them .
Now , I &apos;m --
This is a Fibonaccomplishes I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a game of words that is half between Scarabees and Boggle .
Pratically , at every turn on every turn Siftable , in case , Pratically , to every turn on every turn to every turn on Siftable , and while cers words , and while cers words of words , and while cers words on a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new letters and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s what children came up to the Media Lab , I did so they just tried them and I &apos;ve turned a video .
They are very placeased .
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people many instructions .
You just say , &quot; Compons of words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s what other people coming out .
This is our youngest , the most younger , there on the right .
It was actually wanted to implane them .
They were only morning , for him .
Now , this is an interactive application of an interactive cardboard .
We wanted to build a tool for learning . He &apos;s learning .
It can put new characters in the scene , and it can sunlight the Siftable them .
It can put new characters in the scene , and it can sunlight the Siftable them .
Well , it &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : Sun is source .
David Merrill : Now he brought a treator in the scene .
Video : The arange treator .
Bel work ! Yeah !
So , I school the Siftable and put them neighborhood can interact the person-hand --
Video : Bau !
To , when you &apos;re going to be .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a final story , and it can decide that .
DM : It &apos;s a final story , and it can decide that .
Volice : Go , cat .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , realized by the way , to sample and exectable and exectable .
It &apos;s a tool , realized , for sampling and execting music .
The Siftable is sounds like base , based and battery and battery .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose what we use .
You can put sound sounds in a sequence sequence of your full facross .
And you just touch it just touch a sound &quot; and a sequence . &quot;
These are effects that you can control from alive , as the reverse and the filter .
And then it &apos;s going to be a sound and then inclines to be standing it .
And then there are the general effects as time and volume , that &apos;s going to be the whole sequence .
Let &apos;s look at how it works .
DM : We &apos;re going to start putting a base in two Siftable . &quot; sequence , we &apos;re doing it , we add it in a series , we add base .
Now , I put a base line .
Video : Now add of percussions --
DM : And now I &apos;m going to put the filter battery , so I can control the effect of the view .
DM : I can speak up the whole sequence , by by squence , by one hand .
DM : And I &apos;m going to add the bottom to the basse to get more expression .
DM : I can read the sequence &quot; to fly . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have places before , but I can suddenly please , and it longer .
And finally , finally , I can brow the whole sequence inating on the left the Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new man interfaces more and more like more like , and more like , how we work our brain and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some possibilities that we &apos;re trying to take out of the lab .
The concept that I want to transmit is coming to this new generation of design objects to interact with digital media , that will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time talking to all you .
I &apos;m a writer .
Sort books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the fashion my life .
And I don &apos;t look like that it can change .
But , said , something that &apos;s recently happened in my life and my career , and my career , and I got me to realibrate the whole relationship with this job .
And what I recently wrote about this book , this book , this biography called &quot; Manway , Prua , Prua , &quot; Ama , &quot; which , diversounds , for some reason I had to use in the world and become a big , sensitive sensational , wild-sensational .
And the result is that everywhere goes now , people treating me as if you were condanced .
It &apos;s really -- condanced , condanced .
They &apos;re all going to be concerned and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t fear more ?
You don &apos;t fear that you keep write all the lifetime , without maybe be able to create a book that can important one book ? &quot;
what can you important to somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s rassured , you know .
But it might go worse , part of that I remember more than 20 years ago , when I started saying to people -- I was an adolescent -- I was a writer .
I &apos;m going to meet the same reaction based by fear .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t get successful ?
You don &apos;t fear that the humiliation of the refuse you ?
You don &apos;t fear that you do this for all life for all life that nothing came out and die on a sample of sample every infrants with the dy-filled sample of laming cluinfrants ? &quot;
Therefore , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I fear of all those things .
I &apos;ve always been afraid .
And I have a lot of other things that people can &apos;t inate .
It &apos;s like algae and other things .
But , as much as I thought about what I was thinking and wonderly , I would ask it , because ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logic that everyone who should wait to be friendly by a job that you hear to do .
But what is so particular in the fashion creative fashion , creative health of the mental health , in a way that other career can &apos;t do ?
And as my father , for instance , he was a chemistry and I don &apos;t remember one once in his 40 years of activity that he was asked if he had to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able ingenished ?
It was never -- that block of the engineer John , how do it ?
Not work , you know ?
Onestly , chemicals as a group have not , in the centuries , in the centuries , in the reputation of being alcolized depressive .
We have enough , we have enough reputation , and not only writers but creative of all gender , we have this reputation of being enormous instabove mentally .
And it &apos;s not rest more than looking at the conteaints dead dead of the creative minds that , only in the 21st century , they died young and often to hand .
And even those who are not suicidated southern , they &apos;re actually disdealed by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before I die , in the last interview said , &quot; Oh , my book killed me a little more . &quot; And a little more extraordinary deal released to work in its life .
But we don &apos;t bad ad at the way we feel about why we feel these things so long that in some way we have completely interiorized and accepted the notiorized that creativity and suffering are in some way bapart and the art , at end .
And the question I want to ask all of those today is : are you agree with this idea ?
You &apos;re going to be good for anything -- because it &apos;s looking at it .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous and I don &apos;t want to see the perpetuate in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better encourage our big minds of creative minds to live .
And of course , I know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start figing out the circle of suppositions , above the circumstances that are in my career .
That &apos;s what you &apos;re going to look , are pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I have about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything I &apos;m going to write in the world , and then will be judged by the world as the work that was going to be used to be successful .
I &apos;m going to be cut , because we &apos;re all more or less friends here -- is likely that my greatest success to my herself .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that that brings a person to start beside in the morning , and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would keep doing this work that we do .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it seems , after many reflective , that the way to work to keep writing is to create a psychological construct , OK ?
I have to find a safety of safety between me , who I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxiety about what reaction is going to get . And as I was trying to get around year , trying to get into the time , trying to find out , and I was looking for all the time , trying to see if they could have better ideas and more healthier . And the most more several ideas and more healthough ideas . And more switching . And I &apos;m going to get a lot of the most of ideas . And more several ideas . And
about how to help people care creative to run the inerent inerent inerent risks .
And that research led to the ancient Grex and ancient Rome .
Let me because I play in circle and then go back .
In ancient Grex and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t look like creativity to believe that creativity was from men , OK ?
It thought that creativity was this spirit of divine and waiting , and he came to men from a few distant and sources , for distant reasons , and disappecially .
The greatest called these &quot; spirits of creativity &quot; demons .
Socry , wonderful , believed that he had a demon the high wisdom .
The Romans were the same idea , but they called the kind of spirit without body genius .
That &apos;s great , because Romans didn &apos;t think that a genius was somebody was someone was a particularly intelligent .
And they thought that a genius was this kind of entity , which was created literally lived in the walls of a artist , a little bit like Dobby , a little bit like Dobby , and he came out to hidden work of nailing , and what you do is to model .
Here &apos;s what I &apos;m going to -- that &apos;s the distance of which I &apos;m talking about -- that psychological costruth that you protect from your work .
And everyone knew that was , right ?
So , the antic artists were protected by certain things , like the too narcissm , right ?
If your job was exceptional job , you couldn &apos;t take all the market , everyone knew that you had helped by this incorporate geniorporation .
If your fales work , it wasn &apos;t all care all holds , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be an incapable .
And so people han conceived creativity in the West for a long time .
And then Renaissance came and everything changed , and everything changed , and we have this great idea ; we &apos;re going to be at the center of the universe and mysteries and leaving in the creatures and leaving mitizens and leaving in the details .
This was the principle of rational humanism and people started thinking that creativity was completely the ished ines completely .
And for the first time in history , he started to refer to this or one , as an artist as a rather than one with a genius .
And I have to say , I think it was a big herror .
I think that allow somebody , a simple person to believe that you &apos;re like a recipitch as a source , the essence and the source of all mysterneternal and the hins and a very large philuge philosy .
It &apos;s like to ask somebody to enjoy the sun .
Dealform and fully the ego and creates all these expectations on performance .
And I think it was this pression to destroy the artists in the past 500 years .
And , if that &apos;s true , and I think it &apos;s , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do that different ?
Maybe you can go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t sing 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience that we have a scientific suspects on the notion , instead , you do that , you do that , they do that follow people people out of them .
I &apos;m not going to have convince you all about this .
But the question I &apos;d like to ask is -- why not ?
Why don &apos;t you think that way ?
Because it has more sense of everything that ever ever heard to explain the exasperant impredicbility of creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever have tried to do something -- so , fundamentally , everybody here -- you know , you don &apos;t behave .
And , in fact , it can look completely paranormal .
I did this recently , with the extraordinary poetary poeties , who now 90 years old , but it was a poetary for all of life and said that during his childhood in Virginia in Virginia , working out in the fields , and he fellow it , in if a poem , when a poem to the landscape .
He said that it was like a fragorous train train .
And she came up to her landscape .
And he felt it came , because he was tremendous land under its its feet .
She knew to have one thing to do at that point and it was , words , &quot; running as a matters . &quot;
And so he was walking up home and he was following up from this poem , and it wouldn &apos;t have to get a piece of paper and a faster math , while the translate , and it on it on the page .
Sometimes he couldn &apos;t be faster , so correces and correces and correces and correct the house and the loss and the lost and she would continue to get up through the landscape and she would continue to roll through the landscape , looking , as he said , &quot; one more poet . &quot;
Then there were times -- this piece I &apos;m never going to be -- there were times -- there were moments where they were almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was looking for paper and he was looking for paper and he was going to go down and he was going to go , and he said , that he was going to go , and he said , that it was like if you put it together with the other hand .
And he had the poem from the tail and he put it in his body and he went to the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on perfect and intact , but the last word to the first word to the first word .
So when I heard it -- I was crazy , it &apos;s exactly equal to my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conducture !
I &apos;m a moving , and my way of working is ; I &apos;m going to wake up to the same horarian every day and spend on it .
But even I was in my test , I &apos;ve stripped against that thing , sometimes .
And I imagine that many of you do .
You know , even though the job and ideas came from a certain fundamental source I could not honestly know .
And what is this ?
And how can we relate it to do not lose the head , but , rather , rather , what do you healthy ?
For as much as I &apos;m going to be about , the best example I have is the musician , which I interviewed several years ago for a news news .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life was the incarnation of the extra artist , trying to control , trying to control , trying to control , you know , tom-hold species of pulses .
But then he went up , and he went down , and one day as he was driving on a highway in Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
She was going to quickly and all this sent sent sent , this little bag bits , and it comes into its head as it does , and the elusive , and the path , and the wants , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the wonders , and the desident , but not known how to take it .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , it has no matters .
So it starts to feel this kind of old anexing anexiety , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to reach out of this characters .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to go in the panic , he stopped .
It &apos;s been to do the whole mental process and did something completely again .
And he just watched the sky and said , &quot; Scush , I &apos;m not going to be driving ? &quot;
&quot; Do you look like that write a song right now ?
If you really want to exist , you get back to a bit more than when you can take care of you .
You go and important , you know , you &apos;re going to important something else today .
You know , you can bar Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his process worked , he changed after this .
Not work , the job was still hoscure as always .
But the process , and the anexiety that was released when he was practical , the genius that was out of anything else and liberry it back to remove it back to where it came out , and realizing that had to be a whole thing , and it was returned and gone .
but he was wondered , wonderful , wonderful , a conversation between Tom and this external thing that was external and this external thing that was not Tom .
So I heard that story started changing a little bit even where I was working I was already and saved me .
This idea , he saved when I was writing &quot; Manway , &quot; and fall in one of those depth of those disaster disaster , and falls in one of those disaster disaster , and we &apos;re all going to think that &apos;s a disaster , which is going to be a disaster , which is going to be the worse book or never wrote .
Not only bad , right the worst book .
And I started thinking about themselves to throw this project .
But then I remember of Tom who talked to the air and I tried to the air and I tried .
So I went up my face in the hritish and I became my comments to a hand my comments to a hand .
And I said to high voices , &quot; Sences , what we know that if this is not shining my book , it &apos;s not going to be bright , right ?
Because as I &apos;m going to get all I &apos;ve got , I have no more than that I have ,
So if you want it to be better , you have to present and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , I don &apos;t do .
I &apos;m going to writing the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to do , I want to do , I &apos;m presented to do my part , &quot; because -- at the end is , OK -- it &apos;s holding in the deserts of Africa &apos;s North Africa &apos;s deserts , and people would go around the watch of the slams , and sacred sacing music , and hours to the alba .
And they were always magnifies , because the dances were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every once so , it was rarely , something happened , and one of these artists had become actually transfer .
And I know what I &apos;m talking , because I know you &apos;ve all seen it , at a point , a performance .
It was like if the time he stopped , and the walking walk through a kind of left and wasn &apos;t doing anything from the sun , as the 1,000 nights before , but everything was all halls .
And suddenly , it appeared just as a human .
But it was happening in the fire and the illuminated in the fire of divinity .
And when this happened , to the time , people knew what was , they were called it .
They were eating hands and started sing , &quot; Allah , God , Allah , God , Allah , God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Soric night -- when the Morororic south th th was assumption , and they took this habits and with them and print changed in the centuries from &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , &quot; to , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; or , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Allah , &quot; in the flew . &quot;
In Spain , when an artist did something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , &quot; bah , &quot; basic , &quot; basic , &quot; basic , &quot; basic , &quot; God .
And it &apos;s great because we need .
But , the problem comes the day , for the dancing itself , when you wake up and discovered that are the 11 in the morning of Martedesday and I &apos;m going to look at God .
It &apos;s just a mortal with a lot of bad bad to ginocket , and maybe maybe not going to get to the altitle .
And maybe nobody named God still as a glasses , and what is it has to do with rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most painting recognizes to make a creative life .
But maybe not force to be so angosciant if you can &apos;t believe , anzyed , that the most extraordinary aspects of your own .
But you just believe that you &apos;re just going to get data from an unimaginable source of this squid part of your life that you have to go to something else when you &apos;re finished .
And , you know , if we think it &apos;s changing this way .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s sure as I thought about for different months during the workers of the book that I &apos;m going to take soon , the dangerous , I &apos;m going to do it , dangerous , existed , so that &apos;s been doing my graphoping .
And what I have to continue to say when I feel eling electricate from this is , not afraid .
You don &apos;t go down . It only your job .
And that &apos;s going to present you for your part , whatever you can be .
If your job is baling , bought .
If the wine , I asd you assigned decide to leave some kind of wonders , for only moment through your effort , and then , &quot; OK . &quot;
You do , you do the same dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot; Sime ! &quot; Sime ! &quot;
I think we have to teach it .
&quot; Sime ! &quot; Sime , even for the same as well , and later , and later , and later , you know , you &apos;re going to be present .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Yeah !
You know , I talked about some of these projects on the human genoma , what can mean and discovery new genes of genius .
Now , we &apos;re starting a new path : we started digitalize biology and now to start from that digital code we &apos;re going to a new biology phase , design and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing life .
We always tried to ask big questions .
&quot; What &apos;s life ? &quot; is something that many biologists I think I &apos;ve tried to understand various levels .
We tried different approaches , reduce it to the minimes .
We &apos;re digitizens by almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genoma was going to go from the analog world of the digital world .
Now , let &apos;s say , we can regenerate life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome that can authorethorms in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genoma for creating one more more smaller .
We are able to eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 that are here .
But when we &apos;re a look at its metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our .
I think I &apos;m going to do , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it &apos;s very iminate that this can get to a living cell living .
So we decided that the only way to design was synthesize this croms in a way that we could modify the components to bring some of these questions .
And so we started the adventure of &quot; Can we synthesize a croma croot ? &quot;
Can chemistry to make these big molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create before ?
And , in case , we can make a croma cromous chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of inert chemistry .
The speed that we &apos;re able to digitalize life is growing to be exponential rhythm .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , rather slowly , but it &apos;s improving .
And our most recent retails take the exponential curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process has required many past , starting with a bioethical review before the first experiments .
But we found that DNA is very difficult .
There are decades of thousands of machines in the world produces producing small sector of 30 to 50 letters and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the most segment is long , more herrors there are .
So we had to develop a new metod to assembling these fragments and correcting the herrors .
And this was our first attempt , to start to digital information of Phi &apos;s genome of Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , actually , the correction of the errors and get a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
And the interesting part is when we took this piece of chemistry inert and we put it in the bacteria , the bacteria , the bacteria began to read this genetic and producurn .
The viral particles are then , you were released by cells , are come back and they destroyed E.
I talked about recently with members of the oil industry and they &apos;re saying to them that they have certainly compress this model .
They &apos;re saying more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where software can actually build its same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the biggest things .
We wanted to build the whole battery chromosome .
They &apos;re more than 580 mile letters letters .
So we thought we could build it in the size of the virus of the virus , so that we can change the cassette to understand what the components are components of a living cell .
And the design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genoma for the first time in 1995 , the standard was of a mile for every 10 mile .
We found , requency , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence we would never be able to do that work .
One part of the process is designing segments in 50 letters that you overwhelments are going to be read with all the other segments of 50 letters that work together .
We &apos;re going to get one elements here .
You probably have read that we put up the flies .
Think it like this : We have a genetic code based on four letters : A , C , Gs and T.
Three of those letters code together , about 20 adminds , and there &apos;s a specific order of letters for every adminoacid .
So we can use genetic code to write words , fraction , frasures .
What we did in the beginning was self-al-free .
Some of them were dollar by the fact that it wasn &apos;t poem .
We designed these segments to just get them to just join with enzymes .
There &apos;s enzymes that reputting them up and put them up .
And we started assemble , we started with segments , starting with segments from five to seven thousectons of 24 miles , sletters of 24 payments in letters to come to 72 myself to get 72 mile .
We have produced these segments in abundance , so we can sequency them that we &apos;re trying to create a very robust process -- as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems to be a basket played bellone playoff .
When we get to these very long segments , more than 100 mila , more than 100 middle , they &apos;re not going to be directly in E.
It comes to the limit of modern molecular biology &apos;s limit .
So we &apos;ve looked at other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called a homologist , that in biology , which is using to repull DNA can get segments .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism called Deinococcus , it can make three million radiation .
You can see in the square of high as his cromous croma .
In 12 -- 24 hours , 24 hours , it &apos;s before .
There are thousands of organisms that they can do that .
These organisms can get completely caught .
They can live under vacuum .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life in space , and you have moved to find new environments .
It &apos;s actually the real , NASA showed that this happens .
This is an image of the molecule we &apos;ve built using this processes , just using the free segments to put in design segments to put in the segments .
The lievision assemble .
This image was not taken with a electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a tasally big that we can see it with a sligher microscope .
These are pictures that they cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the published we did a little time ago .
They &apos;re more than 580,000 letters .
It &apos;s the biggest molecule than a defined structure of man .
It &apos;s a molecular molecular sperior to 300 million .
If we prove it with a cartoon 10 without spaces , they would like 142 pages to just writing this genetic code .
Now , how do we work it ? How can we activate it ?
Of course , through a virus is a game from kids .
It &apos;s a little more complicated when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s more simpler even when it comes to cells as our eues : you can just extract the nucleo and put it out of them , and put out another , which is practically the process of cloning process .
In the haea , the chromosome is integrated inside the cell , but we &apos;ve recently demonstrated that we &apos;re able to do a complete transplant of a cromous trape of a cell from one cell to another and activate it .
We got a cromous chromosome from a microbial species .
The two are different ones are as the men from the men .
We added some gene gene in more way we decide what you &apos;re going to chromosome .
And then it &apos;s science with the full filled up with the protein .
And when we put it in the cells was study -- and we &apos;re going to appreciate graph -- the new croma -- the new cromous croma .
And we were thinking that we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried anyway to push us .
This is one of the most evolution .
We found that many species have added a second or a third or a third or a third , adding in a thousands of new , in a thousand of new species ,
So who think evolution as a gene as only gene to evolution as a gene , it has no graphed a lot of biology .
There &apos;s enzymes called &quot; restriction enzymes that addrestrial to digerized .
The chromosome that was in the cells not one .
The cellula-in cellula-s-up .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other croma as extraneous material , and we found it with only the cells and the new croms and the new croms .
It became blue because of the genes we have inserious .
And in a short time , all the characteristics of a species have gone up in a new species , based on a new kind of software that we put into the cells .
All the proteins are changed , and when we read the genetic code is exactly what we &apos;ve transfer equivalent is exactly to what we &apos;ve transfer .
Now , this might look like genetic alchemy , but altering the software we enough to change things in a pretty much suspect .
Now , I &apos;ve got a slayer that &apos;s not talking about genesis -- but we &apos;re result by three million and a half years of evolution , and I &apos;ve already said that we &apos;re going to create a new version of the Camboard , and I &apos;ve already to this design process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty obvious when we think about our need .
We &apos;re going to pass six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to give you an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one in 1946 , in 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find food , fresh water and fresh , medicinal and wild for six and a half billion people .
It &apos;s going to be even more hard to do that for nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion barils .
That means a hundred million barbs a day .
When we look for biological processes , or any kind of processes to replaces them , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
We have more we have to realize all the emission of CO2 from these materials that ends up in the atmosphere .
And in today , thank you for the scientific discoveries all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that they are the design components for the future .
The electronic industry is only one dozen about a dozen components , and think about how many different things are come out .
Our limitations are principlly from biological and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , thank you , thank you very quickly , able to create what we call a combinatory genomics .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day .
Think of processing these 20 million different genes or try to get to optimize the processes to optimize the processes to optimize or drugs , we can change , with a little team , and create more biology , and create more biology than in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemistry , chemistry or carburer , production , and production vaccines .
This is an instantly of some software program that we &apos;re working on to be able to sit and design species on the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know , we don &apos;t need to be .
We know exactly what they &apos;re exactly the genetic code .
Now we &apos;re focused on the carbons of how fourth generation .
You also see that you extract ethanol from the grain was a bad experiment .
We have carbons of second and third generation that will come out enough sugar to carburanants of higher value as the opposed or different types of butanol .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without more than food , and the cost of food and limited the cost of food and limitaris would be transforming CO2 in matter , before , where we &apos;re working to design cells that we &apos;re going to add this , and we think we can get the first carbons of how to address this , and we think we can have the first carbons of dioxide .
The sunlight combined with CO2 is a methodom -- but in our discoveries all over the world , we found different metodds .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deepest ocean , about 2500 feet of deeply at the temperature of the water temperature .
It &apos;s creating the CO2 using hydrogen , as a source of energy .
We &apos;re trying to figure out if we can incanalate the CO2 , that can be transported through the tiny , converting that CO2 in carburn , to drive this process .
So , we think we might be able to reach what we might be able to increasing what the basis is that life . &quot; We , &quot; have the goal , &quot; We , versus the goal to replacing the whole obial industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do this from TED , where can you do it ?
It would be a major source of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working to use the same high to create vaccines .
You see this year with influence , we &apos;re always foraged with a year and a dollar year and a dollar when it comes to find the right vaccine .
I think that &apos;s changing combinable vaccines in anticype .
And that &apos;s what the future might start to be changing , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria , and the eucariote .
We &apos;re so much like that , we &apos;re so much better .
Our goal is to make it a way of living enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the most faster than we have brought to Microsoft in the new technology that we brought to Microsoft in a following almost . This is Seadragon . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s a environment where you can interact is at local level that remote with a huge amount of data .
Here we &apos;re seeing a lot of digital pictures with a kind of digital photos with a kind of expensive slums , and I continue , to slide the images as we want .
And not matter how big it &apos;s amazing how big the amount of data or the squid , or images .
Most of digital photographs , but this is a exactly provenise from Bilioteca standing from the Biliotecting gama gama gama gapiel of the Congress .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that you just just just the presents of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen on your screen in any time . It &apos;s also a very flexel architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data not images .
This is the Casolate dest of Dickens . Every colonnaked .
To show you that it &apos;s about the textbook and not images , we can do something like this , to really see that it &apos;s a real realization of the textbook , not a picture .
It may be a little bit artificial to read a book ,
It doesn &apos;t look at the advice .
This is a more realistic example . This is a more realistic example .
Every big image is the beginning of a set .
And it really gives you the full and beautiful experience of a magazine or a daily just-daily version of a junk or a daily drawings .
We also did something with the corner of this number in the corner of The Guardian .
We created a higher fashion -- much higher than that you use in a normal publishment -- and we have a very higher published -- and we have a extra extra extra .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see it .
Or other models , or even specific specific techniques .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the limitations of space on the screen .
We hope that this means purpose to the pop-up and other similar porcheries , they should not be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obviously applications for this kind of technology .
And on this not want to lose time , if not to say that we have contributed to do in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. , they have the geospatial images in the U.S.
So , we &apos;re going to go to something else .
This is actually from view on the web ; you can see it .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragging , and the other one is a searching searches at Noah Seady , a student in the University of Washington , with the help of Steve Seitz and Research Seliski and Research Seliski . It &apos;s great collaboration .
And it &apos;s from the view , on the web , drive by Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can spend from one picture to another and have this kind of experience to multiple solution .
But the space collocation of the pictures here has actually a significance .
The algorithms of visualization have recorded these images together , so that corresponding to the real place to the real place to the real place that imaging -- all close to the lages that -- all close to the Roccioil Mount Roccious Mounds Roccious Mount .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some more environment .
There are some much more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data from Noahes -- and this is from a previous prototype of Photosynth prototype of Photosynth that we &apos;ve done the first time , the last time , the Saish . And it &apos;s not necessarily evident . And it &apos;s not necessarily evident in the website .
We had to worry about legals and so on and so on .
This is a rebuild of a Dedral Caestail . Dothers took Flickr . Bauckr Din Flickr and you get images of typing and pull images in magide , and so on .
So , I have all images that was Flickr and they were all linked to space in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate in this simplication .
You know , I &apos;d never thought I &apos;d ever thought I &apos;d been working for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifying to get this kind of accounts here .
I think you can see that this is a lot of different types of different types of fote , from those cellular cellular phones to the professional slandings , in this environment .
And if I can try and look for more strange .
Many are block , etc .
Somewhere you have a series of photographs -- ecliar .
This is a Nothththreatened correctly .
We can go from the poster to the view of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with the social environment . This is taking data from a hot , the whole hand , from the whole hand , from the point of view -- and connected all those data together .
All those pictures become fully , more than the set of the parts .
You have a ground model of the whole terth model that emerge .
Think about this as a prolunging of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as well as people use it , and the people use it , and the advantages for people who use it .
Their pictures are married with insereous metad-and-up metad-hand , and they &apos;re seeing metadhereas a lot of other people .
If someone comes to the idea of contrast all these sets , and I &apos;m going to get all these several , my picture of Nothtrial to go to dive up with all those data , and I can use it as a point of all those data , and I can use the picture of anyone else , and I &apos;m going to get a picture of anyone else , and I &apos;m going to have a high social experience of anyone else , and I have a cross-moot-fashion .
Of course , a consequence of all of this are extremely elaborate models of the Earth , and it doesn &apos;t only only one of the planet and from satellite images and satellitariarian images and satellitariariarian images and satellitarian .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized what your software will constantly constantly going to be that in the next few years , all of the next few years , all of the world are going to be practically shared in the world will be practically connected together ?
BA : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is basically , it &apos;s discovered .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it &apos;s going to based it at the content of the images .
What becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of set information that many of these images can be possible .
As when you do a research of images on the Web , you get a sentence and the text on the images of the picture .
Now , what if you have happened if you get all your pictures ?
So , the amount of simanttic interconnection and the amount of wealth that comes out of it is really enormous .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really amazing . Compliments .
BA : I thank you very much .
One of the major pleasure when you travel and one of the ethnography research is the power of the power of the people who have not forget the hand-forgotten traditions , between who are winning the wind floating the staks , the drillled in flew .
Bastes thinking that the Jaguar , they still traveling the Via Lattea , or that the Mils ancient ancient ancient , and in Himala , the budddholds , the buddhits , the buddhers , they still follow the central importance of the anthropology , and that the world we live central sense , but it &apos;s only a model , but it &apos;s only a model , but it &apos;s only a model , but it &apos;s only a model , but it &apos;s only a very much ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stirs did , well or a lot of generations that our stirts did .
And , of course , we all share the essential .
All right . We all procreating .
We are subjects in the beginning .
We have to death the inexorability , so it doesn &apos;t surprised us if we sing and ballie --
We all have a art .
What hits is the rhythm is the particular song , the rise of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that they are the Leady &apos;s forests , or the following Sahars , or the following Kaids &apos;s forests , or the warrights of the Kairs , the Curandero , or a camelmels in Sahara .
He was my journey in the desert of journey in the desert value in the value of the Qomolangma , on the Everest , on the Everest , the dea mother of the world .
All of these populations teach us that are other ways of thinking , and other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And if you reflect a minute , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
So , if you do , the cultures of the world create a spiritual life and cultural life that &apos;s a spiritual life that &apos;s important for the planet and it &apos;s important for the planet as a biosphere as a biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural girl as a cultural girl , and you can define the ethnosphere , the whole whole concepts of all the concepts , inspirations , inspirations , inspirations , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , and intuitions .
Ethnosphere is the fantastic patrimony of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be as inquisitive species .
And because biosphere was graveled by as much as it was as much as it was , and unfortunately , and unfortunately .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species was on the extinction of simply , because it &apos;s false , or -- in the higher ipotential -- in the higher ipoothers -- and it &apos;s not even neighborhood in the field of hypothesis , and that the most typical diversity -- that &apos;s the most cultural diversity --
The whole thing is , of course , is , of course , the loss loss .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only a vocabulary or a series of rules , or a series of rules .
A language is the spraised human spirit .
It &apos;s the medium with which the soul of every culture comes into the material world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a bind , a thought-ext lights .
And those 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re sitting in Monterey , at least the half of children .
They don &apos;t come to children , the means , which means , unless you wisn &apos;t going to watch something , that they &apos;re already .
What is more sad of being flown from the silence , of being the last one , of being the last speak , of not to transmit the wisdom of wisdom or to anticipate the promiping of the children ?
This is a fate state of somewhere in the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks : The last squid source of the last silabe of a ancient language .
And I know somebody who &apos;s going to say , &quot; Is it not better ?
The world wouldn &apos;t be a better place if we talk all the same language ? &quot; We all talk all . So we all talk all .
Let &apos;s talk .
You &apos;ll be a suddenly thing you want to say not to talk about your language .
I &apos;d like to do you a journey through ethnosphere --
a little journey in the ethnosphere to give you a kind of thing we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , &quot; when I say , &quot; different ways of exists .
Take for example this Barasana bic bimbo , in Amazon , the population of anaconda , which creates at mixed to come from the side of the lath several sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred .
It &apos;s a population that &apos;s not able to distinguished the blue color , because the green color is identified in forest of the forest , which depends the population .
They have a strange language and a mathemselves , called Lial , &quot; , you have to move a person that &apos;s different language .
And that &apos;s all radical past , in the mythological past , is that in these families that are talking about six or seven languages to cause of seven languages nobody practices any practices .
They limited to listening and then they start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived , the Waoran of Ecuador , an incredible population , an incredible population , an incredible population that had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionaries have tried a contact of a very herror .
They have been going to go from the higher photographs that remained them in a pose poses that this is the population of pluvial forest had never seen anything in bi-dimensional forest .
They collected the ground of the ground , they turned them to look for a shape or a figure , they have conclosed that they were diseases that was diseases , and they kill the five missionaries with the basic .
But the Waorans don &apos;t just kill the straniests .
They were killed with them .
Four percent of mortality was caused by them .
We save up at eight generations and we found two of mortic mortass and when we insisted to know , they have admit that one of them was invected , and then they knew that one was invected , and then they kill it .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps and recognizes the species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned a really interesting task when my Harvard professor was asked for Harvard professor I wanted to go to Haiti in the bottom societies in the base of the power of Duvalialier and Tonton Macouth &apos;s power and Tome , and imposed me of the watching slams .
To give a sense of myraculous , I should have to understand the Vodoun culture and that Voodoo is not magic .
It &apos;s a pretty good , metaphysics of the world .
Very interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimo , Islam , Budddddged , except .
A continent always comes out , when I was left , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no religious faith . And that &apos;s not religious features . And the Voodoo is not religious , very profound deep nthemselves in the tragic deep tragic .
What makes interesting about the doo is the intense intense of life and death .
So , they do hold out .
And the spirits can be invoded by the Grande Aca , they respond to the ride of dance and replaced themselves , to the animate animates in such a very short that we &apos;re going to be a short .
So , the voodooists love saying , &quot; You white you go to God .
We &apos;re giving in the temple and bear and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re possitting , is the spirit you , how can you do the bad ?
So you &apos;re experienced to these incredible events : following trance in state of trance that touches infuriled in a rather strong demonstration rather than the body &apos;s body on the body statement when it &apos;s catalyzed in a state of extremely exciting .
I &apos;m all the people with what I lived the most extraordinary people are the Kogi in Sierra Nevada Santa , in Colombia , in Colombia .
Discending of the ancient civilization , which was once the carairplanning caraise planning carcarbon on the conquist , the popules would be retreated on the massicro-to-to-cop-to-carbon planning .
In a continent of blood continent , this population was never conquered by the pagners .
But I &apos;m government today , I &apos;m government today , and they &apos;re government is very extraordinary .
The young people are taken away from the families to three or four years , and they live in a bailed world and shombs in a world , shombs in the shadows of the ice for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years from nine years to reproduce the nine months that transcorporate in the user of the mother , now are metaphorically in the Grande Mather .
For all this time , they are acculated to the values of their society , values that they predict their prayers and only their prayers the cosmic balance -- or to say the cosmic equilibrium .
And the term of this incredible initiation , they &apos;re improvide up and for the first time , 18 years , they see a high . And that &apos;s in that activity of the first button , and in that activity of the first bails , when the sun sun buts , everything that they &apos;ve learned in theories , everything that they &apos;ve learned in theorem . And the precisely a step back and says , &quot; The precise a step .
&quot; Yeah ? &quot; I prize how I said .
It &apos;s just a further . Now it &apos;s going to protect it . &quot;
It &apos;s called greater frrothers and say that we , brothers , we are the hit of the world .
This intuition of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about indeed populations and environment , we invooown-up populations and the old history of the non-vage , which is a razy concept in its simplicity or perhaps invoded . And we say that these people are closely closely closely , we think of the Earth .
Indigenius are not sentimental population are not sentimate from the nostales .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the malaric paludium or in the winds of the Tibet , but thank you to the time and the rhyths , they &apos;ve created a mystic of Earth , not on the concept of the consciousness of the Earth can only because it &apos;s infected . But it &apos;s the concept that the Earth can only because it &apos;s infected from the consciousness .
What does that mean ?
It means that a mountain of the Ande who grows up to be a swaiting spirit of Apu that will be a deeply different human being depped . And it &apos;s going to be a deeply different and it will have a fun , and that you grow up to a little bit of a Montana who grow up with a mountain is a mountain , and you know .
That &apos;s the demonstrstrstrstrstrstretch or a mineral car is irrelevant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forest of the British Columbia creating forest to be cut .
That made me a different human being different from my friends from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that forests are the forests are the high history of the paradise and the history of the paradise and the history of the world , and the spirits that live in the Hamatsa , and the spirits that are during the Hamateery .
If you start to look at that these cultures can actually create different reality , you can start to understand some of them discoveries .
I &apos;ve taken this picture open in the norockies .
Mayahuge of you have heard about the ehuge sushuge of the repertorium repertowards of the repertoium repertorium .
What it makes the fascinating ehuge is not the potential pharmacological potential , but it &apos;s about two elements .
From a side , this lian lys-carboline series , and harmed harmful high , harminogs and harmed , slightly .
And by making the way , you have a smoke , you have a little bit of the coast , but it &apos;s mixed with the leaves of a house family of coffee family caught with the house of the family coffee .
This plant is a triptamines , very similar to serotonin serotonin five , methoxyle-five , methoxine methoxine .
If you ever see the Yanomami , you &apos;ll see the Yanomami that they do from a different species of species , in the mixed methods of species , which is methodd-methods .
Tirate that poliss on for the nose is a little bit like being disappear by a file pinjected pines and land on a sea sea sea of electricity .
I was often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who wrote the psychedelic , with his discovery of the fungi fungi in the &apos; 30 in Mexico .
I think about my thesis can &apos;t classify these triptaminogens like hallucinogens , because if you &apos;re not telling anybody to be slowed .
It &apos;s possible above orously if you until other chemicals that money are the MAO .
Now , the beautiful hot : the carboline carboline are inhibitors of MAO , the same kind of needs . The same kind of need to be the same kind of thing . The source question : in a 80,000 species of plants , like these are the populations are two deaths , how these are the hot dies of them , but if you combine in this way , they create a version , they create a version that &apos;s time on the squid ?
We use the great eufemism and the mistakes and the mistakes , that can reveal .
But if we ask Indians , they &apos;re going to say , &quot; We talk . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 varieties of ayahuge , which distinguished in the forest , and that the eyes would come in the same species .
If we ask him how they stabilish their tasonomy will say , &quot; I thought I realize it &apos;s plant , you don &apos;t know everything ? &quot; I said , &quot; No .
The solution is : you get the 17 varieties in a note of lyourself and each other a song with a different song .
With this is not laurea laurea , but it &apos;s much more interesting than to count .
Now , &#91; apples &#93; the problem is that even the ones of us who have heart the history of indeed people are paths , but somehow reduce the margins of history in our real world , and it &apos;s over .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it &apos;s not remembered for its wars its wars and technological innovations , but rather as the was where we stopped and we have abbractively , and we have abuntil the wonders of diversity and cultural distraction . Now the problem issue of biological diversity and cultural distressed . Now the problem is not change .
All cultures through centuries were involved in a dance for new possibility .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians don &apos;t have to be Sioux when they put up up in the areas they have been in the areas , as they have to be as Americans have to stop .
It &apos;s not change or the technology that threatening integrity of ethnosphere . It &apos;s the power .
The wall of the domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you &apos;ll discover that these are not destined cultures .
They are creatures and dynamics out of identifiable forces that are beyond their ability of adaptation .
And it &apos;s disbosing disbosystem in the patria of the Penan --
a population namad of Sarawak , in the South Asian , a population , a population forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to a generation ago , and now reducing the rivers of the rivers , where you can see the river free . And the next reward to the switch . And the people &apos;s population , where the sounds like the horizonic ens , where the naveling horizonic the horizonic enlights , and now , and now , and now ,
and filled the stifilled with the stifilled to the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that have come with the discovery of gold .
If we move on the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the wall of the political domination .
As the genocide , the physics of a population , is a condanced at the universal level , but the ethninium of lifestyle , but the indeed of the lifestyle , but celebrated in certain certain in class , because it &apos;s part of development .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering Tibet until you &apos;re not going to be the beginning .
I spent 6,000 miles from Chengdu in the Western China in Western China , came to Lhasa with a young , but only came to Lhasa young , but only came to Lhasa , I &apos;ve realized what &apos;s behind the statistics that we &apos;re hearing .
6,000 literally sacred in the poles and centers .
1.2 million people killed from the military Rvolution .
The father of this guy was absolutely critism in the Panchen Lama .
And that means that it was killed to the time of the Chinese invasion .
His uncle with Santity during Santity during the deaspora that brought the people in Nepal .
His mother was imprisoned and his colpa was recipitch .
It was taken to carry in the age of two hundred years , hidden under its own gonna because it wouldn &apos;t have lived without .
The sister , who did the same , it was put in in reeducation .
It &apos;s a day , he &apos;s walked up a fashion Mao and , for this transgression , was put forced to seven years .
The Tibet of the Tibet can be insatiades , but the redenter of the population is from tener .
And it &apos;s all over , it &apos;s all it reduces .
We want to live in the world world &apos;s world , or we want to take the polycrown-class .
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before we die said that his biggest fear was that , in our lightened vision of the world , we &apos;re going to see the whole world , we &apos;re not only going to see the whole ama limited limited to a hand limited limited to a modality , but one day we &apos;re going to be able to be able to perform .
And it &apos;s a humiliating that our species is , for 600,000 years .
The Revolution , which has given us the agriculture , which has done us to socks to the cult of the seed , and by the slide of the slide , and by the closer , creating the hesarchy of species , and we &apos;re talking about 10,000 years ago .
The industrialized world has about 300 years .
That sharks I &apos;m not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we &apos;re going to dealing with in the millennia to come .
When these cultures of the world &apos;s cultures are asked what it is to be human , they respond to to be human , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we &apos;re all going to find the chance of being what we are : a consciousness , that has to make all the people in way that all the popules and all the gardefense . And there are great moments .
I took this picture on the north extrity of Baffin , when I went to drive with the waiting of the whales with Inuit , and this man , and this man , and this man , and this man , and this man , and he told me the wonn history of her grandfather .
The canadvice was not always gency with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to stabilie our teenagers , we &apos;ve got to colonies .
The grandfather was born of this man refused to go .
And the family , templating for his life , brought him away , and all the arms , and his attractive tactors .
You have to know that Inuit isn &apos;t feel the cold , they &apos;re going to be .
The sleeps of the original sleeps were made of paper sharp .
The grandfather was not intimix from arctimix or the wind night or the blizard night .
It &apos;s under the bag , you went out , and it &apos;s hot the pin the foca and defecated in their hand . When I did them , it &apos;s taken them , it &apos;s working on a light .
She sprayed up on the door of this car , and when he became solid , he was killed , and it was killed a dog .
She was high schools and created a bridge , with the acian actical class , and he gets a sleep on a sleep , and it &apos;s disappeared on the banchisa , and it &apos;s short on the room , and it &apos;s shake on the room , and he &apos;s got a sleep in rest .
We want to talk about cavareas with nothing ? And that , in different ways , in different ways , &#91; Applausi &#93; is the simple resilience of the Indigence population and all the indigence of all the world .
In the open 1999 , the canadvice of the California , the total control of a high territory of California and Texas I had together .
It &apos;s their new patries . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a independent territory . They &apos;re all the mineraries .
One splendigm of how a nation-state can recognize with his population .
And , finally , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious at least to who was in these areas of the planet , makes it not deal with the remote .
For somebody &apos;s home .
They look at the human imagination that are rising the dawn . And for all of these children , as the dreams of these children , as the swimming dreams of these children , become part of the swimming swimming .
Finally , we are National Geographic , we are convinced that political will never come to nothing .
We believe that polemy --
&#91; Applauses are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month our site remains our site remains 35 million visit .
156 countries transmit our television canal canal canal .
Our reviews are slands out of millions .
Our work is to travel in the etnosphere to bring our public in places of beautiful cultural wateres from what they saw and hope , hopefully , hopefully , hopefully , the world will be in the diversity , and we have to find a lifestyle in a pluralistic world , and we have to find a lifestyalist and move style world in a pluralists and must my-wild world and men in a places .
where the wisdom of all the populations can contribute to our well-being wish .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope is about other than you &apos;ve heard and I &apos;m going to evidence some connects , in case , not notes them .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the official dogm . &quot;
The official dogma of what ?
The Dogma official societies of all the Western societies . &quot; The dogma official , &quot; If we want to men the benefits of our citizens &quot; &quot; The way to do it is to move the individual freedom . &quot;
And the reason is , from a side , in the fact that freedom is in itself a value , is precious , useful , for human beings .
As the other one is in fact that if we &apos;re free , each of us can act to do everything that massive , to do everything that massive , and not no one that decide in our well-being , no one that decided to names .
The way to maximizing freedom is to move .
More people are the more , they are more libers , and more , and more is their liberty , more , is their well-being .
This , I think , is so deeply radicated in society that nobody would be able to put it in the society that no doubt .
And it &apos;s also deeply radicated in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;ve got a simple note on the switness for injection .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conducts , without contact on the oil oil . And the 12 howners and 12 acetes that you can buy to make you a huge number of conducting in the research surrounds that nobody 75 proned is to you a huge number of your degrees .
Here &apos;s what the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic store to buy a stereo : case , letters , CD , radio , radio , fleastra , amplifier .
And in this single store of electronics , there &apos;s a big number of audio .
We can make six and a half million different combinations of using the components that there are in one store .
You have to admit that there &apos;s a lot of choice .
Although the world of communications .
Once I was a child , you could get all the services , you could get all the services , at the basic services , at the basic mama Bell .
You just just came out with the phone , you didn &apos;t buy it .
One of that , by the one , by the phone , was that the phone would never get .
These are time .
Now , we have a variety of phones , especially between cellular phones .
Here &apos;s the cellular cellular .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , letters of the naso , and it fornels for the cryle cle car .
If you don &apos;t have seen it in the store under house , you &apos;re just looking for you .
And what &apos;s happening is that people are going to come into the news and does this question . And you know what the answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the purpose of choices , you get the same explosion .
Assistence : Axithan is not going on in the United States and you go to the doctor and doctor what you have to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we can do , or B , &quot; A , &quot; A has these benefits and these goods . &quot; B has these benefits . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Doctor , what would I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; It &apos;s got these benefits and these swites , and these ofs . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebats : &quot; Dr. &quot;
And the doctor : &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
And we call it the autonomy of the malate , &quot; the expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But it &apos;s actually not that a fish and responsibility to make decisions of making something , which is the doctor , to something that &apos;s not known -- and whatever you know nothing -- and it &apos;s not known -- and it &apos;s not in the ideal condition to make the patient decisions that are not the patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing products of drugs , direct to people like me and you , that if you think about it doesn &apos;t have any sense , of that we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why are we going to get them ?
The answer is that they want to ask it . We call the doctor to ask to change it .
Something that is fundamental as our hyentity is horses , as you see in this gades . &quot; We don &apos;t want to force children . They &apos;re going to stand children . They &apos;re going to herited . &quot; We don &apos;t want to make it .
And we can reinvent how many times we do .
That means that every morning , at risis , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I &apos;m putting up to the family and marriage , a time perspective , slides in the most possible , it was that you got the most possible possible , and he was that the most soon as possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , not even when , and not even what to do .
It &apos;s really to play .
I teach at a very intelligence , and I do do their 20 percent in less than a time .
And not because they &apos;re not smart , not because they &apos;re less diligent .
but why are I &apos;m impensieritation , I mean , &quot; Do I would have to go to ? &quot;
&quot; Do I must go more ? I have to think about children or career ? &quot;
They &apos;re interrogorous logorananants .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this implement not the compassionate compassionate and not get a beautiful vote to my exact .
And they have to do that . I &apos;m important questions .
Now , the job : we are lucky , as Carl underolineked , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from Hotel Randolph .
In parentesesis , there &apos;s a angler , and I &apos;m not going to say anybody , where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t say that , because I want to use it .
What does , this mean , this incredible freedom of choice we have about to work ? It &apos;s that we have continuously decide , continuously in every moment , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son play , with the cell phone in a pocket , Blackberry in other , and the task , and the typically , on ginocia .
And even though they &apos;re all spent , every minute that we see our son , we see the partners , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; Do I say , &quot; Do I say to spend this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? I have to wait this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , &quot; it makes the experience of your child , very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , what we look at , we look at , little and big , things , and the lifetime , and life is a choices , life is a choices .
Once the world was this : Over , there were some possibilities , but not all of choice .
The world today looks like this : The dilemma is : &quot; Is it a positive thing ? &quot;
The answer is , we have .
So , we know all know , we know all , so I &apos;m going to talk about negative .
And this choice is two effects in fact , two effects on people .
The first , paradoxially , is that produced paralysis , instead of liberation .
And with many options that are going to get it .
I &apos;m going to offer for you , an example : a study conducted on the plans of volunteer pensive plans .
And a colleagues had access to the data of Vanhead , the gigantic societies , with about a million climents in 2,000 different companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , percentage , the percentage of adjesion , the percentage of two percent .
With 50 funding . With fix , there &apos;s 10 percent in under adesions than they &apos;re available only . Why ?
Because with 50 sourds that he choose , it &apos;s sically hard to decide , and it &apos;s disease .
And at domorders , and again , domorders , domain , and of course , domorders , and of course , domorders , and of course , domorders , and of course , domorders , and of course , domorders , of course , domorders , and of course , domorders , and domorders , and of course , domain , and of course , domain
You know that it doesn &apos;t mean only that these workers are going to eat for dogs because they &apos;re not going to have enough money , they want to say that decision is so hostica that they have more hostic that lost the complementary phyementary of the work .
Not by by putting , they &apos;re losing up to five dollars per year from the work , which would be willing to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be touch .
So , the paralysis a consequence of the having .
And I think that &apos;s making the world .
&quot; And finally , for the eternity : ketchup , feeling or mayonese ? &quot;
You would like that right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and nepure the wrong condent condent condent .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can avoid paralysis and to make a choice , we &apos;re less satisfilled by the result of how we would be with less options .
And that &apos;s for different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of conducting , which you would choose , if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you would have to make a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us , and the repieces that you have to get the decision , and the replant defense it by the decision , and it &apos;s just just just remaining the decision ,
even when it was a good decision .
More choices are , more , it &apos;s easier than any details that it &apos;s insoddle insodged .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call cost .
Dan Gilbert has clear very well practice as the value that we have to depend on what we do is .
Fest , when there are so options , you know , it &apos;s easily representing the characteristics of alternative alternative , and be less satisfilled .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m going to be one . I &apos;m not in New York .
But that &apos;s what you would probably think .
There &apos;s this copy copy .
It &apos;s a place of light .
It &apos;s beach , bag . Otype . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not anything . But what he thought is , &quot; Well , malediition , is August . &quot;
&quot; All my neighbors in Manhattan are away . &quot;
&quot; I could talk about home . &quot;
And it &apos;s two weeks , he &apos;s losing from the idea that &apos;s losing -- every day -- the possibility to go .
The cost-opportunity , it is the satisfaction for what we have , even when the choice was eccellent .
And the more are the options we have to look at the more , the more the features we &apos;re going to go back against as a container opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This vious jet saying a lot of things .
It &apos;s about living the moment , and maybe living slowly .
But the most important point is that whatever you choose , you choose to do other .
The things we don &apos;t choose have a tactivity that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : spiral growth of expectations .
I tried it on my skin bought a new couple of jeans .
I &apos;m going to almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were only one kind of , bought them and bought them , they were scomfortable , and they were sitting , only after I was taken after I was washed to go .
So I went to buy a couple of jeths when the old ones were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Wey slim , fashion , relaxy , relaxy and relaxy ? &quot;
You want them to do it , or with the name or with the slums ? &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; acishashed &quot; ?
&quot; Would you want loved ? &quot;
&quot; Sive the varii , or stricken ? &quot;
I was high , and after a little bit , and after a little bit , I was able to say , &quot; I want the only guy that was , &quot; I didn &apos;t have any idea what I was , so for a hour . I had to do all of the maletheless store , and then I got out of the best jeans I &apos;ve ever had .
It was the very choice . I had all the best . I had the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse for the whole thing is that with all that choice my expectations were perfect , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was tined minime . I won &apos;t wait for anything when it was only one of them , but when there was only a kind of 100 different , steps , at least a kind of perfect .
What I was buy , but not perfect .
And after I was talking about that choose to what I was trying to do was in the expectations .
The add of options in life , it doesn &apos;t do that care about the expectations that these have respect of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options that are .
And this will produce less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the marketing world if it makes it .
Because if they knew , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth looks more like this .
&quot; It was better when you were worse , &quot; The reason why he was better when you were worse , it was better when you were worse , it was that when you were worse , you could even meet surprised .
Egyday , in the world we live -- opulating , opulations , industrialized , citizens with the perfection -- the most of the high expectations are .
You never surprised places because your expectations , my expectations , they &apos;re injected .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Well , expectations . &quot;
I mean -- little self-moment , self-moment , and I &apos;m really saying .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t have to do better ,
But it &apos;s not always good .
And finally , a consequence of jeans swites when there &apos;s only that when there &apos;s only that when you &apos;re not satisfied , and say , &quot; Why ? &quot;
Who is responsible ? &quot; And the answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What could I do ?
When there are hundreds of types , and you buy a insodger , and you ask who is the responsible , it &apos;s as clear that the responsible , it &apos;s just as clear that you are .
You &apos;d have to do better .
With hundreds of varieties , there are no scootes for the indeed .
So when people are decisions , even though it &apos;s willing , you feel insodbed and damage the holds them .
In the last depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think that a significant factor -- not the only one of this depression is that people have experiences of depression is that people have experiences of the standard experiences are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that the colple is them .
So the final result is that in general , we &apos;re better , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it &apos;s false . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt of choice that a little bit better than having . But from this wasn &apos;t derive that much better than a little bit better than a little bit better than a little bit .
There &apos;s a critical value , magical . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m pretty sure we &apos;ve overcome from a piece of the level that choices improve our lifetime .
Now , from political point , I have almost finished -- I &apos;ve almost finished , the noticed is the following .
What it &apos;s allows in the industrial society is the material wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know about it , and you know , the problem isn &apos;t that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too loud .
So the facility I &apos;m talking about is a malbeen malesclusive of modern , recidly societies .
And what it does depressing and arrotate is this : Steve Levitt has talked about yesterday and scomfortable sample sateues for whether it &apos;s uselected . It &apos;s a waste of money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and dispendependent , it &apos;s not that they &apos;re just useful .
I &apos;m going to be deleteries .
They &apos;re going to stay worse .
If a little bit of what in our societies allows , it was revered in those where people have too few possibilities , it wouldn &apos;t just be better , not just their life to be improve but our own lives .
This is what economists call a paretian partian horamming improvement .
A redistribution of the income , and it &apos;s good at all -- not only the poor -- because of this choice that goes up .
To conclude : &quot; basic , you can become everything you want &quot;
You , people , think , you &apos;re thinking , &quot; What does that believe ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t get anything in a glass . &quot;
&quot; A castrated , a limited vision limited vision of the world -- &quot;
and I interpret it , I interpret it , and I interpret .
But then , think , in thinking , instead , I realized that that fish knows the long .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you eat in the books , so that &quot; everything is possible , &quot; you can &apos;t get freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you cut the drive such as everything beautiful decrease .
You get the paralysis , and you reduce the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too strike , maybe even sure for fish , and of course for us .
But the axim of some symbolic symbolic and , I &apos;m feeling , for rhot .
Thank you very much .
