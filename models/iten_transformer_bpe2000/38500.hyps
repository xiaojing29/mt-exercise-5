Last year I showed these slides to show that the cotta calculate glacial glacial , which for almost three million years had the size of 48 continental continental .
However , this underestimate the gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the grid of the ice .
The arcat glacial is , in a sense , the pulsing heart of the global climate ,
You &apos;re expands , and it ritis .
The next slide is going to be a rapid record on the lights of the last 25 years .
The ice lenian has signed in red red .
And as you can see , they expand down to the blue blue .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter , which is the summer of the summer .
You can see that the ice cosidly gglad , of five years or more , it &apos;s like the blood , which is like the blood of the body .
In 25 years , he went from that , and so .
This is a problem because the interests that interested in the arcles around the ocean , where there are enormous amount of congests that , microbes , and they &apos;re transformed in the microbes .
I &apos;m putting to the totality of the atmospheric pollution , that quantity may radical , that quantity may radical , super-h-hand , super-h-out , super-h-out ,
In some of the deep in Alaska deep in Alaska , the metan is already rebecame from the water .
The professorehouse Katey Walter of the University of Alaska was based with a team at the winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : She &apos;s good . The question is if we &apos;re going to be .
A reason is that this term , the term , Greenland from the north .
This is a glacial rumbbasic .
The led was never reached levels .
This is the Kangerlush &apos;s Kangerlush in the South of Greenland .
If you want to know how the slide the sea level of the sea gment of the ice on the terrain , here is where it reaches the sea .
These runs are increasing rapidly .
On the other part of the planet : Antarctars of the planet .
The month , scientists have diclosed that the balance of the ice is in negative , and that the Antarctica Antarctica , which is particularly about some islands in the shape .
Equival six feet of the watching square , like in Greenland .
Sull Himalayas , the third greatest block , you see new laghi , that a few years ago , that a few years ago they were glaciers .
40 percent of the world population is half of the world population is half of water .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the water of this city .
The led was increased .
But when you decrease , it &apos;s the same account water .
In California , the snow on Sierra Nevada is decrease .
The hyrices are in crisis .
The predictions , like you know , they &apos;re graves .
The growth of the city in the world brings to a remarkable increase .
The environmental disasters are increasing a rhythm outside of the normal and without previous .
Four times more numerous numerosses in the last 30 years .
This is an unsustainable thing .
If you look at it in historical context , if you can see the consequences .
We &apos;ve added 70 years we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the area of the East Pacific , from American , to the west , and on both the west parts of Indian , where there &apos;s a radical impoverments , where there &apos;s a radical impovermimic impoverments .
Most of global warming , with deforestation , with deforestation , which is the use of fossil fuels .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worst .
The United States is one of the two more emissions , with China .
And he was proposed to build a lot of other central .
But we &apos;re seeing a direction .
These are the annulled in the last few years and some of the high-green alternatives .
Every , a way , there &apos;s a political lots in our country .
The carbon industries and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon car year to promote the carbon , which is a hosystian .
That picture me up to something --
Very Natal , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a lost of 3.8 billion carbon .
You may have seen it on the news .
This is the second largest scories in America .
It happened around Natal .
The natalized natalized audience of one of the carbon industries .
Video : carbon .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it &apos;s growing our economy .
Fross the carbon is more and more clean .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and the workers are holding the stipenditure .
Al Gore : From here .
The largest society in Massey Coal . This is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I &apos;m going to be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosis , Harry Reid -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima Protection
This is one of them , one part .
Video : At COALergy : At COALergy see the climate change as a sery tiny tiny .
So , for this priority is invested a big amount of money in a very effort to make public effort to make public and confused the carbon .
In fact , the carbon isn &apos;t seeing .
We think it can be clean , it also has a good profumor .
So you don &apos;t preocators of climate change .
Let me do .
Video : Ator : Carbone . You had to talk a lot about it .
So let &apos;s go around a clean in a clean to advancing as much as the carbon as a clean .
Strtraordinary ! The machines are a little noorous , but this is the sound of the carbon technology .
The carbon consumption is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology of clean clean , but the remarkable technology that you see all changes .
Take a look , this is the carbon clean hatch technology .
Al Gore : Inally , the positive alternative alternative question and connected to the economic issue and national security .
Video : Comment America is in crisis ; the economy , national security , national security climate crisis .
The filter that the all of our dependence on fossil of fossil fuels , like carbon and oil .
Now , I have a new audace for it .
Repower : 100 percent flew , 10 years .
A plan to put America to make safer , make us safer , and help to stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that &apos;s basts to solve our problems .
Repower power . Scop .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It &apos;s a holding energy .
One of the fastest ways to bring up the dependence of the combustible that kill our planet .
Computer : The future is here . Vent , sun , just a new network .
She &apos;s got a lot of burn .
Commove : Repower . It &apos;s time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old proverbird is said , &quot; If you want to go to fast , go from alone .
If you want to go away , you go together . &quot;
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED I did a full of the LHC .
And I promised to return you to how the machine works .
So here I was . And for that the other time , there was no LHC is the largest scientific experiment , ever tried -- 27 kilometers of circumference .
Her joined is to recreate the conditions that were present less than a billion second from the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
That &apos;s just the very simply .
This is the machine under Ginevenra .
We pick these mini-Bang in the repair .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- is 44 meters and has a 222 meters .
This is an expectacular image of ATLAS so you can see proportions .
Ten September 10 year we accent the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was cause of festegments in control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first particles of particles who had done all over LHC , both collision , with a collision , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles in the resert .
In other words , when we see that image 10 to be seen , we realized that the machine worked , which is a big vicicity .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to make us exultate more or this , when somebody went on Google and saw that the beginning was this .
That means we had a cultural impact impact over to the scientific .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had to these files here -- these dored files .
These files are 13,000 ampits when the machine works at the most power of the power of power .
Now , the technical technical , they will look at the files and say , &quot; That &apos;s not true . They &apos;re too throw . &quot;
And they can do that because when they &apos;re very cold became the superconducted , superconducted .
So , at less 271 degrees , at a inferior temperature at the star between the stars , these files can bring that runs .
In one of the guntures between the most novemisle in LHC , there was a fabrical difect .
So , the films further , they slightly , and the 13,000 ampings of suddenly met a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think these magnets fishing more than 20 tons . And that &apos;s moved on , and that have moved of about 30 inches .
They &apos;re damaged about 50 magnets .
We had to take them , what we did .
We resisted them and traveled .
Now they &apos;re coming back all of their place sub-war place .
By the end of marzo , LHC is going to be new integrate .
We &apos;re going to accent it , and we expect it to get right or slue , and continuing our adventure to discover what the morning is what the morning is the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these accidents reaccount the debbate on the value of science and engineering . It &apos;s easy to be .
I think that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s so difficult to go beyond the value of things like LHC .
I &apos;d like to end with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , imagine , in the defense of his pullo , his pullo was Michael Faraday , his pullo was Michael Faraday , &quot; Not so dangerous for the progress of the human mind that the ideas of of science , that we &apos;re not mistake up with the progress . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start asking , by the time , from children , playing , as children , playing full morning .
As you reach them and deal with them , and they go and get them , and they learned , and they learned in fact , and resolve problems and manipulating problems and manipulating problems .
And space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , by information , from the uslity of our interaction with physical objects , together my consult Patist , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking me , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of having the mouse of the mouse as a digital , we could have a desktop , we could be on a desktop , we could be a physical desktop ,
and systemars our placement ?
The question was so interesting question was that we decided to explore the answer , by building the Siftable .
In a few words , Siftable is a very very very very very very , very little computer like a beautiful scooks .
In a few words , Siftable is a very very very very very very , very little computer like a beautiful scooks .
You can move them with the hand , they can see , &quot; they can see between them , and they have a movement and they have a radio and a radio wireless .
But above , they &apos;re physical objects , like the morning , you can move just by depth with them .
The Siftable is an example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physical , consciousness , consciousness , and other as we become more physical , of other people , how we move , of other people , how we move them , of the other things , how we can explore new and different style style .
I &apos;m going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configurated to show the video : if you incline it in a direction , the video , it will rotate , if you cline from the other side back .
These interactive reactive realized .
If I shall , they &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re around .
If they come circumstand , they can get a little bit .
If they come circumstand , they can get a little bit .
They &apos;re also going to be their movement and inclinding .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the poter to use community gestures , &quot; a color like , &quot; a color like , &quot; a liquid color as if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable , as a century of the vernice and I can use them to versing color in that central , where they sheep .
and I can use them to versing color in that central , where they &apos;re missing .
If we come too , we can put it up , we can put a little place .
They also have a great possibility of learning , like mathematics languages , mathematics and logic jewels where people can try things , and see the immediately .
Now I &apos;m --
This is a sequence of Fibonaces I do with a program of equations .
We have a words of words that &apos;s half between Scarabeo and Boggles .
Pratically , every turn on every turn in Sift-case on every Siftable , to every turn on a digital , to every Sift-basic , and while certainly , while certainly , and certainly he &apos;s controls a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the kids came up to Media Lab , I did so they were a way they tried them and I spent them and I &apos;ve been a video .
They &apos;re very , very , very , very , very , very , very , they were very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , they &apos;re in a lot of them .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
You just say , &quot; Compons of words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s what other people who try it .
This is our younger , younger , there on the right .
It was actually just implanning them .
They were just morning .
Now , this is an interactive cardboard .
We wanted to build a tooler for the learning of languages . He &apos;s Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , suncable Siftable them .
It can put new characters in the scene , suncable Siftable them .
So , that &apos;s going to be out .
Video : Sun is source .
David Merrill : Now he took a tractor in the scene .
Video : The arange tractor .
Bel job !
So , I schooling Siftable and put them neighbors can be interact in --
Video : Bau !
And , inventing your story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a story with final open , and it can decide him as you feel .
DM : It &apos;s a story with final open , and it can decide him as you feel .
Vink : Volice : Gat .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , realized of recently , to sample and exeded music .
it &apos;s a tool , realized recently , to sample and exeded music .
The Siftable is sound , they &apos;re based , based and battery .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose what we use .
You can also put these sound sound in a sequence to compose your placement .
And modifiing it just touch a &quot; sound &quot; and a sequence . &quot;
These are effects that you can control from the view , like the reverse and the filter .
The attacks at a particular sound and then inclins to be sound .
And then there are the general effects like time and volume , and volume , and they apply to the sequence .
Let &apos;s look at how it works .
Video : DM : We &apos;re going to start with a base in two Siftable . &quot; sequence , we do it in a series , we extend it , we add it in a series , we add other base .
I &apos;m going to put a basic line .
Video : Now I add to some percussions --
Video : And I &apos;m going to put the filter battery , so I can control the effect of the battery .
Video : I can fast faster the whole sequence by by one hand on time from one hand .
Video : And I &apos;m going to add the strength to give more expression .
Video : I can reombing the sequence . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to plan it before , but I can suddenly , making it longer or more cords .
And now , finally , I can smoke the whole sequence by inclining on the left Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is built new man &apos;s built new man &apos;s interface and more more and more like our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some possibilities that we &apos;re looking for bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to transmit is that it &apos;s coming to this new generation of design objects to interact with digital media , that will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time talking to all of you .
I &apos;m a written .
Boes books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the fascine of my life .
And I don &apos;t look like that .
But , said , something particular happened in my life and in my own own life and my career , who took me me to realibring the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is I recently wrote this book , this book called &quot; Manway , &quot; Prega , &quot; Ama , &quot; which , a lot of reason I &apos;ve got a lot of reason books , for some reason that my previous books , and become a big , sensational , besseller .
And the result is that everywhere goes now , people treating me as if I was condanned .
Design -- convicted , convicted .
They &apos;re all right now everyone worried and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t fear more ?
You don &apos;t have fear to continue to write all life without any lifestyle can be able to create a book that can care someone to important ? &quot;
What can you care anybody ? &quot;
It &apos;s rassuring , you know .
But it may be worse , part of that I remember more than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was an adolescent -- I was a adolescent to be a written .
I &apos;m going to meet the same reaction based by the fear .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t get me succeed ?
You don &apos;t fear that the humiliation of the refuse you ?
You have no fear of doing this for all life without any lifestyle that &apos;s ever out and die on a couple of unleft , with the mouth of under the bought full of falliment ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I &apos;ve got afraid of all those things .
I &apos;ve always been afraid .
And I have a lot of other things that people can &apos;t inate .
As the floor and other things .
But , as much as I thought and ask me , what I thought and ask me , I ask me , is why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logical that everyone has been waiting for being spaved by a job that you feel like you hear .
But what &apos;s about so particular in the creative engaging to make us nervous health about mental health , in a way that other careers do not ?
Like my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don &apos;t remember a once of one in his 40 years of activity that he was asked if you fear engineer ?
It was never -- that block of John engineer , like ?
It wasn &apos;t that , you know ?
Onestly , the chemical engineers like group have not , in the centuries , in the centuries , in the centuries , depressive manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manivers .
We have this reputation , we have enough this reputation , and not just writers , but creative of all gender , we have this reputation of being enormously instable .
And it &apos;s not not going to look at the contegrated trists of the magnific death of the magnificent minds that , just in the 20th century , they died young people .
And even the ones that have not suicidated seems to be really disggglasses from their dons .
Norman Mailer , before he died in the last interview said , &quot; Every book kill me a little bit more . &quot; A very little more . &quot; A extraordinary deceper about work .
But not bad when we hear it to say , because we &apos;ve heard these things that are so long that we &apos;ve been completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering the copy , and it &apos;s somehow bonked and the art , it will always conduce the city .
And the question I want to get to everybody here today is : are you agree with this idea ?
You &apos;re good at all this -- because it &apos;s also looking at it from a centimeter of distance to me , not good for anything that suppose .
I think it &apos;s odiosa .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous , and I don &apos;t want to see the perpetuate in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our big creative minds our creative minds to live .
And of course , I know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start figing towards that feel of suppositions , above the circumstances that I &apos;m in my career .
So , really -- I look , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;ve got about 40 years .
I have still about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything write about this is going to be judged by the world as the work that came out of my last book .
I &apos;m going to be watched , because we &apos;re all over the most friends of my greatest success is to my house .
Oh , Gesus , which I thought .
You know this is the kind of thinking that &apos;s brings a person to start bing gin the morning , and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would stop doing this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how do you ?
And so it looks like , after a lot of reflection , which is a way to be able to write is to create a psychological construct , OK ?
I have to have some way to find a distance of security between me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxiety of what reaction is going to get out of the last last last last last year , and I was looking for all last last last last last last year , looking at how to find other society to see if they could have some some more ideas and more healthy and more healthy healthy and more healthy .
about how to help people cut the emotional inerents risk of creativity .
And that research took me to the ancient Greetness and ancient Rome .
I saw me because I play in circle and then back .
Nelantics , the ancient Greety and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity is from men , OK ?
They thought creativity was this spirit of the beautiful died and save man to the man somehow distant man and unknown for distant reasons , distant reasons .
The great-hand-to-laws of creativity , &quot; demons . &quot;
Soke , wonderful , it was believed to have a demon that wisdom .
The Roman were the same idea , but they called the kind of spirit without body genius .
which is great , because Romans didn &apos;t think that a genius was someone particularly smart .
They would have a genius was this kind of divine that was a divine that they created literally in the walls of a artist , a little bit like Dobby , and what Dobby , and he came out to high assisted , and model the result of that work .
Here &apos;s a worth -- here is , that &apos;s the distance of which I talk -- that psychological construct that protection from you to the results of your work .
And everybody knew that was what was , right ?
So the antic artists were protected by certain things , like , too much , like , too ?
If your job was exceptional job was not to take all the full , everyone knew that was helped by this genioral genioral .
If your job your job , it wasn &apos;t all beautiful all your , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be an incapable .
And so people have creativity in the West creativity in the West for a long time .
And then the Renaising came and everything changed , and all this big idea ; we pull the human being at the center of the universe , and the misteries and no longer and left in the misteries and no longer and left in the divinity .
This was the principle of rational humanity and people began to think that creativity was completely from the isse divide .
And for the first time in history , he began to refer to this or that artist as a genius , rather than a person with genius .
And I &apos;ve got to tell you that was a big herror .
I think that we allow someone , a simple person to believe that I as a degree as a source , the essence and the surprising of all mysters , creative , unknown and etern is a lot of light-hand-to-to-like , a lot of people to be a big philanthough to be .
It &apos;s like someone to go to the sun .
Deform and completely distort completely and creates all these expectable .
And I think it was this pression to destroy artists in the past 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think it &apos;s , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do that different ?
Maybe I can come back to a more ancient comprehension of humans .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t sing 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people between the audience who would have a scientific substitutes on the notion of , income , do that , they do people , by sfit , and they do that , they do .
I &apos;m not going to talk to you all about this thing .
But the question I &apos;d like to ask is -- why not ?
Why don &apos;t you think it ?
Because it has more sense of all other thing that has ever heard to explain the exasperant of the exasperant process of creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever have tried to do something -- so , fundamentally , everybody here -- you know , you don &apos;t behave rationally .
And in fact , it can be a fully paranormal .
I &apos;ve done this met with the extraordinary poetry Ruth Stone , who now 90 years , but it was a poetic for all life and said that during his childhood in Virgy , working out in Virginia , working out in the Virginia , and he felt it , within a poetry to the landscape .
He said that it was like a fragorous train .
And she came up with her landscape .
He felt it , because he was tremendous to be under his feet .
He knew to have one thing to do at that point and it was , words , words his running , &quot; run . &quot;
And so it was running out of this poetry , and he was wouldn &apos;t have to be able to make a piece of paper and a faster math , while the translated , while the trapart and deal it on the page .
Sometimes he couldn &apos;t be fast , so correct and correct and correct without having to get in the house and the poetry it through the lost and she would continued to roll through the landscape , and he &apos;s going to continued through the landscape , and he said , &quot; another poet . &quot;
Then there were those times -- this piece I &apos;ll never forget it -- there were some moments where the standing almost , you know ?
So , he was running home and he was looking for the card and the poetry and paper them through , and he was a writing in the way he was spending , and he was like , and he was like , and he was like the other hand and and they shoot .
He had the poetry to the poetry and put it in his body and put her in the page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be presented on perfect page and intatta , but the contrary to the first word .
So when I thought , I &apos;m crazy , it &apos;s exactly the same thing to my creative process .
Not all of my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conducture .
I &apos;m a move , and my way of work is ; wake up , every day and to work and spend on and work and spend on it .
But even I , in my test daggin my testardage , I &apos;ve been striped against that thing , sometimes .
And I can imagine that many of you did .
You know , even if the job and ideas came up with me , and the ideas were given from a certain source I could not know it .
And what &apos;s this thing ?
And how can we relationto it in a way that we don &apos;t do to lose the head , but , rather , what do you do ?
For how much it &apos;s about , the best example of me , the best example , I have a Tom Waits , which I interviewed for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life was the incarnation of the artist remented artist , looking for control , to try and control , to try and control , dominate these species of totally interested in .
But then he was driving , he was driving on a highway in Los Angeles , changed it all for him .
He was going to be fast and all of a sent sent this little sent , that &apos;s coming into his head like inspiration , and elusive , and the various , and the vodd , and the vodd , and the voice , but you don &apos;t know how it .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , it has no matter .
So he starts to feel this species of old anxopy in him like , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to go obsessed by this song .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to the panic , he stopped .
He gets the whole process and did something completely again .
And I just look at the sky and said , &quot; Scause , you know , I &apos;m not seeing that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; You know , it seems that write a song right now ?
If you really want to exist , you know , you get a more time when I can take care of you .
Although , you go to important something else today .
You know , Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his process worked changed after this .
Not the work , the work was still hoscure as always .
But the process , and the heavy , that was repair was repair when he took the genius , the genius that was out of him caused anything else , and liberated it back where it came back , and remained that it didn &apos;t have to be a interiorized thing .
but it was a little bit of a further wonderful , wonderful collaboration between Tom and this strange thing , and this strange thing , and external thing that was not Tom .
So , I felt as I felt as much as I was working on and already , and he save me once .
This idea , he save me when I was writing , &quot; Manway , &quot; Ama , &quot; and falling in one of those dispersed cave where we all work on something and we can &apos;t start thinking that that &apos;s a disaster , which is going to be a disaster , which is going to be a disaster , which is going to be the worst ever written .
Not just book , just the worst book wrote .
And I started thinking about to themselves to throw this project .
But then I remember of Tom who talked to the air and tried to you .
So I went up to my face in the house and I bdirest my comments to a hangle of the room .
And I said , &quot; Spink , &quot; Spelse , both , both of course , if this book won &apos;t be very much , very shall ?
Because as I &apos;m seeing us everything I have , not more than that .
So if you want to be better , you have to presented you and do your part .
Okay . But if you don &apos;t , you know what , I don &apos;t do anything .
I &apos;m going to go to write the same because it &apos;s my job .
And I &apos;d like to favor that was recorded that I &apos;ve been presented to do my part &quot; because , it &apos;s so , OK -- in the desert of the North Africa in North Africa &apos;s desert , and sacred music , dance and sacred music sacred music , dance and hours to the treat the top and hours .
And they were magnific , because the dancer were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every long time , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists had actually become transcending .
And I know what I talk about , because I know you &apos;ve all seen it , at a performance .
It was like if the walking , and the dancing ballerin a kind of laptop and walking nothing different from the usual , like the 1,000 night before , like the 1,000 nies before , but everything was all .
And suddenly , it doesn &apos;t just like a human .
But it happened from the divince and under the divinity of divinity .
And when this happened to the time , people knew what was called it with her name .
They were broken and they began to sing , &quot; Allah , God , Allah , God , Allah , God ,
That &apos;s God , you know .
And he was a historical historical -- when the Momorrow south Spain , they took this habits and pronounded the unit changed in the centuries of &quot; Allah , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; , &quot; Okay , &quot; in the flow . &quot;
In Spain , when an artist did something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , oh , oh , oh , oh , good , Allah , magnificent , etches -- a God scorce .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes the dancing day after , to the dancing himself , when you wake and discovered that are the 11 in the morning of Martedesday and the God is not much .
It &apos;s just a death with a lot of bad to the knees , and maybe not able to be able to get to the height .
And maybe no God &apos;s still while he &apos;s gone , and what it has to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most sweet recognciliations to make a creative life .
But maybe not to be so angosciant if you can &apos;t believe , anzycles , that the most extraordinary aspects of your being coming from you .
But credit just that you have data in the focus from a unimaginable source of this source of your life that you have to then someone else when you &apos;ve finished .
And , you know , if we think it in this way .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s certainly like the I thought for several months in the book that I &apos;m going to be present , the dangerous , spaveats , so I was a dangerous success .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel electrized by this is , not having fear .
Don &apos;t be beaving you . It just your job .
Continuates you presented to your part , whatever it can be .
If your job is balling , bat .
If the divine , absurd genius , assigned decide to leave some kind of wonderful kind of wonderful , for one moment through your effort , then , &quot; Yes ! &quot;
Although , you do that yourself .
And &quot; Okay ! &quot;
I think , and I think it &apos;s got to teach it .
&quot; You know , &quot; at you . &quot; At it , just for having had love and test test taps that you &apos;re going to introduce you to present you continually .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Okay .
I &apos;ve already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , about what it can mean and the discovery of new genes of genes .
Now we &apos;re starting a new patent : we started digitizing biology and now start from that digital code we &apos;re both in a new phase of biology , designing and synthesizing and synthesizing life .
We always tried to ask big questions .
&quot; What &apos;s life ? &quot; is something that many biologists I think they &apos;ve tried to try to various various levels .
We tried different approaches , reducing it to minimes .
We &apos;re digitizing for almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was to spend from the analog world of the digital world of the computer world &apos;s digital world .
Now , we can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species of genome that &apos;s the species of genome that can self-ap-by-ap-bycopy .
And we tried to reduce the genome of them the genome to create a smaller .
We &apos;re able to eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 that are here .
But when we have a look at his map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our own .
Credet , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can be eliminate , one at a time , it &apos;s very improbable that this can get to a living cell .
So we decided that the only progress in the way that was synthesize this croma in way that we could modify the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
So we started the adventure of &quot; we can synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Can the chemistry to produce these big molecules that we never have to create before ?
And , in case , we can make a chromosome chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a chemical piece of inert material .
The speed that we can digitalize life is growing up to exponential .
Our capacity of writing the genetic code , rather slowly , but it &apos;s better .
And our recent recent retaken the landscape to a exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process has required a lot of past , beginning with a bioetc review , before the early experiments .
But we found that DNA is very hard .
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that producing small security of DNA , of the long , of 30 to 50 letters and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the most errors , more errors there there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assembly these fragments and correct the errors .
And this was our first attempty , to start from digital information of Phi &apos;s genome of Phi &apos;s genome of Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
We did the fragments , actually designed the correction of errors and got a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material chemical material , and we put it in the bacteria , the bacteria began to read this genetic , and produced the viral particles .
The viral particles have been released by the cells , they went back and destroyed E. it .
I &apos;ve talked about the oil with the piece of the oil industry and they say that they have a model .
They review more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where software can actually build his same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the largest things .
We wanted to build the whole cromosoma of bacteria .
They &apos;re over 580 midddletters of genetic code .
So we thought we build it in the cassette of the virus of the virus of the virus of a virus , so that we could change the components of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accuracy was a mile for every 10 mile base for every 10 mile base .
We &apos;ve discovered , we would have a 30 errors . If we used that original sequency we would never be able to be we would be able to do that , we would be able to do that ,
One part of the process is designing segments about 50 letters that they have overlap with all other segment of 50 letters to build under smaller , and they &apos;re going to make smaller subject .
We &apos;re going to see one .
You know , you know , you know , we look at the free fighter .
I think that &apos;s a genetic code based on four letters : A , C , God and T.
Three of those letters code together about 20 adminds , and there &apos;s a specific admind-letters for every amminacid .
So we can use genetic code to write words , frasash thoughts .
What we did in the beginning was self-caught .
Some were delivered by the fact that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
We &apos;ve got these segments to be able to just join with enzymes .
There &apos;s enzymes repair them and put them up .
And we started assembling parts , beginning with segments , beginning with segments from 2,000 letters , in a way that they form 24 mile letters .
We made these segments , we made these segments in abundance so that we could sequenced that we &apos;re trying to create a very robbust -- as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatize process .
So , this seems to be a basket playoff .
When we get to these very long segment segment , more than 100 middle basis , they won &apos;t grow directly in E.
You get to the limit of modern tools of molecular biology .
So we consider other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called a homology , which is a homology that in biology repair DNA can get the segments .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus , it can make three million radiation .
You can see in the superior as his chromosome cromosome is destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s reassembled exactly as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that they can do it .
These organisms can come out .
They can live under vacuum .
They &apos;re absolutely sure that life in space , and you move to new environments of water .
NASA , NASA showed that this happens .
This is an image of the molecule that we built using these processes , just using the free segment with the appropriate design of appropriate segment .
The free ables them . The automatically .
This image was not taken with a electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a very big molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that cover a period of six seconds .
This is the publishing we did a little time ago .
They &apos;re over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the largest molecule of a defined structure .
It has a molecular molecular sent to 300 million .
If we prove it with a 10 cartoon 10 without spaces , they would like 142 pages to just transcriting this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ? How can we active it ?
Of course , you know , you have a virus is a girls .
It &apos;s a little more complicated when they use bacteria .
It &apos;s simpler , even when it &apos;s about the eukariotes like our : you can just extract nucleo and insert another , which is practically the clonically process the clonically process .
In the bacteria , the cromosome is integrated integrated integrated by the cell , but we &apos;ve just shown that we can do a complete trape of a cell cell , and activate it .
We had a chromosome ches a chromosome species .
The two are different men from the topes .
We &apos;ve added some genes in more way that we decide what you can choose for this croma .
The time , he &apos;s slightly with the funny so it &apos;s proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was study -- and you &apos;re going to be a software -- and we &apos;re going to be a new croma -- the new cromosome croma .
And we were , we thought we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we have tried anyway to push us more .
This is one of the most evolution of evolution .
We &apos;ve discovered that many species have added a second or a third chromosome somewhere , adding in a second thousands of new , which species .
So who thinks about evolution as a only gene at time that evolution has no understanding a lot of biology .
There &apos;s a scientist of restriction called &quot; restriction &quot; that addrestriction , they &apos;re dealing .
The chromosome that was in the cell not a cell .
The cell phone that &apos;s cell phone that we have a hert .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other croma as an extraneous material , and we found it with just the cell and we found with just the cell and the new cromosome .
it became blue because of the genes we &apos;ve been inserted .
And in a short of time , all the characteristics of a species have gone lost of a new species , based on a new species , based on the new software that we in the cell .
All the proteins are changed , membranes have changed , and when we read genetic code equivalent to what we &apos;ve spent you .
Now , this may seem genetics , but altering the DNA software , we can change things in a pretty much such way .
Now , I &apos;ve been explained that here is not talking about genesis -- but progress to go from three million years and a half million years of evolution , and I said that we &apos;re perhaps to create new version of the Cambrian explosion this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty obvious when we think about our needs .
We &apos;re going to spend six billion people to 9 billion next 40 years .
Gust for example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one existing in 1946 ; in 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medicinal and clean , medicinal and beneath for six billion people .
It &apos;s going to be even more hard to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion barrasses .
That means million barrels a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replace them , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
We have to convey emission of CO2 from these materials that end up in the atmosphere .
And today , because of the scientific discovery in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that they are the design components for the future .
The electronics of the electronents of a dozen about components , and think about how many different things come out .
Our limits here are principlally from biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , because of these synthesization of synthesization , that we call combined genomics genomics .
We &apos;re able to build a big robots that can make a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day .
Think of processing these 20 million different genes or try to try to get the processes to make the processes to make a little team , new vaccines , we can change , because of a little team , and create more biology , molecular biology , and create more biology that in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , production , chemical or carburn , or carburing , production vaccines .
This is a few software programmed on which we &apos;re working on to be able to set and design species .
Well , we don &apos;t know it necessarily as they are .
We know exactly what they &apos;re genetic code .
Now we &apos;re focused on the carbons of how quarter generation .
You also saw you that extracting ethanol from the grain was a window experiment .
We have second and third generation that will use enough , which is they &apos;re going to be high higher in the higher value as the eigh-different types of butanker .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increasing more food impact with no increasingly more food , and limiting the availability would be transforming CO2 in matter , before , which we &apos;re working to design cells that they can reach this scale , and we think we could make this puring , and think we could think of we could have the first carbons of how much generation in about 18 months .
The solar light combined with CO2 is a methodom -- but in our discovered all over the world , we found different metothers .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , at about 2500 feet depth of the water temperature of the water temperature of the water .
It &apos;s created by CO2 using a molecular hydrogen as a source of energy .
We &apos;re trying to figure out if we can sing CO2 , which can easily be transported through the touts , convert that CO2 in carburn , to drive this process .
So we think we can increase to think that we can increase to increase what the question of what the basis of life . &quot; We , &quot; We , &quot; &quot; We , &quot; have the goal , we have the goal , we have the modest of replacing the whole oil industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do that TED , where can you do that ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working on to use the same methods to create vaccines instantaneously .
You &apos;ve seen this year with influence , we &apos;re always always back a dollar in a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s a dollar vaccine .
I think that it can change and built vaccines in anticype .
Here &apos;s how the future could start by changing , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria , archathetic , archeukariote .
We &apos;re so much better people .
Our purpose is to do so much enough to try to try to make it . Thank you very much .
I &apos;m going to show you , the most rapidly possible some fundamental job , of new technology that we took to Microsoft in the way to a very quickly budaily a year ago . This is Seadron .
It &apos;s a local level that you can interact is at local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data .
Here we &apos;re seeing a lot of digital photos that digital photos with a kind of expensive zooms , and continuous , for a bread , digital fast , disponing the images as we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big it is , how big these data or images .
Most of digital photographs , but this is a example of a scan , but this is a scan from Bilioteca , and it reentrepreneurs of the Congress , and it &apos;s 300 megapiel .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that &apos;s the only thing that &apos;s the number of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen in any time . It &apos;s also a very flexel architecture .
This is a whole book , you don &apos;t have images .
This is Dickens . The Casolate desolate is . Every column is a capital .
To show you that it &apos;s about heads and not images , we can do something like that , to see really , that &apos;s a real representation of the text of the head , not a picture .
It may be a little artificial way to read a book electronic book .
I don &apos;t have to be advice .
This is a more realistic example . This is a lot of The Guardian .
Every big imagery is the beginning of a seeding .
And it really gives you the pleasure and beautiful experience of a reverse or a journey of a journey or a journey , which is for nature a lot of medium .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the Guardian .
We made a higher advertising fashion -- much higher than that you use in a normal advertising -- and we &apos;ve been putting you in the extra normal content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even specific specific .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that that means to put pop-up and other synthetic doors , they should be a more .
Naturally , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on that I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say that we have contributed to this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. , it &apos;s geospatial imagery of NASA .
So , we go now step to something else .
This is actually actually from the view on the web ; you can see it .
This is a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadraggon , and the other is a visual research computer very interesting by Noah Snavely , a student in the University of Seadly , with the help of Steve Seitz , with the help of Steve Seadroptic Research .
And it &apos;s from the view , the Seadroptied .
You can see when we do this , when we do this kind of screen , where we can spend from another image of experience and having this kind of experience .
But the location of the images here has actually a meaning .
The algorithms of the computer visualization have recorded these images together , so that they corresponds to the real place where the imaginions of the real scaces -- all the neighbors , and all the closed Montagne Roccial Montagne Roccial Montagne Roccial -- they were scacross the elements of a slide-stening .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data set of Noah-hand -- this is from a previous Photosynth that we &apos;ve done in Photosynth , we &apos;ve done in the first time , the last last time , the last last summer -- to show you what I think is really the key depending on the webosynth . And it &apos;s not as you need to look at the environments that we have seen in the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a rebuild of Nothtrial Nothtrial . Dothers Flickr . Bast Din Flickr , and you get images of types and you get images of shirts and so on . Each of these , represents a picture that &apos;s discovered a image that &apos;s discovered a image that &apos;s discovered a image that you have been discovered to this model .
So , I &apos;m all images that Flickr , and they were all connected to the space level in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate very simplication .
You know , I would never have thought to finish working for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifying to get this kind of account here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of focus , from those of the cell phones to those professional cell phones to the professional those professional cellphones to the grateues .
And if I can , try and try and look for those more strange .
Many are block , etc .
Sometimes here is a series of photographs -- etles .
This is a Nothtrial Nothtrial .
We can go from the poster to the view of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the ential memory of how the earth , from the interior , vision -- and connection point of view -- and connecting all those data together .
All those pictures become linked , more than the size of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the such of the such of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum .
You have a model of the entire land model .
Think of this as a prolungment of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as well as people use it , and the people use it , and the advantages for the people who use it with use .
Their pictures are married by other people .
If someone comes to the idea of contrassignment all of these sets , say , my photograph of Nothtrial to be a Nothtrial to be in that space , and I can use as a point of all the data , and I can use as a point of immerged , in that space , in that way , and have a social experience of anyone else , and having a social experience of cross-like cross-mothers and cross-modity .
Naturally , a consequence of all that are extremely elaborate model of every interesting part of the earth , you college not just by the airplanes and satellitarian images and satellitarian images , but from the collective memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What your software will be doing is that software will be doing is that at some point , in the next few years , all of the photographs shared by anyone in the world will be practically connect together ?
BA : Yes . What &apos;s basically what &apos;s doing is basically .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of seeing of seemed information that many of these images .
As when you have a research of images on the web , you flighting a sentence and the heads has a lot of information about the pictures .
Now , what if that pictures lines all your pictures ?
So , the amount of seemed interconnection and the amount of wealth that &apos;s really enormous . It &apos;s a classical classical effect .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible . Compliments .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure , when you travel and one of the research of the research of the research of the traditions , between the days , between the wind of the wind , the touches in the wind , the touches , the touches , and it &apos;s the plants .
Baste me think that Jaguar traveling still further the Via Lattea , or that the Via Lattea , or that the Mths of Inuit , and that the budget , and in Himalayas , the budget of Dharm , to remember the central importance of the central important , and the idea that the world that we live in the world that we live in the world that we live in the world that we live in a model , but it &apos;s just a model of reality , but it &apos;s just a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of adaptative that our stirs did , well or a lot of generations that our stirts did .
And , of course , we all share the essential .
Everybody . We all procreates .
We &apos;re subjects in the beginning .
We have to death the inexorability of death , so not surprises if we sing and ballim and ballim --
We all have a art .
What hit is the particular rate is the particular rate of cancer , the dance of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that they are the Penan forests of Borneo , or the followed of Haiti , or the Sahars of the Kaisut , the Curander , or the Saharan Curander , or a cameleras in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my journey of journey in the desert a month ago , or a hallever of yak in the values of Qomolm , on the Everest , dea mother of the world .
All of these people teachers teach us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , and other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking ,
And if you reflection a moment , it &apos;s a concept that it can give you hope .
Insigned , the myriadians in the world creating a spiritual life and cultural life that &apos;s been well-being , and it &apos;s important as a biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural girl as a cultural girl , and you can call the etnosphere the sum such of all the concepts of all the concepts , dreams , inspirations , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , and intuitions , ideas , as you can be from the same as a consciousness .
Eetnosphere is the fantastic patric of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be in as a species .
And because the biosphere was graved as much as it was as well as it was successful to the ethnosphere and much rapidly .
Nobody , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species has been on the extinction , because it &apos;s failure , or -- in the most apocalyzed , in the most apocalyzed , in the most of the biological diversity -- and not even near ipowered to the most typical hypothesis -- that of the cultural diversity of cultural diversity .
The index of that is , of course , the language .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only composed by a vocabulary or by a series of rules .
A language is the spraised of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle with which the animal of every culture is coming into the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a backin , a spiritual ecosystem .
And those 6,000 languages , while we &apos;re sitting in Monterey , at least half not susdeed in the ears of children .
They don &apos;t come from children , which means , which means , not not wonder that won &apos;t wasn &apos;t wasn &apos;t train anything , which they &apos;re dead .
What is more sad than being happened by the silence , of being the last one language , of being the last one language , not having a way to transmit the wisdom of the wisdom ?
This is a full state of somewhere in the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks . And it &apos;s a little bit of a ancient language .
And I know somebody will say , &quot; Isn &apos;t that ?
The world wouldn &apos;t be a better place if we talk all the same language ? &quot; We all talk to yoruba , then we all talk to yoruba .
Let &apos;s talk to the kogi .
You &apos;re going to be a suddenly thing to say , you know , you can &apos;t talk about your language .
I &apos;d like to do a journey through eded ethnoshere --
a little journey in ethnosphere to give you a little journey of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , &quot; different ways of existing , there &apos;s really different ways of existing .
We take for example this Barasana Barasana , in Amazon , Amazon , the population of anaconia , which creates at myth to try to try to try from the latt of several sacred sacred sacred sacred .
It &apos;s a population that &apos;s not able to distinguished the blue color , because the blue color is identified in the forest , which depends the population .
They have a strange language and a marriage , depending with language , &quot; literally &quot; : you have to move a person who talk a different language .
All this radical past , mythological past , but the particularity is that in these exists that are talking about six or seven languages because of the mysts that any practice nurseven languages anybody practices a language .
They &apos;re limited to listening and they start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I &apos;ve lived , the Waoran of Ecuador Eastern Eastern Eastern , a population , an incredible population , a incredible popular population in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionaries have tried a contact that was a commodity .
They &apos;ve been doing that , they were going to get out of the photographs that they were loved , forest that this popular population that this popular popular forest had never seen anything .
They took the earth pictures , they turned them to the research of a shape or a figure , and they didn &apos;t find anything , they have been diseases that they treated disease , and they kill the five .
But the Waorans didn &apos;t just kill the straniests .
They were killed with them .
Fi54 percent of mortality was caused by them .
We &apos;ve found two cases , and we found two cases of natural death and found two cases of death , they admit that one of them was so much aging , so they were so invested that one of them was so invested that one of them . They had a very incredible knowledge of the forest .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urin the animal , and recognizes the species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned a very interesting tassignment when my Harvard &apos;s professor asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to intrue in the secret of the secret society of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutside of Duvalier and Tonton Macought to the home of the band .
To give a sense of the miraculous , I should have Vodoun culture . And that Vodoun is not magic .
It &apos;s a very much of a metaphysics of the world .
Very interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianism , Islam , Buddism , etc .
A continent is always always left out , by thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has no religious . And instead , and Voodoo is not religious , that the distilled of the nails of the ground religious religious , schiavism .
What &apos;s interesting is the intense is the intense between life and death .
So , the living spirits .
And spirits can be invoded by the Great Aqua , they answer to the rate of the dance and replace temporary to the anima very , so that for a short anima very short , which is the followed .
So , the voodoohisti love to say , &quot; white you go to God .
We go to the temple and become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re posset , is the spirit that you , how can you do you do the bad ?
So you &apos;re assist these incredible events : follow voodoo in state of trance that touches infuocated a rather stripped a rather strong demonstration rather than the body &apos;s mind when it &apos;s catalyzed in a state of extremely exciting .
I &apos;ve all been the people with which I lived the most extraordinary the most extraordinary Kogi in Santa Marta , in Colombia . Colombia .
Does it &apos;s a tyrange of the ancient civilization planning caraibon the caraic plants , the population was roughly routed on the willing vulcanic , that population on the carbon planture .
In a continent continent of blood , this population never been conquered by the spagners .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m governed to be a cler , but they &apos;re their forming formation is really extraordinary .
The young people followed away from the families to three or four years , and they have secrets in a world that was good hombs and shombs in the basic basic and basic in the basic , for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years , the nine years of the nine months of gestation , and they trouble in the mother of mother , now are metaphorically in the Great Mther .
For all this time , they are acculated to the values of their society , values that they predict their prayers and only their prayers , they keep the balance -- or for the balance -- or for the balance .
At the term of this incredible initiation , they &apos;re suddenly brought out and for the first time , 18 years , they see a little bit of the first burn , when the sun burance , the bad , when the sun buts the bad bad , when the sun buts the values of beauty , and it &apos;s all that they &apos;ve learned in the heads .
&quot; Yeah ? Proprion . I said .
It &apos;s studies . Now it &apos;s about you protect it . &quot;
They &apos;re called the greats and say that we , brothers , we are the holds of the world .
This is extremely important level .
When we think about Indigenes and the environment , we invodd Rseau and old history of the noble vage , which is a razge concept in its simplicity or maybe invodd , and we say that these people are more close to the Earth of us .
The populations are not not sentimental sentimental .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the Abat , or in the winds of the Abat or gelids of Tibet , but because of time and the rituals , they created a mystic mystic intuition , but on a mestage , a little bit more submine , but on a little bit more subtle : the concept that the Earth can only live in the human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
It means that a little girl who grows up in the Ande of the mountain is a piece of Apu spirit . The Apu that &apos;s going to be a deeply different human being deeply , and it &apos;s going to have a different mountain , and it &apos;s going to have a little mountain a Montana who grow mount mount mount of rocks .
That &apos;s the dimall of a spirit or a mineral cave is irrievant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between individual and natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Britannica of Britannica by creating that forests serve to be cut .
And that made me a human being different from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the forests are the dimball of the Hukuk and the cannery digm and the cannbe the disease of the north of the world , spirits in the northern initiation .
If you start to consider that these cultures can actually create different reality , you can start some of understanding some of them , we can understand some of them sensational sensational .
I took this picture to open them in Amazon Amazon .
Maybe some of you &apos;ve heard about the Eahubasca , the most powerful substance of the Grepertory .
What it makes the fascinating the ayahubasca is not the potential pharmacological potential of substance , but his own two elements .
From a house , this lian legnature that &apos;s a series of expensive carboline , harmers and harmed , slightly .
She gets the only plants has a bluash of a bluxtape that alters a little consciousness , but it &apos;s mixed with the leaves of a family of coffee .
This plant is a triptams , very similar to serotonin , didmethoxylad-five , methoxyltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryptamines .
If you ever see the Yanomami , you &apos;re going to see the Yanomami , the sustairly , in half a different set of species , which is half a little methoxyltryltryptamine .
Tiring that policy on for nose is a little bit like being disappear from a file card dipines and landscape on a sea and landscape of electricity . Rare not creates a distortion of reality ; it doesn &apos;t believe a distorage of reality .
I was often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who got the psychedelic was , with his discovered , with his discovery of fungi in the &apos; 30 in the &apos; 30 in the &apos; 30 in Mexico .
Second , my countries can &apos;t classify these triptams like alucinogens because if you &apos;re not telling anybody who can &apos;t be a hallucinated .
It &apos;s possible to the bear if you make a lot of other chemical chemical substances that denial MAO .
Now , the beautiful : the fuel : the carboline is in this lian Is-like , the same kind of needs of MAO , of the same like the triptamines . The surprisintamines : in 80,000 species of plants , how these people are in these people are not like these people , they make these people , they create a way , they create a kind of creating a version of a lot , they create a very biochemical version that &apos;s perior chemical version of the way , they create a kind of a lot of the way ,
We use the big eufemism of the prova and error , which can reveal infruit .
But if we ask the Indian , they will say , &quot; Phts are talking about it . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribes , Cofan , has 17 varieties of Ehuash , which distinguishing in the forest , and that in our eyes would be in the same species .
If we ask them how they stabilizes their tasonomy will tell us , &quot; I thought I was a lot of plants , of the rest , you don &apos;t know ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : they take 17 varieties in a notice of lady and each one will be with a different tiny .
With this is not laurea to Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting to count that pright the prints .
Now , &#91; applauses &#93; the problem is that also the people of us who have heart of the people who have heart of the people who have been a little history , but somehow reduced to our world , and it &apos;s beyond .
In fact , the 19th century , in 300 years , it &apos;s not remembered for his wars its wars , but rather as a way we have , and we embraced actively actively , and we embractively actively , the degree of biological diversity and cultural accepted , the problem isn &apos;t changing .
All cultures , in the centuries were involved in a dance for new possibilities .
And the problem isn &apos;t technology .
The Indians Sioux , they don &apos;t stop being Sioux when they put it back back and frecess , as Americans have no stopped by the horse and calef .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that they threatening the integrity of ethnoss . It &apos;s the power .
The domination of domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you &apos;ll discover that these are not destined cultures .
They &apos;re creatures and dynamics spines outside of the existence of the forces that go beyond their ability of adaptation .
Sy that &apos;s disbosing in the paths of the Penan --
a population namad , Sarawak , in the South Asian , a population , a population forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to a generation ago , and now reduced to the remarkable . And the remarkable to the Borneo to Morneo in Morneo in the South Morneo in the South of the Morneo in Morneo .
and fill the stives with the wood wood saddress .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that have come with the gold of gold .
If we move on the Tibet of the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the right dough of domination .
You know , as you know the genocide , the physical extinction , is condantly condantly , but the ethnic of a population , the distruction of a population , not just condanced , but it is not only condanced , but it celebrated in the development , because it &apos;s part of the development of the development .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of Tibet until you go from the beginning .
I run 6,000 miles from Chenger in Chengu in Chenginal Tibet , through the Tibet , coming in Lhasa with a young colleague , but just came to Lhasa , I realized what &apos;s behind the statistics that we &apos;re talking about .
6,000 sacred sacred sacred in poles and centers .
1.2 million people killed from the military Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascrited to Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed to the time of the Chinese invasion .
Suo , he was slightly with Sua Santity in Santity in Santity , in Nepal .
His mother imprisoned and his colpa was reich .
It was brought to hidden in careers in the age of two years , hidden under his clear because he wouldn &apos;t have lived in with him .
The sister , who did the same , was put in a reeducation camp .
One day , he has been wish a fashion Mao and for this transground , and for this transgression , was put in the forced for seven years .
The Tibet of the Tibet can be insatisportable , but the spirit reducer of the population is from tener .
And then it &apos;s all of the time , it &apos;s a choice .
We want to live in the world world of the monocromatical world , or we want to take the policromatically , or want to take the policromatical world of diversity ?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he said that his greatest fear was that , in our own vision of the world , we &apos;re going to see the whole amorous of human imagination is , we &apos;re not just seeing the whole ama modality of thinking , but a day , we &apos;re wake up to a de-formented limitation , but a day we &apos;re able to wake up .
And it &apos;s humiliating our species is there for 600,000 years .
The Neolitics Revolution , who has given us the agriculture , which has done us to socks on the cult , and replacing the poetry with the next next few of the closer , creating the hierarchy of specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world of industrialized world has been 300 years .
That slide history , I &apos;m not suggests that we have to defends that we have to deal in millennia to come .
When these myriadic cultures are asked what it means to be human , answer with 10,000 different voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all have to be what we are : a species of consciousness , that it has to be what we are : a species , that we have to be what all populations can flow .
I took this picture on the north of Baffin the north island of Baffin , when I went to the hunt with Inuit , and this man , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , and this man , and he told me the wonderful story of her grandfather .
The canadvice was not always gentile with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to stabilier our own own colonies , we &apos;ve reached them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refused to go .
The family , tempting for his life , he brought him away all the arms , and all of his attractioned .
You have to know that the Inuit is not the cold , they shake it .
The slitte pats were in the original fisheries of characishes .
The non-up of this man did not intimidddle of the arctimic night , or from the blizard of the blizard .
It &apos;s sitting out , you &apos;ve got the broken bang , and defecated in their hand . When I did the frow , they &apos;ve been created , and they worked them , and they work with a moderation .
He was spring up on the dog of this cluster , and when he came solid , he was killed a dog .
He schooled the dog and created a sharp , with the Atorn cassa , and he gave a sled sledged a slide , and he gets a little bit of banchisa , and he gets a lot of cluster in rest .
We want to talk about none ? Rate : Is this , in different ways , &#91; Applausi &#93; is the symbol of the resilience of the population of Indigits and all the Indigence of the world &apos;s population .
In 1999 , the canaddress of the California government reduced to a total area of California and Texas a set of California and Texas a set .
It &apos;s their new patria . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a territory of independent . They &apos;re all the minerary resources .
One of the splendid-state , of how a national state can recognize with his population .
And , finish , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious at least to the people of us was in these zones of the planet , make it remote .
For somebody is house .
They represented setions of the human imagination that are the datables of the time . And for all these kids , like the dreams of these children , like the dreams of geography .
Finally , we National Geographic is we &apos;re convinced that political political will never come to anything .
We believe that polemy --
&#91; Applausi &#93; , they &apos;re not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month our site realized snow , our site realized snow 35 million visit .
156 countries our television , we transmit our television .
Our revisters are seven seven from millions of people .
Our work is traveling in ethnoshere to bring our public in the audience in the way of cultural wonderful , as they saw and hopefully , hopefully , hopefully , hopefully , hopefully , and we have to find a lot of fun , and we have to find a lifestyle in a world of pluralistic life , and multicultural , and multicultural , and multural multicultural reveal furaling , and we have to find a fashights of pluralong how to be in the central lights
where the wisdom of all the people can contribute to our well-being well-being .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope required others that I &apos;ve heard and I &apos;m going to try to evidence some colleague , in case not note .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the &quot; official dogram . &quot;
The official dogm of what ?
The Dogma official of all the Western society of all the Western Design ual . &quot; If we want to men the benefit of our citizens &quot; &quot; The way to do it is to men the individual freedom . &quot;
The reason is , from a side , in fact that freedom is in itself a value , is precious , useful , for humans ,
On the other is in fact that if we &apos;re free , each one of us can act for it to do all that massive to do all that massive , without any one that decided called our well-being , no one that decided called our well-being , no one that we &apos;re going to be , without any one of us .
The way to male freedom is to move choice .
More people have , more to choices , more free , and greater is their freedom , more , is their well-being .
I think , it &apos;s so deeply radicated in society that nobody would be able to put it in the society that nobody would be able to put it in the society .
And it &apos;s also deeply radicated in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m going to allow a very simple note about conditions .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conducts , without contextreme oil 10 varieties of oil , and 12 acets , the 12 acets that you can buy for a huge number of conditions in the rescired , which nobody nobody of the 175 , promison , which no one of the 175 , you have a huge of your degree .
Here &apos;s the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic store to buy a stereo : case , leter CD , radio , radio , radio , radio ,
And in this single negotiation , there &apos;s a big number of audio .
We can make six million different combinations of different combinations using the components that there are one .
You have to admit that there &apos;s a lot of choice .
Other camps : the world of communications .
And when I was a child , when I was a child , they could get all the services , they could be forned by the mothers , at the least mothers , at the time , Bell .
You know , you know , it didn &apos;t buy it .
A consequence of that , by the way , was the phone had never been shromed .
These time , they went .
We now have a variety of telephones , especially between cellphones .
Here &apos;s the cell phone of the future .
My favorite is that in the middle , MP3 , cut it &apos;s cut up , and forts for the cryme of the birthele .
If you don &apos;t have seen in the god , you &apos;re not seen in the house , you &apos;re not seen certain that soon will be .
And what &apos;s going on is that the end is that people come into the goes and ask this question . And you know what the answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more importantly than the buster , you would come up with choices .
Assistence : health doesn &apos;t happen in the United States that you go from the doctor and doctor , you have to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; Okay , we could do , or B , &quot; You can do , or B , &quot; A , &quot; has these benefits . &quot; She &apos;s these benefits . &quot;
You said , &quot; Does , what should I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A has these benefits and these benefits , and these benefits . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebats , &quot; Does if she was me , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result of the result called the autonomy of the malseeing , expression that makes it look a beaution-thing thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not a smart the weight and responsibility to make decisions of somebody who knows something , which is the doctor , someone else that doesn &apos;t know -- and almost certainly , and it &apos;s not in conditions , and then not in the ideal condition , and then not in the ideal conditions .
There &apos;s a huge marketing products of drugs , direct to people like me and you , if you think about it doesn &apos;t have any sense , of that we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them them , why do you public ?
The answer is that they want we domactor called the doctor to ask them to change it .
Something so fundamental as our identity is horever is a question of choice , as you see in this jump , &quot; we don &apos;t want to force children . They &apos;re not going to force the children . They &apos;re going to be a full right now .
And we can reinvent us how many times we get us .
That means that every morning , to be able to be able to be .
I &apos;m slums to the family and marriage , a time next time next to be community for anyone , was that you would have the most soon as possible , and he began to make the most soon as possible .
The only choice was with whom , you know , not when , and not even what to do after .
It &apos;s really all to play .
I teach in a very smart students , and I do do their 20 percent work than a time .
And not because they &apos;re not smart , because they &apos;re not not not because they &apos;re not not dead .
but because I &apos;m impensieritation , I mean , I &apos;m going to go , or not ? &quot;
&quot; I should be going to move more later ? I have to think before children or career ? &quot;
They &apos;re srogogorants .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this implement doesn &apos;t completing the companies that I teach and not get a good vote to my exactly vote to my exame .
And they have to do it . They &apos;re really important questions .
Now , the job : we &apos;re lucky , like Carl underineating , because technology allows us to work every day , every day , from Hotel Randolph .
I &apos;m parentesespecially , there &apos;s a angled angle , and I &apos;m not going to say anybody , where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , this incredible freedom of choice we have to work ? Is we have to continuously on every moment , if we have to work or not .
We can go to the hot , with the cell phone in a tank , with the cell phone in a tank , Blackberry , and the nibberry , on the knees .
And even though they &apos;re all spent , every minute that we see our child , we also see the partold board , we also asking , &quot; Do I have to answer this named ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? I have to get this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , &quot; this makes the experience of your child &apos;s experience of your child &apos;s gotten from what it would be in other conditions .
So , whatever we look at , little things , small things , and big things , the materials and life , life is a choices , life is a question of choices .
The world was this : Oval , there were some possibilities , but it was not a question of choice .
The world &apos;s worth like this : The dilemma is , &quot; Is it &apos;s a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Scially .
The positive law is all known , so I &apos;m going to talk about negative ones .
All this choice is two effects in fact , two negative effects on people .
The first one , paradoxygen , is that it produces instead of liberation .
With many or options that are very difficult to choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I offer you an expensive example : a study conduct on the flight plans .
A college had access to the Vanguard data , the giant society of the Vanality of the depension of a million employees .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of adjail is about two percent .
With 50 sources , there &apos;s 10 percent of offering , there &apos;s 10 percent of them . Why are they only five . Why ?
Because with 50 sourds of the sources that choose , it &apos;s hard to decide , and choice is remanded to the domorders .
And domorrow , and domorders , domain , domain , domain , and of course domorders , of course , domorgan , domain , and domorders , of course , domorange , domoranguring domorangent , domorangan domorgan , domorance , domorders and domorders to domain , domain , and of course
You know , not just mean that these works from old food to dogs because they don &apos;t have enough money , because they don &apos;t have enough money , they want to say that decision is so obstic that they also lose the complementary of the loss of work .
Not to participating , they &apos;re losing , they &apos;re losing , they &apos;re going to be disposed to be versarsarsarsarsarsarsaring them .
So paralysis a consequence of having too much choice .
And I think that &apos;s makes the world .
&quot; And finish , for the eternity : ketchup , or maybe or maion ? &quot;
You &apos;d like to be a just decision , if it &apos;s for ethernity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and nepure the wrong , and nepure the wrong conditional conditions .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can avoid the paralysis and make a choice , we &apos;re less satisfying as we would be with less satisfying .
And that &apos;s for several reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of conditions that you choose , if you buy one and not perfect , is easy to imagine that you could have done a choice , and that &apos;s easy , it &apos;s that the alternative imagined us , and the record is that the alternative imagined us , and the record defull the satisfaction of the choice , and the repieces of the choice , and the recording to the sing of the decision ,
even when it was a good decision .
More choices are , more easy displeasy than anybody who detail in any detail of choice .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call cost .
Dan Gilbert asked a lot of practice like the value that we have to depends on what we &apos;re confront .
In the rest , when there are many options , it &apos;s easy representing the characteristics of alternative , and be less satisfying of the option and be less satisfying of the options that is choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m not in New York .
But that &apos;s what you would probably think .
There &apos;s this copy to Hamptons .
A place of luxury .
It &apos;s beaving a lot of them . Otype , it &apos;s all for them .
Nothing . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , malediption , is Augost . &quot;
&quot; All my neighbors are out of Manhattan are out . &quot;
&quot; I could talk about home . I could talk about the home . &quot;
And it &apos;s going to go to two weeks that &apos;s losing -- every day -- every day -- the chance of parking where it wants .
The cost-opportunity is decrease for what we have , even when the choice was eccellent .
And the more of the options that we have to considering , more equivalent us to return us as a cost-opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
It &apos;s about the time , and maybe it &apos;s perhaps about living slowly .
But the most important point is that whatever you choose , you choose you choose not to do other .
The things that we don &apos;t choose have a lot of attractivity that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : spiral growth of expectations .
I tried it on my skin , comprinting a new jeans .
I &apos;m going to almost always jeans .
The jeans were one of a one of the bought , and bought them , they were switched , they were slifted , just after they were a lot of times , they were washing them a lot of times , they began to go well .
So I went to buy a couple again when the old old one of the old , and I said , &quot; I need a couple jeans , this is my table . &quot;
The common said , &quot; You want to slim fashion , easy , relaxy , relaxed ? &quot;
He wants to the ground or with the ground or bottons ? &quot; Stonewashed &quot; &quot; or &quot; acidwashed &quot; ? &quot;
&quot; Would you be struggling ? &quot;
&quot; Sight the willing or stretches ? &quot; The bla -- &quot; Sinur babies .
I was sbalance , and after a while I was able to say , &quot; I want to say , &quot; I want to the guy , &quot; he had no idea what was , so for a time I had all of the diguts , and I had no idea what I &apos;ve ever had .
It was the very choice . I had all that choice had the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand it .
The reason I was worse , is that with all that choice my expectations were altissim , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was very much about that . I didn &apos;t expect to me anything . I was nothing about that when there was only a kind of 100 different , steps , but when I saw 100 different steps , at least a guy had to be perfect .
What I had busted was good , but I wasn &apos;t perfect .
And I was talking about that choose to what I was trying to be insodently insoddently ,
The addition of the people who don &apos;t do that that they &apos;re going to increase the expectations that these have respect to the options of the options of the options of the options that are .
And this will product less satisfying , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing .
Because if they knew it , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more to this .
&quot; It was better when you were worse , &quot; The reason why it was better when you were worse when you were worse when you were worse when it was worse , it was still worse .
Everyday , in the world that we live -- opulents , citizens , industrialized industrialized , citizens that we can hope is that the things are in the height .
You never surprised , because your expectations , my expectations , my expectations , they were justed .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Greef expectations . &quot;
I mean -- small moment , self-authodd -- which I &apos;m really moving and my wife is really stupend .
I wouldn &apos;t have to do better , I didn &apos;t know .
But it &apos;s not always good .
And finally , a consequence of buying a couple of jeans soul when you have that jeans is that when you &apos;re not satisfying , and say , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot; The answer is clear .
The world is the responsible . What could I do with it ?
When there are hundreds of types , and buy a dissatisssatisssatisfacing , and ask you who is the responsible , is just as clear that you .
You would have done better .
With hundreds of disponto , there are no scuspect , there &apos;s no scuspect .
So when people are decisions , even though the result is valid , they feel unexpect and they give the basic to them .
In the last depression is exploss in the industrialized world .
I think a meaninger , I don &apos;t have the only one , but -- of this depression -- of this depression is that people have experiences of the experiences because the standard experiences are too much high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that the colp is them .
So the final result is that we &apos;re better better , but we hear it worse .
Let me reminds you .
This is the official dogm , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely false . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than it , but it doesn &apos;t be anything , but it doesn &apos;t be a lot better than a little bit better .
There &apos;s a critical value , magical . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure that we &apos;ve been supered by a piece of the level where the improving choices our life .
Now , from the political point -- I &apos;ve almost finished -- from political point of view , the nocle is the following .
What it &apos;s allows in the industrial society is the material wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not they have too much choice .
The problem is they have too much .
So the facility I &apos;m talking about is a disease of modern modern , requires of modern , society society .
And what it does deprove and arrator is this : Steve Levitt has talked to you how those expensive and saddress , in the basic seats . It &apos;s a waste of money .
I mean , these choices , complicated and dispendependiture , it &apos;s not that they &apos;re just useful .
They &apos;re going to be deleteries .
They &apos;re doing it .
If a little bit of what we society allows a lot of choice was reversed in those where people have too little possibility , it would not be better , but our own life , it wouldn &apos;t just be better , but our own life .
This is what economists call a paretian .
A redistribution region region it , not only to the poor -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice that &apos;s been going to hold us .
To conclude , you can become everything you want to become everything you want to be &quot; --
You , people , think , you think , &quot; What &apos;s it &apos;s the weight ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t make anything anything in a glass of glass . &quot;
&quot; An intrated , a limited vision of the world -- &quot;
and I interpret it as I interpret .
But then , I realized that that weight the long basic knows the long long .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you eat the bouth bts , so that &quot; everything is possible . &quot; You can &apos;t get the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you take the bought , the books that all diclosed sodisphysical satisfaction .
You know , you know , paralysis , and you reduced well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too strike , maybe even for fish , and of course for us .
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic , and I &apos;m feeling , I &apos;m about roline .
Thank you very much .
