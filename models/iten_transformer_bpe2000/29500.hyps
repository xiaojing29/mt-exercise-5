Last year I showed these slide to demonstrate that the cotta glacial glacial , which for almost three million years , has had the size of 48 percent .
But this underneath the gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice of the ice of the ice .
The arctic glacial glacial , in a sense , the pulser &apos;s clear system .
You winter and the summer and the summer expect .
The next slide is going to be a remarkable remarkable remarkable to the last 25 years .
The ice losenian drawn in red .
As you see , they expand the wall .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter , which is the summer .
You can see that the ice cosidly ice , of five years or more , it &apos;s like five years or more , it &apos;s like the blood , which is the body .
In 25 years , he went from this way , so .
This is a problem because the interested in the arctic warming the ground of the arctic ocean where there are enormous amount of congeled that , microbes , and they &apos;re transformed in metane from the microbes .
Most at the totality of the climbs of the global warming , that amount could radical , by the way , super-hythellow point , super-hyritority .
In some laghi broads in Alaska , the methane is already rebolling from the water .
The professorehist Katey Walter of the University of Alaska is remarkable lake a team broken out .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You &apos;re good . The question is if we &apos;re going to be .
A reason is that this termal scale the Greenland from north .
This is a rubber to glacial .
The laptop had never reached free .
This is the Kangerlush aq , in the southwest of Greenland .
If you want to know how the sal level for the sea level for the ice sea of ice on the terrain here is where the sea .
These running are increasing rapidly .
An the other side of the planet : Antarctica of ice ice ice ice ice ice ice the planet .
The month the scientists have declared that the bankness of the ice is in negative , and Antarctica , which is the Antarctica , which is particularly remained in the shape .
Equiet six feet of the watching source , like Greenland .
Sull Himalaya , the third biggest block of ice , you see new laghi , that a few years ago , that a few years ago , they were glagholds .
40 percent of the world population is half the water power of the world &apos;s powerful water from that cheaper .
Sulle Ande : this ice is the source of the water power of this city .
The loud is increased .
But when it diminishes , the same happens to water .
In California , the Sierra Nevada is declining of 40 percent .
The hyricis in the crisis .
The predictions , as you read , are graves .
The growth care in the world &apos;s downtools a wind increase .
The environmental disaster disaster , they &apos;re increasing a rhythm out of normal and without precedented .
Four numerous times in the last 30 years , I have respect to 75 .
This is a whole thing about all of the whole thing .
If you look at it in historic context , if you can see the consequences .
And in the last five years we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 , every 24 hours of tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the East Pacific area , the American area , and the obvious , and on both the Indian , where there is a radical impoverments of Indian , where there is a radical impoverments .
Most because of the global warming , together , which is 20 percent , is the deforestation , is the use of fossil fuels .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worst .
The United States are one of the two hemissions with the China .
And he was proposed to build a lot of other centers .
But we &apos;re seeing a change of direction .
These are the annulled in the last few years and some of the high-grand some of the high-verge .
At every way , there &apos;s a politics lots in our country .
The carbon industries and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon clean , which is a hosympics .
That picture me remember something --
Natal Canal , in Tennessee , where I live , there was 3.8 billion lboard .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the second biggest scories in America .
It &apos;s happened around Natal .
The nature of one of the carbon industries of one of the carbon industries .
Video : carbonaum carbonasic is a kind of food and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and growing our economy .
Make the carbonaum is increasing .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and work work in the stipendent .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest minerary society is Massey Coal . This is his administration .
Video : Don Blankenship : Sarry , Al Gore , Nancy Pelosis , Harry Reid -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima Protetion of Clima &apos;s launched two campaign .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Ator : At COALergy see the climate change as a sery sery as a sery sery sea sery tor of our business .
For this priority is to invest a great amount of money in a bad ad basic amount of money in a bunch of carbon .
In fact , the carbon is not spork .
We think it &apos;s clean -- it &apos;s also a good profumo .
So , you don &apos;t preocupon climate change .
Let me do that .
Video : Ator : Caribone clean -- you &apos;ve heard a lot of you heard .
So let &apos;s go around a straight in a structure to advancy as a clean .
Strordinary ! The machines are a little human rumor , but this is the sound of the clean technology of clean .
The carbon consumption is between the major causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology , but the remarkable technology that you see that you see changes everything .
You have a look , this is the hate technology of clean clean .
Al Gore : Inally , the positive alternative alternative , the positive himself to the economic issue and the security .
Video : Sment America is cription ; the economy , security , national security , climate crisis .
The philos that connections : our dependence of fossil dence of fossil beautiful , as the spork and oil .
Now , it &apos;s a new , audace solution for using circumstants .
Really America : 100 percent energy energy , 10 years .
A plan to repush America to make sure more safety , and helping the global warming .
Finally , a solution that is to solve our problems .
Really America . You can get more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It &apos;s about reducing energy to America .
One of the fastest ways to get to dependence from the combustable dependence from the combustable .
Compared : The future is here . Vent , sunlight , just a new energy netics .
Some of them : Novi investments for a places of jobs .
Commment : Repower America . It &apos;s time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old old African proverbian says , &quot; If you want to go fast , you go to fast .
If you want to go away , you go together . &quot;
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED I did an introduction on LHC .
And I promise to return you to return to you about how the machine works .
So here I figure . And for those who was not , LHC is the biggest experiment , the biggest experiment , 27 miles of circumference .
His joined to reach the conditions that were at least as a billion second of the universe -- at 600 million times a second .
All this is just environmental .
This is the machine underlying .
We are these mini-Bang Bang in the relevators .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLATLAS -- it &apos;s 44 feet .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in building so you can see proportions .
Ten Spattern we have accent the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was because of the himself festegs in control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first particles who had done all around the LHC , walking into collision , with a part of the LHC , and by a part of the LHC , and particles in the back .
In other words , when we see that picture the picture of 10 section , we realized that the machine worked , which is a great vitting .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to make us exultate more or this , when somebody went to Google and saw that the beginning was .
That means we had a cultural impact cultural impact that scientific .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , I had to these phils here -- these dored philans .
These films are 13,000 ampount when the machine works at the most powerful power .
Now , the technicians between you and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . They &apos;re not true . &quot;
And they can do it because when they &apos;re very cold became the superconduct-conductor .
So , at less 271 degrees , to a inferior temperature at the space between stars , these phils can bring that run .
In one of the younger of the novemila in the LHC , there was a fect fabrication .
So the philos susped up , and 13,000 ampount of suddenly met resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressioning if you think these magnetes are more than 20 tons , and that have been moved of about 30 feet .
They are damn about 50 magnetes .
We had to take them , what we did .
We repristined and traveled them .
They &apos;re now coming back all to their submit .
By the end of marzo LHC is will be new integrate .
We &apos;re going to happen , and we expect to get the right data or light , and we continue our adventure to discover what the morning is the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain qual way , these initions reaccount on the value of science and engineering in frontier . It &apos;s easy easy to confuture .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact of going to go beyond the limits , I think is the value of things like LHC .
I &apos;d like to end with the words of a Indian scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , imagine , in the defense experiments of his pupiler , his pupiler , his pupiler was Michael Faraday , he said , &quot; Not is so dangerous for the progress of the human mind as the rest of the human mind that the ideas of science of the human mind that the ideas of define , and our trifespecially conists are ,
Thank you .
I want to start wondering you to rethink when , from children , played with the morning .
While you figure out how to get them and run and you learn them , you know , you actually learn to think and solve problems and manipulating problems and manipulating problems .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand the way we understand the world around us .
So , from the usual information using the whole thing with physicists , together at my consultable . Patts , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to ask me , &quot; If we use a computer , I have a wonderful computer that you have the mouse as a digital drugital that you move on a desktop , we could relieased to physically a information with a walking information ,
and systemaries ?
The question was so interesting , we decided to explore the answer , by building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a whole computer interactive computer interactive as a while .
In a few words , a Siftable is a whole computer interactive computer interactive as a while .
You can move them with the hand , can see , &quot; you can see &quot; you &quot; in their movement and they have a screen and a radio wireless .
But above , they &apos;re physicists , like the morning , you can just move them .
The Siftable is an example of a new ecosystem of tools for manipulate the digital information .
And as a become more physical , consciousness , known by other people , and they become more physical , and they become more physical , of the other people , as we move new and fun styles of interaction .
I &apos;m going to start with some simple example .
This is Siftable is to show you the video : if you incline it in a direction , the video , the video , the way , if you close from the other hand back .
These interactive re-conscious things .
If you deal , you &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re going around .
If they come circumstates , they note it and they can act a little bit .
If they come circumstates , they note it and they can act a little bit .
They actually spend their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interaction of interaction was the power to use common data , for example , &quot; to be a real color as if it was a liquid color as a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable , as a dump of the versor , and I can use them to spend the color in the central , where they missions are missions .
and I can use them to train color in the central , where you missing .
We can be too much , we can put a little place .
They also are beautiful possibilities of learning , like languages , mathematics and games , where people can try to try the bad things , and see the results of myself , and see the results of myself .
Now , I &apos;m --
This is a Fibonacci sequence of Fibonacci .
Here we have a game of words that is half between Scarabeo and Boggle .
Pratically , every turn on a letter to the letter on every Siftable on every Siftable , to every turn to a letter to every Siftable on every Siftable , and while he was talking about a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds , 30 seconds , and you have a new letters of letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the children came to the Media Lab , I did in a way I did this , and I turned a video .
They are very , very placed .
And one of the interesting things of this application is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of education .
You just say , &quot; Spons of words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s what other people who come out .
This is our younger biggest , there &apos;s the most .
It just wanted to implemathers .
They were only morning .
Now , this is an interactive cardboard .
We wanted to build a tool for the languages , Lui &apos;s Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , soliftable , by the Siftable .
It can put new characters in the scene , soliftable , by the Siftable .
So , he &apos;s going to get out of the sun .
Video : The sun is surprising .
David Merrilled : Now he brought a treat in the scene .
Video : The arange tree .
By work ! Yeah ! Yeah !
So schooling the Siftable and put them neighborhood ,
Video : Bau !
Today , by inventing your story .
Video : Hiao !
DM : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide him as you spend him .
DM : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide him as you spend him .
Video : Good , gets .
DM : The last example I have the time to show you is a tool , realized recently , to sampling and exeques .
It &apos;s a tool , recently realized recently , to sampling and exeguing music .
The Siftable here are sounds like base , base and battery .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose what use .
You can put these sounds in a sequence to comport these sounds in a sequence to your placement .
And modifying it just touching a &quot; sound &quot; and a sequence . &quot;
These are effects you can control from the alive , like the reverse and philter .
The acks to a particular sound and then clines to figure out ,
And then there are the general effects as time and volume , that we apply to the whole sequence .
Let &apos;s look at how it works .
Video : We &apos;re going to start putting a base in two Siftable . &quot; sequence , we extend , we extend , we extend , we extend , we add the other basic .
Now , I put a basic line .
Video : DM : Now I add of percussion --
Video : And I &apos;m going to put the battery , so I can control the bacteria , so I can control the effect of the bacteria .
Video : DM : I can speed to the entire sequence by a hand on the other side .
Video : And I &apos;m going to add the basic phillion to give more expression .
Video : DM : I can reconbining the sequence &quot; to the flight . &quot;
So I didn &apos;t have to plan it before , but I can suddenly suddenly , so I can make it longer or more cording .
And now , finally , I can smode the entire sequence by inclining the left Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new man &apos;s interface , it &apos;s more like our brain interface , and the body &apos;s body .
And today , I &apos;ve got time to show you one of the results of this loss , and also some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to transmit is that &apos;s coming up with this new generation of design objects to interact with digital media , that will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the hour to talk to all of you .
I &apos;m a written .
Boy books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also the love and the fashion of my life .
And I don &apos;t expect that it can change .
But , said , this , something that was recently happened in my life and my life , and in my life , who bring me me to received the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this whography called &quot; Mangia , which , different , a very different reason , for some reason , for some reason , for some reason , for some reason , in the world and become a big , wild , wellers ,
And the result is that everywhere now , people treat me as if I were condanted .
Davigate -- condanned , condanted !
They &apos;re all going to be worried and they say , &quot; Don &apos;t you fear not able to do ?
You don &apos;t fear to continue to writing all life without power without a book , and can be able to create a book that can be ? &quot;
Why can it important ? &quot;
It &apos;s rassuring , you know .
But I can go to the worst , I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was a adolescent -- I was a written .
I met the same reaction by the pure of fear .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you can &apos;t have succeed ?
Don &apos;t you fear that the mimiliation of the refer ?
Don &apos;t you fear to do this all life without any living without any living in the whole life without any infrants with the mouth of the sample of sampling fallims ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
Yeah , I &apos;ve got afraid of all those things .
I &apos;ve had afraid .
And I also have a lot of other things that people can &apos;t inate .
As the floor and other things .
But , as much as I write what I thought and I was wonder and I was asked , why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logical that anyone should be waiting to be spavented by a job that you feel like to do .
But what is so particular in the creative creative creative to make us nervous health about mental health as a way that other careers do not ?
As my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and not remember one once in his 40 years of activity that he was asked if he were able to be able to be able to be ?
There was never -- that was -- that block of the John engineer , how do it ?
Not work , you know ?
Onestly , chemical engineers like group have not certainly , in the centuried , in the centuried of being alcolized manized manized depressive .
We have this reputation , we have this reputation , and not just writers , but creative of all kinds of things , we have this reputation to be enormous instailable .
And it &apos;s not going to look at the trists connecting trists of the magnific ments that only in the 21st century , they died young people , died young people died and often for hand .
And also , the ones that don &apos;t have suicked to be really disguys from their dons .
Norman Mailer , before I die , in the last interview , he said , &quot; Every book has killed me a little more . &quot; A extraordinary affermation about their life .
But we don &apos;t bad when we heard this because we heard these things so long that somehow we have completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering the notion and the art , it &apos;s going to conduce the end .
And the question I want to take all over here today is : are you agree with this idea ?
You &apos;re good at this thing -- because it also looks at a huge distance to me , not good for anything .
I think it &apos;s odiodd .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous and I don &apos;t want to see the perpetuate in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our great creative minds of creative people .
And I know that , in my case -- in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start figing out , above the circumstances that I &apos;m in my career .
Ovally -- you look , I &apos;m pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I have still about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything I &apos;m going to write in the world &apos;s going to be judged by the world as the work that &apos;s after the later book .
I &apos;m going to be , because we are all the more or friends here -- it &apos;s likely , my greatest success is to my horse .
Oh , Gesus , who think !
You know , this is the kind of thinking that that brings a person to start boundary to start boundary nine and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would keep doing this work that we do .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it looks like , after a lot of reflection , that the way to work to keep writing is to create a psychological construct , okay ?
I have to find a safety of security between me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural anximum , and I was looking for the last year , and I was trying to get it . And as I was trying to get to the year , trying to find out of the world , trying to find other societies to see if they could have better ideas and more sane and more sane and more sane and more sane and more sane .
to help people creative to manage the emotional inerent inerent risks .
And that research has taken me to the ancient Greek and ancient Rome .
Seguitems because he gets into the circle and then go back .
In the ancient Greek and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity creativity , OK ?
It was the creativity was this spirit of divine and sell men from a few distant surprised and known , for distant reasons , distant reasons and unknown , for distant reasons .
The greatest called these berites of the berites of creativity &quot; demons . &quot;
Sowever , wonderful , created to have a demon that was wisdom from the far .
Romans were the same idea , but they called the spirit of spirit without body a genius .
Which is great , because Romans didn &apos;t think that a genius was a particularly intelligent .
And they would have a genius was this kind of entity divine that has created literally living in the walls of a artist , a little bit like the elpho , and that was out of hidden artist and model the work of artist and model the work of that work .
Here &apos;s eyes -- here is , that is the distance of which I talk -- that psychological construct that you from the results of your work .
And everybody knew that was so that he worked , right ?
So the antic artists were certain things , like the narcism , not ?
If your work was exceptional work was except , you couldn &apos;t take the whole market , everybody knew that you were helped by this genius ,
If your fallies , it wasn &apos;t all college , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a incapable .
And so people han concept creativity in the West for a long time .
And then Renasciments came and all changed , and all changed , and nac5 this great idea ; we put the human beings and lelowed and ledge and leaving and leaving and leaving mitic creatures .
This was the rational principle of rational humanism and people began to think that creativity was completely from the idrue .
And for the first time in history , he began to refer this or the artist as a kind of a kind of thing .
And I have to say , I think it was a big herror .
I think that we allow someone , a simple person to believe that as a reciplies like a reciplies , the beddded , and the source of all mysterners , creative , and inknown to ethern a very big philty to the bagle of human .
It &apos;s like a ask someone to ingod the sun .
Deats and full completely the ego and creates all these expectations on performance .
And I think it was this pression to have destroyed the artists in the past 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it &apos;s , and I think it &apos;s the question , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe you can go back to a more ancient than the relationship between human and mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t sing 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience that would sunlight in the audience of the notion , you know , you make that follow people to squeen , and they follow people to square happening ,
I &apos;m probably not convince you all this thing .
But the question I would like to ask is -- why not ?
Why not to think it in this way ?
Because it has more sense of all the other thing that I &apos;ve ever heard to explain the exasperant exasperant process .
A process that , as anyone that I &apos;ve ever been trying to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- so , you don &apos;t behave rational .
And in fact , it can see a completely paranormal paranormal .
I did this recently , with the extraordinary poetary poem Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but it was a poetic for all life and he said that during his childhood in the Virginia , working out in the camps , and he felt , in the Virginia , and he fellow out of if a poem .
He said he was like a fragorous train .
And he was rolling towards his landscape .
He heard it was going to be , because he was tremendous to his feet .
He knew he had one to do that point and he was , words , words , words , &quot; run as a mathemselves . &quot;
And so it was recorded to home and he was walked by this poem , and he wouldn &apos;t have to make a piece of paper and a fairly faster , while the drop , and he would raise it on the page .
Other times he couldn &apos;t be fast be fast , so correct and correct and correct without able to get back to home and her driver and she would continued to roled through the landscape , and he would continued to rolate through the landscape , trying to do something else . &quot;
Then there were times -- this piece I &apos;ll never forget -- there were the moments that was almost losing , right ?
So , he was running home and he was trying to card and paper her through , and he was going through , and he was going to go through , and he said , that he was going to go , and he said , that it was like the other hand and the offer .
He was willing the poem of the tail and put it in his body and page her body and transcritation .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page and intatta , but the last word at the top .
So when I heard it -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly the same creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conducture !
I &apos;m a move , and my way to work is ; I &apos;m wake up with the same orarian every day and work and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and wake up and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and work and go on and go on and go on and go on
But even , in my test , in my test , I &apos;ve been test against that thing , sometimes .
And I imagine that a lot of you have done .
You know , even though the work and ideas came from a certain source , I can &apos;t know that .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate it to do it in a way we don &apos;t lose the head , but , rather , rather , what do you do ?
For the best example of me , the best example that I have is the MMy Tom Waits , which I have interviewed in a very different days ago .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life was the incarnation of the murdered artist , trying to control , to control , dress , dress , dument these species of totally interiorized impulses .
But then he was sitting , he slowed , and one day as he was driving on a &quot; highway in L.A.
He was going to go quickly and all of a sent , this little bag melody , which is coming in his head as a inspiration , elusive and halletting , and the various , and the wonderful , and the wonderful , and the desidery , but not knowing how to take it .
It &apos;s not a piece of card , it doesn &apos;t have a climbing , he doesn &apos;t have a recorer .
So he starts to feel this kind of old anxiety of anxished to him , and I &apos;m hossessionate by this chart song from this chart .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to the panic , he stopped .
He was a whole mental process and made something completely new .
And he just watching the sky and said , &quot; Scause , not see that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Do you look like this song ?
If you really want to be , you get to a more than you can get a care of you .
You go to important something else today .
You know , Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his process has been working after this .
Not the work , the work was still hoscure as always .
But the process , and the anxiety that was reped when he was left when he was sent , the genius who had no other problems and libered it , and he sent back from the back of the back , and he had to remained it , and he had no mind to be a interiorized and formented .
but it was a peculiar , wonderful , wonderful collaboration between Tom and this strange thing that &apos;s not Tom .
So , how I heard that story , I also save a little bit , even the way I was working and saved me once .
This idea , he saved when I was writing &quot; Mangia , Prua , Ama , &quot; and falls in one of those cheaper of the desperation that we all do when we all work on something and we can &apos;t start thinking that &apos;s going to be a disaster , that the worst book is that the worst book .
Not just bad , just the worst book wrote .
And I started thinking about dying this project .
But then I remember Tom who talked to the air and I tried to the air and I tried to the air and I tried to the air .
So I hold my face in my face and I would say , my house and you break my comments to a stand .
And I said , &quot; Sensing , &quot; Sensing , what we know that if this book won &apos;t be bright , won &apos;t it be bright ?
Because as I see me I &apos;m putting everything I have , I don &apos;t have this .
So if you want to be better , you have to represent you have to realize you ,
Okay . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , you don &apos;t do anything .
I &apos;m going to writing the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to favor that was recorded to me to do my part , &quot; because , at the end is so , OK -- at the end of the North Africa , the North Africa , the North Africa , the North Africa , and sacred sacred to the high-sacred music that they were going to have hourselves for hours and hours to the along .
And they were magnific , because the balerins were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every once , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists had become actually transcendent .
And I know you know what I &apos;m talking , because I know you &apos;ve all seen you have seen it , a performance that .
It was like if the time , and the walerd balerd wallowed through a downtown and not doing anything different from the usual , as the 1,000 night before , as the 1,000 notes , but all all of them .
And suddenly , I don &apos;t just like a human .
But it turns out from the divinside and spot in the divinity of divinity .
And when this happened , the time , people knew what was called the name .
They were in my hands and started sing , &quot; Allah , God , Allah , God , God , God , &quot; God , God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curious storic -- when Mom invaded Mements invaded the Spain , I took this habituines with them and pronounce in the centuries from &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; as you can hear in the flow .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , magnificent , bah , boundary , &quot; burning , &quot; I can understand -- a God of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes the day after , for the ballerd , when you wake up and discovered that they &apos;re the 11 of Martednesday and I &apos;m going to talk about God is , there &apos;s no longer .
It &apos;s just a bad death with a bad bad to the ginocy , and maybe never to get to the tree .
And maybe nobody name the name of God as a gyer , and what is it to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most sweet recognizing to make a creative life .
But maybe not to be so angosciant if you can &apos;t believe , ancutt , which is the most extraordinary extraordinary , that the most extraordinary extraordinary extraordinary extraordinary , you know ,
But created it just as you can see that you have data in a unimaginable imaginable unimaginable source of this squeens of your life that you have to go to someone else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think it all changes .
And so I started thinking , and it &apos;s certainly as I thought for a different months in the book that I &apos;m going to think about the book that I &apos;m going to spot , the dangerous success .
And what I have to continue to say when I hear , I fear electric , not fear .
Don &apos;t traveling . It &apos;s just your work .
It &apos;s going to present your part , whatever you can be .
If your work is balance , ballows .
If the wine divine , absurd you assigned to leave some kind of wonderful kind of wonderful , for a moment through your efforts , then , &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Although , you do the same dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot; Simmen . &quot;
I believe that , I think you have to teach it .
&quot; Okay ! &quot; Sime ! &quot; She &apos;s human love and test love and test testing tals that you &apos;re going to present you continually .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I talked about some of these projects on human genome , what can mean and the discovery of new genes of genes .
Now we &apos;re starting a new perspent : we started digitalize biology and now to go from that digital code we &apos;re going to a new biology , designing and synthesizing and synthesizing .
We &apos;ve always been trying to ask great questions .
&quot; What life is that life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists I think they have tented to understand various levels .
We tried different approach , reducing it to the minimes .
We &apos;re digitalizing almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was to go from the analogic world &apos;s digital biology in the digital world of the digital world .
Now , let &apos;s say , we can regenerate life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the smallest genome of the smallest genome of the smallest genome .
And we tried to reduce the genome for creating a more smaller .
We are able to eliminate a hundred of genes about 500 that are here .
But when we look at his meabolic maps , it &apos;s relatively simple respect to our .
Credeters , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it &apos;s very improbable that this can take to a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to design was synthesize this chromosome in a way to be able to modify the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of the &quot; Pan : Can we synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Can chemistry to make these big molecules that we &apos;ve never able to create before ?
And in case , we can make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemical material chemical material .
The speed that we can degree with life is growing up to exponential .
Our capacity to write the genetic code , rather slowly , but it &apos;s improving .
And our recent recent recent retailed to a exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process has required a lot of passion , starting with a bioethical reatening review before the experiments .
But we discovered that DNA is very hard .
There are thousands of thousands of machines in the world that make small segments of DNA , the long longer 50 letters and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the more the segment is , more errors there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments and correct the mistakes .
And this was our first attempty , to start to talk about the digital information of Phi &apos;s genome of Phi &apos;s genome of the Phi &apos;s genome of the Phi &apos;s genome of the Phi genome of Phi &apos;s genome of the Phi &apos;s genome of the Phi &apos;s genome of the Phi &apos;s genome of the Phi &apos;s genome of the genome of
It &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , actually , the retion of herrors and got a molecule of DNA about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of inert chemical material chemical material , and we put it in the bacteria , the bacteria , and to read this genetic and producurn the viral particles .
The viral particles have been reped from the cells , are coming back and they destroyed the E.
I &apos;ve talked about recently with the pattern of oil industry and they have been spot this model .
They have more than you .
We believe this is a situation where the software can actually build his hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the biggest things .
We wanted to build the whole battery chromosome .
They are more than 580 myths of genetic code .
So we thought we could build it in the size of the virus of the virus of the virus , so that we could change what the components are components of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information , they have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accurately was a mile for every 10 mile base .
We found , resequency , 30 errors . If we had used that original sequence we would never be able to do it work .
One of the process is to design segments , 50 letters that have been able to design sovering with all other segments of 50 letters to build smaller subjects working together .
We can see unique elements here .
You probably read that we put a broken bably the phones .
Think about it , we have a genetic code based on four letters : A , C , Gs and T.
Three of those letters together , 20 myself , and there &apos;s a specific amminod-letters for every admind .
So we can use genetic code to write words , frackage .
What we did at the beginning was self-doing .
Some of them were deluses from the fact that it wasn &apos;t poem .
We designed these segments to simply help to bring them up with enzymes .
There are enzymes them and put them up .
And we started to assembling parts , starting with segments , seven letters , unendulights in a way to form segments of 24 myle letters to come to 72 myself to get 72 myletters .
We have these segments in abundance , so we could sequence them , sequence that we &apos;re trying to create a very robbust process extremely robbust -- as you see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems to be a babellon a babled play-basket play-basket play-basket play-basket play-basket play-basket play-basket play-basket play-basket playwalk .
When we arrive these very long segments , more than 100 mile , they will not grow more directly in E.
It comes to the limits of modern molecular biology .
So we &apos;ve seen up to other mechanisms .
We knew a mechanism called homologist called homologist , which is using a biology to repulse DNA can get segments .
Here &apos;s an example .
This is called Deinocration , called Deinocror , it can make three million rad .
You can see in the square of superior as the croma is destroyed .
In 12 , 24 hours , it &apos;s reassembled exactly as the first .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can do completely .
They can live under a vacuum .
They &apos;re absolutely sure that life is in space , and you can find new environments of water .
ASA true , NASA showed that this happens .
This is a picture of the molecule we &apos;ve built these processes , just using the literally using the segments to put together .
The lievening them automatically .
This is not taken by a electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a very big molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are photograph that they cover a second .
This is the published we did a little time ago .
They are more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the biggest molecule of a definitely structure that &apos;s created by man .
It &apos;s a lot of the swearing 300 million .
If you stampast it with a career 10 without spaces , it would like 142 pages to transcriting this genetic code .
Now , how do we do it work ? How can we activing it ?
Of course , you know , you can see a virus is a game from a guys .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when you use the bacteria .
It &apos;s simpler as well as it is to be as simpler cells as our : you can just extract the nucleo and put it up , which is practical process .
In the bacteria , the archaea is integrated integrated integrated by the cells , but we &apos;ve demonstrated that we can do a complete trape of a cell that we can do a cell from one one cell and activity .
We had a microbial chromosome from a microbial species .
The two are different things like men from topes .
We &apos;ve added some gene in a way we could decide what choose for this chromosome .
The stage of the physical way to kill all proteins .
And when we put it in the cells was study -- and you opening our graphic graphic graphic graphic -- the new croma was going to the cell .
And so we started thinking we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to spuspend more in there .
This is one of the major mecchanisms .
We discovered that many of this species have added a second or a third or a third or a second thousands of new , and in a second thousands of new , and that species .
So who think about evolution as a gene at the time that you modified not a lot of biology .
There &apos;s a scientist &apos;s called the restrial restriition that add digerism that addition digerism .
The chromosome that was in the cells didn &apos;t have one .
The cellula-cell cell that we have a serit-on .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other croma as extraneous material , and we found it , and we found it with only the cells and the new croma .
it &apos;s became blue because of the genes we &apos;ve put .
And in a short llass of time , all the characteristics of a species , and it &apos;s transformed all in a new species , based on the new software we in the cells .
All the proteins changed , members are changed , and when we read the genetic code , exactly what we &apos;ve transfer is exactly what we &apos;ve transfer .
Now , this could look like genetics , but altering the software DNA we can change things in a very fairly suspect .
Now , I &apos;ve got explained that here is not talking about genesius -- but I have a few million years of evolution , and I &apos;ve already said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion in which is going to be created new species on this digital process .
Why do this ?
I think it &apos;s pretty obvious when we think of our needs .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion people to nine billion people at the next 40 years .
Right to give you an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one in 1946 , in 1946 , there will be four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find fresh fresh fresh water and clean , medicinal and a half of people .
It &apos;s going to be more dough to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion pounds of oil .
That means a million barrels a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or whatever we can replaces them , it &apos;s a huge challenge .
We have to hold the whole emission of CO2 from these materials that finished in the atmosphere .
And the day of the scientific discoveries all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that they are the design components for the future .
The electronic industry is only a dozen about components , and think about how many different things are out of it .
Our limits here are principlly by biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have some techniques , these synthesids of synthesization , able to create what we call combinatory genomic genomic genomic genomic .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a day .
Think about this 20 million different genes of different genes or try to make a very good joke the processes to produce opening the processes to make a small team , and we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology , and we can create more biology , and we can change now .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemical , chemical or carburging , or carburging , production , vaccines .
This is an instantaneous instantly , some software programmed on that we &apos;re working for being able to seem species on the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know necessarily how they &apos;re going to be .
We know exactly what they &apos;re exactly their genetic code .
Now we &apos;re now concentrating on the carbons of how fourth generation .
You also see you that extracks that extracks from the grain was a very bad experiment .
We have a second and third generation that will be using enough of the sugar to the higher carbons of higher value as the eight , and different kinds of butanol .
But the only way the biology can have a big impact without increasing more more than food and limitarian avbility , the consciousness of food and limitarian would be transforming CO2 in the first , which we &apos;re working for designing cells that can reach , and we could think we can make this scale , and we think we could have the first carbon , and we could think of that , and we could think we have the first carbon about 18 months .
The solar solar combined with CO2 is a methodowntown -- but in our discoveries all over the world , we found different metothers .
This is a organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , at about 2500 feet of depth of the water temperature of the water temperature of the water .
Cremethane from CO2 using hydrogen molecular hydrogen as energy as a source of energy .
We &apos;re trying to figure out if we can put the CO2 , that can easily be transported through your tubes , converting that CO2 in carburant , to drive this process .
So we can run to think that we could be able to increase what the basic question , &quot; what life is &quot; we have , &quot; We have the food , &quot; we have the holding obirth to replacing the whole oil industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can you do ?
It would be a major funds .
And also , we &apos;re working for using the same methods to create vaccines .
You saw this year with influence , we &apos;re always behind a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s going to find the right vaccine .
I think that we can change that change is building vaccines in anticipated .
Here &apos;s how the future could start to change , now , the tree , the tree of evolution , accelerating the evolution with synthetics , and then , euuuariote cells .
We are so much like that we improve people .
Our purpose is to live long enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the most foundly possible , some fundamental work , the new technology that we &apos;ve taken to a very quickly year ago . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s a environment where you can interact with a local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data .
Here we &apos;re seeing a lot of digital pictures of digital slide with a kind of digital zoom , dying the images as we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these data , or images are these draces of data .
Most of digital photographs , but this is a sudden scanning from the Bilioteca , and reentrepreneurs in the gammer of Congress , and it &apos;s in 300 megapiel .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that is the number of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen in any moment . It &apos;s also a very flexelecture .
This is a book , you don &apos;t images .
This is Dickens of Dickens . Each colonnamed a capital .
To show you that it &apos;s about text and not images , we can do something like this , to make a real thing like this , to see it really is a real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little bit artificial to read a book for a book book .
Don &apos;t recommend it .
This is a more realistic example . This is a lot of the Guardian .
Every big picture is the beginning of a seeding .
And it really gives you the pleasure of the dragonflighting the real version of a magazine or a daily daily draft , which is for a lot of medium .
We also did something with the angle of this particular number of this particular number of this particular number of this particular number of this particular number of this particular number of this particular number of this particular number of this particular number of this particular number of this particular number in the corner of this particular number of this particular number in the corner of this particular number of this particular number in the
We have created a high-solutions -- much more high than what you use in a normal published -- and we put you in a normal ads -- and we put you on the extra extra extra .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even techniques .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that this means to put pop-up and other cheries , similar , and other porcheries , they should not be necessary .
Naturally , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this not I want to lose time , if we don &apos;t want to say that we have a contribution to this field .
These are all the streets in the United States , you can get a geospatial picture of the NASA .
So now , we go to something else .
This is actually actually from the Web ; you can go to see it .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which combined two different technologies .
One is Seadragging , and the other is a very interesting searching for a very interesting computer . Noah Snavely , a student of the University of Washington , with the help of the UW and Rick Seashington , and Research Seadragging .
And it &apos;s from the Web , dress from Seadragon .
You can see that when we do this kind of skill , where we can spend from a picture to another picture of image to the other and have this kind of experience .
But the space collocation of the images here has actually a meaning .
The computer algorithms of the computer visualization has recorded these images together , in a way that the imaging records to the real places -- all the closing neighbors of the Greeat Montagne Roccial Montagne Roccial Montagne Roccial Montagne Roccial Montagne Roccial Montagency , and these things were all at the space .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some much more space .
I want to go to the directly at one of the original sure data set -- and this is from a Photosynth of Photosynth that we did work for the first time , the first time , the first time the summer extated scap -- to show you what I think is really the key behind this technology , Photosynth -- and it &apos;s not necessarily , in the website .
We had to worried about legal and so on .
This is a reconstruction of Nothtrial Dothers . Dimimages Flickr . Bast Din Flickr , and you get images of type in magic and so on . You get images of type in the samp , and you get images of the arcial arming connection of this model .
So , I &apos;m all images from Flickr and they were all lined to the space level in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this way , very simple way .
You know , I would never have thought I &apos;d be able to finish working for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratificant to required this kind of accounts here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of different types of focus , from those of the cellphones to the professional cellphones to the graphic .
And if I can , try to try to get those more strange .
Most are block , etc .
Somewhere there is a photographs of photographs -- etc .
This is a Noththtried in Nothtried .
We can go from the poster to the view of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is taking data from the entire collective memory of how the land , from the entire collective point of view -- and connection point of visual vision -- and connection point of view -- and connection point of visual environment .
All those photograph become connected , the greater of the parts .
You have a ground model of the entire term .
Think about this as the Stephen Lawler &apos;s work in the virtual Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as a lot of people use it , and the vantages that are using using using using using using it .
Their pictures are married by other people .
If someone comes to contrast all these several sang , my picture of the name , my picture of Nothers , and I can use the same , and I can use as a spot point of all those data , and I can use as a spot point of ingraving in that space , using the universe , using the picture of the kind of cross-modity criting criting coss-modity of the kind of cross-modity .
Of course , a consequence of all this is extremely elaborate , extremely elaborate , which is not only a lot of the Earth , tells you you don &apos;t just have a satellitariarian and images , but collective memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What your software is going to do is that somewhere in the next few years , all the photographs , all the photographs shared by anyone in the world will be reading world will be reading together ?
BA : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is actually doing is to find out .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And he &apos;s doing it in the basis of the images .
And it becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of seem information that many of these images are possible .
As when you do a research of images on the Web , you can fit a sentence and the head on the web page , it &apos;s a photograph .
Now , what if that picture is that picture is connected to all your pictures ?
So the amount of simantity interconnection and the amount of wealth that &apos;s really huge . It &apos;s a classical effect of the networks .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible .
BA : Thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure when you travels and one of the research , the power of the holds of the holds that they don &apos;t forget the antic antic antic , between who have the past , the past in the wind , the dump is in the wind , the leaving plant places .
Bastes think that the Jagar &apos;s still beyyond the Via Lattea , or that the Mians , or myths are still connected by meaning , or Himalaya , the buddddisters , the basic central of Dharm , to remember the importance of anthropy , and the idea that the world that we live in which we live in the world we live in the living not exists in which we live in the world , but it &apos;s just a reality , but it &apos;s just a reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stirs made , well , or a bad , a lot of generations ago .
And , of course , we all share the essential thing .
We all nachieve . We all procreating .
We are subjects in the beginning .
We need to death the inexorability of death , so we don &apos;t surprising it if we sang and ballie --
We all have a art .
What hit is the particular rate is the particular rhythm of all culture .
Not matter that are the Penan forests of the Borneo forests , or the followers of Haiti , or the Soot Kaisut , Kenya settal settal Kenya , the Curniture of Ande , or a camellow in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my journey in the desert a month ago , or a hallevator of yak in the valley of yak in the valley of the world .
All these people are teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking ,
And , if you reflection a moment , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
Insive cultures of the world &apos;s cultures a spiritual life and cultural life that is the planet and it &apos;s important for the planet and it &apos;s important for the planet as a biosphere as a biological biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural girl as a cultural nership as an ethnosphere , and you can define the eths , under , inspirations , inspirations , inspirations , inspirations , inspirations , from the human imagination of the known of the known of the knowledge .
Ethnosphere is the fantastic patrimony .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we can be as a little bit as a inquissue .
And because the biosphere was gravelly consumed as it as much as it was as much as a very quickly as quickly .
Nobody biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species was on the easy of the extinction of the extinction , or -- in the highest hypothesis , or the most apocalitting in the most environment of the most optimistic diversity -- that of the most typical diversity -- that of the obvial diversity of cultural diversity .
The dator of all that is , of course , the language .
When you were 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not only a vocabulary or a vocabulary or a series of rules .
One language is the broken of human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle with the animals in the material world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a bind , a thought , a spiritual possibility .
And 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re sitting here in Monterey , at least the half of the children &apos;s sussed in the ears of children .
They don &apos;t come from children , the children , which means , unless you weren &apos;t wonder something , which is not sure .
What is more sad of the sad of being being being being the last , to be the last to talk a language , not have a lingual spromise to be the wisdom of the children ?
This is a horring is somewhere in the world , every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks .
And I know that somebody who say , &quot; Is it doesn &apos;t better ?
The world wouldn &apos;t be a better place if we &apos;re going to talk all the same language ? &quot; We all talk all . Let &apos;s talk all . Let &apos;s talk .
Let &apos;s talk about .
You &apos;ll be a tract thing you want to say , not to talk about your language .
I &apos;d like to do you have a journey through ethnosphere --
a little journey in ethnic ethrow for you to give you a massive of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , &quot; different ways of ways of existing , &quot; I really mean different ways of existing .
We take for example this Barasana bimbs in Amazonia , the population of anacades , which creates the myth of horses of hest high hundred of house in the satt of horse switches .
It &apos;s a population that it &apos;s not able to distinguished the blue color , because the celests is identified in the forest , which is the population .
They have a linguious and a major regle , called the language , &quot; Linguistic exogamia , &quot; you have to spose a person who talk a different language .
All this has gone in the mythological past , but the particularity is that in these families are talking about six or seven , seven or seven , seven , lites no languages .
They limited to listen and then they start to talk .
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived , the Waorani Ecuador , an incredible people , an incredible population , an incredible population , which has the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 means , in 1957 measured a commercial connection .
They have been able to pick out of the photographs that reference them in poses that this population forests , by the way , this is the burning forest had never seen anything .
They &apos;ve been saying the ground pictures , they turned them to the searches of a shape or a figure , they realized that the diol , and they killed the disease , and they killed the liance .
But the Waorans didn &apos;t just killed the straniests .
They killed between them .
Four percent mortality was caused by them .
We &apos;re sitting eight generations and we found two natural death cases , and when we insisted , they have admitted that one of them was so , that one of them was actually dead , and then they knew it . You know , they knew Ad , they had a incredible knowledge of the forest .
The sunners were able to recognize the animal urina from 40 steps and recognizing the species .
In the early 1980 , I was a very interesting compiece when my professor Harvard professor Harvard professor who was going to go to Haiti to intrue Haiti to intrue Haiti and Tonton Macoutside and Tonton Macoutoutside , and move me to the fast the fast of the arbage to use to the the fast the art of the art for the bage to the game to the flew of the ard-using homes .
To give a sense of the miraculous , I should have to understand the Voodoo culture and the Voodoo culture .
It &apos;s a very much more physics of a mea-physics of the world .
Most interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Budddsm , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has no religious feelings . And he &apos;s not religious , and the Vooo is not the distilled of these very profound concepts of these very profound religious concepts that we have a slavism .
What makes interesting is the voodoo is the intense report between life and death .
So the vive the spirits .
The spirits can be invoded by the Great Aqua , respond to the dance of the dance and replace temporary animates at the animal of the vive in a very short that we have the followed becomes the goal .
So , the voodoohisti love to say , &quot; white God go to wake about God .
We give in the temple and become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re sitting , is the spirit that you guide , how can you do the bad ?
So you &apos;re amazing these incredible events : you followed voodoo in the state of trance that touches infuridge , infuels infugee of the power of mind on the body when it catalyes in a state of extremely exciting extremely extremely exciting .
The people with the most extraordinary people who lived the most amazing people in the Sierra Nevada Marta , in the Colombia , in Colombia .
It turns out of the ancivilization that once was living on the carairplanes of Colombia , the population , the population , the population , the population of vulmassicro-to-to-to-to-copy planture .
In a slide continent of blood , this population was never conquisted by the spagners .
And so , I &apos;m governed to a cler , but their formation is extraordinary .
The young people are brought away from the families three or four years , and they live secret in a good way , and hombs in a bag world of the glacier for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years in the nine years of the gestation of the nine months of gestation , now are metaphor , now are metaphor , now are metaphor , now are metaphor , now , they &apos;re metaphorically in the Great Mther .
For all this time , they are acculated to their values of their society , values that their prayers and only their prayers are acculate to the cosmic balance -- or to say the balance equilibrium .
At the term of this incredible initiation , they &apos;re improvide , and the first time in their own life , at 18 years , they see an alba . And in that actim , when the sun basic basic basic , when the sun broken , all that has learned in theory , all that has learned in theorety , all that has been conmitted in the whole , the pret of a behind and says , &quot; : : The pres a steel ,
&quot; See ? Proprise as I said .
It &apos;s studies . Now it &apos;s going to protect it . &quot;
It &apos;s called the majority and say that we , brothers , we are the brothers of the world .
This intuition of intuition is extremely important .
When we think of Indigene and environment , we invodd Rseases and the old history of the bvage , which is a razy concept in his simplicity or maybe we invoded Thoreau and say that these people are more closely to the Earth of us .
Indigenes are not not sentimental populations are not not not sentimate from the nostales .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the Afat , or the vent gelids of the Tibet , but thank you , and the time , they created a mystic of the Earth , they created a mystic intuition of the Earth , not on the concept of the Earth can only live in the world , is that the Earth can only because it is infected from the consciousness of human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
It means that a mountain Ande who grows up to the mountain is a pu that &apos;s a spirit of the Apu that will be a deeply different human being deeply different . And it &apos;s going to be a different mountain or that place in a Montana who grow up with a Montana who grow up with a mountain is a mountain is a mountain is a mountain is a mountain is a mountain is a mountain or that a mountain ,
Whether it &apos;s the dimpointed or a mineral ceasy is irrilevant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Columbia credating that the forests serve to be cut .
That made me a different human being different human being different from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the dimpowers of Hukuk and the history of paradises and the paradisannerments that live in the north of the world , the Hamatan beginning of the world , the Hamatent Hamatan beginning .
If you start to considering that these cultures can actually actually make different reality , you can start to understand some of their sensational discovery .
I &apos;ve taken this picture to open them in the Weszon .
Mayahugly some of you have heard about the ayahuash , the most powerful suspsychoackage .
What makes the eyahudging , is not the pharmacological potential pharmacological potential of the way . It &apos;s composed by two elements .
From a hone , this lian leagues that has a series of carboline , harmers and harmful , slightly hallucinogene .
Prending the only plant plant is a blueaser that altera little bit the consciousness , but it &apos;s mixed with the leaves of a basic family of the caffas the called Psychoia .
This is a little dumptams , very similar to the serotonin , didyltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltrymine .
If you ever see Yanomami rare on for the nose to suspect the suspect methods of species , which is methods methoxyltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryptams .
Tiring that policy on for the nose is a little bit like being disappeared by a file paper and therefore pink and therefore , you can &apos;t believe a distortion of reality .
I was often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who had scened the psychedelical hallucinogens in the 1930 in the 1930 in the 193-in the 1930 in the 1930 in Mexico .
Second my tese tams can &apos;t classify these triptams like hallucinogens because if you can &apos;t tell anybody to be hallucinated .
It &apos;s possible absolutely only if you make other chemical chemical chemical ances that money are MAO .
Now , it &apos;s the beautiful : the carboline , are inibitors of MAO , the same kind of MAO , the same kind of triptams . The source question : in a 80,000 species of plants , like these people are in a 80,000 species of plants , like these people are in this way , they make a very , creating a very , crean verbiochemical version that is sudden that &apos;s a very ,
We use the great euphemism of the evidence of the herror , which can revealing .
But if we ask Indians , they &apos;ll say , &quot; Polts are talking about . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribes , Cofan , has 17 variety of Ehuasuk , which distinguious eyes , and our eyes would come in the same species .
If we ask him how stabilish their tasonomy will tell us , &quot; I thought you know , I don &apos;t know ? &quot; I have . &quot; I have said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take 17 variety in a note of the moon of the moon and each other .
With this is not laurea Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting that contact the press .
Now , , the problem is that the problem is that even the holds of us who have to have the house heart of the history of history , but somehow reduced the history of history in our real world , and the way .
In fact , the 19th century , 300 years , not remember the waterre or the war innovations , but rather as the way we stopped and we stopped active or passively accepted , or passively dealing , or passively dealing , and we have abundded the planet is not change .
All cultures through the centuries were involved in a dance for new possibilities .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux didn &apos;t stop being Sioux when they put up the area , and they did as recess as as Americans don &apos;t have to stop being Americans when they put from the horse and clear .
It &apos;s not the change or the technology that threatening etheless . It &apos;s the power .
The flight of the domination of the domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you discover that these are not destinate cultures are not destinate cultures .
They are living and dynamic creatures out of identifiable forces that go beyond their ability of adaptation .
Which is it of disboss in the patries of Penan --
a population of Sarawak , in the Sarawak , a population that has lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to a generation ago , and now reduction on the region of the rivers , where you can see the river Borneo MaCinese , where you seem that seem to the Borneo Chinese , where the Norsweet , where the names of the horizon-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-asiatic Midd-Asian ,
You replaces to repull the bledge .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that have come with the discovery of the golden .
If we move on the Tibet of the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the volved of politics .
As you know the genocide , the physics of a population , is condanted to the universal level , but the ethnic of a population , not only is condanted , but it &apos;s not condaned , but it &apos;s celebrated in certain environments , because it &apos;s part of the developing strategy of development .
And you can &apos;t understand the Tibet in the Tibet until you go from the beginning .
I ran 6,000 miles from Chengu dental Chengu dental Tibet , through the Tibet , coming to Lhasa with a young , but only came to Lhasa , but only came to Lhasa I realized what we &apos;re going to talk about .
6,000 mountain reducts and centers .
1.2 million people killed from the military Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascrited to Panched Lama .
And the means that it was killed to the Chinese invasion .
Shuncle is sitting with Santity in Santity during the diaspores in Nepal .
His mother was imprisoned and his colpa was rich .
It was taken to hidden in carbing in the age of two nasd years , hidden &apos;t living without him .
The sister , who made the same , was made the same , was put in reeducation .
One day , he has inavverted a daily fashion Mao and , for this transgression , was put forced to the forced jobs for seven years .
The Tibet of the Tibet can be insopy , but the spirit of the population is from a tenpresent .
And the fin the end , it all reduces .
We want to live in the world world &apos;s world &apos;s a homatic monotony or we want to collect the policromatic world of diversity ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he said that his bigger &apos;s bigger , in our advice to this vision of the world , we &apos;ll just see the whole whole amorous human imagination is a modality of human imagination is a modality of modality , but one day a day , we &apos;ll see that there were other possibilities .
And it &apos;s umiliating our species is that we have been for 60,000 years .
The Revolution , which has given us the agriculture , which has done us to have the seen of the seed of the seed , and by the next few of the closer , by the closer , creating the hierarchy of specifically , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The industrialized world has been 300 years .
That slaughter history not suggests me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to deal with the millennnia to come .
When these myriadic mriadies what it means to be human , they respond to be human , they respond to be human voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers we all returned the chance of being what we are , a kind of consciousness , that has to be what we are , in a way that all population and all the people and all the gardens can fiord .
I took this picture on the north of Baffin , when I went to the hundred of balene , when I went to the wonder of the whales , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya story of his nonfather .
The canadvice was not always gentile with the Inuit and in the 1950s to stabilie our soul , we have them in colonies .
The non-grandfather refuse to go .
And the family , themselves for his life , he brought to all the arms , and all of his own tols .
You have to know that Inuit doesn &apos;t feel the cold , they don &apos;t feel the cold .
The slites were slites of slums were made of fished fished shells .
The non-men doesn &apos;t have to intimidddle from arctic note or the lizarctic note .
It &apos;s gacross , it &apos;s spot , the baled broken the skin of foca and defecated in their hand . When the feckers were conged , it &apos;s working on a mothers .
He sprurized on the points of this cacces of this caccess and when solid solid , he killed a dog .
He history , and created a bright , with the Adddrop with the Addddye , he sleep , and he &apos;s sleep on the banchisa , and he sleep on the banchisa , and he sleep on the rest .
We want to talk about cavarsela ? &#91; Rish &#93; . &#93; And this , in different ways , in different ways , &#91; Applauses &#93; is the symbol of Indigenes and all the world &apos;s population and all the world &apos;s population of the world .
In the oprile 1999 , the canadvation has redded to the total control of a largest of the California and Texas the largest California and Texas apas a set of California and Texas apas a together .
It &apos;s their new patric . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a territory territory . They contrict all the mineraries .
One splendiging example of how a national national state can recognize with his population .
And , finish , I think it &apos;s quite obvious to the planet , I think it was in these slightly switches of the planet , make it remote .
For somebody &apos;s home .
They know , they know , the human imagination that are rising the daily of the days . And for us all these children , as the children , as the sample of our children , as the geography of the hope .
For finally , we National Geographic we are convinced that politicians will never arrivers anything .
We believe that polemy --
&#91; Applauses are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and we maybe we &apos;re the best institution to tell the world , and we &apos;re the best institution to tell the world . Every month , our site 35 million visit .
156 countries our television we transmit .
Our revists are slets from millions of people .
Our work is traveling in ethnosphere to bring our public in the ethels of wonderful cultural reveal and hopefully , hopefully , hopology , they will hope to be able to be in a diversity , and we have to find a style of life in a pluralistic life in a pluralistic world , and mought to find a style of multicultural life in a pluralists and multural world .
where the wisdom of all the population of all the people can contribute to our collective well-being .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope called &quot; others that you &apos;ve heard and I &apos;m going to evidence some colleagues , in case , not notaste .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the official dogma officer . &quot;
The officer of what ?
The officer of all the Western industrial society of all the Western official societies : &quot; If we want to male the well-being of our citizens &quot; &quot; The way to be to male the individual freedom . &quot;
The reason is , from a side , in the fact that freedom is in the same value , is precious , useful , for human beings .
As the other is that if we are free , each of us can act for the way to do everything that that massive myzes our well-being , without any decided in named our .
The way to male the freedom is to male choice .
More people are liberty , the more liberty , and greater is their liberty , greater is their liberty , greater is their well-being .
This is , I think , it &apos;s so deeply radicated in the society that nobody would dream to put it in doubt .
And it &apos;s also deeply radicated in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I lost a simple note on condents for insalate .
In my supermarket , there are 175 condents , without contact , without contact oil oil , and 12 acet holds and 12 acet acets you can buy a huge number of condents in the resilient resive in the rescious resilient of your dededededededecing .
Here &apos;s the supermarket .
You go to the electronic store to buy a store : case , CD , radio , radio , pleastra , amplifer , amplifer , amplifer .
And in this single negotial store , there &apos;s a big number of audio components .
We can make six and a half million different combinations of using the components that there are in a only negotial negotial .
You have to admit that there &apos;s a lot of choice .
Other fields : the communications world .
Once I was a child , you could get all the services , you could get all the desire , the basic phone of the mom Bell .
You were born the telephone , not buy it .
One of that , among the other , was that the phone was that the phone was never spot .
These days are gone .
We now have a variety neighborhood , especially between cellphones .
Here &apos;s the cell phones of the future .
My favorite is the middle , MP3 , MP3 , cut , cut the nose , and the broken to me .
If you don &apos;t have seen it in the house , you &apos;re not seen certain you &apos;re going to get .
And what happens is that people come into the stops and makes this question . And you know what the answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cellphone that doesn &apos;t make too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more importantly than the acquire , you know , the same explosion of choices .
Asanitarian sistence : not happens in the United States that you go from the doctor and doctor , what you have to do .
Instead , go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; Okay , we could do it , or &quot; As &quot; A , &quot; B has these benefits . &quot;
You say , &quot; Doctor , what should I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A has these benefits and risks , and the risks and the risks . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebats : &quot; Doctor she was me , what would be ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result , we call it &quot; autonomy of the malseem , expression that it seems to be a beautiful thing .
But it &apos;s actually not that a fishing the weight and responsibility to make someone who knows something , which is the doctor , someone else knows , whatever certainly , it &apos;s not -- and so it &apos;s not the patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing products of drugs , direct to people like me and you , that if you think about it doesn &apos;t have any sense , because we don &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why do they publiician ?
The answer is that they want to be that domactor called the doctor to change it .
Something so fundamental identity as our orever is a choice of choice , as you see in this jamed vilian &quot; in this jamed vilian &quot; We don &apos;t want to provide their sex right now at the right time . &quot;
And we can reinventing how many times we get us .
Which means that every morning , to be able to be able to be able to be .
She said , &quot; People , the maybe a common prospeces , almost anyone , was that you could , and it was that you could have the most soon as possible , and he started to make the most soft possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , not even when , not even what to do after .
Oggidday , it &apos;s really to play .
I teach a very intelligence students , and I do 20 percent work in less than a time .
And not because they &apos;re not smart , because they &apos;re not not smart , because they &apos;re not not not smart .
but because I &apos;m impensieritites , I mean , I &apos;m going to spose , &quot; I should not go to now ? &quot;
&quot; Do I must must be sposed to be thinking about the basic or career ? &quot;
They are logorananananants .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this implement , not completing the companies that you don &apos;t get a beautiful vote to my exture .
And they have to do it . They have to do it . They have to do it . They have to do it . They have to do it . They have to do it . They have to do it . They have to do it . They have to do it . They have to do it . They have to do it . They have to do it . They really important .
Now , the job : we are fortunate , as Carl Soolineen , because technology allows us to work every day , from Hotel Randolph .
Tra parentests , there &apos;s a angolin , and I don &apos;t tell anybody , where the WiFFi works .
I don &apos;t say , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , this incredible freedom of choice we have to continuously deciding , if we have to work or not continuously , if we have to work or not .
We can go to the snap , with the cell phones in a task , Blackberry in the other , and the basic , and the night , and the kberry , on the ginocy .
And even though they &apos;re all spended , every minute that we see our child , we also see our child , we also ask , &quot; I have to answer this call ? &quot;
&quot; Do I answer this email ? &quot; I have to habboard this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is &quot; no , &quot; this makes the experience of your child very different from what would be in other conditions .
So , as we look at all , small things , and big materials and big , materials and life , life is a choices , life is a choicken .
Once the world was this : Over , there were some possibilities , but not all the time , it was a choice of choice .
The world today is a slide of this : The dilemma is , &quot; Is it a positive thing ? &quot;
The answer is Scially , you know ,
So we all know , we all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative latest ones .
This is all about two effects , two negative effects on people .
The first , paradoximately , is that it produces fliberation .
And so many of the options that choose , it becomes very hard to do it .
You offer an example meaning : a study example of volunteer plan on the plan of voluntary patterns .
A college has access to the Vanhead data , the giant society of the Vanald , with about a million climbs in 2000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that is offered in more , the percentage of adhesion , the percentage of adhesion .
With 50 source , there &apos;s 10 percent , in less adesions , as they are available to when I &apos;m only five . Why ?
Because with 50 source of the source , it &apos;s disease , it &apos;s hardly hard to decide , and the choice is remandy to the indomories .
And domories , and domorders , domorders , domorous , of course , domorly domorous , and of course , domorly domorous , and of course , domances , of course , domorous domories , and of course , domorances , of course , domorances , and of course , domorous domories to domorate domories .
You know , it doesn &apos;t just mean that these workers are going to eat for canoes because they don &apos;t have enough money , it also , it also means that decision is so hostica that the decision is so hostica that they also have the complementary of work .
Not teaching , they &apos;re losing until five dollars per year from the dator of work , which would be going to be traveling them .
So the paralysis a consequence of the hanging of the scodd .
And I think that makes the world like this .
&quot; And finally , to the ethernity : ketchup , or maybe or maionese ? &quot;
You would like to take the right decision , if it &apos;s for eeternity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong soul , and nepural consummation .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can avoid paralysis , and we finally are less satisfied by the result of how we would be with less options that choose .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of conditions , which choose , if you buy a little bit of it , it &apos;s easy easy that you could make a different choice that would be better . And that &apos;s what happens was better . And that &apos;s what happens is that the alternative imagined us , and the repiece of the choice , and the satisfied the sfied of the choice , and the sodenter defense , and the satisfied soften by the decision ,
even when it was a very good decision .
More choices are , more easy to displaced with any detail of the choice that is insodas as it is insodas .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has clear very well , like the value we &apos;re depending on what we are confronted with .
In the rest , when there are a very options , it &apos;s easy to represent the characteristics of the alternative characteristics that you have to be less satisfied of the option that is choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I wrote with all those who are not New York .
But that &apos;s what you probably would think .
There &apos;s this coppia of Hamptons .
A site of lussions .
Spills . Otymma day . Otymma day .
Nothing . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , maledition , is August . &quot;
&quot; All my neighborhattan are away . &quot;
&quot; I could talk about home . &quot;
And it turns out two weeks absolutely , the idea that &apos;s losing -- every day -- the chance of parking where it wants .
The costo-opportunity is declining the sodas for what we have , even when choice was birth .
And the more of the options we have to consider , the more actual characteristics , we will return out to the ex-opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a vision of it tells us a lot of things .
It &apos;s about the time , and maybe of living slowly .
But the most important point is that you choose , you choose , you choose not to do other .
The things we don &apos;t choose have a lot of attractive that can make less attractive what we do .
Tirst : the ral growing of expectations .
I tried it on my skin compring a new jeans .
I &apos;m going to almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were a kind of bought , compraved them and wrestment , they were scomfortable , only after they took them a life and washed a lot of time , and they were wasn &apos;t begin to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple again when the old people , I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Who wants slim , fit &apos;s fit , relaxed by relaxed ? &quot;
You want them to the nera or bottons ? &quot; Stonewashed &quot; or &quot; acizashed &quot; or &quot; acizashed ? &quot;
&quot; Who wants ? &quot;
&quot; Sive the basic or strets ? Bol bla -- &quot; Continured to elency .
I was boundary , and after a little bit , I was able to say , &quot; I want the guy that was the only guy that was , so for a hour , I tried me all of the jeans , and then I came out of the best jeans , I was going to use me , I gave the best draw , with the best dyspot , with the best daily jeans that I had .
It was the very big . I had the whole choice I had the best .
But I was feeling worse .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand that .
The reason I was worst for the whole choice is that with all the skells were altim , the jeans had to be perfect .
And I started waiting . I didn &apos;t expectations of the except when there was only a guy , but when there was a kind of a guy , at least a kind of hundred , at least a guy had to be perfect .
What I was busted was good , but not perfect .
After I liked the choose that choose to what I was trying to confront of the expectations .
The addition of options in life , people don &apos;t make the expectations that have respect to the excellence of options .
And this is less satisfying , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the marketing world if I realized .
Because if they knew it , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is a more about this .
&quot; You were better when you were worse when you were worse , &quot; The reason you were better when you were worse when you were worse , it was even meet , you could meet surprised to meet surprised .
Oggidday , in the world we live -- opulents , industrialized , citizens with the perfection of perfection -- the most hopefully , the hopefully history .
You never sprise because your expectations , you know , my expectations , you have ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Basse expectations . &quot;
I mean , small moment , self-hyographic moment , and it &apos;s really study .
I couldn &apos;t have to do better , I didn &apos;t have to be able .
But to be not always bad is a bad thing .
And then finally , a consequence of buy a couple of jeans scomfortable when there &apos;s only that you &apos;re not severe , and you ask you , and ask you , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot;
The world is responsible . What could I do ?
When there are hundreds of types of jeans , and you buy a disaster , and you ask , and you ask , you ask , is as clear that you are .
You could do better .
With hundreds of variety , there are no scratches for the insuccess .
So when people are decisions , even though the result is valid , they feel unexpected and they give the bathers .
In the last few years , depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a meaning that a meaning -- not the only one , but important -- of this depression of depression is that people have experiences of the standard people because the standard experience are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation , they think the college is their own .
So the final result is that we &apos;re better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely false . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than it has not to have a little bit better than that there is a little bit better than a little bit .
There &apos;s a critical value , magical . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve been a piece of a piece of the level that choices better our life .
Now , from the political point of view -- I have almost finished -- from the political point of view , the noise is the following .
What allows is the whole choice in the industrial society is the material wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is they have too pocket .
So the facility of modern that I &apos;m talking about is a malbeing malesclusive of modern , recidesizing society .
And what it does deprove and arrand is this : Steve Levitt &apos;s talked about how those expensive and snap seats for near-bathers are useful . It &apos;s a weather of money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and dispendious , it &apos;s not useful .
They are deleteries .
They do stay worse .
If a little bit of what in our societies , it &apos;s revered in those where people have too few possibilities , it would not be the better life , not just their life , but it would be better , but it also would be our better life , but it &apos;s also .
This is what economists call a parethan ,
A distribution of the reduction is good for everybody -- not just the poor -- not just the poor -- because of this choice that comes out .
To conclude : &quot; You can become everything you want to be --
You , people of culture , you think , &quot; What is that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious you can &apos;t make anything in a glass of glass . &quot;
&quot; An imagination , a limited vision of the world -- &quot;
And I &apos;ve been interpreted in this , at the beginning .
But then , I realized that that fish the long known that that fish the long knowledge .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you eat the blood , so that &quot; everything is possible , &quot; you can &apos;t get freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you romotate the drugs that all possible possible declining as sofation .
You know , you &apos;re going to go to go to go to go .
You all need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too stricks , maybe even for us .
But the aximments , the aximolic symbolic , I &apos;m not happiness and I , for the rovina .
Thank you very much .
