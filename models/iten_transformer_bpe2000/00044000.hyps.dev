Last year I showed these slides to demonstrate that the hot glacial glacial , which for almost three million years has had the size of 48 United States continental .
However this is the gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t shows the spent of the ice .
The arctic glacial is , in a certain sense , the pulsant heart of the global climate system .
You expanding in the winter and the summer .
The next slide is going to be a quick carrying on on the lights of the last 25 years .
The ice loss have been signed in red .
As you can see , they expand to the blue .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter , which broads of summer .
And you can see that the ice cooled ice , of five years , it &apos;s like the blood , which is like the blood , which five years from the body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s gone .
This is a problem because the interests that interests the ground of the glacier , where there are enormous amount of coal amount of carbon conger that , shoulders are transformed in the microbi .
Rest to the totality of the atmospheric and global warming , that amount could double , that amount could double .
In some short laghi in Alaska , it &apos;s already rebroken by the water .
The professor Katey Walter of the University of the University of the University of the University .
Video : Wow !
One reason is that this termal exchanger the Greenland from north .
This is a river to glacial .
The door had never reached levels like this .
This is the Kangered Kangerlush , in the Southeast Greenland .
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea level to the short of ice ice ice on terrain on terrain .
These rhns are increasing .
At the other part of the planet : Antarctica , the biggest block of the planet .
The month last month , scientists have declared that the balance of the ice is in negative , and the Antarctica Antartarctica , which is particularly rapid in the science .
It &apos;s a six feet of the waters , like in Greenland .
Sull Himalayas , the third biggest block , you see new laghits , which few years ago , that a few years ago , which a few years ago .
For 40 percent of the world population had gotten water from that leaves .
Sull Ande : this glacier is the source of the water source of this city .
The door is increased .
But when you diminishing , the same happens to the water .
In California , the Sierra Nevada is declined 40 percent .
The houses are in crisis .
The predictions , as you &apos;ve read , they &apos;re gravy .
The growth security in the world leads to a remarkable increases .
The environmental disasters are increasing a rhythm out of the normal and without precedented .
Sometimes the numerous 30 years in the last 30 years of the previous 75 .
This is an unsustainable thing .
If you look in the historic context , you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 tons of CO2 tons in the oceans every day .
Look at the area of the Pacific Eastern Pacific , to American , and on both parts of Indian subcontinent , where there &apos;s a radical pattern in the oceans .
The major cause of global warming , together to the deforestation , which is 20 percent , it &apos;s the use of fossil fuels .
The oil is a problem , and the coal is even worse .
The United States are one of the two more emissions , together at China .
And it was proposes to build a lot of other centers .
But we &apos;re asking a change of direction .
These are the ancient projects in the last few years and some of the green alternative alternative .
At every way , there &apos;s a politician in our country .
The carbon industries and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the coal year , to promote carbon , which is a hosystem .
That image I remember something --
Very Natal , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion pounds of coal scories .
You may have seen it on the news .
This is the second biggest flows in America .
It happened around Natal .
The published nature of one of the coal industries was this .
Video : My carbon is a carbon and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it makes our economy .
At the carbon is more and more clear .
It &apos;s good price , it &apos;s adorable and the workers are the stipended .
Al Gore : From the West Virginia &apos;s West Virginia .
The biggest societies on the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administration .
Don Blankenship : Don Blankenship -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosous , Harry Reid -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima Protection of Clim has launched two campaign .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Ator : Ator COALergy , we see the climate change as a seriously seriously .
So this priority is to invest a big amount of money in a effort of money in a effort to make public and confused the truth .
In fact , the coal is not sports .
We think it &apos;s clean -- it also has a good profit .
So , not preoctor of climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Ator : Carbone clean -- you &apos;ve heard of it .
So let &apos;s take a turn in a struggle to a clear as a clean of clean clean .
Straordinary machines are a rumor , but this is the sound of coal technology .
The carbon consumption is between the major causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology of clear clear that you see changes everything .
Take a look : this is the clear technology of clean clean .
Al Gore : Finally , the positive alternative alternative , and the national security .
Video : America is in crisis ; the economy , national security , national security climate crisis .
The philos that connects all : our dependence from fossil fuels , like carbon and oil .
Now , though , there &apos;s a new , audace solution to use .
Repower : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to put America at work , to make us safer , and help to stop global warming .
Finally , one solution that we can solve our problems .
Repower power .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : This is to reduce America .
One of the fastest ways to ask the dependence from the combustible that kills our planet .
Comparts : The future is here . I feel , one new energy .
South two : Novi investments for a retributed jobs .
Comment : As America . It &apos;s time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old proverbium proverbirth says , &quot; If you want to go fast , go from it .
If you want to go away , go together . &quot;
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED I did an introduction on the LHC .
And I promise to return you about how the machine works .
So , here I am . And for the ones that the other time , the LHC is the biggest experiment ever trial -- 27 kilometers of circumference .
Her task is to recognize the conditions that were present less than a billion second in the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
This is simply environment .
This is the Ginevence .
We pick these mini-Bang in the middle .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLATLAS -- it &apos;s 44 feet .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in buildings .
Ten September 10 section of the last year we have accent machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was cause of huge festegments in control room .
It &apos;s a picture of the first particles of particles who had all around the LHC , and entering in collision , with a collision , with a part of the LHC , and spreading particles inside the rest .
In other words , when we see that image 10 , we found that picture , we realized that the machine worked , the machine worked , which is a great victory .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to make us exultation more or that , when somebody went to Google and he saw the page was this .
That means we &apos;ve had a cultural impact impact as a scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , I had to these phils here -- these dorates .
These phils bring 13,000 frightened when the machine works at the most of the power .
Now , the technicians between you and watch the files and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . &quot;
And instead they can do it because when they &apos;re very cold to become the cost-called superconductors .
So , unless 271 degrees , to a inferior temperature to the space between the stars , these philos can bring that run .
In one of the junk of the younger magnets in the LHC , there was a factory of fabrication .
So the phils surroundly , and 13,000 , and the 13,000 amps improvising an electric resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think these magnets more than 20 tons of tons , and that were moved of about 30 feet .
They are damaged about 50 magnets .
We had to take them , what we did .
We &apos;ve been resisted .
Now , they &apos;re coming back to all the sub-place .
By the end of marze the LHC will be again .
We &apos;re going to accent it , and we expect to get the jugment , and continue our adventure to discover which is the universe .
Now , of course , in a certainly way , these crashes are the debate on the value of science and engineering . It &apos;s easy to confuture .
I think the fact that it is so difficult , the fact to go beyond , I think this is the value of things like LHC .
I &apos;d like to conclude with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , I imagine in the unuseful experiments of his pupillo , his pupillo was Michael Faraday , he said , &quot; Not is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind that science is , which we don &apos;t have any new mysters in nature ,
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to start thinking about when , from children , playing , from children , played with his morning .
As you figured out how to reach them and rate them , take them and move them , learned actually to think and solve problems and solve problems understand relationships .
The reasoning reasoning is profoundly connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , from the information from the uslity of our interaction with physics objects , together my consult Patts , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I began to ask me , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of having the only cursor of the mouse as a digital polet that you mouse mouse as a digital policy that we can digital information .
and figure our placement ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is an interactive computers like a behind .
In a few words , a Siftable is an interactive computers like a behind .
You can move them with the hand , they can see , &quot; they can see , &quot; you know , &quot; and they have a run and a radio scream and a radio .
But above , they are physical objects , like the morning , you can move , you can move them .
Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physical , knowledge of the movement , of the other , and as they become more physical , of other , how we can exploring new , of how we move them , we can exploring new and enters of interaction .
I &apos;m going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show the video : if it incline in a direction , it &apos;s going to rotate on the other hand .
These are interactive of other people .
If you do them , they &apos;re interested in what it is .
If they are surrounded , they can act a little bit .
If they are surrounded , they can act a little bit .
They have their movement and include .
And then we realize that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power to use communicate gestures , &quot; a color like a liquid color like a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configured as a center , and I can use them for the color in that central color in that central .
and I can use them for real color in the central of the color in that central .
If we get too , we can put it up , we can put a little place .
It &apos;s also beautiful possibility of learning , like languages , the mathematics and logic games where people can try and see the results , and see the results of them .
Now I &apos;m --
This is a sequence of Fibonaces that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a game of words that &apos;s in the middle and Boggle .
Pratically , to every turn on any Siftable on every Siftable , Pratically , Pratically , to every turn on any Siftable , and whereas , and whereas , and whereas a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you &apos;ve got a new set of letters and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
And here &apos;s the children came up to the Media Lab , I made them so that they tried them and turned a video .
They are very pleased .
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people many instructions .
You just say , &quot; Compons of words , and they know what to do .
Here &apos;s what other people who try it .
This is our younger Extester , there on the right .
He actually wanted only to employ them .
They were only morning for him .
Now , this is an interactive cardboard .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning languages languages is Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , Siftable them .
It can put new characters in the scene , Siftable them .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : The sun is source .
David Merrill : Now he brought a tractor in the scene .
Video : The arange tractor .
Good job !
So by schooling the Siftable and put them neighbors can interact the characters --
Video : Bau !
And by inventing their story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a story with the open , and it can decide him as it flies .
DM : It &apos;s a story with the open , and it can decide him as it flies .
Volunteer : Good .
DM : The last example that I have the time to show you is a tool , realized of recently , to sample , to sampling music .
It &apos;s an instrument , realized of recently , to sample and execute music .
The Siftable here are act sounds like base , and the battery .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also put these sounds in a sequence to compose these sounds in a sequence .
And modificate it simply by touching a &quot; sound &quot; and a sequence . &quot;
These are effects that you can control from alive , like the reverse and the filter .
So this guy at a particular sound , and then including to fix it .
And then there are the general effects as time and volume , which are applied to the whole sequence .
We look at how it works .
Video : DM : We &apos;re going to start putting a base in two Siftable , &quot; sequence &quot; sequence , we &apos;re extensive it .
Now I &apos;ll put one line .
Video : Now , I add some percussion --
Video : And I &apos;m going to put the filter to the bacteria , so I can control the effect .
Video : DM : I can speak the entire sequence inating time from one side .
Video : And I &apos;m going to add the bottom to get more expression .
Video : DM : I can reombing the sequence . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to plan it first , but I can improvide it , and I can make it longer ,
And now , finally , I can split the entire sequence in the left Siftable &quot; volume . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new man machine and more like a machine and more like our brain and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some possibility that we &apos;re trying to get out of the lab .
The concept that I want to transmit is coming to this new generation of design objects to interact with digital media , which will take information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time to talk to all of you .
I &apos;m a writer .
Sort books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the fails of my life .
And I don &apos;t expect that it can change .
But , said this , something particularly happened in my life and in my career , and in my career , who brought me to do this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called &quot; Manda , Prega , Ama , Prega , Ama , &quot; which , for some reason I &apos;ve become a big , for some reason that it has become a big , sensitive books .
And the result is that everywhere goes now , people treat me as if I were convicted .
It &apos;s true -- convicted .
They come from me now , everybody worried and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t fear that you can &apos;t do fear more ?
Don &apos;t you fear to continue to write all the life without powerful lifetime to create a book that can important ? &quot;
What can it important to someone ? &quot;
It &apos;s rassuring , you know .
But it may be worse , I remember that I remember more than 20 years ago , when I began to say to people -- I was an adolescent -- I wanted to be a written .
And I would meet the same reaction based by fear .
And people told me , &quot; Don &apos;t get successful ?
Don &apos;t you fear that the humiliation of the rejumiliation ?
You couldn &apos;t be afraid to do this all life without any life without any lifetime and die on a couple of all infrants with the mouth of all infrants . &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I &apos;m afraid of all those things .
I &apos;ve always had afraid .
And I also have afraid of many other things that people may not guess .
As the algae and other stuff .
But , as much about the write what I thought , and I thought , and I would ask me what I thought and wonder is why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logical that anybody should have waiting to be achieved by a job that you feel to do .
But what is so particularly in the creative enterprises to make us nervous about health mental health in a way that other careers do not ?
Like my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer , and I don &apos;t remember one once in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if he were aframed to be engineer ?
There was never -- that block of John engineer John , what ?
It didn &apos;t work like that , you know ?
Onestly , the chemical engineers like group have no , in the century , in the centuries , the reputation of being alcolized manized .
We have enough , we have enough this reputation , and not only writers but creative of every gender , we have this reputation of being enormous instable mentally .
And it &apos;s not going to look at the trists of the magnifices of the magnifices of the magnifics , only in the 21st century , they died young people died young , they died young ments .
And the ones that have no suicidated seems to be really disfaced by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before I die , in the last interview , he said , &quot; Every book killed me a little bit more .
But we don &apos;t bad it until we heard this because we &apos;ve heard these things so long that in some way we have completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are in some way , and that the art , at the end .
And the question I want to ask everybody here today is : Did you agree with this idea ?
You know this thing -- because it also -- because it &apos;s looking at it from a couple of distance to me .
I think it &apos;s odiosa .
And I think it &apos;s dangerous , and I don &apos;t want to see it perpetuate in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our great creative minds to live .
And of course , I know that in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start figing towards that I was very dangerous circumstances that I &apos;m in my career .
So , really -- look , I &apos;m pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I have still about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything I &apos;m going to writing right now is going to be judicated from the world as the work that I came out of the last book .
I &apos;m going to be claims , because we &apos;re all more or friends here -- it &apos;s likely that my biggest success to me .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thought that brings a person to begin to get a person in the morning nine and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would keep doing this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it seems to me , after many reflection , that the way of work to keep write is to create a psychological construct psychological , OK ?
I have some way to find a security distance between me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxiety about what the reaction can be . And as I was looking for all the last year . And as I was looking for all the last year , trying to find other societies to see if they could have better ideas to see if they could have better ideas to see if they could have the best ideas and more .
about how to help people remainerent the emotions of creativity .
And that research has taken me to the ancient Greek and ancient Rome .
Let me go back .
In the ancient Greek and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem belief that creativity was from men , OK ?
It was thinking that creativity was this spirit , and he came up and he came to men from a few distant and unknown for the distant and unknown for distant distant and unknown reasons .
The Greek called these spirits of the creativity of creativity ,
Socrate , wonderful , he believed to have a demon a demon wisdom .
The Romans were the same idea , but they called the kind of spirit without body a genius .
which is great , because the Romans didn &apos;t really think a genius was a particularly intelligent .
They believed that a genius was this sort of divine that was created literally in the walls of a study of an artist , a little bit like the Dobby , and it came out to hidden the work of it .
Now , here &apos;s worth -- this is the distance of which I &apos;m talking about -- that psychological construct you from the result of your work .
And everybody knew that it was so it worked , right ?
So the ancient artists were protected by certain things , like the narcism , right ?
If your work was exciting was exciting , you couldn &apos;t take all the market , everybody knew that you were helped by this genioral genioral .
If your fales work , it wasn &apos;t all those fales , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be an unable .
And so people han conceived creativity in the West for a long time .
Then the Renasent came and all changed , and all changed , and born this great idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe and mysteries and not leaving space to creatures that write from the divinity .
This was the principle of humanity , and people began to think that creativity is completely from the issue .
And for the first time in history , he began to refer to this or that artist as a rather genius than a person with genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think it allows somebody , a simple person of believing being like a source , the essence and the sorts of creative mysters , creative , unknowledge and an ethernal responsibility to give the psystems .
It &apos;s like to ask someone to enjoy the sun .
Death and fully the ego and creates all of these expectations on performance .
And I think it was this pression to destroy artists in the past 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think it &apos;s , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe back to a bigger understanding of the relationship between humans and creative mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t sing 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people among the audience that there would be scientific suspended on the notion of the notion of the notion of them .
Probably not convinced you all about this thing .
But the question I &apos;d like to ask is -- why not ?
Why don &apos;t that way ?
Because it has more sense of all the other thing I &apos;ve ever heard to explain the exaspering exaspering exaspering .
A process that , as anyone that I &apos;ve ever tried to do something -- so , fundamentally , everybody here -- you know , you don &apos;t comport rationally .
And in fact , it can sometimes seem completely paranormal .
I did this met recently with the extraordinary poet Ruth Stone , which has now 90 years old , but it was a poetic for all life and he told me that during his childhood in the Virginia , worked out in the camps , and he heard , in if a poem to the landscape .
He said he was like a fragorous train of air .
And she came up to her landscape .
He felt it coming , because he would be tremendous under his feet .
He knew to have one thing to do at that point and he was , &quot; he was , &quot; running like a matx . &quot;
And so correct to the house , and he was washed by this poem , and he would not have to take a piece of paper and a faster math , while he would raise take it and raise it on the page .
Other times he couldn &apos;t be fast , so corrected , so corrected and running and correct without having home and the poetry was roll and she would continued to roll through the landscape , trying , as he said , &quot; another poet . &quot;
Then there were those times -- this piece I &apos;ll never forget -- there were a moments where they were almost losing , right ?
So he was running at home and he was looking for the paper and the poetry her , and he would be a math in the time , and he said , that it was like you drop with the other hand .
He willing the poetry from the tail and put him in his body and putting her in the page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be presented on the perfect page and intact page , but in the last word at the time .
So when I heard it -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly equal to my creative process .
Not all of my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conducture !
I &apos;m a moving , and my way to work is , and I &apos;m wake up to the same eye every day and work and swake up and work and swake up with it .
But even me , in my testardaggin , I led against that thing , sometimes .
And I imagine that many of you .
You know , even though the work and the ideas came up with a certain source , I could not honestly know it .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate it to do it in a way that we don &apos;t lose the head , but , rather , what does it remaining us healthy ?
For the best example of me , the best contemporary example that I have is the musician , which I interviewed a different years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life has been the incarnation of the artist , looking for control , trying to control of control , dominate these species of pulses of totally interiorized impulses .
But then he stood up , and he was driving up , and one day as he was driving in Los Angeles , he changed everything for him .
He was going quickly , and all of a switness , this little slide melodies , which comes to his head like inspiration , elusive , elusive , and you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and it doesn &apos;t know how it .
It doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a register .
And so it starts to feel this species of anxiety , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , &quot; I &apos;m going to stay obsessed by this perspective song .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to the panic , he stopped .
He gave the whole mental process and did something completely new .
And he just watched the sky and said , &quot; Scause , don &apos;t see that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Do you have a song to write a song now ?
If I really want to exist , I come back to a bit more when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , you &apos;re going to care someone else today .
You &apos;re going to disturbing Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his process worked changed after this .
Not the work , the work was still obscure .
But the process , and the anxiety that was allowed when he took the genius , the genius who had anything else and liberying it .
but it wondered this peculiar , wonderful collaboration between Tom and this is a conversation between Tom and this external thing that it wasn &apos;t Tom .
So , how I heard that story started changing a little bit even the way I worked me , and he save me once .
This idea , he save me when I was writing , &quot; Manda , Prega , Ama , &quot; and frozen in one of those dispersed in which we &apos;re all working on something and we can &apos;t begin to think it &apos;s a disaster , which is going to be a disaster , which is going to be the worst book .
Not just bad , just the worst book written .
And I started thinking to throw this project .
But then I remember of Tom who was talking to the air and tried .
So I ran up my face in the manoscrits and I would say , my comments to a corner of the room .
And I said to high voices , &quot; Hear , what , we know that if this book is not going to be bright , it &apos;s not going to be full , right ?
Because as I can see me , I &apos;m putting everything I have , no longer than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to show you and do your part .
Okay . But if you don &apos;t , you know what , I don &apos;t do it .
I &apos;m going to write the same thing because it &apos;s my work .
And I would like this to be recorded that I today , I slied to do my part . &quot; Because it &apos;s so , OK -- it does in the North Africa &apos;s deserts in North Africa , the people would gride for the north and hours .
And they were always wonderful , because the dances were professionals and they were fantastic .
But all the time , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists was actually transcending it .
And I know what I talk about , because I know you &apos;ve all seen it , at a certain point , a performance .
It was like the time he stopped , and the danced dancing the walks through a kind of landscape and it wasn &apos;t doing anything different from the usual , like the 1,000 nights before .
And sudden not just like a human .
But it turns out from the divinside and below illuminate in the fire of divinity .
And when this happened , to the time , people knew what it was , people knew what was , called it with her name .
They had the hands and started sing , &quot; Allah , &quot; Allah , Allah , God , Allah , God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curious historic -- when the Mom invaded the south of the Spain , I took this habitude with them and pronounded changed in the centuries of &quot; Allah , Allah , &quot; Bolah , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Allah , &quot; Okay , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , &quot; in the Spain .
In Spain , when an artist has done something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , broken , Allah , magnificent , huge , I was a God of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need .
But , the problem comes the dancing day , for the dancing himself , when you wake up and discovered that are the 11 in the morning of Marteddays , and the scoring of God is not .
It &apos;s simply a mortal graduate with the ginock , and maybe never going to be more to ascending to that altitude .
And maybe no one of the name of God , and what it has to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s difficult .
This is one of the most sweet recognciliations to do in a creative life .
But maybe not supposed to be so angosciant if you can &apos;t believe , in fact , that the extraordinary aspects of you are .
But it just believed that there are data from an unimagery of this source of this squirt source of your life that you have to go to someone else when you &apos;ve finished .
And , you know , if we think it all changes .
And so I began to think of it , and it &apos;s certainly as I thought for several months during the book that I &apos;m going to do soon , the dangerous success .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel electrized from this is , it doesn &apos;t fear .
Don &apos;t traveling . It &apos;s just your work .
Contintains for your part , whatever it can be .
If your job is drink , drink .
If the divine , aburd genius decided to leave some kind of wondering some kind of wonderful , for one moment through your efforts , &quot; then , &quot;
Although , you do the same dance .
And &quot; Okay , &quot; to yourself . &quot;
I think about it , and I think you &apos;ve got to teach it .
&quot; You know , &quot; at yourself , even for having the human and test love and textardaggines that are continued .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : OK .
And as you know , I talked about some of these projects on human genome , what it can mean and discovery of new set of genes .
Now we &apos;re beginning a new course , we started to digitalize biology , and now starting from that digital code we are in a new biology phase , designing and synthesizing and synthesizing life .
We always tried to ask big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists , I think they tried to understand various levels .
We tried different approaches , reduce it to the minimes .
We &apos;re digitalization from almost 20 years .
When we &apos;ve sequenced the human genome , it was going to go from the analogical world of the computers .
Now , we can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome of the smallest genome .
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome to create one more smaller .
We are able to eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 genes that are here .
But when we look at its own metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our .
So , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this can bring to a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to design was synthesize this chromosome in a way that we could modify the components to ask some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of the &quot; Can we synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Can the chemistry to produce these great molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create before ?
And , in case , can we make a chromosome chomosome ?
A chromosome is simply a piece of chemical material .
The speed that we are able to digitalize life is growing to be exponential .
Our capacity to write the genetic code , instead , progressly , but it &apos;s getting better .
And our latest results take it on an exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process has required a lot of the passages , starting with a bioethical review that we started the first experiments .
But we discovered that DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that produce small segments of DNA , of 30 to 50 letters and it &apos;s a degenerative process . It &apos;s a longer process .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments and correct the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , to go from the digital information of the genome of Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a small virus .
We &apos;ve designed the fragments , actually made the correction of the mistakes and get a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material chemical material , and we put it in the bacteria , the bacteria have started to read this genetic code .
The viral particles have been released by the cells , and they destroy the Each .
I &apos;ve talked about recent with members of the oil industry , and they &apos;ve talked about this model .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build his same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the biggest things .
We wanted to build the entire bacterium chromosome .
They are more than 580,000 genetic code .
So we thought we &apos;d build it in the size of viruses , so that we could change the casses to understand what the components of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accurateful standard was a mile of mile .
We &apos;ve discovered , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence that original sequence we would never be able to work .
One part of the process is to design segments along 50 letters that have overwhelmed with all the other segments of 50 letters to make smaller subject that works together .
We &apos;re going to see one elements here .
You know , you probably have read that we &apos;re going to stop .
Think of it . We have a genetic code based on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters put together with about 20 amminds , and there &apos;s a specific order of letters , and there &apos;s a specific order of letters .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , sentences .
And what we did at the beginning was self-up .
Some of the fact that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
We &apos;ve designed these segments to be able to held them .
There are enzymes that repair them .
And we began to assembling parts , starting with segments from five to seven thousand letters in a letters of 24 mile letters .
At every step , we made these segments in abundance so we can sequence them that we &apos;re trying to make them extremely robustoes -- as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re looking at the process .
So , this seems like a basket of a basket .
When we arrive these very long segments , more than 100 mile , they will not grow more directly in E.
It &apos;s coming to the limits of modern molecular biology .
So we &apos;ve considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called a homologist , which is using homology to repair the DNA able to get the segments .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus , it can absorts three million rad of radiation .
You can see in the superior as her chromosome as his chromosome is destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours are reassembled exactly like it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can do completely .
They can live under empty .
They are absolutely certainly that life in space , and you move to find new environments of water .
Actually , NASA showed that this happens .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built these processes , simply by using the free segments to insert .
The lievitually assembly .
This image didn &apos;t have been taken with an electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a tough molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that cover a time of about six seconds .
This is the published we did a little time ago .
It &apos;s over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the biggest molecule of a definite structure .
It has a weight molecular over 300 million .
If we prove it with a cart 10 , without spaces , it would like 142 pages just to transcriting this genetic code .
Now , how do we work it ? How can we activity it ?
Of course , through a virus is a virus is a game from kids .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria .
It &apos;s simpler , even when it &apos;s about eukariots as our : you can simply extreme the nucleo and insert one else , which is practically the clonce process .
In the bacteria bacteria , the chromosome is instegrated inside the cell , but we &apos;ve recently showed that we &apos;re able to make a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to one other and activate it .
We crobial chromosome from a microbial species .
The two are different than men from the topes .
We &apos;ve added some gene in a way that we could decide what to choomosome for this chromosome .
And then he slide with the enzymes in a way to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was a study -- and you &apos;re going to appreciate graph -- the new chromosome graph -- the new chromosome .
And we began to think we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we &apos;ve tried anymore .
This is one of the major mechanisms .
We discovered that lots of species have added a second or third chromosome somewhere , adding in a second thousands of it .
So , who think about evolution as a gene at the time that has not got a lot of the biology .
And there are enzymes called me &quot; &quot; restrict &quot; that add digerism the DNA .
The chromosome that it was in the cell .
The cell phones that we put it up .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other chromosome as an extraneous material , and we found it with only the cell and the new cromosome .
it became blue because of the genes that we &apos;ve put .
And in a short of time , all the characteristics of a species have gone up in a new species , and it transformed all in a new species , based on the new software that we &apos;ve put in the cell .
All the proteins have changed , the membranes have changed , and when we read the genetically code what we &apos;ve transfer .
Now , this may look like genetics , but altering the software DNA software we can change things in a pretty substantial .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that we don &apos;t talk about genesy -- but progress to go from three million and a half years of evolution , and I &apos;ve already said that maybe we &apos;re going to create new version of the Cambrian explosion process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty obvious when we think about our needs .
We &apos;re going to go from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Just to give one example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each other existing in 1946 ; in 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find food , fresh water and fresh water , medicinal and gas for six and a half people .
It &apos;s still going to be more hard to do it for nine billion .
We use more than 30 billion carbon .
That means million barrels a day .
When we &apos;re trying to find biological processes , or any kind of process to bring them , it will be a huge challenge .
Again , we have to realize all the emission of CO2 from these materials that ends in the atmosphere .
At the science day , because of the scientific discoveries all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the design components for the future .
The electronic industry can only have a dozens about components , and think about how many different things come out .
Our limitations are principlally from biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have some techniques , because of these synthesization , able to create what we call a combinatory genomic genomics .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a day .
Think of processing these 20 million different genes or trying to optimize the processes to optimize the processes to produce or drugs , new vaccines , we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology than the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choices for survival , we can produce chemistry or carbons or carbon , production of vaccines .
This is an instantly of some software program that we &apos;re working on to be able to sit and design specific species on the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t even know how they will be .
We know exactly what the genetic code .
Now we &apos;re focused on the carbers of how quarter generation .
You &apos;ve seen that extract ethanol from the grain was an finite experiment .
We have a second and third generation that will come out of sugar out of sugar to the highest value as the eight-different kinds of butanol .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact impact without increasingly increasingly the cost of food , and limitarily availability would be transforming CO2 in matter , which we &apos;re working for designing that they can achieve this , and we think we could reach this purpose , and we think we could have the first carbers in about 18 months .
The solar light combined with CO2 is a methodom -- but in our discoveries around the world , we found different different methods .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
He lives in the deep ocean , at about 2500 feet of the deep ocean temperature of the water temperature .
It creates from CO2 using hydrogen using molecular hydrogen as a source of energy source .
We &apos;re trying to figure out if we can sing the CO2 , which can easily be transported through the tubes , converting that CO2 in carbons , to drive this process .
So we think we might be able to think that we may be able to increasing what the bottom question , &quot; what life is Not , we have the modest goal to replace the entire obial industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can you ?
It would be a major of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working to use the same methods to create vaccines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with the influence , we &apos;re always back to one year , and with one dollar when it comes to the right vaccine .
I think that this can change combinable vaccines in anticype .
That &apos;s how the future could start as changing , now , the tree of evolution , now , accelerating the evolution with synthetic bacteria , and incells .
We &apos;re so much like the improve people .
Our purpose is to make a long enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the most quickly possible , some fundamental work , a new technology that we have brought to Microsoft exactly one year ago . This is Seadragon .
This is an environment where you can interact with an enormous amount of visual data .
Here we &apos;re seeing a lot of gigabytes of digital photographs with a kind of expensive zoom , and I continue , for a quick panoramic bread .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big we see , how big these collection of data or images .
Most of digital photographs , but this for example is a scanning scan from the Bibliotect of the Congress , and it fits in the gama of 300 megapiel .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that limits the presents of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen in any time . It &apos;s also an architecture .
This is a whole book , you don &apos;t have images .
This is the Casa desolate of Dickens . Every column represents a capital .
To show you that it &apos;s really about textbooks and not images , we can do something like this , to actually see that it &apos;s a real representation of the textbooks , not a picture .
It may be a little artificial way to read a book electronic book .
You don &apos;t recommend it .
This is a more realistic example . This is a number of The Guardian .
Each big image is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beauty experience of a magazine or a newspaper of a magazine or a daily journal , which is to nature a lot of medium .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the Guardian .
We &apos;ve created a high-resolures -- much higher than what you use in a bad advertisity -- and we &apos;ve insert you about extra extra .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even specific specific .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limitations of space on the screen .
We hope that this means to be able to the pop-up and other things like that , they shouldn &apos;t have to be .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to tell you that we have contributed to this field .
These are all the streets in the United States , there &apos;s geospatial picture of the NASA .
So now we &apos;re going to go to something else .
This is actually actually from alive on the Web ; you can see it .
This is a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon , and the other is a very interesting pursual research in Noah Snavely , a student from the University of Washington , with the help of Steve Seitz of Microsoft Research . It &apos;s a good collaboration .
And it &apos;s from view on the Web , Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can spend a image to the other and have this kind of experience to multiple resolution .
But the location of the images here has actually meaningful .
And the algorithms of a computer visualization have recorded these pictures together , so that corresponds to the real places where you imagine -- all taken close to the Grasks on the Montagne Roccial Montagne Rockcial Montagne Rockcies -- they &apos;ve been taken .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some much more space .
I want to spend directly to one of the original data set -- and this is from a precedented Photosynth of Photosynth that we &apos;ve done the first time in the summer time -- to show you what I think is really the key technology , Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily the key technology , Photosynth .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of the No3 Cathrows from Flickr . Buight-Din Flickr , and you get pictures of types in shirt , and you get images of types and so on . Each one of these arancies represent a picture that &apos;s discovered .
So , they &apos;re all pictures from Flickr , and they were all connected in this way .
And it &apos;s possible , it &apos;s possible .
You know , I wouldn &apos;t think I end up for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifying to get this kind of access here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different kinds of different kinds of different kinds of types : from those professional cellphones to the size of those professional phones in this environment .
And if I can , I try to try and look for those more strange .
A lot of them , etc .
Somewhere there is a series of photographs -- here .
This is a non-Dame poster recorded .
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with the social environment . This is now taking data from the entire collective memory of how the Earth , from the visual point of view -- and connects all those data together .
All those pictures become connected , greater than parts .
You have a Earth model land model land .
Think of this as a Stephen Lawler of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as complexity as people use it , and the advantages for people who use it .
Their pictures are married by other people .
If someone comes to the idea of contrassigning all of these several several , my photograph of the Noththroughout of Noththroughout of all of the data , and I can use it as a point that I &apos;m going to be able to get me in the space , and I can use the pictures of anybody else , and have a social experience of cross-modes and cross-like social experience .
Of course , a consequence of all of this are extremely elaborate models of every interesting part of the Earth , you collected not only from airplanes and satellitary images and satellite , but from the collective memory .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I figure out what your software is going to have to do is that at a certain point , in the next years , all the photographs shared from anybody in the world will be practically connected ?
BA : Yeah . What it &apos;s actually doing is discovered .
It &apos;s creating the hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it at the bottom of images .
And what it becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of semantial information that many of these images possible .
As when you do a research of pictures on the Web page and the text on the Web page is a lot of information about the images of the picture .
Now , what happens if that pictures up all your pictures ?
So , the amount of set interconnection and the amount of wealth , which is really enormous . It &apos;s a classical effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible . Blaise .
BA : Thank you very much .
One of the major pleases when you travel and one of the ethnographic research is the power to live between who has not forgotten the ancient in the wind , the past in the wind , it in the wind of the rain the wind of the rain .
Bastes to think that the Jaguar &apos;s still beyond the Lattea , or that the myths of the Indians are still more significance , or that in Himalaya , the budged of the Dharma , to remember the importance central of the anthropology , and that the idea that the world that we live in which we live in a central sense , but it &apos;s only a model of reality , but it &apos;s only a model of reality , but it &apos;s only a reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our style has done , well or bad , good , or bad , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share the essential .
Everybody is named .
We are subjects .
We &apos;ve got to death the inexorability of death , so it doesn &apos;t surprise us if we clear and dale --
We all have an art .
What hits is the particular rhythm of the song , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that are the Penan forests of the Borneo , or the followers of Haiti , or Haiti , or the Sahars , or the Sahars in Kenya , the Ande , or a camp in Sahara .
He was my journey in the desert a month ago , or a month ago , or a yak of yak in the valle of the Everest , on the Everest , the dea mos of the world .
All of these populations teach us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And , if you reflect a second , it &apos;s a concept that it can give you hope .
So , together , cultures of the world &apos;s myriades create a spiritual life of spiritual and cultural life on the planet and it &apos;s important for the wealth of the planet as a biological girl night as biosphere .
And you can think of this cultural nosphere as an etnosphere , and you can call the etnosphere , the expect of all the concepts , dreams , under ideas , inspirations , inspirations , inspirations , inspirations , from the human imagination .
The ethnosphere is the fantastic pathway of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be as inquisitive .
And since the biosphere has been graved as much as it as it as much rapidly as it as much quickly .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all the species has been about extinction to simply because it &apos;s false , or -- in the most apocalytic diversity -- in the most of the biological diversity of biological diversity -- and you don &apos;t have neighborhood -- that of the cultural diversity .
That &apos;s all of this is , of course , the loss of language .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only composed by a vocabulary or a series of rules .
A language is the spray of human spirit .
It &apos;s the medium of every culture of every culture comes in the material world .
Each language is a forest of the mind , a bind , a thousand , an ecosystem of spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , while we &apos;re sitting in Monterey , at least half is not sitting in the ears of children .
They don &apos;t come to the children , which means , which means , unless than not wondering something , which are already death .
What is more sad about being the wish of being the silence , of being the last one language , to be the last one language , of the wisdom or to anticipate the wisdom of the children ?
And this horring is the state of somebody of the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks , one of a moving language of an ancient language .
And I know that somebody &apos;s going to say , &quot; Isn &apos;t that ?
The world wouldn &apos;t it be a better place if we all the same language ? &quot; Benisish , so we all talk yoruba . We talk yorrific .
Let &apos;s talk .
You &apos;ll discover a sudden what it means can &apos;t talk your language .
I &apos;d like to give you a journey across the etnosphere .
a small journey in the etnosphere to you an assage of what we &apos;re losing .
Most of us forget that when I say , &quot; different ways of the different ways of existing .
We take for example this Barasana Barasana , in Amazon , Amazon , the popole of anaconda , which creates the myth to try out from the side of the latt sacred of sacred sacred .
It &apos;s a population that it &apos;s not able to distinguished the blue color blue from the green color because the forest is identified in the forest , where it depends the population .
They have a strange language , and a marriage , called &quot; Exogamia . &quot; : &quot; Do you have to move a person who talk about a person who talk a different language .
So all of this has roots in the mythological past , yet the particularity is that in these extended families that are talking about six or seven because of the marriages no one practical practice a language .
They &apos;re limited to listen and then begin to talk .
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I &apos;ve lived , the Waorans of Ecuador Ecuador , an incredible people , an incredible people in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionaries have tried a contact comfortable .
They &apos;ve gotten out of the photographs that they would retrading them in order that they had gotten amiches , forgotten that this people who had never seen anything .
They collected the photos from the ground , they turned them to the research of a shape or a figure , and they killed that they were treated , and they kill the five missionary .
But the Waorans don &apos;t just killed the foreign .
They &apos;re killing between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by them .
We sat eight generations , and we found two , and we found two cases of death , and when we started to know , they admit that one of them was aging , and then they killed it . And then they killed it . And then they killed it .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal of 40 and recognize it .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was a very interesting tassigned , when my Harvard professor of Haiti , he asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti in the secret of the Duvalier and Tonton Macouth &apos;s power and Tonton Macouched , and impossessing me that was used to do the zombies .
To give a sense of miraculous , I should have to understand the Vodouble culture and the Vodouble is not magic .
It &apos;s a rather than a complex metaphysics of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianism , Islam , Budhism , etc .
A continent comes to left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has no religious . And instead of it , and the Voodoo is not religious that the distilled of these religious concepts about the tragic diaspora .
What makes the voodoo is the intense report of life and death .
So , vive are getting the spirits .
And the spirits can be invoded by the Great Aqua , they respond to the rhythm of the dance of the vive soul so that for a short-anima short active , which is the following .
So the voodoodoohisti love to talk about God .
We start in the temple and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re possitting , it &apos;s the spirit that you guide , as you can do that ?
So , you assist these amazing events : folloacing voodoo in state of trance that touched tizons infuels that touched in the power of the mind when it &apos;s catalyzed in one state of the mind when it &apos;s catalyzed in a state of extremes .
As all the people with which I lived the most extraordinary people are the Kogi in Sierra Nevada Marta , in Santa Marta , in Colombia .
And it turns out of the ancient civilization , that once they were on the carairs of the Colombia in the conquist , the population was retreatment to the massive vulcanic .
In a landscape continent of blood , this population has never been conquisted by the spagners .
Now , they are governed by a cler , but their formation is really extraordinary .
The young people are brought away from the families to three , and four years , and they live secreed in a world fact of good and shombers in a world of the background for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years of proposed to reproduce the nine months of extation that transrates into the user of the mother , now are metaphorical in the Great Mther .
For all this time , are acculated to the values of their societies , values that they predict their prayers , and only their prayers are the cosmic equilibrium .
At the term of this incredible initiation , they &apos;re improviding out and for the first time , at 18 years old , they see a da-year-old . And in that activity of the first bad , when the sun buts the values of the first bad , the values of the beautiful thing that has learned in theorety . The prets a step back and he says , &quot; A step back and he says , &quot;
&quot; Good ? Proprize how I said .
It &apos;s studies . Now he &apos;s going to protect it . &quot;
It &apos;s called the major brothers and tell us that we , brothers , we are the destruction of the world .
This intuition of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about Indigene populations and the environment of the world , and the old history of vage , which is a razy concept in its simplicity or maybe , or maybe we say that these people are more close to the Earth of us .
Indigenes are not nor sentimental population .
There is no space for these things in the Asmat the Afat or the gelids of Tibet , but because of the Tibet , they created a mystic of the Earth , have created a mystical intuition that the Earth can live , but on an intuition that the Earth can live only because it &apos;s infected . The concept that the Earth can live only because it &apos;s infected from human consciousness .
What does it mean ?
It means that a child of the Ande who grows up the mountain one mountain Apu spirit his destiny will be a deeply different , and it &apos;s going to have a foundly different relationship with the mountain , or that place in a Montana who grow up a mountain one mountain one mountain a mountail of rocken .
which is a spirit of a spirit or a mineral cave is irrelevant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia creating Britannica believed that forests serve to be cut .
That made me a different human being different from my friends from my Kwakiutl who believe the forests are the forests of Hukuk and the history of the paradist Hukuk and the history of the paradise and the channels that living in the Hamatsa .
If you begin to consider that these cultures can create different reality , you can start understanding some of them discoveries .
I &apos;ve taken this picture in the North Amazon Amazon .
Mayahuge some of you have heard about the ayahuse , the most powerful psychoactive repertory .
What makes it fascinating the eyahuge is not the pharmacological potential of pharmacological potential . It &apos;s composed by two elements .
From one hand , this lian league that contains a series of beta-carboline , harmine and harming , slightly harmful hallucinogens .
Taking the only plant , you have a smart smoke that alters a little bit the consciousness , but it &apos;s mixed with the leaves of a coffee of the family of coffee .
This plant contains powerful , very similar to the serotonin the serotonin , methoxygine-five , methoxygine-field , methoxine .
If you ever see the Yanomami , you &apos;ll see the Yanomami that are doing from a different species of species , which is a methoxydimethoxydimethoxygine .
Tirking that policy on the nose is a little bit like being disappeared by a field fields of a field of electricity . It doesn &apos;t believe a distortion of reality .
I was often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who wrote the psychedelic was , with his discovery of the fungi in the 1930s in the &apos; 30 in Mexico .
According my thesis , you can &apos;t classified these triptamines like hallucinogens because if you &apos;re doing you can &apos;t tell no one of being hallucinated .
It &apos;s possible to now now it &apos;s possible with other chemicals that denaturing the MAO .
Now it &apos;s the beautiful : the carboline carboline that are in this liana are inibitors of MAO , the same kind of needs to be able to potential triptamines . The question : in an 80,000 species of plants of plants , how do these popules find two phological death . But if you combine in this way , creating a version , creating a version that &apos;s time at the same time .
We use the great eufemism of the evidence and the error , which can revealing .
But if we ask the Indians , they will say , &quot; The plants talk about it . &quot;
What does it mean ?
This tribes , Cofan , has 17 variety variety , which distinguishes netically in the forest , and that our eyes would come in the same species .
If we ask him how they stabilish their tasonomy will tell us , &quot; I thought , &quot; I thought , &quot; You don &apos;t know everything ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take the 17 variety in a night of the moon , and they &apos;re going to cant with a different tone .
With this graduate in Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than to count the press .
Now , &#91; appluses , the problem is that even those of us who have heart the people who have heart people who have heart people who have the history of the history of the history of the story in our real world , and the real world .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it &apos;s not remembered for his wars or technological innovations , but rather like the age where we stopped and we abbrought activally or accepted activally or accepted activally or accepted . Now the problem is not changing .
All cultures through centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibility of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians , Sioux don &apos;t have to be Sioux when they put part of the horse , and it as the Americans don &apos;t have to stop being Americans when they put away from the horse and hot .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that threatening the integrity of ethnosphere . It &apos;s the power .
The flip of domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you &apos;ll discover that these are not destined cultures .
They are creatures and dynamics out of the identificable forces that go beyond their ability of adaptation .
It is that it &apos;s disbooks in in the Patria --
a nomad nomad of Sarawak , in the Sououth Asian , a people who have lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduction on the neighborhood , where you can see the river , where you can see the river of the rivume that seems to be able to bring out out of the South Ciny , where you can see the river of the South Ciny , where the named Sarawak .
Somebody stones to fill the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that have come with the discovery of gold .
If we move on Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the flip of the political domination .
As you know the genocide , the physics of a population , it &apos;s convicted at the universal level , but the ethninife , the destruction of lifestyle , it &apos;s not only convicted , but even celebrated in the environment of development .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of the Tibet , until the beginning .
I spent 6,000 miles from Chengdu in the West Chengdu in the Western China , through the Tibet , coming to Lhasa with a young college , but only came to Lhasa , I realized what &apos;s behind .
6,000 sacred sacred in pollus and centers .
1.2 million people killed from the military Revolution .
The father of this guy was absoluted to Panchen Lama .
which means that it &apos;s been killed to the time of the Chinese invasion .
and uncle is figured with Santity in Santity during the diaspora that has brought the people in Nepal .
Her mother had been imprisoned and his colpage was rich .
It &apos;s been brought to hidden at the age of two nasking under his gry because it wouldn &apos;t have living without him .
The sister , which has done the same , it was put in the field of reeducation .
And one day , he was hoken a drop , and for this transgrain , and , for this transgression , it was put in the forced jobs for seven years .
The Tibet of the Tibet can be unopporable , but the spirit redentor of the population is from tener .
At the end , it &apos;s reduce a choice .
Do we want to live in the world world of the monotony , or we want to collect the policromatical world ,
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he said that his biggest fear was that , in our biggest vision of the world , we &apos;re not only going to see the whole world of human imagination , we &apos;re not only going to see the entire modality of thinking , but a day we &apos;ll wake us from a day .
And it &apos;s humiliating our species is existed for 600,000 years .
The Neolution Revolution , which has given us the agriculture , which has done us to southern cult , and replacing a poetry with the next few of the shaman , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The industrialized industrialized world has about 300 years .
The challenges that I don &apos;t suggests me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we &apos;ll have to deal with the millennia to come .
When these myriades of the world is asked what it means to be human , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we &apos;re all going to find the possibility of being what we are : a consciousness , which has to make all the people , and all the gardens can fiorders . And there are great moments . And there are great moments .
I &apos;ve taken this picture on the north island in the island of Baffin , when I went to hunting with Inuit , and this man , and this man , Olayas , and this man , Olaya , he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The Canadian government was always gentile with the Inuit , and in the 1950s to stabilie our teenagers .
The grandfather got to go .
The family , tempting for his life , he brought to all the arms , and all of his equipment .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t feel the cold .
The sleep of the slums were made of fish skin fish skin fish skin .
The non-like this man wouldn &apos;t put out of the arctic note , or the blizard night-suffering .
It &apos;s ungathered away , it &apos;s hot the skin of focus and defecated in their hand . When I did the full full . When I did the full .
He saved salive on the dot of this clear , and when it became solid , he killed a dog .
He schooled the dog and created a brilliant , and created a slide , he created a slip , and he &apos;s gave another dog , and it &apos;s disappeared on the banchises .
We want to talk about clear with nothing ? ♫ ♫ And this , in different ways , in different ways , &#91; Applausi &#93; is the symbol of the resilience of the population of Indigence .
In the 1999 , the California government has recorded to Inuit the total control of the California and Texas I did .
It &apos;s their new pathy . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s an independent territory .
One slide as a nation-state can recognize with his population .
And , finally , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious at least , I think it &apos;s been in these remote areas of the planet , make it remote .
For somebody is home .
They look at the &quot; sections of human imagination that come up with the stuff . And for us , the dreams of these children , as the dreams of our children , become part of our children , become part of the swim of the hope .
For finally , we National Geographic , we &apos;re convinced that politicians will never arrive anything .
We believe that polemy --
&#91; Applauses are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and perhaps we &apos;re the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month to tell stories about the world . Every month our site , 35 million visit .
156 countries transmit our television .
Our requires come out of millions of people .
Our work is to travel in the etnosphere to bring our audience in a cultural places where they &apos;ve seen and hopes away as they saw and hopefully as they saw and hopefully revealing the central revealing of the anthropology of anthropology , and we have to find a lifestyle in a pluralistic world and multicults in a pluralistic world , and we have to find a lifestyle ,
in which the wisdom of all the people can contribute to our wealth .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I &apos;m hoping to the other than you &apos;ve heard , and I &apos;m going to find some links , in the case .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the offices . &quot;
The officer of offices what ?
The dogma dogma of all the Western industrial societies . The dogma dogma offices : &quot; If we want to massive the well-being of our citizens &quot; The way to do it is to male the individual freedom . &quot;
The reason is , from one side , in the fact that freedom is itself a value , it &apos;s very precious , it &apos;s useful , essential , useful , essential for human beings .
At the other one is in fact that if we &apos;re free , each of us can act to do everything that massive to do everything that masses our wealth .
The way to massive freedom is to male choice .
More choices people have , the more they &apos;re free , and the greater is their freedom , greater is their well-being .
So , I think , it &apos;s so profoundly radicated in society that nobody would be able to put it in a doubt .
And it &apos;s also deeply radicated in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m allowing a simple note on the conduction .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditioned , without content , without content , and 12 acetes of oil and 12 acetes that you can comprove to you a huge number of conditions in the remarkable conduction that no one of the 175 of your degree .
That &apos;s the supermarket .
And then you go to the electronic stereo to buy a stereo : CD leter , CD , radio , radio , radio , radio , radio , radio .
And in this single negotium store , there &apos;s a big number of components .
We can do six and a half million different combinations of combinations using the components that are in one negotiate .
You have to admit that there &apos;s a lot of choice .
Other camps : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the serve services , you could get all the phone service .
He was born the phone , it didn &apos;t buy it .
A consequence of that , by the way , it was that the telephone had never gotten .
These have gone .
Now we have a variety of telephones , especially with phones , especially .
This is the cell phones of the future .
My favorite is that in the middle , MP3 , cuts of the nose , and baker for the cross .
And if you don &apos;t have seen it in the house , you &apos;re stunder the house .
And what &apos;s going to the end is that people get into the newspapers and it does this question . And you know what the answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more importantly than the acquired , which is the same explosion of choices .
Assistence : no longer in the United States that you go from the doctor and doctor doctor doctor what you have to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; Okay , we could do it , or B &quot; has these benefits . &quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Doctor , what should I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; It &apos;s got these benefits , and those risks , and those risks , and those risks . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; Dr. &quot; If she was me , what would it do ? &quot;
And the doctor : &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result we call it &quot; autonomy of the sick , &quot; expression that makes it looks like a beautiful thing .
But actually it &apos;s not that one to move the weight and the responsibility of making decisions from someone who knows something , which is the doctor , someone else knows anything -- and so it &apos;s not in the ideal condition to make real decision .
There &apos;s a huge marketing of pharmaceutical products , direct to people like me and you , that if you think about it doesn &apos;t make sense , because we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why do it ?
The answer is that they want we call the doctor to ask , we call it the doctor to change it .
Something so fundamental identity is the horever is a question of choice , as you see in this junk . &quot; We don &apos;t want to provide children . They &apos;re not going to provide them . &quot; We don &apos;t want to do it . We have to invent .
And we can reinvent how many times us .
Which means that every morning , to the rest , you have to decide what kind of person wants to be .
I &apos;m like the family and marriage , a time perspective , a common time perspective , almost for anybody , it was that there would be the most soon as you could .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not even what to do after .
So , all is really to play .
And I teach them at very intelligent students , and I do the 20 percent work in less than a time .
And not because they &apos;re not smart , not because they &apos;re dealing .
but why are they impensieritation , I mean , &quot; I should must move or not ? &quot;
&quot; Do I &apos;m going to move later ? I have to think before the children or career ? &quot;
They are interrogorant .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this implements , even though this implement , and you don &apos;t get a beautiful vote to me .
And they have to do it . They have to do it .
Now , the job : we &apos;re lucky , like Carl underneath , because the technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from Hotel Randolph .
I &apos;m talking about , there &apos;s a angle , and I wouldn &apos;t tell anybody who , where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use it .
What means , this amazing freedom of choices that we have to continually decided to keep , and we have to continually decided , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our child player , with the cell phones in a tank , Blackberry , the Blackberry , and the niebook , typically , about the ginock .
And even though they &apos;re all spents , every minute that we see our child , we &apos;re also asking , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; Do I say , &quot; Do I have this call ? &quot;
&quot; Do I have to answer to this email ? &quot; I have this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , &quot; all this makes the experience of your child &apos;s experience of your child .
So , whatever we look at , small and big , materials and big , materials and lifestyle , life is a question of choices , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : OK , there were some possibilities , but it wasn &apos;t a choice of choice .
The world &apos;s world now looks like this : The dilemma is , &quot; Is it a good thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Some .
We all know them , so we all know them , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative ones .
All this choice composes two negative effects on people .
The first one , paradox , is it produces instead of liberation .
With many options between which choices , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I give you a significant example : A study conducting on the plans of volunteers .
One of my colleagues had access to the Vanguard , the gigantic societies , with about a million climents in 2000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that for every 10 solutions that are offered , the percentage of adesion of two percent .
With 50 sources , there &apos;s 10 percent in less adesions that are available to when they &apos;re available only . Why ?
Because with 50 founds between which choices , it &apos;s directly difficult to decide , and the choice is sent to the indomorders .
And tomorrow , and tomorrow , tomorrow , and of course tomorrow .
You know that not only means that these workers are going to eat food for dogs , because they don &apos;t have enough money , it also wants to say that decision is so obvious that the decision is so obvious that they also lost the fundamental funds .
Don &apos;t participating , they &apos;re losing up to five dollars a year from the work dator , which would be true to make them .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think that makes the world .
&quot; And finally , for the eternity : ketchup , or major maion ? &quot;
Would you like to take the right decision , if it &apos;s for ethernity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the bottom , and the bad condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even though we can avoid paralysis , and make a choice , we &apos;re less satisfying from the result of how we would have been with less options .
And that for different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of conditions that you choose , if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you might have to make a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us . And what happens is that the alternative of the choice , and the replaction of the decision , and the record of the decision of the decision ,
even when it was a good decision .
More choices there are , the more it &apos;s easy than any detail of the choice of choices .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has clear very good practical like the value that we depends on what we confront .
In the rest , when there are a lot of options , it &apos;s easy to represent the tools of alternative scale of alternative scarten than the option that is choice .
So here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m sorry with everybody who are not New York .
But that &apos;s what you would probably think .
There &apos;s this pair to Hamptons .
A place of light .
It &apos;s beach them . It &apos;s all of them . It &apos;s all for them .
Nothing . But what he thought is , &quot; Well , what he thought is , &quot; Well , sick . &quot;
&quot; All my neighbors in Manhattan are away . &quot;
&quot; I could speak in front home . &quot;
And he spends two weeks that it &apos;s losing -- every day -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
And the cost-opportunity is the satisfaction for what we have , even when the choice was excellent .
And the more of the options that we have to consider , the more the features that are going to return up as a cost-opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This junk tells us a lot of things .
It &apos;s talking about the living , and maybe slowly .
But the most important point is that whatever you ched , you choices , you choose not to do other .
The things that we don &apos;t choose have so active that they can make less attractive what we do .
Third : spiral growth of expectations .
I tried it on my skin bought a new jeans .
I think about nearly jeans .
Once the jeans were one like one , compressed them and dress , they were scomfortable , they were uncomfortable to have them , just after they were taken a life and washed a lot of times , they began to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple new when the old ones were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Who wants slim , easy failed ? &quot;
Do you want them to the nera , or with the bottom ? &quot; Stonewashed , &quot; or &quot; acidwashed ? &quot;
&quot; Who wants ? &quot;
&quot; Highi , or stretched ? &quot; The bla -- &quot; Continured to elency .
I was willing , and after a while I was able to say , &quot; I want to say , &quot; I want that it was the only guy . &quot; He had no idea what it was , so I had no idea which was , so I had no idea what I had .
It was the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse for worse is that with all that choice my expectations were high , the jeans had to be perfect .
At the beginning I didn &apos;t expect . I wasn &apos;t exceptioned when there were only one of them , but when there were only a kind of 100 different steps , at least one had to be perfect .
What I had been good , but not perfect .
After the choice that choices what I was looking at what I was looking at the expectations .
The addition of options in the life of people don &apos;t have the expectations that these have respect to the eccellence .
And this will produce less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the marketing world .
Because if they knew it , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth looks like this .
&quot; It was better when you were worse . &quot; The reason why it was better when it was better when it was worse , when it was worse , it was when it was worse .
In the world that we live in the world that we live -- open-industrialized citizens with the perfection of the perfection of the perfection of expectations .
You never surprised please because your expectations , my expectations , they were ingigantly .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Basse expectations . &quot;
I mean , small moment , I &apos;m really married , and I &apos;m really married and my wife is really study .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I couldn &apos;t do that .
But it &apos;s not always a good thing .
Finally , a consequence of buying a couple of jeans s-comfortable jeans is that when you &apos;re not sure , and you say , &quot; Why ? &quot;
Who is responsible ? &quot; The answer is clear .
The world is the responsible . What could I do ?
When there are hundreds of types of jeans , and you buy it , and you ask you who are the responsible , it &apos;s the responsible .
You would do better .
With hundreds of variety available , there &apos;s not going on the indeed .
So when people are decisions , even though the result is valid , you feel feel like , you feel like that .
In the last few years , the depression is exploss in the industrialized world .
I think that a significant factor -- not the only one , but the only important -- this wave of depression is that people have experiences of the experiences because the standards are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation , they think that the culture is them .
So the final result is that in general , we &apos;re better , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely false . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit of choices is better than having it , but it wasn &apos;t going to have a lot of choice .
There &apos;s a critical value , I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve been on a piece of the level choices .
Now , from the politician view -- I have almost finished -- from political point , the nocle is the following .
What it allows in the industrial societies is the material wealth .
There are a lot of places in the world , and you know about it , where the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too loud .
So the facility that I &apos;m talking about is a sick of the modern of modern , rich societies .
And what it makes to repress is this : Steve Levitt : Steve Levitt talked about how those expensive and seats seats are useful . It &apos;s a spread of money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and dispendious , it &apos;s not useful .
They are in deleteries .
They &apos;re doing worse .
If a little bit of what in our societies allows , it allows was reversed in those where people have too few possibilities , it wouldn &apos;t be only their lives .
This is what economists call a improvement improvement .
A redistribution of the redistribution is good to everybody -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in excess .
To conclude , you can become everything you want . &quot;
You , people of culture , you think , &quot; What does that believe that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious you can &apos;t make anything in a glass of glass . &quot;
&quot; An imagination , a limited view of the world --
and I interpret it like this , in the beginning .
But then , I realized , instead , I realized that that fish knows the long .
Because the reality of the facts is that if you eat the mouth , so that &quot; everything is possible , &quot; you can &apos;t get freedom . You get the paralysis . You get the paralysis .
If you get the mouth in a way that all divents can decrease the satisfaction .
Look at the paralysis , and you reduce the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too strip , maybe even a fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic symbolic and , I &apos;m afraid , I &apos;m afraid , for roline .
Thank you very much .
