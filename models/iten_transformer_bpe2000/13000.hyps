The year I showed these slide to show that the slide to show that the artic glacial glacial glacise , 48 million years later continental .
So , this swimming the gravity of the problem because it &apos;s not showing the spexpectacks .
The arten is artic glacial is , in a sense , the pulsant heart of the global climate system .
You &apos;re expande and you get expands .
The next slide is going to be a quick remains on the last 25 years .
The ice losiacs are signed in red .
As you see , you know , they &apos;re going to blue .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter , which is a text .
You can see that the costtold , five years or , of five years or , it &apos;s like the blood , which is as the blood , which is five .
And in 25 years , it was so .
This is a problem because the interested in the bottom of the entire artic record the artic artic crap , where there are enormous amount of congent carbon the microbes .
It &apos;s inquitch of the atmospherical insurquish from global warming , that amount could radical , surprising this point of not return .
In some laghi , in a deep deep in Alaska is already rebuling from the water .
The professortic Katey Walter University of Alaska , and a team a team bad lay , you know , you can go down .
Video : Wow ! At Gore : You &apos;re good . The question is if we will be it .
A reason is that this term term measure the Greenland from the north .
This is a glacial figures .
The brought had never reached to spend slights .
This is the Kangerlushed Kangerlush , in the swest of Greenland .
If you want to know how the level of the sea to the sal cheaper to the draw on terrain .
These corrents are increasing rents .
At the other part of the planet : Antaris , the biggest block of the planet .
The month , the scientists have died that the ice of the ice of the ice is in negative , and that the Antartartargative , which is particularly on some sophistory , which is particularly quarly reverse in the science .
Equival six feet of the action of action , like Greenland .
Sull Himalaya , the third biggest block , they see new laghes , who was a few years ago , who was glacier .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population is going to be half the water power from the power of the power of the points .
Sulle Ande : this ice ice is the bottom of the water of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of this city .
The brought is aumented .
But when you dimind , the same accept water .
In California , the Sierra Nevada is about 40 percent .
The dries are in crises .
The predictions , as you have lay , I &apos;m gravi .
The growth care in the world is a nievil for incends .
The environmental disaster are aumenting out of the normal and without precedents .
Four times more numerous in the last 30 years , I replipped .
This is a watching of all instainable .
If you look at the storic context if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we &apos;ve added 70 million tons in CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the U.S. , the U.P. , at American area , to the American area , and on both the parts of the subcontinent , where there &apos;s a radical impact of obsible in the oceans .
Most cause of global warming , together to deforest , which is 20 percent , is the deforestation , it &apos;s the combustible .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with more emissions , together at China .
And he was proponed to build a lot of other centers .
But we &apos;re assist to a direction .
These are the annarrow in the last few years and some of alternative alternative .
And every way , there &apos;s a political lotta in our country .
The industries of the carbon and oil have spesesum 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon , which is a hospitch .
That picture me remember something --
Serse Natal , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion pounds of a 3.8 billions of paper .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen the news .
This is the second bigger than scories in America .
It &apos;s happened to Natal .
The nature of the published industries of the industries of carbon was this .
Video : â™« Fross the carbon is a kind of allegry and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it &apos;s growing our economy .
Fross the carbon is always more and more and more .
It &apos;s good , it &apos;s good , and the work and work , they &apos;re doing it .
At the Gore : West Virginia , the West Virginia .
The largest society on the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his friend .
Video : Don Blankenship : Sarry , Nancy Pelososis -- Al Gore , Harry Reid -- not know what they &apos;re talking about .
At the Gore : So the Alleance for Protetion of Clima Clima Protetion .
This is one of the one .
Video : Ator : Ator , we see the climate change as a minute of climate change as a minute of minute of our business .
So that our priority is invest a great amount of money in a huge amount of public hand to make public and confused the verity on the carbon .
In fact , the carbon is not sports .
We think it &apos;s got a good profound .
So , you don &apos;t preocateves of climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Attor : Carbone -- you &apos;ve heard a lot of talk .
So let me give you a game in a structure on a street for how it is about the carbon is about the carbon .
Strtraordinary ! The machines are a little rumorous , but this is the sound of the carbon of the carbon .
The consumption is between the main the main the main the global climbing , but the nievil technology , but the night of the carbon the car that you see change .
You have a look at the time , this is the odier technology of the carbon .
At the Gore : Finally , the alternative positive to the economic question economic questioning and the security .
Video : Mment America is in the crisis ; the economy , the national crisis , the national crisis .
The phils that the colleagues all of our dependence from fossil , as the carbon and the oil and the oil and the oil .
Now , perhaps there is a new , audace solution for using it .
Really America : 100 percent of the pulitches in the years .
A flowed to put America , make us more safety , and help us to stop the watching global warming .
Finally , a solution that basts to solve our problems .
Really , you know , you know , you know .
At Gore : This is the last .
Video : Yeah , it &apos;s about to America .
One of the fast faster to get to the dependence from the combustible that kills killed our planet .
She talked : The future is here . I feel , a new energy .
She talked about two : Noves investment for places .
She &apos;s move . It &apos;s time to be realists .
At the Gore : A old proverbies said , &quot; If you want to go speak , you go to spend .
If you want to go away , you go back . &quot;
We have to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
The year at TED fectors a introduction on the LHC .
And I promise to go to the back to how it works .
So , I did it . And for those who had no , LHC is , LHC is is the largest experiment , ever ever ever -- 27 miles of circonference .
Her compit is to reach the conditions that were presents less than a billion-second from the universe -- until 600 million times the second .
All this is just environment .
This is the Ginevenland .
We photograph these mini-Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Big Bang Big Big Big Big Bang Big Bang Big , we &apos;re going to get these minig Bang Bang Big Bang Big ang Bang Bang Bang Big Bang ang Bang .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- it &apos;s got 44 feet and has a 22 feet .
This is a specacular picture of ATLAS in buildings so you can see the proportions .
The 10 of the scored of the scored , we have accested the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was causing immense of immense in control of control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first phasm of the LHC , and went into collision , and walking in collision , with a part of LHC , and diffon-spreading particles in the result .
In other words , when we see that picture the 10 patterns , we can get that the machine worked , which is a great vitter .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to do us to exultent , when somebody went on Google and vide that the page was this .
What means we had a cultural impact cultural impact on the scientific impact .
And it was a week after , there was a problem with the machine , had to these phili here -- these dorate dorse .
These phils take 13,000 lams when the machine works at the mass of power .
Now , the technical technical of you will look at the phils and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . &quot;
And they can do that when they &apos;re very cold to be the deal of the deal of the conducts .
So , at least 271 degrees , at a temperature of space between the stars , these phils can bring that running .
In one of the player of the younger novemile in LHC , there was a fect of fabulation .
So the phils surprising up , and 13,000 lots of emptips , and 13,000 lampattern .
This was the result .
Now , this is still more impressionate if you think these magnetes are more than 20 tons , and that they &apos;ve been posed to about 30 feet .
They &apos;re damage about 50 magneti .
We had to take them , what we did .
We repristinted and traveled .
Now they &apos;re run back to all their place to their swar .
By the end of the LHC is going to be new integro .
We &apos;re going to happen , and we expected data to get the data to play the gunlight , and continuing our adventure to discover what the morning to discover what the universe .
Now , of course , in a square , these instead of them , they reaccount the value of science and engineering engineering . It &apos;s easy to confuture .
I think the fact that &apos;s so hard , the fact that I think is that it &apos;s a value of things like LHC .
I want to sell with the words of one Inglese scientist , Humphrey Davy , who , in the difeside , in difesis in the inutionary experiments of his bael Faray , he said , &quot; Nilian experiments , said , &quot; Nilian is so much for the research of human mind as the science of the rest of human mind as the science that we don &apos;t have to have a smile of the squid of our tribes that are not squicket .
Thank you .
I want to start thinking about rethink when , you know , from children , you would play , you get climbers .
And as you can reach them and deal with them , take them and get them , take them and move them , learned , and they actually learned to reach problems and manipping relationship .
The space reasoning is deply connected to the way we understand part of the world around us .
So , from the useful ushed by using the useful ushing objects , together at my consult , and my collaborator , and my collaborator , I started asking me , I started asking me , &quot; And if we use a computer , when we use a computer douse , and if we can only have the douse , you could just just digital to be a wonderful information with a desktop , you could have a deserrate information with a sure information with the physick ,
and we get our full ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , build the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a great computer interactive as a birth .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a great computer interactive as a birth .
You can move them with the hand , you can see &quot; between them , you can see &quot; between them , and they have a screen and a radio and a radio radio .
But surprising , they &apos;re physical , as a morning , you can move simply fairs .
The Siften is the example of a new ecosystema new ecosystema to manipping the digital information .
And as a lot of physical , consciously , consciously , in other other , and they become more physical , conscious , conscious , to the other , as we move new and different different seems and different different seeing and different different seen and different different sees and different different set .
I &apos;ll start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configure out to show you video : if you incline in a direction , the video , it will roterate from the other back back back back .
These are interactive , they &apos;re consciously consciously .
If you &apos;re interested in them , they &apos;re interested in .
If they come circustomer , you know , and they can agitself a little bit .
If they come circustomer , you know , and they can agitself a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power to use communities , to be a liquid color as if it was a liquid color as if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable as a center of vernice and I can use them to be able to be able to be a high , where they missied .
and I can use them to be able to be the color in the central , where they &apos;re missions .
If we &apos;re too too , we can put a little bit .
They also beautiful possibility to take , as the languages , the mathematics and james of logic , where people can try to try and see the logic results .
Now , I &apos;m --
This is a sequence of Fibonacy , I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a game of words that &apos;s half between Scarabeo and Boggle .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you can get a letter to Siftable on every Siftable , to every turn out on a letter to the letter to every Siftable in any of Siftable , and you try to have a control on a dium .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new set of letters and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the children in the Media Lab , I did in a way I did it , and I &apos;ve been saying , and I turned a video .
They &apos;re very huge .
And one of the interesting things of this application is that you don &apos;t have to give people many education .
You just have to say , &quot; You &apos;re words , and they &apos;re exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s what other people who are trying to do .
This is our young mtester , there on the right .
It actually wanted to implement them .
They were only morning .
Now , this is a very simple pton .
We wanted to build a tool for the lingue of Luingui languages .
It can start new characters in the scene , solid Siftable , solid Siftable .
It can start new characters in the scene , solid Siftable , solid Siftable .
Here , it &apos;s doing the sole .
Video : The sun is sure .
David Merrists : Now he brought a treator in the scena .
Video : The arange arm .
By work ! Yes !
So schooling Siftable and put closes neighbors can interact the character --
Video : Bau !
inventing their history .
Video : Can !
DM : It &apos;s a story with apert , and it can decide him as you know , and he can decide .
DM : It &apos;s a story with apert , and it can decide him as you know , and he can decide .
Video : The thing .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , realized , to wait , to wait and exeguing music and exeguing music .
It &apos;s a recent , realized , to wait and exeguing and exeguing music .
The Siften is where they &apos;re base , basis and battery .
Everybody has four different variations , and you can choose what use .
You can start to inserious sounds in a sequence of sequence to your piacement .
And modifying it just takes a sound &quot; and a sequence . &quot;
These are actually you can control from vive , as the reverse and the philer .
You &apos;re going to get particularly and then inclines to go to the .
And then there are the general effects as time and fly , which they just applicate the interest .
Let &apos;s look at how it works .
Video : We &apos;re going to start a base in two Siftable . &quot; The sequence , &quot; we &apos;re sequence , &quot; we &apos;re going to add , we add , we add the other basis .
Now , a bad line of the basis .
Video : Now , I add to the percussions --
Video : And now I &apos;ll put the philer to the bacteria , so I can control the effect of the view .
Video : I can speak the interest sequence the internal sequencing the time from one or .
Video : And now I &apos;ll add the philer to get the bottom to get more expression .
Video : I can realize the sequence . &quot;
So I have to do it before , but I can try to do it , but I can make longer longer or more cording or .
And now , finally , I can sell the interact in the Siftable to the left Siftable , &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is built new interface in a little bit more more than our brain and more more looks like our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the result of this lost , and also some possibilities that we try to bring out from the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that it &apos;s going to turn this new generation of objects to interact with the digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the now I &apos;m going to see it .
I &apos;m a wrote .
It &apos;s my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also the love and the fashion my life .
And I don &apos;t expect that you can change .
But , said , something particularly happened in my life and in my life and in my life and in my career , who bring me the entire relationship with this work .
The particular thing is I recently wrote this book , this biography called Manwear , Prua , Prua , Prua , &quot; which , fun from my precedented in the world and become a big , and it become a big sensitive , bestlic .
And the results is that everybody now now , people treat me , people treat me as if they were condanced .
Dad -- condanced , condannect !
They &apos;re all worried and they &apos;re saying , &quot; You don &apos;t have to do you can &apos;t do more more to do ?
You don &apos;t have to continue to go to the whole life without power without being able to make a book that can make a book that can &apos;t get to somebody ? &quot;
who can be important to somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s rassicity , you know .
But it could go worse , in part of that I remember 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a wrote .
I met the same based by the same based .
And people said , &quot; I don &apos;t temes me , &quot; I don &apos;t have successful ?
You don &apos;t have the lost of the refening you killed to kill you ?
You don &apos;t have to do this move to all of life without nothing that was nothing about it and dead on a cumual cumual cumulation of all infranky with the falent bought ? &quot;
You know , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I have a couple of all those things .
I &apos;ve had always been lots .
And I also have many other things that people couldn &apos;t have to income .
As the alga and other things .
But , how much about it , what I thought and I was thinking about and I was slightly why ?
Is it it ?
It &apos;s logic that anyone who had to be split from a work that you &apos;ve been sent to do .
But what &apos;s particularly in the emerge of creative creative creative to make us nervous about the health health health , in a way that other career &apos;t ?
How my father , for instance , he was a chemical engineer and I don &apos;t remember in his 40 years of activity in which was asked if he had to be engineer ?
There was never -- that blowed John , how do it ?
Don &apos;t work that , you know , you know , that ?
Only , the engineers who are not certainly , in the centuries , in the centuries , dried the reputation of being colized maniputs .
We written , we have enough this reputation , and not just written but creative creative of every gender , we have this reputation of being an instable instable to be a huge member of mentally .
And it &apos;s not to look at the trists conteger of the magnific magnific ments , just in the 20th century , they died by the century , they died by hand they often for them .
And also , those who are not suickly saying , they &apos;re going to be really displaces from their dons .
Norman Mailer , before I died , in the last interview said , &quot; Every last interviewed me a little bit more &quot; a little bit more &quot; a little bit more extraordinary flowed on the work of their life .
But we don &apos;t bad when we heard these things so much of things that we &apos;ve been hearing these things so we &apos;ve completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and the sufference and the suffering , at the end .
And the question I want to bring all of the quickly today : are you agree with this idea ?
It &apos;s good at this thing -- because you look at the middle of distance to me , it wouldn &apos;t good for anything .
I think it &apos;s odioxide .
And I also think it &apos;s perforecuate and I don &apos;t want to see it lost in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our big creative ments creative ,
And I know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start fuging out of the positions , surprising the surprising circumstances in my career .
That &apos;s true -- look at it , I &apos;m quite a young young , I &apos;ve about 40 years .
I have about four decades in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything about now , in now , it will be judicated by the world as I did that , after the succeed successful succeed .
I &apos;m slavery , because we all have more or friends here -- is likely my biggest success is to my bigger .
Oh , Gesus , who think !
You know , this is the gender of thinking that it &apos;s going to start to start to start to start to get gin the nine of the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would stop this work that we &apos;re going to do this .
So , the question is , how do it ?
And so it seems to me , after many reflective , which is to work to continue to go to write is what to create a protective psychological , okay ?
I have some way to find a safety of safety between me , and I &apos;m written , and my natural natural , what I was going to get out of the time , and I was trying to do it , and I was looking at the time , trying to do it through time , trying to find other society to see if you could have the best and more several of the best ideas and more sane and more several ides and more sane and more smart and more sances and more sent and more sure and more swites and more sure and more sure and
to help people creative creative to reach the inerents risk , emotional inerents .
And that research me to the ancient Green and ancient Rome .
Seguitems because I gave it in a circle and then back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that the creativity was wasn &apos;t to believe that the creativity was going to be ?
And it thought was creativity was this beautiful , and that was about divine and several swine and known , for reasons and unknowledge , and unknowledge .
The greatest dots of the beyond the creativity of creativity . &quot;
Sowever , she had a demand that was credeeper that was a demon that was wisdom from the lots of wisdom .
Rome were the same idea , but they called that sort of spirit not a genius .
The thing is great , because the Romans didn &apos;t really think a genius was very smart .
They have a genius was this kind of wind , which was created that you &apos;ve created literally living in the lawyers of a artist , a little bit like Dobby , and that was out of the work and moon the work of the work and moon the work and moon the work .
Here &apos;s a standing -- this is the distance of which I &apos;m talking about -- that is the psychological costruck that you have to protect you in your work .
And all know they had that worked , right ?
So , the anticient artists were protected by certain things , as you know , you know , what ?
If your work was excetional work was , you couldn &apos;t take and everything the market , all know they had been helped by this genius .
If your work , if your fallies , it was not all the college , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a huge .
And so people full the creativity in Occident for a long time .
And then the Rinal Rind came and everything changes , and we put this great idea ; we put it up to the universe , we put the universe , and the misters and and leaving the creatures and not to the creatures that wrote from the divinity .
This was the main of the rational human anesimum and people start thinking that creativity was completely from shared shared .
And for the first time in history , you start to referring this or one of a piece of a piost genius that to a piece of genius .
And I have to say , I think it was a big herror .
I think it allow somebody , a simple person to believe that you can be like a recipient , the essence and the surprising and source of all mysters , creatives , creatives , creatives , and you a very much bigger to the best philossh humanity .
It &apos;s like to ask somebody to income .
Deapappears and creates all of these engineer expectations .
And I think it was this pression to destroy the artists in the past 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it &apos;s , and now ?
Can we do it fun ?
Maybe back to a more ancient commercial of relationship between human relationship and creative .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t have 500 years of thinking about a 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience that we had to have a network on the network of the night , you know , you can follow people sell square , or they square , and they did their projects .
I &apos;m not convince you all about this .
But the question I &apos;d like to bring is -- why no ?
Why don &apos;t I think that way ?
Because it has more sense of every other thing that has ever heart to explain the exasperant exhidden of creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever ever had to do something -- so , you know , all here -- know , you know , you don &apos;t get rational .
And , in fact , you know , you know , it seems to be completely paranormal .
I did this met recently met with the extraordinary poetchecks , who now 90 years , but that was a few few years , but that was a few of all life and said that he was in his infancient in the Virginia , working out in the wyers , and you feel , and you feel , when a few days .
He said that he was like a train ,
And that was rolating toward to her .
You know , he was going to do it , because he had a lot of his pieast .
He had a sola sola thing to do that point and it was , words , words , &quot; runs how a mathemselves . &quot;
And then it turns out to home and he was slowed by this poetry , and it wouldn &apos;t have to take a piece of card and a fast fast faster , and a fast faster , and it was going to get it on the page .
Sometimes you couldn &apos;t be fast fast , so correverse and correverse , and correverse it was going to get home and the lost and she would continued to go and lost the landscape , looking at the time , looking at , looking at the time . &quot;
Then there were times -- this piece of the time , I &apos;m never going to be -- there were some moments where they were almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was looking for the card and a poetry and the past through , and he was waiting a math in while he was saying , and then said , that was like if you were holding the other hand and the lacy .
He was the poem poem from the coil and he had the page and the transcity was page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on page and intouches but at the last word before .
So when I heard it -- it &apos;s lots , it &apos;s exactly the same thing to my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conducture .
I &apos;m a mad , and my way to work is ; I &apos;m going to see me at the same time and work and spend and spend on the wait , and spend it .
But even , in my testardaggine , I &apos;ve striped that thing , sometimes .
And I imagine that many of you have a lot of you .
You know , if the work and I was swimmed by a certain both a certain both you could &apos;t know that .
And what is this ?
And how can we relationship us to do that that you don &apos;t lose the head , but , quite oximately , what do you do you get ?
And as I look at the best example of me , the best example of the Musican , which I have is a lot of different days in a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life was the incarnation of the artist of the artist of the artist , trying to control , to conversation , to move these species of creationship , and you know , you know , you get these species of creatives .
But then he invected , and a day when he was driving on a a land-built broad to Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
He was wanding fast and all of a little bit of a little bit of melodia , which is wonderful in his head , which is wonderful and leter , and the wants , you know , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the desider , and the desidentire , but you know , you know , but you know , you know , but it &apos;s not how to take it .
It has no piece of card , it has no math , it has no record .
So , he started to hear this sort of old old this , and I &apos;m going to slow , &quot; the site to lose , and I &apos;ll remarried by this saved by this saved as .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And he was going to go into the panic , he stopped .
I &apos;ll move the whole process and did something completely new .
I &apos;m just going to just the sky and said , &quot; Scusush , not see that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; You know , you know , you know , you know ,
If you really want to exist , you get a more high when I can take me care of you .
All of the other people , you know , you know ,
You know , you know , Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his process , he has been changed after this .
Not the work was still hard as always .
But the process , and the anxy fish was that the attempty was recise when the genius , the genius who had nothing else and sandle it was going to realize that they had no thing to be a whole thing that was , I realized that he had no interested and forgled .
but it was a little bit of a bad , wonderful bizarre collaboration a conversation between Tom and this extern , and this extern &apos;t Tom .
So how much you feel that story to change a little bit of how I worked , and he save me a time .
This idea , I save me when I was writing , &quot; Mangia , Prua , and I was going to have a lot of the switching cause we all have when we &apos;re working on something and we &apos;re working on something and we &apos;re working on something and we &apos;ve been working on a disaster , which is the worse .
Not only , just the book , right .
And I started thinking about this project .
But then I remember Tom who talked to the air and try to get us .
So I went to my face in the hoscritical and I realized my comments to a corner of the room .
And I said , &quot; Sense , &quot; Senends , what is , what is , you know if this book won &apos;t be interested in my , no longer ?
Because as I see you put everything I &apos;m going to see what I have , I have no more than that .
So if you want you to have to be better , you have to your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , I don &apos;t get anything .
I &apos;ll start to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I want to do for my hand that was recorded to do my part , &quot; because I &apos;m going to end up , OK -- at the end of the North Africa &apos;s in the watching people in North Africa , and it was going to go to the dances of the lots of hours and to hours .
And they were always magnific , because the baleren , and they were fantastic and they were fantastic .
But every long , I rearly , something happened , and one of these artists become transcency .
And I know what you know , because I know you &apos;ve got all , in a point , in a performance , a performance so .
It was like the time , and the time , and the balerin the walking out of a portal and it wasn &apos;t doing anything before , as 1,000 night before , but all night before , it was all hallened .
And in a suddenly not as a human .
But it happened from the diddriven in the fire of the fire of the divinity .
And when this happened , you know , the time , people know what was , they called it it with her name .
They were the hands and started to dog , &quot; Allah , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , God , God , God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curiosa night , when the More invasolder the Spain , I was this abitude with them and proned the proned of the Spain , Allah , Allah , Allah , Allalah , &quot; Ool, OK , &quot; Oh , &quot; Oh , &quot; which you can still hear in the corrid .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , words , workers , I was , I bring , I bring , &quot; incompressing , I &apos;ll be a scoring of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need .
But , the problem comes down the day , for the day , for the same , when you see and wait and discovered it , and it turns out there are 11 of Marteds and I wrote it &apos;s not more .
It &apos;s just a mortal details to the ginocky , and maybe not to get more ask to the high .
And maybe no one of God , and what does have to do with her life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most porous recognize that it &apos;s a life .
But maybe not to be so angerous if you can &apos;t believe , you can &apos;t believe , anzezing , which extraordinary extraordinary extraordinary extraordinary extraordinary extraordinary to be that .
But crete , just you know , you &apos;re going to have a full of this squites of this squites of your life that you have to go to what you have to go to anything else when you &apos;ve got to go .
And , you know , if we think that all changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s sure as I thought about for different months in the work of the book that I &apos;m going to public , and pericentering , so I &apos;m going to do that , existing , very much , so I was going to do that my graduate succeed .
And what I have to continue to say when I feel electrized from this is , not having .
Don &apos;t get you to get you . It just your work .
It &apos;s going to represented you for your part , any way to be .
If your work is baling , ball , ball .
If the divine , I &apos;m saying you &apos;ve been asked to leave some kind of wonderful , for a moment , for a moment through your short , then you can forget , &quot; Okay ! &quot;
She did the same one of your dance .
And &quot; Oh ! &quot;
I think I think I think I think I &apos;ve got to teach it .
&quot; You know , you know , just for the same , also for human-toardages and test tal tape to realize you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Yes !
You know , I &apos;ve been talked about some of these projects on the genome , what can meaning and on the discovery of new genes .
Now we &apos;re starting a new percorse : We started to digitalize biology and now to go from that crazy , we &apos;re both in a new phase of biology , designing and syntizing and syntizing life .
We always always tried to bring a big questions .
&quot; What &apos;s life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists I think they &apos;ve been tented to understand various lively .
We &apos;ve tried different approaches , reducing us to the minimes .
We &apos;re digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequency genome , they sequenced to go from the world of biology in the world &apos;s digital world .
Now , what do we can regenerate life , or create new life from this universe from this universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the kind of genome , which is the kind of the smaller than those who can autorse in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome for creating one more little .
We &apos;re able to eliminate a hundred of genes about 500 that are here .
But when we take a little bit of his map , it &apos;s relatively simple , it &apos;s relatively simple respect to our .
I remember , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at time , it &apos;s very imlikely that this can bring a living .
So , we decided that the only to design this was to synthesize this cromosoms in a way to make components to get some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of the &quot; Pan we can syntize a cromosoma ? &quot;
Can the chemistry to produce these big molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create before ?
And in case , we can do it a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemical material ,
The speak we are able to digitalize life is growing up to the life is growing back .
Our capacity to write the genetic code , instead , but it &apos;s reped , but it &apos;s impressed .
And our recent recent returned the brought on a exponential curve .
We &apos;ve been initiitiated more than 15 years ago .
The process has required many past , began with a bioetc revision before we start with a bioetc reviewed .
But we found that that synthesize of DNA is very difficult .
There are thousands of thousands of machines in the world that produces are little segments of DNA , long letters and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the segment is longer , more running .
So we had to develop a new metod to assembling these framments and read the herrors and corrors .
And that was our first tenty , to start from the first thing to the digital information of the Phi 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills .
We designed the framments , actually , in the rors and get a molecule of DNA lot of DNA of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of the chemical material , and we &apos;ve inert in the bacteria , they started to read this genetic and producurn this particles .
The particles were replaces , you &apos;ve got back to the cells , they &apos;re going back and they destroying the Ecoli .
I talked about recent with members of the industry of the oil industry , and they &apos;ve been told that they have certainly compress this models .
They rex more than you .
We believe this is a situation in which the software can really build his same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things more larger .
We wanted to build the whole cromosome of the bacterium .
They &apos;re more than 580 mountain the genetic code .
So we thought we build it in the casses of virus , so that we could change the casses to understand what the casses to understand what the components of a living cell .
The design is crucial information , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequency this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accuratedom was a ror for every 10 mile .
We found out , it resequency , 30 herrors . If we had that squence , we would never be able to do that .
One part of the process is designing segments a long letters that they &apos;re going to have to be a lot of the other segments to build sounds more smaller and work together .
We can read elements here .
You probably have you read that we put us on the chain .
Think about it , we have a genetic code on four letters : As , C , G and T.
Three those letters together together , and it &apos;s a mind of 20 amminacids , and there &apos;s a specific order to every ammind of letters .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , spensive , spensive .
What we &apos;ve been done in the beginning was self-doing it .
Some of them were in the fact that it was not poetry .
We designed these segments to just help them to just help them with the full .
There &apos;s scientists that they reped them and they put them .
And we started to assembling parts , began with segments from five to seven to seven to seven to form a letters of 24 ments , and they switch literally sweet to them at 72 ,
And every step we &apos;ve made these segments in the sequency so that we can sequency , we &apos;re trying to create a very robustoil , you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re looking for the process .
So , this seems to the tabellone of a bad player .
When we go to these very long segments , more than 100 mile , more than 100 mile , they will not grow more directly in Ecoli .
It comes to the modern limit in the modern tools of biology .
So we &apos;ve been considered to other mechanisms .
We had another mechanism called a recognize recognized reombation , which in biology to repect DNA to repect the DNA to repect the seat .
Here &apos;s a example .
This is organism , called Deinoccurs , it can be three million rad rad .
You can see in the square of a perior as his chromosome was destroying .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s just like it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be completely completely .
They can live under a hot .
They &apos;re absolutely sure that life exists in space , and you can find new environment of water .
The real , NASA has shown that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule we built these processes , just using these processed processed , just using the appropriate of the segments to inserve .
The lievenision , you know ,
This image not been taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a lot of the tool we can see it with a microscope ,
These are pictures that takes a period of about six seconds .
This is the published that we &apos;ve done it .
They &apos;re more than 580,000 letters .
It &apos;s the largest molecule of a definiture of a deal .
It has a lot of molecular sent over 300 million .
If we &apos;re going to stop it with a 10 without spaces , they would like 142 pages to translated this genetic code .
Now , how do we do it ?
Of course , you know , you &apos;re a game from kids .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when they use batters .
It &apos;s simple when it &apos;s about cell , and it &apos;s a cell of our : You can just just extract the nucleo and inserious , and inseriously , which is practical process of clonely .
In the bacteria , the cromosome is integrated by integrated in the cell , but we recently demonstrate that we &apos;re able to do a complex trape from a cell from a cell from one one of a cell of a cell cell from one other and activity it .
We got a microcken to a microbial species .
The two are different than the topes .
We &apos;ve added some gene in a few gene that you can decide that chromosome for this croms .
The one then he had a science to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cells was studied -- and you &apos;ll appreciate our graph -- the new cromosome -- the new cromosome is going to get into the cells .
And we were thinking that we couldn &apos;t go to go to , but we tried to go more and try and spush us more in the lots .
This is one of the most mecchanisms of evolution .
We found that very much species have added a second or third or third cromosome from some of , address in a second thousand new new species of new new species of new species .
So who think about evolution as a gene and at time you have not got a graphor of biology .
There &apos;s a restrial restriition of restriition that addrestriition that address the DNA .
The cromosome that was in the cells didn &apos;t have one .
The cellphone that we have inseritous cellphone that we have a lot of it .
It &apos;s expressed , and he reoned the other croms as extraneous as extraneo , and we found out with only cells and the new cell and the new cell and the new cromosoms .
it become blue , because of the genes we &apos;ve been inseriously .
And in a short lass of time , all the carpet of a species are lost , and it &apos;s transformed all in a new species , based on the new kind of switch , we &apos;ve inseriously in the cells .
All the proteins are changing , members are changing , and when we region the genetic code , exactly what we &apos;ve turned to you .
Now , this may seem alchemia , but altering the software DNA , we can change things in manipping .
Now , I &apos;ve got already exploiting genesis , but I have to go from three million years and a half million years and a half million years and a half version of evolution , and I &apos;ve been doing a new new species on this .
Why do this ?
I think it &apos;s enough when we think about our need to our need .
We &apos;re going to go from six billions and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to give you an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one of the planet for 40 , in 40 years , they &apos;ll be four .
We &apos;re doing this now , and it &apos;s fresh water , fresh water and pulital , medicinal and a half billions and a half billions and a half billions of people .
It &apos;s still more dare to do it for nine billions .
We &apos;re five billions of carbon carbon , more than 30 billion barili , more than 30 billion barili .
That means millions of barilers .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replaces , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
And more we have to tend to the whole emission of CO2 materials that is in the atmosphere .
At the day , we have a database in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they &apos;re thinking that they are the design components for the future .
The electronic industry only a dozen about components , and think about how many different things are come out .
Our limits here are actually principlally from biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have the techniques , because of these metods of synthetization , able to create what we call genome .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can produce a billions of croms .
Think about these 20 million different genes or to get these 20 million different genes or try to get the processing to produce the processes to produce the processes , we can change , because of a little team , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose to be survival , and it &apos;s a chemical , production , production of vaccines , production of vaccines .
This is a few of a few software program that we &apos;re working on doing to set and designing us to make a computer computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how they will be .
We know what we know is their genetic code .
Now we &apos;re focus on the carbons of how much generation .
You also see you that extract from the grain of the grain was a finished experiment .
We have a second and third generation that will use enough enough to be prove enough to the car carbons of the most high value as the opened or different kinds of buts .
But the only way the biology can have a big impact without a big impact without increasing the cost of food and limited the disponbility would be transforming CO2 in matheria before , for which we are working to design cells that they can make this scale , and we could have the first carbons of the quarter of 18 months .
The solar solar combined with CO2 is a metodom -- but in our discoveries in the world , we found different different metoxide .
This is a organism that we have been described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , at about 2500 feet of deep depth of the time of water .
It &apos;s put out from CO2 using idrogen a lot of energy .
We &apos;re looking for us to figure out if we can indog CO2 , which can be transported treated tramp , convertire that CO2 in carbons , to drive this process .
So we think we could think we could be able to aumenting what the question is , which is life , &quot; We think , &quot; We have a life . &quot; We have the modest of replacing the flowing industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can you do ?
You would come a main the main the energy .
And also , we &apos;re working on the same metods to create vaccinines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with influence , we &apos;re always back to a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s a dollar in in the right .
I think what you can change is build vaccines in anticipate .
That &apos;s how the future could start changing , now , the tree , now , accellerating the evolution with synthetic , and finally cells , and finally cells , and finally cells .
We &apos;re so much like that from improvement .
Our purpose to live enough long enough to try to try to do it . Thank you very much .
I &apos;ll do that , the most quickly possible , somehow much much more fundamental work , in new technology that we &apos;ve brought to Microsoft a year ago ago , this is Seadon a year ago . This is Seadon .
It &apos;s a environment where you can interact is to the local level that remoon with a huge amount of visit data .
Here we &apos;re seeing a lot of digital picture of digital photograph with a kind of switches and continue , for a speak , dispone-of--foot saying , and I continue to .
And not import how big the amounts of information that we see , how big these colracy of data or these cold data or or images .
Most of the photographs , but this for example , but this for example is a provenide from Biblioteca provense of Congress , and reentrepreneurs in the gapixel .
It does not have a difference because the only thing that limited the presents of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen in any moment . It &apos;s also an architecture .
This is a whole book , you know , not images .
This is the Casolate dest Dickens . Everymal colonna represents a capital .
To show you that it &apos;s about head and not images , we can do a thing , to see , to really see that it &apos;s a real representation of a real representation of the head , not a picture .
It could be a little bit of artificial to read a book to read a book for a book .
You don &apos;t recommend it .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s a number of the Guardian .
Every big imagines is the beginning of a seem .
And it really dust the pleasure and the beauty of a read of the version of a revision of a newspaper or a lot of days , which is nature a lot of a lot of a medical teappears .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of this particular number of the Guardian .
We &apos;ve created a fasull the alast along solutic -- much more along than that you can use in a normal published , and we &apos;ve inserious extra extra .
If you want to see the cards of this authomobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific ,
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limit of space on the screen .
We hope that this means to put people in the pop-up and other downeries , they wouldn &apos;t have to be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not to lose time , if you don &apos;t say that we have contributes to go into this camp .
These are all the streets in the U.S. .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually actually from the website ; you can go to it .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seady and the other is a search for a very interesting search for a very interesting set of Noah Seadvice , a student of University , with the U.S. Sez of U.S. S. Sez Rick Seliski and Resch Seliski . It &apos;s a very collaboration .
And it &apos;s from the Web , gested Seady .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from a another and have this kind of picture , and have this kind of experience to resolution .
But the space of images here has a meaning here .
The high of visualization of computers , they recorded these images together , in a way that they correspond to the records in which images , you know , all the neighblags from Montne Roccial Can , you &apos;re scape . So that you can see the elements of a lot of the elements of the elements of a lot of myself , and these things were all the different different things are all the different different different different different different different different things .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more space .
I want to go to a directly at one of the original set of Noahahhahhadn prototype of Photosynth that we &apos;ve done for the first time , we &apos;ve done the first time the extact , shows you what I really do is the key ey to the technology technology , Photosycity . And it &apos;s not necessarily a webody of the environment .
We had to worry about the lawyers and so on .
This is a rebuilt of the Cedital cattedge of Nothers . Bastikr . Bastay Nothers Din Flickr and you get out of a typping , other campus and so on . Or one of these things , and so on . Ogns and draising this model .
So I &apos;ve got all images from Flickr and you &apos;ve been all college to the space .
And it &apos;s possible to have this simple way .
You know , I would never think I would have to go to Microsoft .
It &apos;s very fun to realize this kind of account here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of different types of different types of the cellphones to those professional professional professional , a number of message , in this environment .
And if I can take them more strange .
Many are bload , etc .
Some of the photographs of photographs -- etc .
This is a Nothter poster Dame recorrectly .
We can spend from the poster of this physical vist .
The essential point is that we can do things with the social environment . This is now taking data -- from the interest memory of how to appear the Earth , from vision , and colleagues all those data together .
All those pictures become colleagues , most of the parts .
You have a model of the earth that emerge .
Think about this as a prolgment of Stephen Lawler on Earth &apos;s Earth .
It &apos;s something that growth in complexity , and they use it , and the which are using people to use it , and the which are using it .
Their photograph are marries to other people .
If somebody comes to contrast all these saying the name , my photograph , my picture of the Nothers of Noththers , and I can do that , and I can use all those data , and I can use as a point for the way of insite , and I can get a lot of the other , and using the universe , using photograph and a picture of the choss-moke , using the way to have a social experience of the cross-moke chososososs-moke , and
Of course , a consequence of all of this is virtual model of every interesting part of the earth , and they didn &apos;t only only only vists of the planes and satellite and satellar images and satellar , but from the memory of the world .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What your software to do is that you &apos;re going to contain us to do is that in a point , in the next years , all the photographs of all the world are they will be practical together ?
BA : Yes . What &apos;s doing is doing is to discover .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want to get , and you want to get it .
And it &apos;s doing it in the contained of images .
The thing is very interesting if you think about the recknight to the simple information of simple information that many of these images .
As when you do a research on on the web , you get a sentence and the page on the web page , it &apos;s a lot of information about pictures .
Now , what if that picture is a picture of your picture ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amounts of recheeness that it was really huge . It &apos;s a very huge effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really amazing .
BA : You &apos;re very much .
One of the main the major of the major of the major of the search and the ethnography is the power of the ancient , and who has been traditions , and who &apos;s the past in the wind , the drop , the drop , and the drop , and the drop .
Basts thinking that Jaguar , and they still still get the Woman Lattea , or who are still still a lot of the Inuit &apos;s still a lot of meaning , or who in Himalaya , or who are actually slowed the respire of Dharm , to remember the importance of the central central central , and that the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that the world in which we live not exists , but it &apos;s just a a model of a model , but it &apos;s just a model of a central central central central central central central central , but is not exists , but it &apos;s not exists of a respirrr
the consequence of a particular set of scowever , in our stiring has done , well , well , many generations ago .
And , of course , all we share of the essential .
All all we have all property .
We are objects at the beginning .
We have to have to death the inesorability of death , so we don &apos;t spring and ballim --
We have a huge art .
What college is the particular is particular run in canzone , the dance of every culture .
Not me that they &apos;re thinking about the Borneo of Borneo , or the followers of Haiti , or the desert Kenya , or the desert Kenya , or a waiter , Curandering in the Sahara .
He was my journey of journey in the desert of a month ago , or a month ago , or a month ago , on Everest , den the mother of the world .
All these populations teaching us that there are other ways to be other ways to think , other ways of dies in the world .
And if you reflected a moment that can give you hope .
And we had the cultures of cultures of the world creating a spiritual ryoung and cultural and cultural that the planet and it &apos;s important for the planet , as a very much as a biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural girl as a nosphere and you can call the ethnosphere , and you can see the nospital of all the concepts , ideas , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions .
The ethnosphere is the fantastic patrimonide of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how inquisitive species .
And because the biosphere was really consumed , as it was happened at the ethnosphere and too much more quickly .
No biologist , for instance , it should be that 50 percent of all the species was or on the horders of the extinction of simply , or in the most apocalong -- in the most apocalong , and you don &apos;t have neighbor in the most of the biological cultural different countries .
The injected all of this is , of course , the lost linguistic .
When you have been 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not just a voices from a voabulary or a series of rules .
One language is the sprice of human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle with the animate of every culture in the material world .
Every language is a forest , a shink , a wind , a thought , a thought , a lot of spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re seduce to Monterey , at least the half doesn &apos;t get more sushed in the earth .
They don &apos;t get more teaching to children , which wants to say , less you wave something , who are already dead .
What &apos;s more trists of being fly from the silenenency , to be the last to talk a language , not have a way to transmit the wisdom of the wisdom , or to anticipate the promise ?
This is saving it was someone in a few of the world every two weeks : every two weeks and a ancient anissue and brings with a homb and a hand of a language .
And I know you have to tell you , &quot; Isn &apos;t that ?
The world would not be a better place if we all the same language ? &quot; Benisish , then we all talk all the yoruba . We &apos;re all going to be cancer .
We &apos;re kogi .
You &apos;ll take a tract thing to say , &quot; You can &apos;t talk about their language .
I &apos;d like to do you get to do a journey through the ethnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a little bit of what we &apos;re losing .
Most of us mented that when I say , &quot; different ways of exists of exists to be really different ways of exists .
Let &apos;s take for example this Barasana , in Amazon , in Amazon , the population of the anaconda , who crew the middle of the latest burn in the sea of spends .
It &apos;s a population that &apos;s not able to distinguished the color because the dump of the blue color because the forest is identify in the forest , where the people depend the population .
They have a strange language and a mathemselves , detail , &quot; exogamia , &quot; You have a person who talks about a person who who park the language of different language .
All this has been radical past in the mythological past , and it &apos;s in these families , in these families that are six or seven or lingua lingua languages .
They get to listen to listen and then start to talk .
Let &apos;s take one of the most interesting tribes with what I lived , Waoran of Ecuador , a population , a population of the earlier who had the first contact in 1958 .
In 1957 , they &apos;ve been tented a commitment contact .
They did it from the photographs that they retradaditional , they retraditional , forest that this population of the forest , and they had never seen the bi-dimensional forest .
They have a seen ground , they &apos;ve got the research of a shape or a shape or and , not find nothing , they have been a bad , they concluses the drap , and they killed the five missioning .
But Waorani not just killed the strange .
They kill them on their .
54 percent of the mortality was caused to them .
We save the housing generations and we found two dead of death , and when we &apos;ve been insisted to know , they have a lot of them was invected , and then they killed it to be the same .
The hundred degrees were able to reach the animal urina from 40 and regroup and regraduate them .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was asked a very interesting compiece when my professor of Harvard Harvard to me if I wanted to go to Haiti and intrue in the base of Dualier and Tonton Maces , and impossessed me to do the zombie .
To give a sense of my measure , I should understand the Vodoun culture and the Vodoun &apos;t magic .
It &apos;s quite a little bit of a physical vision of the world .
Most interesting .
If you ask you to tell me great religions of the world , what would you have to do ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Ssaharian Africa has no religious feelings . And he saves and Voodoo is not the other than these concepts of these concepts of these religious religious religious deep on the tragic travism .
What makes the voodoo is the voot is the intense between life and dead .
So , you live the spirits .
The spirits can be invocused by Great Aqua , they said , they respond to the dance and replaces are replaces to the anima short that for a short of the vive in a short way that for a short .
So , this is a wonderful vooists , you go to to the wonderful to talk about God .
We go into the temple and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment you can sitting , is the spirit that you , how can you do you do that ?
So you &apos;re assist these incredible events : followed the wind in the state of trance , infuel infuel infuel , infuel a raising demonstration of the power of mind when it is catalyses in a state of extremely excitation .
The people who have lived the most extraordinary , the most extraordinary are the Kogi of Sierra Nevada Santa Marta , in Colombia , in the settlenterional septs .
It &apos;s taking the ancient cient civilization that once they had a living town in the Colombia in the conquickly , the population , the population of critical ancient planture .
In a drugs of a drugs , this population never been conquicted by the spagners .
And so , I &apos;m government from a closer , but their formation is really extraordinary .
The young people who were brought out of the families three or four years , and live seeks in a world of good bombs and bombs in a bombs of the bombs of the brobs of the bombs of the broads for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years , in the countries of proposed the countries of gestation that transformed in the mother , now are metaphor , now they &apos;re metaphor in the Madaddress of Mther .
For all this time , they &apos;re acculate at their society , values that their predict and they just predict and their precise and they just their pregned to the cosmic equilibrio -- or for the best best balance .
At the term of this incredible , they &apos;re improved out and they get out and for the first time in their life , at 18 years , you see a high . And in that actic actic , when the solution of the first bore , when the sunlight bulb . And in that we learn in theory , everything that has learned in theory . The precient is a past and says , &quot; The precient . The past a past and says , &quot; The land-a past and says , &quot; The pret and says , &quot; The pret .
&quot; I mean , I said , &quot; How do I said .
It &apos;s studies . Now , it &apos;s looking at you . &quot;
They &apos;re called the most of them and say that we , frackers , we are the bevolved of the world .
This is extremely important .
When we think of the Indiges and the environment , and the old story of the old story of the old story of self-vacuum , which is a razy concept in his simplicity or perhaps , and we say that these people are more closer to the Earth of us .
The Indigenes are not nor sentimental , nor indebolites .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the world &apos;s paludiaric vents in the gelids of Tbet , but because of time and they created a mystic war &apos;t about the Earth &apos;s based on the Earth &apos;s based on a maintubbers , but on a very much more slightly sets slightly uncle .
What does it mean ?
It mean that a little girls who who are growing up with the Ande who growth is a spirit of Apu that will drive his destiny is a depth of a full , and it will be a fun in a full of Montana who are growing a little bit of Montana who growth a mountain in a mountain .
which is the dimour of one or a mineral cent is irrievant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that &apos;s the meaningful is the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia , who were able to be cut for the forests , they were going to be cut .
And what I realized is a different human from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the Hukuk and the song of Hukuk and the song of paradian and the dog of the world , and the nobal world , the spirits that we have in the Hamatest , the spirits that they &apos;re going to go in Hamatomen .
If you start to look at that these cultures can actually create really different , you can start to understand some of them , you can start to understand some of them . We take this plants .
I wrote this picture to aprid in Amazon ,
Mayahuash , you know , the most powerful psychoactive , the powerful psychoactive .
What it makes the gahuases the playahuge is not the drug of the drug , but his elaboration . It &apos;s a two elements .
From a layer , this lian lian lian lian hydroppins , harmin harmin and harmers , literally labor , literally .
It turning the sunlight , you have a bule or blueat that altera little bit the conscience , but it &apos;s mscowever , but it &apos;s mscowever , you know ,
This is a triptamines , very similar to the serotonin the set , dithoxyltryltryltryltryltryptamp .
If you you &apos;ll see the Yanomami to the nose to the nose to the sushing that they do from a different kind of species , it &apos;s contained methoxyltryltryltrysten .
Tiring that policy on the nose is a little bit like to be spared by a little bit like a fixed fucile and lots on a move of electricity . Rish and lots of electricity .
I had often often my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who had chedelic was psychetry , with his discovered fungi in Mexico .
And I think of my tears not can classificate these triptaminogens because if you &apos;re doing you can &apos;t tell anyone of being able .
It &apos;s possible to assumercially if you under chemical to other chemical chemical chemical to MAO .
Now , the beautiful : The goes that are in this liana are inibitors of MAO , the same kind of need to power the triptames . The amazing thing to the triptamptampes . The amount of 80,000 species of plants , how these people are in this one way , they &apos;re not spend , but if you believe a real real real real real way , but if you believe a real real real real real tricks .
We use the big eufemism of provide and the herror , which can reveals .
But if you ask the Indians , they &apos;ll tell us &quot; The pits talks about . &quot;
What does it mean ?
This tribes , Cofan , 17 variety of ayahubbustinguished in the forest , and that we would get in the same species would be in the same species .
If you ask them how they stabilish their tasonomy will tell us , &quot; I thought , &quot; I was not going to do it ? &quot; I save it . &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : they get 17 variety in a night of llots and each cannot have a different ton .
With this is not a Harvard , but it &apos;s very more interesting that contact that contact the stami .
Now , &#91; &#91; applauses the problem is that those of us who have to have the heart of us that have the people who are pitting them , but in some way to reduces of our history respect in our real world , and past .
In fact , the X-century , 300 years , it will not remember for his driven or innovations , but as as the wonderful and we &apos;ve been bad and we &apos;ve been bad or accepted , and we &apos;ve bad actively the distriction of the biological diversity and cultural cultural and cultural cultural . Now the problem . Now the problem .
All cultures through the centuries were tained in a dance for new possibility .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux , they don &apos;t have to be Sioux when they put out of the ark and fast as Americans don &apos;t have to be American , when they put from the horse and climbed .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that mind the integrity of ethnosphere . It &apos;s the power .
I wall of the domination .
And if you give one of the world , you &apos;ll find that these are not cultures are cultures to start to comparing .
They &apos;re creatures and dynamics out of the forces of exencicicientify that they go over three their capacity of adaptation .
And the thing that &apos;s disbospatria of the thought of --
a population of Sarawak , in the Asd-Ex-hy-Ex--played , a population , and now reduced the swimming and the next titution and the next titution and the next to the slide of the fiinquinter , where you can see the Borneeks to the Borry Bornewspaper Mdier Cinese , where the naves the naves , where the navi navaillilights the naves , where the named the named the drive named the horise , and the horite of the horium , and the slights of the inese fights of the ddind of the ses the ses
It &apos;s going to replaces the stive to forest .
Or , in Yanomami , I &apos;m the disease , they &apos;re the disease that they have the discovery of the gold .
If we put the Tibet mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the political domination .
You know , you know the genocide , the physics of a population , it &apos;s condannect to the universal level , but the region of a population , not just condannect , but also , not only conduction , but it &apos;s not just condantly conditions .
And you can &apos;t understand the ofference of Tibet , because you don &apos;t get part of the beginning .
I lost the 6,000 miles from Chengineering in Chengines through the Tibet , came to Lhoriental Lhasa young colleagues , but only came to Lhasn &apos;t been doing .
6,000 mountain sacrates and centers .
1.2 million people killed to the military Rivolution in Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascrited to Panchen Lama .
The thing that means that it was killed to the time of invasion of the invasion of the invasion .
Sought the Sanity in Santity during the death in the waiting that has taken the people in Nepal .
Sought her mother had been imprisoned and his color was to be recise .
It was taking nascost in a ceasy to the age of two years , nascondending her gonna wouldn &apos;t living without her .
The ssorella , who did the same , was messed in the weld of reeducation .
A day has been woughly calculated a fashigher fashion Mao and , for this transgression , was messed to seven years .
The Tibet of Tibet can be insent , but it &apos;s redenter redenter &apos;s redenter .
At the end , everything is reduce a choice .
We want to live in the world monotony of the monotony or we want to get the policycle world of different different different diversity ?
The great anthropologa Margaret Mead , before we die said that his bigger was that in our largest lasses of the world , we will not just see the whole games of the world , we &apos;re going to see the modality of the modality of thinking , but a day , but a day there was other possibility .
And it &apos;s a billion-half existed that our species is existed for 60,000 years .
The Neolitics , which has given us the agriculture , which has done us to the cult of the sea of sea , replacing poem , they &apos;re doing a little bit of the closer , creating the gerarchy of specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The industrialized world has three miles .
That slow me to be suggested to me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we should be in the millennia to come .
When these cultures of cultures of the world is asked what to say to be to say to be human , they respond to 10,000 voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all return the possibility of being what we are : one species , which has to do that , we have all the people and all the people and all the people and all the people and all the people and all the people and all the people and all the people and the hottional handle ,
I went this to the northern extremity of the Baffin Baffin , when I went to the Baffin , when I went to the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya story of his nonon-history .
The government was not always gentile with the Inuit and in the &apos; &apos; 50s to stabilies our premise , we have them in colonies .
The nonthing about this man has to go to go .
And family , I &apos;m saying for his life , he brought all the arms , and all his attractive .
You have to know that Inuit &apos;s not the cold , they &apos;re sframework .
The brobbrobbrobs were made of fish fly flight in the caribs .
The nonthing is not saying from the artic night to the night to the text of the blizeard or blizing .
It &apos;s slowed out , you &apos;re calculated the pins in the skin and defull in their hand . When the fecks are conged , it has been congeled , it works , it has working on a lama .
It was spruzed on the points of this cacca and when it was solid , and when he was solid , he killed a dog .
She had the dog and created a bridge , with the casses , with the huge casses , he has been brown on a sliter , and it &apos;s springing one other canes , and it &apos;s slands on the hrest .
We want to talk about cavar with nothing ?
In the 1999 , the government of the government has redded by the Inuit &apos;s a total area of a territorary area of California and Texas mas I had together .
It &apos;s their new patria . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a territorary territorary . Controlling all the resources .
One splendido you know , as a national national time could reach with his population .
And , to finish , I think it &apos;s quite obvious to the people of us was in these zones of the planet , make it not remote remote .
For somebody &apos;s home .
They representing sequars of human imagination that they switch at the time . And for us , all these kids , as all these children , as all of our children , become part of our children , become part of the hope .
For finish , we are convince we are convints that politicians will never be in null .
We believe that polemies --
&#91; Applauses , they &apos;re not persuasive , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and maybe we have the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month . Every month . Every month .
156 countries our television .
Our revists are leven millions of people .
Our work is to travel in the ethnosphere to bring our public and cultural wonders from what they have seen and hopefully , they &apos;re hoping , and hopefully , they &apos;re hopefully in different different different , and we have to find a fun in different different different , and we have to find a style in a world and multiculticulations in a world and multiculticulticulticultural world in a floor of a world , and muralists and mystyle and mal world of the world of a
where the wisdom of all the people can contributing our own own own own .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope you &apos;ve been hearing and I &apos;m going to try some colleagues , in case , in case , in case , in case , in case , in case , in case , in case , in case , in case , I &apos;m going to talk about this book that I hope hope you &apos;ve been hearing and I &apos;m going to talk about this book , and I &apos;m going to go to this a few things that I hope to go to to evidence some of college ,
I want to start with what I call the dogm dogm . &quot;
The dogm is what ?
The dogm of all the environment of all the industrial society . The dogm dogm is the recognize of our citizens , &quot; The way to do that is to be massive to do is to be the individual liberty . &quot;
The reason is , from a late , in fact that the liberty is in the same value , is precise , useful , useful , for humans .
At the other is that if we are libers , each of us can act to do all that that massive our well-being , no one who decided in names our well-being , no one who decided in names .
The way to massive the liberty is to be massive the choice .
More choices people , more libers , and most of the liberty , most of them is their liberty , most of them is their well-being .
This , I think , it &apos;s so deply radically radict in the society that nobody would have dream to doubt it in the society .
And it &apos;s also deply radically in our lives .
I &apos;ll show you some examples of what I &apos;ve got to do .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I hope a simple note of condents for inavailable .
In my supermarket , there are 175 condents , no contextreme 10 variety of oil , and 12 acets acets acets to make you buy a huge huge of the long-acets of condents in the restaurban amic condent of the expensive degrees .
Here &apos;s the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic netic to buy a sterean : if you , CD , radio , radio , plastra , leter .
And in this single netic netic , there &apos;s a big number of audio .
We can realize six million different combinations in a different combinations , and they &apos;re in a netight-crap .
You have to put there is a very antis-sceling .
Alchchamps : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could all the service of the service , they could all the serve phone who were fornites from mamma Bell .
It was born the phone , you didn &apos;t buy it .
One of what the other , was that the phone , was that the phone didn &apos;t get .
These tempts are later .
Now , we have a variety of phone of the phone , especially between cellularies .
Here &apos;s the cellphones of the future .
My preferit is that in the midddle , MP3 , and fornels in the nose , and fornellin the crazy for the eggs .
If you don &apos;t have seen in the house , you &apos;re seen in the house , you &apos;re going to present it will be going to be .
And what happens is that people are both in the nezi and does this question . And you know what &apos;s the answer ? The answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cellphone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
So , in other expect of life that are much more important than the case , you know , you can get the same explosion .
Asanitary : Don &apos;t happen in the United States that you &apos;re going to go from the doctor and doctor , what you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do it , &quot; At these waites and these weks . &quot; Aha &apos;s these weks and these risks . What do you want ? &quot;
You know , &quot; You know , what should I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; You have these benefits and those waites and B has these walked them and those ryes and those risks . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebats : &quot; You know , you know , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor : But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result it is the autonomy of disease , &quot; expression that it seems to do it a beautiful thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not a fishing fish and responsibility to take decisions from somebody who know something , oxy -- and whether it &apos;s not not -- and so much of course , and so much certainly , and so in the ideal condition to make decisions .
There &apos;s a huge marketing products drugs , direct to people like me and you , who if you think there &apos;s no sense , because we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why are it .
The answer is that they want to domaction , we call the doctor to ask them to change the recise .
Something that is our hydrop is a question of scoice , as you see in this gap , as you see in this jobp . We &apos;re going to force the children . Scear their hair . We &apos;re sevity , we &apos;re going to have .
And we can reinventing us how many times us aggrade .
which means that every morning , in the rises , you have to decide that kind of person want to be .
I spot at family and mathemselves , a time time , a time time , a time time , it was that there was a lot of one , it was that you know , and he started to get the most present , and he started to get the most of possible .
The only wait was with who , not when , not when , and not even when , and it &apos;s not when , you know what to do after .
Everyday , everything is really to play .
I seat a very smart students , and I do their 20 percent in less than a time .
And because they &apos;re not brilliant , because they &apos;re not not lbrilliant .
Because I &apos;m impensieritites , I mean , I should you know , &quot; I would like to do it ? &quot;
&quot; I should you get more tarch ? I have to think before you think about the or career ? &quot;
They &apos;re interrational logorant .
And they &apos;re looking for these questions , even though this is not completing the compitititites that you &apos;re seeing and not to get a beautiful vity to my exame .
And they have to do it . I &apos;m really important to do .
Now , the work : We &apos;re lucky , as Carl , because the technology we allowed us to work every day , every day , every day , from Hotel Randolph .
You know , there &apos;s a angolin , and I &apos;m not to tell anyone who , where WiFi works .
I don &apos;t have it , because I want to use it .
What does , this incredible liberty of choice that we have to have to go on the work ? Is we have to sell , if we have to go or not .
We can go to the swoom , and the cell phones in a task , Blackberry in the other , and the night , and the night , and the night , on the night , on the ginockberry .
And if you &apos;re all spends , every minute that we see our son , we &apos;re seeing the partner , we also asking this , &quot; I have to answered this ? &quot;
&quot; I have to sell this ? I have to sell this literal letter ? &quot;
And when the answer is &quot; no , &quot; that makes the experience of your own own own own a lot of different partner of your child very different than what would have been in other conditions .
So , from any of the things , and large , and large , and large objects and larger , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this , there were some possibility , but it was not a question . But it was not a question of choice .
The world today is , it &apos;s like this : The dilemma is , &quot; It &apos;s a positive thing ? &quot;
The answer is Shomething .
The positive lots of positive them , so I &apos;ll talk about that negative .
And all this choice , two effects negative effects on people .
The first , paradoxide , is that we &apos;ve been invited to liberation .
With a lot of fra , it &apos;s a lot of difficult to do it .
I &apos;m offered an example : one study a study conduct of volunteer pensionally .
And a colleagues had access to the data of Vantual , the giant society of thinking , with about a million climents in 2,000 different companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of adesion of two percent .
With 50 source , there &apos;s 10 percent in less adesion , less adesion , because they &apos;re only five . Why ?
Because with 50 source 50 source , it &apos;s disease , it &apos;s disease , and the choice comes back to the indomorate .
And at domances , and still domances , domanances , and of course , and naturally domanances never .
You know , you know , that these are worthers to food for cans because they don &apos;t have enough enough money , because they don &apos;t have enough money , it also , it also , they also want to say that the decision is so host of the work .
Not teaching , they &apos;re losing to five dollars a year from the dator of work , who would be lose to be them .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too much .
And I think that &apos;s makes the world .
&quot; And to finish , for the eternity : ketchup , feelings , senape or major ? &quot;
You would be right to take the right decision , if it &apos;s for eternity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the sbroke , and nepurpure the condent condent condent .
So this is the first effect . The second is that if we can evitate the paralysis , and we can do a choice , we can have a scowever , we were with less options that choose choose to what choose choose .
And that &apos;s for different reasons .
One of these is that with many of these is that a lot of condents , if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that you could have been better . And what happens is that the alternative , and that &apos;s the alternative , and the repimet , and the repimounded by the decision , and the repiece of the decision , and the swears from the decision , and it &apos;s a slies from the decision ,
when it was a very good decision .
More scoke , there &apos;s more easy than anything is to be insoftwice that is insoftwice .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has really really very good stamatement as the value that we think about things that we &apos;re going to confrontier .
And in the rest , when there are many possible , is easy to represent the career of alternative actic patterns , and you &apos;re sure as a lot of option that is choice .
Here &apos;s a example . I wrote all those who are not New York .
But that &apos;s what you would think you &apos;re probably thinking .
There &apos;s this coppia .
A place of lussied .
It &apos;s splendes . Otyma days . It &apos;s all for them .
Not ething . But what he thought is , &quot; Well , malbuilding , is Agost . &quot;
&quot; Everybody my nears to Manhattan are so on . &quot;
&quot; I could talk about home . &quot;
And then spend two weeks and slated by the idea that &apos;s lost -- every day -- the chance to go .
The cost-opportunity , it &apos;s savation for what we have , even when the choice was , even when the choice was except .
And the most are options that we have to consider , more careers , more careful paper as a conconcertainly opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
We talk about living the time , and maybe a living lently .
But the most important point is that anything you &apos;re going to choose , you &apos;re going to do not do other .
The things that we don &apos;t choose many active active active that can make less attractive what we do .
Tirst point : It &apos;s growing up to expectations .
I tried on my skin compring a new couple of jeans .
I &apos;m almost always always jeans .
Once the jeans were just like , and I buy them and western out , they were comodissions , only after they had them a lot of time and worked a lot of times , began to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple when that old them a couple when that old them were gone , and said , &quot; I need a couple jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
The committed me , &quot; Who wants me to slim , fit , relaxed and fit ? &quot;
You want to the certain or or with the bottoons ? &quot; Stonewashed &quot; or &quot; &quot; or &quot; accorporate &quot; ?
&quot; Let you want to do it ? &quot;
&quot; Some people who takes them larger or stretches ? Bla -- &quot; Continuate them .
I was sbalance , and after a little bit , and after a little bit , I want the kind of -- which was the only one of which was the only one of which was , so for a lot of what I was going to try all of the stage , then used the best , then I &apos;m using the best couple of jethers who had .
It was the massive . I had the best .
But I had heard about it .
Why ? I wrote a book for caps .
The reason I was worst worse , which was that with all the expectations were altissue , jeans had to be lost .
I started expected minimes . I didn &apos;t expected anything when there was only a kind of , but when there was only a kind of , but when you live 100 different , I had to be perfect .
What I had taken was good , but not perfect .
After the had to talk about what I was trying to be insod-insod-inso-on .
The addition of options in life , not to aumenting the expectations of options that these have respect of options .
And that producing less sod-fying switched , even when the result are good .
No one in the world of marketing world in marketing .
Because if they know you &apos;d know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is a more to this .
&quot; You were better when he was worse , &quot; The reason why he was better when you were better when you were worse when he was worst , when he was worst the pressed was even possible to controversial surprising of the pressed .
Everyday , in the world that we live -- opulations , industrialized industrialized , industrialized , which we can hope is that things are hopefully , we can hope is that things are in the head of the expectations .
You &apos;ve never been surprising please your expectations , because your expectations , they &apos;re ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Basse you &apos;re expectations , &quot; Yes , you want . &quot;
I mean , little autobiographic moment -- which I &apos;m really sposed and my wife is really study .
I couldn &apos;t have to do better , I don &apos;t have to be able .
But it &apos;s not a good thing .
Finally , a consequence of buying a couple of jeans scomodds when there &apos;s only that when you &apos;re not saying , and you &apos;re saying , and you ask you , and you ask you , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot; And the answer is .
The world is responsible . What could you do you do ?
When there are hundreds of types , and you buy a display insod-insod-you , and you ask you who is the responsible , is as a responsible , is as you &apos;re going to spend you .
You could have to do better .
With hundreds of variety , there &apos;s no scale for insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even though the results is willing , they sented , they slowed them and they damage .
In the last years , the last years is explosa in the industrialized world .
I think a meant -- not the only one , but the only , but important -- that &apos;s this , but important -- this is that people have experiences of the people who are too too much much along .
And when they have to explain this situation thought the college is their own .
So the final result is that we &apos;re better , but we &apos;re better better , but we &apos;re worst .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogm , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely full . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than it &apos;s not to have a lot of choice , but it didn &apos;t want to be better than a little bit better than a little bit .
There &apos;s a critical value , I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure that we have surface from a piece of the level where the improvement that the improvement of our life .
Now , from the political point of view -- I &apos;ve almost finished -- from the political point of view , the noise is the following .
What it allows all of this choice in the industrial society is the material recchoice .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have too much much .
The problem is they have too poca lot of poca .
So the facility I &apos;m talking about is a disease to be a disease of modern , recidental society .
And what you do is to be to be this : Steve Levitt talked about how those cost-to-to-to-spot segols and comodds for bibs . It &apos;s a recrecognize of money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and dispendent , it &apos;s not that they &apos;re just inuseful .
They &apos;re going to be a constantly advice .
They do it .
If a little bit of what in our society , because it &apos;s lots of choice was reversed in those where people has too much much possibility , not just their lives , but also our improvement .
This is what economists call a pareties .
A desption of the reduction of the reduction of this -- not just to povering this scoice in the except that there &apos;s a lot of the except that there &apos;s a lot of a choice in the except that you .
To conclude , you can become all of you want to be what you want to want &quot;
You know , culture , you know , you think , &quot; What &apos;s about fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t get anything in a set . &quot;
&quot; At imagination , a limited vision of the world -- &quot;
and I was interpret , I &apos;ve been interpret , at beginning .
But then , I thought , I realized that fish , I realized that that fish the long .
Because the fact , that if you get in the bottom , in the way that you can &apos;t get the swimming , so you can &apos;t get the liberty . You get the paralysis .
If you rompet the way that everything is to be possible diminuitary .
You &apos;re going to give the paralises , and you reduck the well-being .
All they need a sfood .
This is almost certainly too much , perhaps even for fish , and it &apos;s sure for us .
But the assumption of some symbolic symbolic symbolic and , themselves , for rovine .
Thank you very much .
