And year I showed these slide to show that the calculture that calcularten , which for almost three million years had the size of 48 to the United States continent , and it &apos;s restreet , it &apos;s restreet , you know , it &apos;s restreet 40 percent .
Two this switch , because of the problem because of the problem because of the glacion .
The calculture glacial glacial , the heart points of the global climate system .
You can be expected and you get up .
The next slide is going to be a reduced by the last 25 years .
The ice lost , lost , I &apos;m saying .
As you see , you know , you know .
That &apos;s the glacy in invering , which is reverse rupt .
You can see that the told told , five years or , of five years or , is like the sang , which is like the sang , which is five years .
In 25 years , it &apos;s saying so , so .
This is a problem because the return out to the entire record to the ocean arten told where there are enormous amount of carbon congent , and they get transformed in metal , they get transformed into metan hicrobes .
And I pect to the totality of the inquencing , that it could rading , that could radical , that could radical , surrounded , surrounded , you don &apos;t remember .
In some laghi , and in Alaska , and it &apos;s already rebed by water .
The professordered Katey Walter Walter &apos;s University , is recovered with a literally a basis .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : I &apos;m good .
A reason that this is that this exchange in the north .
This is a glacial fighting .
And he had never reached to reach them .
This is the Kangered Kangerled in the south of Groenland .
If you want to know how to sal the level to the site to the site of the game to the wind , here is where you can add the mare .
These running are aumenting .
At the other part : Antartis , the larger of the planet .
The month scientists have died the scientists have died that the crowd is in negative , and that Antartest , which Antartes , which is in some isoles , which is particularly read in the science .
Equires to six feet of across , like in Groenlanguage .
Sular Himalaya , the larger , the larger of the glacters , which points were glaces , which points were glacters .
40 percent of the population of the world &apos;s population to the water to the power of the power of the water .
Sull : this glacier is the source of the water of this city .
The loughly bring is ather .
But when you dimind , the same accept water .
In California to the Sierra Nevada is diminutes .
The blood bins are in cribes .
The previsions , like you have , they &apos;re graveling .
The growth city in the world &apos;s sure for a night .
The environmental environmental ints are aumenting out out of normal , and without precedents .
Four times more numerous number 30 years , you &apos;ve got 75 .
This is a whole thing to instand all of the intenable .
If you look at the context stories , if they can see the consequences .
In the last five years we &apos;ve added to 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tonnels in the ocean every day .
Look at the U.S. .
Most of global warming , together to deforestation , which is used to the deforestation , is used to be used to be .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States are one of two countries with more emissions , together to the China .
And he was proposed to build many other central central .
But we &apos;re assisting a change of direction .
These are the projects in the last years , and some of some of the last years , and some of the alternative version .
And every way , there &apos;s a political lotta in our country .
The carbon and of oil , and oil has spread 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon , which is a host .
That picture me to something --
I know Natale , in Tennessee , where I live , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion scories .
Maybe you see it .
This is the larger second .
It &apos;s happened to Natale .
The published published the published .
Video : Syway , I can reach the carbon and happy .
It &apos;s leaving here in America , and it &apos;s growing our economy .
Fross the carbon is always more lit .
It &apos;s good precise , adorable and work , and the workers are conducted .
Al Gore : Da is part of the West Virginia .
The larger society , on the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his friends .
Video : Don Blankening : I &apos;m going to writing -- Al Gore , Nancy Peloselosis , they &apos;re talking about what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So Alleance for the Clima Protetion of Clima Clima two campaign .
This is a one of the same .
Video : ALergy : All COALergy see the change like a mind of climate climate change as a serious mind to our business .
So , our priority is invest a great amount of money in a huge , and confusual pattern to make it beautiful and confusual pattern .
In fact , the carbon is not sport .
We think it &apos;s a huge -- it &apos;s also a good profumor .
So , not predict of the climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Attor : Carbon -- you &apos;ve heard a lot of talk .
So I do do a type in a structure of the watch for the carbon is about the carbon .
Strickly ! The machines are a little bit of the sound of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon .
The carbon is between the mainly cause of the cause of global warming , but the notions of the carbon that you see change everything .
Do an an easy : this is the odierny technology of the carbon .
Al Gore : Infinally , the alternative alternative , and that &apos;s the handwindow and that safety .
Video : My America is in the crisis , the economy , the national crisis , the climate climate climate .
The philo that lies all : our dependence from all of our dipendence to combustible , like the carbon and oil .
Now , perhaps there is a new , audace solution for use .
Repower , 100 percent of pulites , in the years .
A pian to read America to work , makes us more sure , and help to stop the window the global warming .
Finally , one that &apos;s solution to resolve our problems .
Really , America . Scpressed .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Yeah , it &apos;s a energy to America .
One of the most quickly focus to the end of the dependence that killed our planet .
Comparty : The future is here . I &apos;m going to be , sole , one new energy .
Comparty two : Novi investment for positions for positions .
Commment : Repower America . It &apos;s time .
Al Gore : A old old old , &quot; A old old , &quot; If you want to go to the site , you go to the site .
If you want to go away , you go to , you go . &quot;
We have to go away , we have to go away ,
Thank you very much .
They go to TED fech .
And I promise to reach you to get to the hundred .
So , I realized , and for those who had no , the other time there were , the most largest experiment , and experiment -- 27 kilometers .
His compit is to reach the conditions that were less than a billion second from the universe , until of the universe , until 600 million times to the second .
All it &apos;s just environment .
This is the car Ginevening .
For Big Big Big Bang Bang drible in the result .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- it &apos;s 44 feet and has a 22 feet of 22 feet .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in buildings .
The 10 seping seping year we have accested the first time .
And this picture was taken by AS .
It was because of immentioned immens in the room .
And it &apos;s a field of the first phasases that had all the game of the LHC , and walking in the LHC , and it &apos;s hard , with a part of the rip .
In other words , when we see that image 10 to the 10 september , we could make it , the machine worked , which is a great vittorous .
I don &apos;t know if it was to do it , when somebody on this , when somebody on Google and vivide that the page was this .
What we have a cultural impact cultural impact cultural .
About a week later , there was a problem with car , and just these phils here -- these dorders here -- these dored dored .
These phils are 13,000 amping when the machine works to the massive .
Now , the technical technical , and they will say , &quot; it &apos;s not true . &quot;
And instead of them can do that because when they &apos;re very cold to be conduct up .
So , at least 271 degrees , to a temperature in the space between the stars , these phils can bring that corrent .
In one of the young novemile , the maybe in the LHC , , there was a fabication .
So , the phili sical read , and 13,000 amping , and 13,000 amping , and 13,000 ampes .
This was the result .
Now , this is still more impressioning if you think these magnetic weigher than 20 tons , and that are placed about 30 centire feet .
They &apos;re danging about 50 magnetes .
We had to told them , what we did .
We &apos;ve realized and traveled .
They &apos;re coming back to them all the place to their place .
Enger the end of the LHC is going to be new .
We &apos;re going to happen , and we &apos;re going to get the data , or or light , and continuing so our adventure to find what the morning to find the morning to find what they are the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these in--debate dibad on the value of science and engineering . It &apos;s easy to confuture .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that I think is the value of things like LHC .
I &apos;d like to end with the words of one Inglese , Humphry Davy , which , imagine , the one who , in the inuseful experiments of his broken , his broken , his broke , he said , &quot; Nithing is so much for the resources of human mind that &apos;s ideas the resources of human mind that &apos;s ideas that the ideas of the resources of human mind that ideas the resources of the inuseful , which is not the source the source of the resh ideas of the result .
Thank you .
I want to start to start to rethink , when , from children , you get cool climbs .
And as you can reach them and free them , and they &apos;re going to take them and move them , learned to think and resolve , and refull and refing relationship to realize space .
The reasonable is deeply connected to the way we understand graphor in the world around us .
So , from the useful inspired by the usual action with the physics , together to my country , and my collaborator , and my collaborator , and my collaborator , and when we use a computer , when we use a computer , when we use a computer , when we use a computer , instead of the wind to the wind , you could have a wind , could be a wonderful information with the window , we could have a tiny information with a hundred of the source ,
and we &apos;re going to do it in our plane ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , and build the Siftable .
In fact , a word , a Siftable computer , like a big baby .
In fact , a word , a Siftable computer , like a big baby .
You can move with hand , they can be , &quot; you can see , &quot; You can see the movement and they have a screen and a radio runeless .
But surprising , are objects , like the morning , you can move , you can move out .
The Siften is the example of a new ecosystem to manipulate the information information .
And as we have become more physics , consciousness , of other , of other , of other , and they move that , consciousness , conscience , of the other , of the other people , like , we can explore new and different interaction .
I &apos;m going to start with some simple example .
This is configurate is configurate to show it : if you put it in a direction , the rotery , it will be so , if you get back to the other side side side .
These are interactive , they &apos;re consciously .
If you &apos;re interested in , they &apos;re interested in .
If they &apos;re getting out , and they can get up , and they can get a little bit .
If they &apos;re getting out , and they can get up , and they can get a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
And then we &apos;ve got a construct of interaction was the power to use gests of the interaction was the power to be able to be a color like if it was a liquid color like if it was a liquid liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable like a hundred of the hundred , and I can use them to track them to track .
And I can use them to be able to be able to be able to be able .
If we &apos;re too too , we can ret a little bit .
They also beautiful possibility to appeared , like the language , the mathematics and games where people can try to try to be able to try to things , and see it returns out of the mediately .
Now I &apos;m going to do --
This is a sequence of Fibond , I do with a tiny of equations .
Here we have a word of words that &apos;s half between Scareo and Boble .
And of course , to every realize a literally , a literally , Pratically , Pratically , to every remarkable to be a literally , and while I could try to have a likely , and while he could make words .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new set of letters and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s what the kids came to the Lab , I did it and I did it and I &apos;ve done it and I gave them a video .
They &apos;re very fully places .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of thing about application is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of education .
You only say , &quot; Compons , &quot; and they &apos;re exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s what other people who are trying to do it .
This is our tester tester , there on the right .
It was actually crazy .
They only have the morning .
Now , this is an application of a interactive application .
We wanted to build a type to take a tiny of the languages , and we had to build a type .
It can inseriften new characters in the scene , solve the Siftable .
It can inseriften new characters in the scene , solve the Siftable .
Here &apos;s , we &apos;re doing the sole .
Video : The sole is surprising .
David Merrile : Now he brought a tractor in the scency .
Video : The tractor .
Beless work !
So schooling Siftable and put it to the neighborhood ,
Video : Bau !
And , inventing their history .
Video : I &apos;m going to be .
DM : It &apos;s a story with final open , and it can decide .
DM : It &apos;s a story with final open , and it can decide .
Video : Gola , game .
DM : The last example I have the time to show you is a recently , to wait , to wait , to wait .
It &apos;s a recently , realized , to walk and exejudle and exeiving music .
The Siften here are against sounds like basically , and battery .
Egnature of these has four different variations , and you can choose what it .
You can inserve these source in a sequence from a sequence of your focus .
And ways to make it just touch a &quot; and a sequence . &quot;
These are actually , you can control from vive , as the result , as the result .
It &apos;s a particular sound particular , and then inclines to the way .
And then there are the effects like time and fly , and they wanted to be in the sequence .
Let &apos;s see how it works .
Video : We &apos;re going to start a base in two Siftable , &quot; we &apos;re sequence , &quot; we &apos;re in a series , we extend to , add , we add to the other side .
Now , I put a basis of the basis .
Video : Now , I add to the percussions --
Video : And now I &apos;ll put the battery , so I can control the battery , so I can control the best effect .
Video : I can squencing the intera squence of the time to the time from one to one one to the other .
Video : And I &apos;ll add the phils to the bottom to get more expression .
Video : I can realize the sequence &quot; to the sequence &quot; to the squence . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to be the first , but I can try to improvide , it turns out more cording .
And now , finally , I can sell the intera squence inter in the Siftable to the Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is build new interface , and more like that they work in our brain and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the result of this laboratory , and also some possibility that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that it &apos;s coming to this new generation of objects to interact with media digital media , that will bring information in our world that we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time to talk to all you .
I &apos;m a wrriter .
She wrote books is my profession , of course .
It &apos;s also the love and the phascine .
And I don &apos;t expect that you can change .
But , told this , something particular , it &apos;s happened in my life and in my life , and in my career , who bring the interest with this work .
And the particular thing I recently wrote this book , this book called &quot; Mang , Pull , Pula , Pull what , in my preceds , for some reason my focused in the world and become a great , for some reason in the world and become a great sensationship , and become a great sensationally .
And the result is that everywhere , people are going to me to me as if they were conducted .
Do true -- condanned , conducted .
They &apos;re going to be worried and say , &quot; Don &apos;t you can do you have to do better ?
You don &apos;t have to keep writing to writing for all of life without power , and you can &apos;t have to create a book that can you can &apos;t that anybody ? &quot;
What can you can &apos;t that important ? &quot;
It &apos;s rassicly , you know .
But it could go to the worse , I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I wanted to be a writing adolescent -- I wanted to be a trice .
I was in the same reaction .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you have succeded ?
You don &apos;t have to be able to killing to killing you killed ?
You don &apos;t have to do this myth to do this myself , and you have never out and died on a cumule cumule of all the infranker of all the fallimbing ? &quot;
I mean , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : &quot; Yeah . &quot;
Yes , I have a couple of all things .
I &apos;ve always had a couple .
And I also have a couple of of other things that people could not ind .
As the algae and other things .
But , how much about what I thought I was thinking and I was thinking and I was , and I was , because ?
Is it r.
It &apos;s logic that anybody has to be spavented by a job that you snated to do .
But what &apos;s so particular in the emprize in creative impressing us to the health health is to the other other career than other career &apos;t they do ?
How my father , for example , he was a engineer and I don &apos;t remember one time in his 40 years of activity that the washed to be engineer ?
There was never -- that blowed us to John , like ?
It didn &apos;t work , understand ?
Only , the engineers like group , as group , in the centuries , in the centuries of being alcolized to be colized .
We wrote , we have enough this reputation , and not only creative , but not only creative of every genetic reputation of being an enormous instable instable .
And I don &apos;t realize the trists of the magnific death of the magnific ments , only in the century , death , death , death , death to them .
And the ones that don &apos;t seems to be able to be able to be able to their dams .
Norman Mailer , first of death , in the last interview , &quot; Ogmyself , &quot; Ogmyself a little bit more &quot; , a little bit more &quot; &quot; a little bit more &quot; .
But we don &apos;t bad when we heard these things , because we &apos;ve heard these things that we &apos;ve completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and the soffering and the sounds , and that the art , and that the end up , it will always go to the end .
And the question I want to bring all over today : you &apos;re going to do with this idea ?
It &apos;s good , because it &apos;s also looking at the end of a tiny centire distance to me .
I think it &apos;s odiosa .
And I think it &apos;s pericangerous , I don &apos;t want to see the perpecuate in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encouraging our big ments .
And I &apos;m sure that , in my case -- in my case -- it would be very perhaps to be able to figure out that I was hard to be able to the circle that they &apos;re in my careful reef .
Obecame -- I look at the young , I &apos;m pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I still have about four decadecadecades .
And it &apos;s very likely that whatever write about the world as the work that used to be going to be going to be able to be successful , and it &apos;s going to be successful .
I &apos;m saying , because we &apos;re all more or not here -- it &apos;s probably my big succeeeeeeed to my hand to my hand .
Oh , Gesus , who think .
You know this is the genetic genetic that it &apos;s a person to start to the nine , and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would stop to do this work that we &apos;re going to do this work .
So , the question is becomes , how ?
And so I seems , after many reflective , which the way to work to go to write is to create a psychological construct , okay ?
I &apos;ve got some way to find a sure of safety , which I write , and my natural natural , and my natural natural , and I was trying to get to the year , as I was trying to do it in the way to see through time , and I was trying to find other society to see how to find other society to see if they could have to have ideas and more and more several ideas and more sounds of ideas and more sunder and more several ides and more sently and more safety and more swriting ideds and more and more s
And how to help people creative to create creative people to realize inerents .
And that research has brought to Grex and ancient Rome .
Seguitems because I gave it in the certainly and then back .
In Great Great and Rome -- people don &apos;t seem that creativity becomes drowd , OK ?
It was thinking that creativity was this spirit and they were looking at and that they were to be a few people from a few people from a few people from a few people from distant and knowledge .
The greatest these are called these dots of creativity . &quot;
Soowonderful , created to have a demone that was a re-in-wisdom that &apos;s wisdom .
Rome were the same idea , but they call that kind of spirit , but they were not a body .
The thing is great , because Romans , because Romans were not really thought that a kind of intelligent .
They have a kind of thing was this kind of drive divina that has been able to live literally in the muri of a study , a little bit like the Dobby Dobby Dobby , and that they were able to assister the work of the work is and to model the work of the work .
Here &apos;s that -- that &apos;s the distance of what the distance -- what the distance of what -- that expensive you have to protect you to have your work .
And all they knew that was so that worked , right ?
So , the antianticient artists were protected by certainly , how to be the narcism , no ?
If your work was except , if you can &apos;t take it and all the market , all know they had been helped by this incorporate .
If your work , you know , it wasn &apos;t all the brow , right ?
All they knew that was the genius to be a capable .
And so people are focused to creative creative creativity in Occident for a long time .
And then the Rind came and all changed , and all changed , and naction this big idea ; we put the human universe . And we all have the mistake of the universe , and without left to creatures that they write from the divinity .
This was the main the rational of humanesimum , and people start to think that creativity becomes completely from the ishing .
And for the first time in story , you start to reference this or the first one of the kind of a little bit like a little bit like a person with .
And I have to say , I think it was a big herror .
I think it &apos;s going to put some , a simple person to believe that you can be like a reciplent like the source , and the source of all of my driven , creative , creative , creative , creative , creative , and inknock up to the way to the source of the measure of humanity .
It &apos;s like to ask somebody to income the sole .
Deeat and creates all of these indeed and creates all these these inexpectent .
And I think it was this to realize the artists in the past of 500 years .
And , if that &apos;s true , and I think it &apos;s , and I think it &apos;s , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe to get back to a commodity of relationship between human relationship .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t cell 500 years of thinking about 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience that soldiers would suspect scientific , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to follow people to follow their property .
And I &apos;m not going to convince you all all on this thing .
But the question I &apos;d like to bring is , why ?
Why don &apos;t you think that way ?
Because it has more sense of every other thing that has ever heard to explain the exaspert expensive process of creative process .
One process that , as anything that has ever ever been to do something -- so , you know , all here , you know , you don &apos;t have to be able .
And , in fact , it can be completely paranormal .
I did this met with the extraordinary strake with the extraordinary strake , which has 90 years , but that was a little bit of all life and said that he was a little bit about life and said that it was a little bit of Virginia , and I would feel out in the wind , and I would feel it up to the wind .
He said that it was like a train ,
And that was rolling up to her , and it was wasting .
It &apos;s going to feel , because he was going to be under his soul .
He had to have one thing to do that point and it was , words , and he was , &quot; Dring how a mathor . &quot;
And so it goes up to home and it was intered by this poetry , and it wouldn &apos;t have to make a piece of career and a mathor , as the trape , as the trape , and it &apos;s a page .
And sometimes it could not be faster , so it goes , so corrupt and correct it and correct up through and the home and the lost , and she would continue to rolling through and it would continue to rolling through the landing , and they will continue to rolling through the landscape , and it would continue to rolling through the home . &quot;
Then there were the time -- this piece of the time , I &apos;ll never be -- there were the moments that the squeen ?
So , he was running and he was trying to home and the poetry through , and he was a window , and he was a switch , and then he said , and then he said , and then he said , and then he was like the other hand , and then he was going to home .
He was the poem poem from the car and remainly into its body and transmit on the page .
And in these cases , the poem , it would be presented on the page , but the last word on the last word before .
So when I heard it -- it &apos;s a couple of , it &apos;s exactly to my creative process .
I don &apos;t have my creative process -- I don &apos;t have a conduction .
I &apos;m a move , and my way to work is ; it &apos;s a seeing , and saying , and spend it &apos;s going to be able .
But even in my testardaggine , I met met that , sometimes .
And I can imagine a lot of you .
You know , even if the work and ideas , and ideas they were date to a certain the shark , I could not know it .
And what is this ?
And how can we relationship to do it , you don &apos;t lose the head , but rather , rather , what you do you do ?
And so , I realized , the best example I have is music for the Tom Waits , which I &apos;ve interview , which I interview of a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life is the incarnation of the life is the incarnation of the artist , to control , to control , to control , these kind of interior , these kind of interiorized interiorized .
But then I wondered , and a day as he was driving on a Los Angeles , changed everything to Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
He was wondering and all of a type of melodies , which is going to be wonderful , which is wonderful , elusive and wonderful , elusix , and the lifetime , and the wonderful , and the wonderful , and the wonderful , and the wouldn &apos;t want .
It &apos;s not a piece of career , it has no mathemselves .
So , I started to feel this species of old old , &quot; the site to site , &quot; the site to lossessionate , and he remark up with this song of characters .
I don &apos;t know good enough , I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of wondering , you stop .
And I &apos;m going to get the mental process and fully something new .
Guddle and said , &quot; Scush , &quot; Scush , &quot; Scush , I &apos;m wild ? &quot;
&quot; To you look at that ?
If you really want to be able to get up , you know , you can take me care of you .
All of the most important thing we have another today .
You &apos;ve got to disturbing Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his process , and that &apos;s going to change after this .
Not work , the work was still hard as .
But the process , and the anxy , which was remarkable when the genius , the genius , the genius that had nothing else , and libered it , and liberked up to where it came to the back to where it came out , and realized that it had to be a interior .
But this is , and this wonderful , wonderful , a conversation between Tom and this thing that lost and this thing that it was not Tom .
So I feel that story to change a little bit the way I worked , and I &apos;ve heard it , and save me a time .
This idea , I &apos;m going to writing , I writing , Pula , Ama , and I , &quot; and caddress in one of those of the disperation that we &apos;re working on on something and we can do it , and we can start thinking that will be a disaster , which is going to be the worse .
Not only , the book , just the book book .
And I started thinking about geting this project .
But then I remember Tom that works to the air and you try to the air and try .
So I went to my face in the hoscrited and drive my host and drawings my hand , my hand .
And I said to go to voices , &quot; Sends , what we know , if this book , you know , you will not be interested in my , no longer , no interested in my , no longer ?
Because as I see , I &apos;m saying everything I have , I don &apos;t have much more than this .
So if you want you to be better , you have to be , and do your part .
Okay . But if you don &apos;t , you know what , you don &apos;t have to anything .
I &apos;m going to writing the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to do that I recorded that I today I &apos;ve been to do my part , &quot; because I &apos;m going to end up , OK -- in the end of the North Africa &apos;s in the North Africa people were running to the window of the dances of a lauthor and sacross the alba .
And they were always magnific , because the balleries and they were fantastic .
But every long , I realized , something happened , and one of these artists become transclass .
And I know what you know what , because I know you have , because I know you have all , a performance .
It was like the time , and the walking , and the ballery wasn through a kind of brought , and it wouldn &apos;t do anything about the 1,000 night , but all of it was all .
And in the improvides , not just as a human .
But you access from the drive , and sunder the end of the divinity .
And when this happened , you know , the time , people knew what was , they call it the name .
They were the hands and started song , and they started song , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , Dod , God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curiosa night , when Mory invasoled the south of Span , preserved this habitude , and the record to the centuries of Allah , Allah , Allalalah , Allah , Allalah , and you can feel in the flow in the shock .
In Spain , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , , and , Allah , and , I realize , I realize , except , except , except , except of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need .
But , the problem is coming up , and then the day , for the same , when you wait and wait , and I write it &apos;s 11 morning , and I wrote it &apos;s not more .
It &apos;s just a bad with a mal with ginocy , and maybe you can &apos;t have to ascare to ascening to the tree .
And maybe no one will be the name of Dod , and what we have to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most powerful remarkable to do in a creative life .
But maybe not to make it so angerous if you can &apos;t believe , anzites , which is extraordinary extraordinary , which is extraordinary to be from you .
But crete that you &apos;re just going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be past to what you have to past anything when you get another when you get .
And , you know , if we think in this way .
And so I started thinking , and it &apos;s sure as I thought I &apos;m sure for different months in the book that published in the book that I will realize , the perangerous , the perangerous , and so exissue of my great great great success .
And what I have to continue to say when I feel electried to me to say , you don &apos;t have .
Not waiting . It &apos;s just your work .
Continua represented for your part , whatever you can be .
If your work is balling , you know .
If the divine , I &apos;m going to ask you decide to leave some kind of wonderful wonderful , for a moment through your forests , then you know , &quot; Ole ! &quot;
All of the same dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot;
I think I think I think I think I can teach it .
&quot; Ole ! &quot;
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Good !
As you &apos;ve talked about some of these things on the genome , what can meat and on the new set of new set , and on the new set of genes .
Now we &apos;re starting to a new percoral : we started to digitalize biology and now to talk about that code we &apos;re going to get into a new new phase of biology , design and synthesis , designing and synthreat and synthreat .
We always tried to bring great questions .
&quot; What &apos;s life ? &quot;
We &apos;ve tried to get different approach , reduced us to the minimes .
We &apos;re digitaliking from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the genome of the human genome , we were going to past from the world .
Now , we ask : We can regenerate our life , or create new life ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the kind of smallpox , which can autorous , which can autorum in laboratory .
And we tried to reduce the genome of creating a little bit more .
We &apos;re able to eliminate a hundred of of about 500 that are here .
But when we have a hundred to put it , it &apos;s relatively , it &apos;s relatively to our .
Credes , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes we can , one to the time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this can bring to a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to design this is to synthree-like to stand to stop components to make components to bring some of these questions to bring some of these questions .
And so we started the wind &quot; Poss we can leave a chromosome ? &quot;
It can be able to containing these big molecules that we never have to create before ?
And in case , in case , we can do it a crazy ?
A chromosome is simply a piece of chemical material .
The speech we &apos;re able to digitalize life is growing up to the exponential life is growing .
Our capability to write the genetic code , instead , and it &apos;s pretty much lently , but it &apos;s better .
And our most recently returned to the landscape on the exponential .
We started to start more than 15 years ago .
The process has required a lot of past , beginning with a revision revision before that we start the first experiments .
But we found that synthesis that synthesis .
There are all of thousands of thousands of machines to the world that are all all kinds of DNA , long-lect-lect-regenerative process : the segment is longer , more running , more running , there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these framments and read the herrors .
And this was our first tentle , to talk about the first tentle of the genome of the genome of Phi &apos;s 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that killed batteratteries .
We designed the framments , actually , effectively the reaction of herrors and a molecule of about 5,000 letters .
And the interesting thing is when we took this piece of chemical material , and we have insert in the batteries , the bacteria , the bacteria , and they started to read this code , and produced them to make them .
And viral particles are then you reat the cells , they &apos;re coming back and they have destroy to the E.
I &apos;ve talked about recently members of the oil industry .
They have rex more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build his same way to be build in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the bigger things .
We wanted to build the whole class of the bacterium .
They &apos;re more than 580 myself to code .
So we thought about the casses of virus , so that we could change the casses to figure out what the casses of a cell phone of the living components of a living cell .
The program is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequency this genome for the first time in 1995 the time in 1995 the type of the standard .
We found that , resequency , 30 herrors . If we had that sequence that sequence that sequence we never have to do that .
One of the process is designing to realize 50 lecters that you soved with all the other segment to build up with all the other segents of 50 letters that work together .
We can see it up here .
You probably have you lect to us us to figure .
And so , I think that we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , Good , Good and T.
Tre those letters together , and they climbed about 20 love , and there &apos;s one specific remember for every love to letters .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , swites .
What we &apos;ve done is the beginning was to do it .
Some were used to the fact that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
We designed these segments to simply them to simply .
There are the entire entire them and put them and put them .
And we started to assembling , starting with segments from five to seven mile , unendly sunendly , unendly to stand to them to stop 24 ments , and then it all the way to get 72 mile .
At every past these seat , we &apos;ve produced these sequency so we &apos;re going to see them to be able to create a robustot of the robustot -- like you will see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatizing the process .
So , this seems to the tabellone of a basket .
When we go to these very long segment , more than 100 midle , more than 100 midle , they don &apos;t grow in E. .
It &apos;s going to get the limits of modern biology .
So we &apos;ve been able to other meccanism .
We had another mechanism called recognizes , which is in biology , which in biology to repect the DNA degree to reach the DNA degrees .
Here &apos;s a example .
This organism , called Deinoccurs in the Deinoccurs , can make three million running rate .
You can see in the rest of superior as his craft crowd .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s exactly like before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able able to do it .
These organisms can be completely .
They can live under .
They &apos;re absolutely , that life in space , and you can find new environment of water .
ASA , NASA has shown that this is .
This is a molecule of molecule we have built these processes , just using the lievening with the design appropriate design to insert .
The lievening them to the authumatically .
This is not been taken with a electronic microscope , but with a microscope , but with a rule microscope .
It &apos;s a great great , we can see it with a test microscope .
These are photographs that they have a time of about six seconds .
This is the publishing we did it .
They &apos;re more than 580,000 letters of code .
It &apos;s the bigger of a definitely definitely , we ever created by the man .
It has a fish molecular spot in 300 million .
If we stamp it up with a 10 pattern , they would like 10 to translate this code .
Now , how do we do it ?
Of course , , we &apos;re a virus is a little girls .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when they use batteratteries .
It &apos;s simple when it &apos;s cell when it &apos;s cell photos as our : you can just extract the nucleo and inseriously , which is prately the clonto , which is practice .
In the herself , the cell cell is investimated by the cell , but we recently degree , but we recently degree to do a type of a cell phone from one another and activity .
We can refull a tomosome of a microbial species .
The two are different than the men .
We &apos;ve added some gene in the way to decide what you can decide what it to chromosome .
The one of then is to killed with the entire entire all the proteins .
And when we put in the cells is studied , and you &apos;re going to precise our graphopefully -- the new cell physics -- the new cell phone to the cell .
And we started to think we couldn &apos;t go three , but we tried to go to the lack .
This is one of the major of evolution .
We found that that tants that tants have added a second or third or a third of a few of a few of them , address in a thousands of new acts .
So who think about evolution as a only kind of a kind of gene , it has no gran of biology .
There &apos;s the entire entire entire entire entire fy remarkable to be digering the DNA .
The cromosome that was in cells .
The cell phone &apos;s cell phone we have inserit--tail-tail-tail-tail-tail-tail-tail-tail-tail-tail-tail-tail-tail-tail-tail-tail-taken cellent cellent .
It &apos;s expressed , and it has been expressed the other chromosome as extraneo , and we &apos;ve got to only , and we have to only cells and the new cell and the new cell and the new cell .
It &apos;s became blue , because of the genes we have insert .
And in a short of time , all the carteristics of a species are going to be lost , and it turned out of a new species , based on the software we inseriously in cells .
All protected the proteins are changed , and when we realized the genetic code , what we transfer to what we transfer .
Now , this could seemy , but as a genetic software DNA to be DNA , we can change the software .
Now , I &apos;ve been explained that here is not talking about genius -- but I have to talk about three million years and a half million years and a half million years and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the exhibition that they will be able to create new species on this process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s enough when we think about our needs .
We &apos;re going to pass from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Got for example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one in 1946 , in 1946 , there will be four .
We &apos;re doing fresh problems , fresh , water , and pulites , medicinal , medicinal , and half billion people .
It &apos;s still more drive to do this for nine billion .
We &apos;re going to talk about five billion carbon , more than 30 billion barries of the ololium .
That means millions of barili to the day .
When we try to find biological processes , or whatever you have to replaces to replaces , it will be a huge challenge .
In the most we have to cont the emission of CO2 from CO2 from these materials that finding and in the atmosphere .
At the world , thanks to discovered scientific discovered all the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that they &apos;re designed for the future .
The electronic industry only one dozen , and about components , and think about how many different things are out .
We have the limitations here are the biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have technique , thanks , thanks of synthetization , able to create what we call the genome we call the combinatory .
We &apos;re able to build a big robots that can producing a million cromosoms to the day .
Think of these 20 million different different different different different , or of different genes or to get the processing processes to make a little bit of the drugs , new vaccines , and new vaccines , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more science .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for possibility of survive , and it production , or of carbon , and a vaccineating , and vaccines .
This is an anea of some software , we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to seem and design species to the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know what we need to be .
We know what we know , what they &apos;re doing .
Now we &apos;re focusing on the carbon of how quarter generation .
You &apos;ve seen you see that you extract from the ground of the ground was a mal finite .
We have carbon second and third generation that they use enough to the bird of the hurt , as the full they get or different kinds of butankle .
But the only way the only way the biology can have a big impact without the food of food and limiting the food and limiting the food of food and limiting the cell of the food , we &apos;re working to design cells that can make the practice that can add the first time , and we could make this cell , and we could have the first carbon of 18 months .
The solar solar combined with CO2 is a medoor -- but in our discovered in all the world , we found different metods .
This is a organism we have described in 1996 .
It &apos;s in the deep ocean , about 2500 feet of the water , at the time of the water .
It &apos;s going to put out from CO2 , using idrogen as a source of energy .
We &apos;re trying to figure out , if we can incancer CO2 , which can be transported to the CO2 in carbon , to driving that .
So we think we could be able to be able to be able to humently what the question is , &quot; that the question of , &quot; that is the life , we have the modest of replaces to replacing the whole thing to replaces .
Exacactly . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can you do ?
It would be a main the fourth of energy .
All , we &apos;re working to use the same measure of creating vaccines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with influence , we &apos;re always back to a year and with a dollar in less when you &apos;re going to find the wind .
I think what you can change in the anticipate binable in anticipate .
Here &apos;s how the future could start changing , now , the tree , the tree of evolution , accelerating the batteries of the synthesis , and , and finally cells .
We &apos;re going to be able to best people .
Our purpose is to make a long time . Thank you very much much . Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
I &apos;ll do all you can do , the most of the most of the most of the new technology we have brought to Microsoft in the Microsoft in the following up to a year ago .
It &apos;s a environment that you can interact with local level that recompared with an enormous amount of data .
Here we &apos;re seeing a lot of photographed by a photographed with a kind of swoom , and it , to a squick , to a site , direction , and it &apos;s saying , as we want .
And it &apos;s not how much big amount of information we see , how much these are great .
Most of the photographs are common , but this is a scanning of the Biliotected Biliotected by Congress , and reentrepreneurs in 300 gapixel .
It doesn &apos;t have a difference because the only thing that limit to the only one of a system like this is the number of the pxel on your screen in any moment .
This is a whole book , of data , not imagined .
This is Casolate Dickens . Every colonname a capitable capitable .
And to show you that it &apos;s just about text and not images , we can do a thing , to see , to see that it &apos;s a representation of the heads , not a representation of a photograph .
It could be a little bit of a little artificial to read a book to read a book .
You don &apos;t consider it .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s a number of Guardian .
Every big picture is the beginning of a seeing .
And it really &apos;s the pleasure and beautiful experience to read the version of a revist , which is for a dying , which is for nature , which is for nature a lot of medical medical .
We also did something with the angle of this number of this particular in particular ,
We created a fasull , we created a resolution -- much more along than that it &apos;s used in a normal published you to have contained to the containment .
If you want to see the careon this audience , you can see here .
Or other model , or even specific techniques .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space space on the screen .
We hope that this means to the pop-running , and other hand other hand other hand , they should not have to be necessary .
Naturally , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this wasn &apos;t going to tell you that we have to contribution to drive it in this camp .
These are all the streets in the U.S. .
So now we go to the other thing else .
This is actually , it &apos;s actually , from the website ; you can see it .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which is two different different technologies .
A is Seady and the other is a very interesting research on the computer very interesting search from Noah Snavaged , one of the University Washington , with the U.S. Seitz of U.S. &quot;
And it &apos;s from the website , gently .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can past from another one of the other and have this kind of experience , and have this kind of experience .
But the location of pictures here has actually a meaning .
The goritms of visualization have recorded these images together , so that correspond to the record to the recordate that records to the read , all the neighbed to the lages that the Montontent of the Mound-f-de-sta-sea-slide -- you &apos;re seeing . There are all the elements of the respected , and these things are all the things you in the landscape .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;ve got time to show you some other environment .
There are some more space .
I want to past directly to one of the original set of Noahydrink -- and this provide from Photosynth that we &apos;ve done for the first time , we &apos;ve done for the first time , to show what the first time , that I really really really record to be the technology , Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily the technology , and it &apos;s not not not just to watch the website .
We had to worry about the legals and saying .
This is a rebuilt of the Cedring of Noththree Dame images Flickr . Bades digiting Nothrow , and you can imagine in magnews , and you can imagine , and saying . Ognature . Egnal one of these represents , and saying . Egns one of these are discovered to this model .
So I &apos;ve got all pictures from Flickr and you &apos;ve got all college in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this way .
You know , I &apos;d never thought to end up to work for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratiffying this kind of realizing here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different kinds of different kinds of focus : from those of the cellularly cell physical cellularly , a meaning , a number of myself .
And if I can try , I try to try to those more strange .
Many are blowed by doing , etera .
Some of the photographs here , and it .
This is a Noth3 Dame recorrect .
We can past from the physics of this environment .
The essential point is we can do with social environment . This is taking data from the collective of how to help the mainly , from the hundred of visual view -- and all those data together .
All of those are become colleagues , most of the parts .
You have a term of the interest that emerge .
Think about this as a prolgment of the work of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It &apos;s something that growth in complexity , that people use it , and the vantages that people use it for uses to use it .
They &apos;re marcrowed with metadhing , and they &apos;re saying .
If somebody is the idea of contrast all these saying , my name , my photographs of the host of Noththrow , and the way of all those data , and the can use of all these data , and the post-foot , and I can use the point of the meeting of the meeting of the meeting of the universe , and have a hospital experience of the hossuser and hed a hossuser .
Naturally , a consequence of all of this is virtual model of every interesting part of the land , and slightly , and satellite , and by imagined , and satellite , but from the collective of memory , but from the collective of the collective .
Thank you very much .
CA : I realized I understand ? What your software that your software to do is that , in the next years , all the photographs , all the photographs of the world will be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it ?
BA : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is doing is to practical .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , you want , you want to be ,
And it &apos;s doing it in the contains of pictures .
And what &apos;s a very interesting thing if you think about recheck of the simple of the simple simple that many of these images .
As when you &apos;re doing a picture of images on the web , you get a site , and the page on the web on the web of picture .
Now , what if you have to all your photographed to all your photographs ?
So , the amount of interconnection and quantity and quantity of recycle that it &apos;s really huge . It &apos;s a classical effect of the site .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really amazing .
BA : You &apos;re going to be very much .
One of the main the mainly pleases when you travels and the power of the neethography , who has no directions of the traditions , between the south , the past of the south , the soul of the plants in the room , you &apos;re going to slow up with the room .
Baste thinking that sciamans Jaguar , and the Via Lattea , or that &apos;s Mitites , or that &apos;s the Inuit are still still cold to me , or in Himalaya , the buddd-up , budd-replaces , to remember the important idea of Dharm , and that the idea of the idea that the idea that we live in the idea that we live in the idea that we live in the world that we live in the world , but it &apos;s just a very much , but it &apos;s actually , but it &apos;s actually a very much of a construction ,
conset of a particular set of scowever , our stirpe is actually , or a mal , or a mal , many generations ago .
And , of course , all we share of the essential .
All we all all all we do .
We &apos;re saying to the beginning of start .
We have to free the inesority of death , so we don &apos;t surprising it if we &apos;re and balliving --
We all have a hundred .
What &apos;s the hydropped is the rhythm of canzon , the rhydrink of every culture .
It &apos;s not going to be the Worneo of the Borneo , or the following Voodoo , or the window of Haiti , or the Kenya Kenya settled in Kenya , or a mellives in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my company in the journey of visual journey in the value of yak in the value of the window of the Everest , demonstrate in the world .
All these populations are teaching us that are other ways to be able to think , other ways of thinking , other ways of move in the world .
And , if you reflected a active , it &apos;s a concept that can give you .
And , the myric of cultures of the world are a girls of life spiritual life and cultural that has the planet and it &apos;s important for the planet as a little bit of the planet as a whole biological night to the planet as a hosphere .
And you can think about this cultural girl as a nosphernosphere and you can defined the etnosphere , and you can see the eye of all the concepts , and intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions .
The throw is the fantastic patrimp of humanity .
It &apos;s the simple of what we are and what we can be in how much inquisitive .
And because the biosphere was a biosphere was succeeded to the ethnosphere and purther .
Nobody &apos;s a biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all the species is on the orror of the simply , because it &apos;s fully , and in the most of different biological different biological of biological different countries -- and you don &apos;t even even even even more than the most standing of the most timistic than the most option-hypothesis .
The whole thing is , of all , of course , the lost linguistic .
When you were noved 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not only composed by a voynammine or a type of rules .
A language is the spray of the spirit .
It &apos;s the measure with which animal or animal world .
Every language is a forest , a forest , a tiny , a type of the mind , a type of possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re sitting in Monterey , at least half the hundreds .
They don &apos;t have more teached to children , which means , you don &apos;t have something that are dead .
What &apos;s more trists of the being free , you know , the last one , of being the last last to talk a lingua , of the wind , not way to translation the wisdom of the window of the fire ?
This is coming up with a few weeks , I &apos;ve been in some of all two weeks : every two weeks and a bang , and a suncle of the tomba .
And I know you will tell you , &quot; Is it better ?
The world would not be a better place if we go to the same language ? &quot;
Let &apos;s go .
You &apos;ll prise you &apos;ll take a tract thing to say , not to talk about your language .
Today , I &apos;d like to do a journey ,
a little journey in the ethnosphere to give you a little bit of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us dimental dimentate that when I say , &quot; different ways of exists to be able to exists .
Let &apos;s take for example , Barasan , in Amazony , the population of the anaconda , which crew to the myself to try to try to get out of the latest west sacrop of the sacrates of spend .
It &apos;s a population that &apos;s not able to distinguished the blue of the blue , because the time , you &apos;re drifying in time , where the forest , where it &apos;s dependent .
They have a strange linguious , and a mathor , details , &quot; exogamia , &quot; you have to put one person who talks about a person who talks about a different language .
And all has been taken in the mitological past , yet the particular arity is that in these family , you &apos;re talking or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven or lingudemistates no one language .
They get to the listening and then they start to talk .
Let &apos;s take one of the most interesting tribes with what I lived , Waoran Ecuador of Ecuador , a incredible population , a incredible population , a incredibly population in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionarly have a type of fact ,
They did it takes the photographs that they read them in pose , and they had been returned out that population , dimenting that population of pluvial forests .
They have been taken by the ground , they have to the research of a shape or a shape , they have concluses that they were going to be able to be able to the full , and they killed the five means with the lance .
But Waoran don &apos;t only killed the strange .
They killed them to them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused to them .
We have rised to either generations and we found two cases of death , and when we have insisted that one of them was invected that one of them was invecting , and then they have a told of them , and then they killed it . &#91; &#91; Ad every way , they had a knowledge of an amazing knowledge .
The browds were able to recognize the urina animal to be 40 pass and recognize it .
In the first years , &apos; 80 , I was asked a very interesting compiece when my professor of Haiti of Haiti to me , and I wanted to go to Haiti to intrack the base of Dualier and the power of Dualier and Tonton Macauns , and I impressed me to do the wind to use the watch to do the watch to do .
And to give a sense to my told , I should have to buy the Vodoun culture , and that Voodoo is not magnine .
It &apos;s pretty much more vision of a medium physics of the world .
Many interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the big religions of the world , what you would have ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , except .
A continent is always left out , thinking that Africa Africa , and I think that Africa is not a religious meeting . And I think , and the Voodoo is another that distilled by these religious concepts of these religious religious deep on .
What makes the voodoo is the voodoo is the intense between life and morning .
So , vive you &apos;re going to be the spirites .
And the spiritues can be invoccurred by Great , and they say to the dance and sushed to the dance and sushed anima tal way that for a short that for a short deal .
So this is the woodooists , &quot; You can go to the wonderful God .
We go to the time , and we &apos;re going to go . &quot;
And what you can &apos;t sitting , is the spirit you , you can you do you , you can you do you do you do you have to the mal ?
So you have to these incredible events : followed the woodoo in the time that touches have a little bit of the points of the power of the mind when it &apos;s living in one one of the mind when it is catalycle .
Two all the popules with which I lived the most extraordinary people are the Kogi of Siar Nevada Santa Marta , in Colombia , in Colombia setary seping .
It &apos;s going to make tyrange of civilization planets that had living on the planet &apos;s type of the Colombia , the population of conquicting vulous massicrock that song on the planture .
In a drug of sangue , this population has never been conquicted by the spagnine .
And yet today are government by a clero , but their formation is decided to be extraordinary .
The young people are brought out of the family three or four years , and they live in a bombrown in a bombrobust in capability to the base of the hydrink to 18 years .
Two periods of nine years , and we have been to reproduced the nine months of gestation that transformed in the last year of the Great My .
So , this time , they are acculated to values to their society , values that their predict and only their predict , and only their predict , or for the equilium -- or for better than the equilibrio to say , or for the equilished the equilished to say .
At termine , of this incredible initiation , they &apos;re improvideing out and for the first time in their own , at 18 years , see a high . And in that activity of the first best , when the solution , when the solution of the first bunch , all that has learning in theories , all that have learned in the remarkable to be conscience . The precient time , and says : : &quot; Hought a foreign , and says : : &quot;
&quot; Do you ? Proprise you .
It &apos;s just . Now , I &apos;m going to protect it . &quot;
They call the most people and say that we say , the brothers , we are the brothers , we are the brothers ,
This is extremely important .
When we think about the populations and indeed with the environment , and the old story of the noble history of the noble history , which is a regiven concept , and say , we say , these are more closer to us to the Earth of us .
The populations are not sentimate senior , nereas from the nostalking about nostalking .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the palures of the Are vent in the wind vents of the Tibet , but thanks , you know , they have created a mistic war &apos;t concept about the Earth , and you know , the concept of the Earth , the concept that the Earth can only be living in the realize that Earth can live in the conscience that the consciousness .
What does that mean ?
And I mean that a girls that a girls that grows that the mountain is a rest of Apu that will be a fountain is going to be a foundly different , and it will be a fountain the mountain the mountaining a little bit of the Montan that has growing a little girls that growth is a full of the Mountains of a rocer rocket of mountainly , you have to be scared .
What the dimour is dimmmust be refing is irrifying .
What &apos;s interesting is the measure is the metaphor that we call the individual and the world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia credrowd , they were able to be cut for being cut for being cut .
And what I realized is a human human being saying , my friends Kwautl that creates the forests that the forests are dimour dimour dimour of paradiments and the song of the paradies that they live in the world , explained the world , explaining the Hamattend to the Hamattend .
If you start to start that these cultures can create actually , you can start to make a different way , you can start to buying some of them .
I &apos;ve taken this photographed in Amazony .
Mayahuge some of you have to talk about the eye , the most powerful psychoad of the repertent .
What makes it fascinating the yahuge is not the potential points of sustaining , but his elaboration . It &apos;s two elements .
From a llllled , this lian lian hydropped a series of mine , literally , literally , literally .
And I can do the solution has a burning ban build that altera little bit the conscience , but it &apos;s myscotry with the house hundred of the family of the hundred of the hundred .
This planet &apos;s tyld-triptamines , very similar to serve , methoyltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryptamp .
If you never see Yanomami , you &apos;ll see the type that they do a different set of species , anched , it contising methoxyltrylyltryltryltrylyptams .
Tiring that policy on for the no is a little bit like being spared by a little bit like being spared by a drop of the meeting of electricity . &#91; &#91; Risn &apos;t creates a distort of reality .
I had often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who wrote the psychetry , with his discovered was psychetry , with his discovered in Mexico .
Second my text , you can &apos;t classidying these triptames like hallucinogenes because if you &apos;re doing no one of being . &#91; &#91; &#91; &#91; Roday . &#91; &#91; &#91; &#91; Rathemselves can &apos;t be absolute , because they &apos;re involved because they are atural to be , because they &apos;re of the entertained to , deed with a entire , deal with .
It &apos;s possible to the orbit about if you spend , and sushing the MAO .
Now , it &apos;s beautiful : Or carbon that they have in this lian inibitors of MAO , the same kind of needs to the triptames . The question of the extensive . The question : in one of 80,000 species of places , like these are , like these are not , as these are going to be able , but if you can &apos;t be able , but if you think about this way , you know , that &apos;s a hochemical track of the parts ?
We use the big euphemism of the herror , which can reveal infruker .
But if we ask to the Indians , they &apos;ll say , &quot; The older . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribes , Cofan , Cofan , 17 variety , who distinguashubly in the forest , and that you have our eyes would be in the same species .
If you ask them how they say they say , &quot; I would realize us , &quot; I was able to say , &quot; I wouldn &apos;t you know , you don &apos;t know ? &quot; I have response ? &quot; I have response . &quot;
The solution is : you get 17 variety in a night of lllots and each each each each other .
With this doesn &apos;t have laureaureduced to Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than context that context the stami .
Now , &#91; &#91; &#91; &#91; &#91; &#91; &#91; &#91; &#91; the problem is that also the people who have heart the population of the people who have been pitting them , but in some way you have a few days of the history , and past three .
In fact , the X-century , between 300 years , it will not remember or the source of source , but it &apos;s pretty ty much of technological technological , but rather as the was where we stopped and active active active , and we put active the tent of biological different biological source of different biological sure and cultural planet .
All cultures through centuries are involved in a new possibility of life .
And the problem is not technology .
Girl Sioux Sioux , they don &apos;t have to be Sioux when they have been hold by the American American American American American American , when they put it from the horse and hot .
It &apos;s not change or technology that are integrity .
The wall of the domination .
And if you look at the world , you &apos;ll find that these are not destiny culture .
They &apos;re creatures and dynamics out of the existence that they have been able to be able to be able to adaptment .
And that &apos;s what it &apos;s going to be welling in the patria --
a nometimes of Sarawak , in the south of the south of the south of the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to the reduced up and next to the rest of the restrack and the next reduck , where you can see the challenge that seems to bring up up to the Merasian , where the Maake Cininesternavinate Merian , where the Davinative , where the inzavinate the horines the Davinate the site of the horite of the Masian , where ,
I remember the stion with the sleep with the sleep .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that are the disease of the golden .
If we &apos;re going to put on the mountains of the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of political domination .
As you know the genocide , the physics of a population , is conducted to the universal , but the network , the notion of life , not only conduction , but not only conduction , but not only condannect , but not only condants of developed developed in the development of development .
And you can &apos;t understand the soil of Tibet , because you don &apos;t have the beginning .
I lost the 6,000 miles from Chengineering in Chindental China , came to the Tibet , came to Lhasa with a college , but only only came to Lhasa , but only came to Lhasa , but only the statistics of the window that we feel .
6,000 mountains sacrates in policy and centers .
1.2 million people killed the military revolution in the Cultural revolution .
The father of this girl was ascrited to Panchen Lama .
The thing that &apos;s been killed to say that it was killed to the Chinese invasion .
House is figure out with Sanity in Sanity during the world in Nepal .
Soumm was imprisoned and his column .
It was brought to the age of two years , and the age of two years labor because it wouldn &apos;t have to live in her because it wouldn &apos;t have to live in him .
The experience , which has done the same , it was mitted in reeducation .
A day has inaved a day has been seven pull a raffering , and for this transgression , and to this transgression , it was mitted to seven years .
The pain of Tibet can be insophistory , but it &apos;s reduction of the population is to told .
And then , all of , all of it .
We want to live in the world &apos;s monoys or to be able to account the world or we want to account the world ?
The great anthropology of Margaret Mead , before we died her bigger , in our holding to this vision , not only see the world , we &apos;re not only going to see the whole gamma of humanity , and we &apos;re seeing the whole gamma of thinking , but a day , a day , but a day , a day , but a day , a day , we &apos;re seeing to the way that they were able to be able other possibilities .
And it &apos;s billion remember that our species is existing for 60,000 years .
The Rivolution Rivolution , which has dated the agriculture , which has done us us to the cult of the seem , and sushing the spread of the clero , creating the class of specialization , creating the class of specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world industrialized world has been 300 years .
And that &apos;s history , I don &apos;t realized me that we have the answer to all the challenges that we have to get in the millenished to come .
When I put these hyries of cultures of the world is to say what to be to say to be humans , respond to 10,000 voices .
And it &apos;s in these answering that we all realize the possibility of being what we &apos;re : a kind of consciousness , which has to do people that all the people and all the people and all the people and all all the people are all the people and all the way we have big moments .
I &apos;ve taken this picture on the north of the isola Baffin , when I went to the wonderful cacross , and this man , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , and he told me the wonderful story of his none .
The government has been not always a tle with the Inuit , and in the &apos; 50 to stabilier to stabilier to stake them in colonies .
The name of this man has refed to go .
And the family , though , I brought all the arms , and all his own own , and all his told .
You know that the Inuit &apos;s not the cold , they don &apos;t have the cold ,
The packs of the slites were made of fish slites .
The name of this man &apos;s a type of night , or you know , or the typical , or from the blizing .
It &apos;s saying , you &apos;re calculated , you &apos;re calculated in the puring of foca and defoca , when they &apos;re conged , they &apos;re conged , the work , they work , they work , they work , and they work on a lama .
It was soughly salive on the top of this college , and when they came up , and when they came up , and when I solid , and he knew a dog .
Ha schools , and created a bridge , with casses , with the casses , he has immedied another song , and it &apos;s song , and it &apos;s song on the bancha , college of the class .
We want to talk about cavarsela ? &#91; &#91; Rish . And this , in different ways , &#91; Applauses , &#91; Applauses of the population of the population of the population of the world .
In the government , 1999 , the government has reduced the Inuit &apos;s control of a larger area of California and Texas of the California and Texas together .
It &apos;s their new patria . It &apos;s called Nunavager .
It &apos;s a territoryum . They &apos;re all all the resources of the mineraries .
One of the example of how a national example of how a national national records with his population .
And , to finish , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious , and you have been in these hundred of the planet , makes it not remote remote .
For somebody &apos;s home .
They represented the human imagination , that sounds are at the time . And for all these kids , all of these children , as our children , as our children , become part of our children , become part of the hope .
For finish , we &apos;re going to be convints that political political political arrivers that political political .
We believe that polemies --
&#91; Applauses , they don &apos;t have lost , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we have the best stories of the world , and maybe we have the best stories of the world . Every month , our remember 35 million living .
156 countries have been saying our televisive .
We &apos;re revistates to millions of people .
Our work is to traveling in the ethnosphere to bring our public remarkable to be able to reach our own own hope , and they have seen , and they sope , and they &apos;re going to get , and they &apos;re going to get a central result of the way of the world , and we have to find a focus in the different pluralyses , and we have to find a hydrultural world and multicultural life in the world to be a multural life in the sity and multicultural meal .
which is the wisdom of all people can contribution to our collective well-being collective .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope , and I &apos;m going to have to feel some college , in case , in case , in case , in case , in case , in case , in case , in case , in case , in case , and I &apos;m going to talk about the book that I wrote and I &apos;m going to talk about the book that book , and I &apos;m going to talk about some things that book ,
I &apos;d like to start with what I call &quot; the dogm . &quot;
The dogm is official to what ?
The dogm of all society of all society , the dental dogma official . &quot; If we want to myzes the window of our citizens of our individual citizens . &quot;
And the reason , from a late , in fact that liberty is in the same time , it &apos;s precise , useful , useful , useful , for humans .
And in fact that if we &apos;re libest , each of us , each of us can get to the way to do everything that must be , without one that decide in name our well-being , no one that decide in name our .
The way to myzing liberty is to myzing the choice .
And the people have , more liberate , and most liberty , and most liberty , most liberty , most of them is their well-being .
This , I go , it &apos;s so deeply radicted in society that no one would dreams to put it in the society that nobody .
And it &apos;s also deeply radicated in our lives .
I &apos;ll show you some examples of what the progress has possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly .
I hope a simple note to the condition .
In my supermarket , there are 175 , and without context the 10 various age of oil . And the 12 acetes of oil . And the 12 acectic acecame a huge number of condent remarkable condent in the rescient resive that any of the reduction that no one of your degrees .
Here &apos;s the supermarket .
Then you go to the neighbor to buy a stereo : you case , and lector , wait , radio , radio , radio , huge , love .
And in this single neighbor of electronents , there &apos;s a big number of components .
We can do six million different combinations of different combinations that there are in a neighborhood .
You can move that there is a lot of scoke .
Alome weless : the world of communications .
And once , when I was a child , they could get all the serve phone of the desiders , and puts , and puts from mamma Bell .
And it was name the phone , they didn &apos;t buy it .
One consequence of what , was that the phone , it was never .
These are used .
Now we have a variety variety of phone , specially between cellularly cellularly .
Here &apos;s the future .
My preferred is what in the middle , lector , type of the name , and forts for the cell crowd .
If you don &apos;t see in the home , you &apos;re seen in the home , you &apos;re going to be reverse .
And what happens is that people are in the nearly and does this question is the answer ?
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cellphone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
So , in other expected life that are much more important than the treatment , you know , the same plosyific .
Assistence : She &apos;s going to be in the United States that you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and say , &quot; OK , &quot; OK , we could do it , &quot; As these , &quot; As these walking and these risks , &quot; As these wooks . What do you want ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Dr. &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A has these benefits , and these risks , and these risks . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you remember , &quot; Dr. &quot; Dr. &quot;
And the doctor : &quot; But I don &apos;t have . &quot;
The result to the result we call it &quot; autonomy , &quot; expression that does a beautiful thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not a pattern and responsibility to make decisions of decisions that you know , you know , whether one else you don &apos;t know -- and whatever you know , it &apos;s not -- and so much of course , and so it doesn &apos;t know , and so in the way to make a true of the paper .
There &apos;s a huge marketing , a huge marketing , direct to people like me and you , which you think about it , if you don &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why do you have them , why do you have them ?
The answer is that they want to be called the doctor for the doctor for the region .
Something so that we &apos;re going to be a drive to be a scoice , like you see in this jobs , like you see in this gake , &quot; We don &apos;t want to force the children . &quot; It will not be a more identity : we don &apos;t want to be more identity : we have to invented .
And we can reinvented us us .
The means that every morning , to sweet , you have to decide that kind of person want to be .
And I said to the family and mathor , a time , a time , a time , a time , and squeet , it was that you could have the most possible , and they started to figure out the most possible , and they started to figure .
The only vera was with who was with who , you don &apos;t even when , you know what to do after .
Egiday , all of it &apos;s really to play .
And I seat students very intelligent students , and I have the 20 percent of work in less than a time .
And because they don &apos;t have brilliant , because they don &apos;t have because they &apos;re not died .
Because I &apos;m impensive , I mean , I mean , &quot; I would have to site , &quot; I would you have to do it ? &quot;
&quot; Do I would have to put it ? I have to think before you &apos;ve got to figure ? &quot;
They &apos;re interrogoring logorants .
And they &apos;re trying to answer these questions , even if this implement is not to told the company that seat , and not get a beautiful voto my exame .
And they have to do it . I &apos;m important to do .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , as Carl , because technology we lose to work every day , every day , every day , every day , from Hotel Randolph .
And I &apos;m talking about , there &apos;s a angoline , and I &apos;ll not tell anybody , where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t have it , because I want to use it .
What means , this incredible liberty of choice that we have to have to be able to work ? It &apos;s going to continue , if we have to work or not .
We can go to the board to the board , with the cell phone in a task , Blackberry , Blackberry , and the notion , on , on the ginocy , on the ginocy .
And even if they &apos;re spends , every minute , we see our son , we see our son , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; I have to say , &quot; I have to answer this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? I have to walk this literally ? &quot;
And when the answer is , &quot; no , &quot; I mean , &quot; it makes the experience of your child , very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , as we see , little bit about , little little , little , and the materials and life , life is a question of scowner .
And once the world was : Over , there were some possibility , but all of it .
The world of today &apos;s going to be : &quot; The dilemma is : &quot; It &apos;s a positive , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Sititites .
And we &apos;re all all all , so I &apos;m going to talk about that negative them .
And all this choice is two effects , two effects on people .
The first , paradossitally , it &apos;s that produces is that produced .
With a framework , and it becomes very difficult to do it .
I offer an example : one study , a study : one study conduct of sounds .
And a college has happened to data on the Vants of the Vantual , with about a million climbed climbed in 2,000 different companies .
What she &apos;s found is that for every 10 one of the 10 money that are offered in more , the percentage of the adesion of two percent .
With 50 deep source , there &apos;s 10 percent of the meeting when they &apos;re dispone-foot dispaces only five . Why ?
Because with 50 source , which is directly to decide , is directly decided , and the choice is remandy to the indomorate .
And in the domorest , and again , domances , domorous , and of course , and of course , it &apos;s never .
You know that it &apos;s not only that these are worthy to be able to song because they don &apos;t have enough enough enough money , because they don &apos;t want to say that decision is so hostic that they also have the physics of work .
Not , they &apos;re losing , they &apos;re losing , and it &apos;s later , which would be wouldn &apos;t be to be able to be .
So , the paralysis a consequence of the way .
And I think that &apos;s going to be .
&quot; And to finish , for the eternity : &quot; Yeah , you know ? &quot;
You would you want to take the right decision , if it &apos;s for eternity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the source , and nepure the browd , and neighbed .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can also have the paralize , and do a scoke , at the end , at the end of the result of how we were with less to be bed with less options to what the wod-up , and you know ,
And that &apos;s for different reasons .
One of these is that with many of these is that , if you buy , if you buy , you get a little bit of them , and it &apos;s not to imagine that you could imagine that you could make a different different . And that happens that happens . And that &apos;s what happened . And that happens the alternative , and the source of the source , and the source of the decision , and the swasting of the decision , and the decision , and the decision ,
even when it was a very decision .
And there are more choice , there are more to be easy than anything that is introduced that it is initive to be introduced .
But , there &apos;s what economists call cost .
Dan Gilbert , it really good good , as the value we have to the value that we have to confrontile things that we &apos;re going to confrontile .
And in rest , when there are many possible , is easy to repress the career of the alternative treatment , and it &apos;s less squickly about the option that you have to be able .
Here &apos;s a example . I wrote with all that they &apos;re not in New York .
But that &apos;s probably probably you &apos;d think .
There &apos;s this coppia Hamptons .
A place of luses .
Spiece of the splendic . Otymyself .
I don &apos;t eat anything . But that he thought , &quot; Well , malbuilding , is Agost . &quot;
&quot; Everybody &apos;s nearly . &quot;
&quot; I could wait out of the home . &quot;
And then , two weeks , sled from the idea that &apos;s lost -- every day -- every day -- the possibility to talk where it wants .
The cost-opportunity diminding to that we have , even when the swites that we have , when the choice was except .
And more are the options we have to be , more exactly , the characteristics of the expensive , as an opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
And we &apos;re going to live the moment , and maybe of living .
But the most important point is that you know what you &apos;re going to be scowen , you know , you &apos;re not going to do other .
The things we don &apos;t choose to us us to do that they can make less more active what we do .
Terzo : Orran growth of expectations
I tried on my skin comprinting a new couple of jeans .
I &apos;m going to jeans .
And then the jans were a kind of , and I buy them and wonderful , they were sitting them , only after they had to get them , only after they had to do , and they started a lot of times , they started to go .
So , I went to buy a new couple when the old people who were were used , and I said , &quot; I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
The committed me , &quot; Ley slim , easphit , relaxed me , and fit ? &quot;
Who wants to the certain or with the bottoons ? &quot;
&quot; Would you want to street ? &quot;
&quot; Some people want to get them to eld or streets the brows -- &quot; Continually .
I was balordit , and after a little bit , and after I could say , &quot; I want the until -- which was the until of what it was , so for a little bit of what I &apos;ve been in the best , and then , and then used to use the best , and then , and then used to the best mainly , with the best wall , with the best , with the best wall , and I had .
It was the massive . I had been a best .
But I &apos;ve got to feel .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for capable .
And the reason I was worse , I was worried with all that choice my expectent , the jeans had to be lost .
And I started waiting . I waiting me . I waiting when there was only one of a , but when there was a 100 different , and when they were 100 different , lacters , at least a kind of being .
What I had to have been good , but they wouldn &apos;t be good .
Affter the waiting what I was trying to be introduced in confront .
The address of the people don &apos;t do that that they don &apos;t have the expectent of the expectations of the expectations of the expectons of the expectations of the people who have to humor the expectations of the people who have to humor in the life of the people who can involved the expec
And that will producing less sodftware , even when the result are good .
Nobody in the marketing world , if it makes .
Because if they knew it , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The trutes looks like this .
&quot; You were better when he was worse , &quot; The reason that he was better when you were better when you were best when you were worse , when he was still possible to met the pressed was still to met the pressed of the printing of evolution .
Egiday , in the world we live -- oules , and the citizens , the way , we can hope , the way we can hope is that things are that we can hope is that things are going to hope .
You never surprising pleasy because your expectations , my expectent , you &apos;re ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- what you &apos;re here -- it &apos;s waiting . &quot; Yes , you want . &quot;
I mean , little moment , little moment -- that I &apos;m really saying , and I &apos;m really saying .
I won &apos;t have to do better , I won &apos;t have to do it .
But it &apos;s not always a good thing .
And then , a consequence of the comprise of the window of when there &apos;s only that kind of jeans is that when you &apos;re not sitting , and you ask , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot;
The world is the responsible . What could I do do you do you ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a type of jeans , and you ask you , and you ask you who are responsible to you .
You could have to do better .
With indeed , in the variety of variety .
So when people are decisions , even though , if the result is valized , they sentence , and they &apos;re going to be in their own .
In the last years , the last years is explosa in the world .
I think a meaning meaning -- not the only , but the only , but important -- of this wonderful , that people have experiences because the standard of the driver because the standard are too treatment .
And when they have to explain this situation , they think the college is their .
So the final result is that we &apos;re better , we &apos;re better , but we &apos;re worse , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you remember .
This is the official dogm , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely full .
There &apos;s no one of a little bit of a little bit better than a little bit better than it , but not to do that , but it doesn &apos;t want to be better than a little bit better .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic . I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s .
But I &apos;m sure we have surface from a piece of the level where the best choices our life .
Now , from the political point of political view -- I almost up -- from the night , the nocle is the following .
What we lost this scowever in society is the recycle material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you &apos;re going to know , which is not too much .
The problem is that they have too poca .
So the face of the facility that I &apos;m talking about is a diesclusive of modern modern modern , realize that .
And what it does it have to be able to be this : Steve Levitt you &apos;ve been talking about how I could cost and switing for books and sat , and slowed them .
I mean that these choices , complicated and dispendent , it &apos;s not just inuseful .
They &apos;re going to be talking about the etheries .
They do pay worse .
If you &apos;re a little bit of what we &apos;re going to be reverse in those people where people have too much more than where people have too much , it would not only be their life to better , but our life to better , it also , but our life .
This is what economists call a pareties .
A retroduction of the reduced to all -- not only you have to povering -- because of this scoke in except that there &apos;s a lot of the old that you .
And to conclude : &quot; For , you can become all that you want to be , &quot;
You , people of culture , you think , &quot; But what ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that can &apos;t get anything in a site of glass . &quot;
&quot; SS imimproved , a limitation of the world -- &quot;
And I &apos;ve interpretated this , at the beginning .
But then , I think , I realized that that weight the weight that weight the long time .
Because the reality of fact , it &apos;s the reality , that if you &apos;re going to be able to be possible , &quot; you can &apos;t get the liberty . You get the liberty .
If you rompet up to the way that all of the swites that all of possible diminule .
You &apos;re going to be the paralises , and you &apos;re going to be .
All they need a sfera .
This is almost certainly too , maybe even for fish , and it &apos;s safety for us .
But the asthrow of some symbolic symbolic for inhappiness , for the rinhappiness , for the rinhappiness .
Thank you very heart .
