The year I &apos;ve shown these slidemonstrate to show that the calculate glacial glacial , which for almost three million years , has had the size of the United States , 48 percent .
It &apos;s a problem , because it &apos;s not showing the gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice of ice .
The artica glacial is , in a sense , the pull heart of the global climate system .
It expanded inversus and the summer expants .
The next 25 years is going to be a review of the last 25 years .
The ice loss are drawn in red .
As you see , they expand up to the blue .
That &apos;s the ice in winter , which is the winter retreatment .
You can see that the ice cosid-year-old ice , of five years or more , it &apos;s like the blood , which is here five years from the body .
In 25 years , it was several .
This is a problem because the interested in the artage of the artage of the artage of the artc quantity of congeled that , science that , chaming , they are transformed in metane .
Rected to the totality of the atmospheres from global warming , that quantity could rading , surrounded this point of not return out .
In some laghi little little little deep in Alaska the methane is already rebecting from water .
The Katey Walter of the University of Alaska is recated with a team that was a team that winter a team that .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : The question is if we &apos;re going to be it also .
A reason is that this term scale the Greenland from northermal Greenland from northern .
This is a little glacial figured out .
The brought didn &apos;t have reached free .
This is the Kangerlush &apos;s Kangerlled in the South of Greenland .
If you want to know how the sea level of sea level to the shake of the ice of the ice , here is where it reaches the sea .
These running are increasing rapidly .
At the other part of the planet : Antarctica , the biggest block of ice ice ice block .
The month of scientists have diclared that the ice of the ice of the ice is in negative , and that the Antarctica , which pogs on some islands , which pogs on some islands , which is particularly in the science .
And that &apos;s six feet of the action of the acque of the action of the action of the actual .
Sull Himalaya , the third largest block of ice , you see new gap , that a few years ago , which a few years ago , and they were a few years ago .
40 percent of the world population is half of the world &apos;s people potachieved water from that shake .
Sulle Ande : this ice is the source of the water power of the power of the water of the power of the water of this city .
The cared is increased .
But when it dimines , it &apos;s the same happening to water .
In California , the Sierra on is the Nevada is declined 40 percent .
The hydropped in the hydropped .
The predictions , as you read , they &apos;re graveating .
The growing secure in the world downtown to a remarkable remarkable .
The environmental disaster is increasing a rhythm out of normal and without precedented .
Four times more numerous in the last 30 years of the last 30 years of the previous 75 .
This is an insustainable to be sustainable .
If you look at the context of historical context , if you can see the consequences .
For the last five years we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 25 million tons in the oceans every day .
Look at the area of the Pacific Pacific , by American , and on the west parts of the Indian area , where there is a radical impact of oxygen in the oceans .
Most of the global warming , together to deforestation , which is the use of the fossil of fossil fuel .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with the China .
And he was proposed to build a lot of other carbon .
But we &apos;re living in a direction .
These are the annulled in the last few years and some of the other versity and some of the verge alternative .
And in the way , there &apos;s a political lots of our country .
The carbon industries and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon , which is a host , which is a host simulate .
The imagination of me remember about something --
Natal , Natal Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion pounds of pounds of carbon scories .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen it on the news .
This is the second biggest scories in America .
It &apos;s happened around Natal .
The natalian industries of one of the carbon industries was this .
Video : The carbon Fross the carbon is a type and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it growing our economy .
It &apos;s always more clean is always more and more clean .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and work machines and the workers are style .
Al Gore : For here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The largest society in the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administration .
Video : Don Blankenship -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosis , Nancy Pelosis , they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for Protection of Clima Clima has been launched .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Ator : ALergy set changes as a serious serious mine changes like a serious tor of our business .
So , this is our priority is to invest a great amount of money in a public forcing and public forcing the truth .
In fact , the carbon isn &apos;t spork .
We think it &apos;s clean -- it also has a good profumb .
So not preocupon climate change .
Let me do .
Video : Ator : Ator -- you &apos;ve heard of it -- you &apos;ve heard a lot of talk .
So let &apos;s give you a turn in a structure to the avanot of the carbon for the carbon .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little rumor , but this is the sound of the clean technology .
The carbon of carbon is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable paper of paper that you see changes everything .
You have a look at this : This is the hate hate technology of the clean .
Al Gore : Inally , the positive alternative positive to the economic issue and the national security .
Video : South America is crisis ; the economy , the national security , national security , the climate crisis .
The filo that the bag all : our dependence of fossil of fossil , like the sports and the oil &apos;s oil .
Now , perhaps there is a new audace for using circumstances .
Rear power : 100 percent energy , 10 years , in 10 years .
A plan to repursue America to make us safer , and help to stop the global warming .
Finally , one solving solve our problems .
Repower power . Scoprite of the more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : I &apos;m going to reduck energy to America .
One of the fastest ways to get up to the dependence of the combustible dependence of our planet .
She said , the future is here . I feel , soles , one new energy network .
She &apos;s got a lot of high habitous for places of the retributed bad .
I &apos;m going to be realists . It &apos;s time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old old proverbio rth says , &quot; If you want to go fast , you go to the fast , you go to the fast .
If you want to go away , you go together . &quot;
We need to go far , quickly .
Thank you very much .
The year at TED I did a feckle on the LHC .
And I promise to return you to return to you about how the car works .
So here I recommend . And for those who was not , the LHC is the biggest experiment that was the biggest scientific experiment -- 27 miles of circumference .
His compiece of reating the conditions that were present less than a billion second from the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
And that &apos;s just environment .
This is the car underneath Gineveness .
We are these mini-Big Bang in the record .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- it &apos;s 44 meters and it has a 22 meters .
This is a spectacular image of ATLAS in buildings , so you can notice the proportions .
10 sector of the last year we have accent car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was cause of immense festegaming in control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first particles that had done all around LHC , and it was in collision , in collision , with a part of the LHC , and it &apos;s spread particles in the resilient .
In other words , when we see the image of the 10 sector , we realized that the car worked , which is a great vitting .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to exultate more or this , when somebody went to Google and he saw that the beginning was .
What means we &apos;ve had a cultural impact cultural impact to the scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the car , just just to these files here -- these days .
These files are 13,000 lovers when the car works at the maintaining the maintains .
Now , the technicians between you will look at the files and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . I &apos;m very good . I &apos;m a lot of switches . &quot;
And they can do it because when they &apos;re very cold to be the cost of superconducted ,
So , at less 271 degrees , at a hundred inferior to the space of the stars , these files can bring that running that run .
In one of the younger of the novemila in LHC , there was a fect difabrication .
So , the films slightly , and the 13,000 advanced , and the 13,000 ampuring a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressioning if you think these magnets weight more than 20 tons , and that they &apos;ve moved about 30 feet .
They are damaged about 50 magneti .
We had to take them , what we did .
We &apos;ve been repristed and traveled .
Now they &apos;re coming back all right now .
The latest of the LHC LHC will be new integrate .
We will happen , and we &apos;re expected data to get the data to get right or light , and continuing our adventure to discover what the morning to be the morning .
Now , of course , in a way , these indeed accidents readed the dibate on the value of science and engineering . It &apos;s easy to confuture .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that we go beyond the value of things like LHC .
I &apos;d like to conclude with the words of a Inglese Inglese , Humphrey Davy , which , imagine , in the difesa , his publicer , his publer was Michael Faraday , he said , &quot; Not is so dangerous for the progress of the human mind as the rest of the human mind as the rest of the human mind that the ideas of science as the science of the human mind that are not going to be . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start wondering when , from kids , as children , played with kids , played to the morning .
As you reach them and make them , and they can get them , take and they learned , learning , learned , actually , and they learned about thinking and manipulating the problems and manipulating relationship .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand most capacity of the world around us .
So , from information , from the useful uslity of our interaction with physics , together at my Patti , and at my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to ask me , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of the mouse as a digital poly-just as a digital information with the digital objects , we could have the information with the hands , we could have the hands ,
and systemart our placement ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , by building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a very very very very big computer .
In a few words , a Siftable is a very very very very big computer .
You can move them with the hand , they can see , &quot; you can see , &quot; You can see , &quot; You can see , and they have a radio and a radio radio .
But above , they &apos;re physical objects , as the morning , you can move just just further affirring them .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem for manipulate the digital information .
And as they get physical , knowledge of their movement , of other , and as they become more physical , and they become more physical , of the other people , how we can explore new and fun and different stilds of interaction .
I &apos;m going to start with some simple example .
This is Siftable to show a video of video , if I incline it in a direction , the video will rotate so , if I including the other side back back back back .
These replaces are consciousness of other people .
If you go around the frow , they &apos;re interested in .
If they are surrounded , they see it and they can get a little bit .
If they are surrounded , they see it and they can get a little bit .
They also survive their movement and inclination .
And then we realize that one of the interaction was the interaction of the interaction was the power to use communicate , for example , &quot; a color as if it was a liquid liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable , as a center of the versor , and I can use them to grew the color in that central , where they missing .
and I can use them to real color in the central color in the central , where they misquickly .
We can be too much , we can do a little place .
You also have a chance of learning , as the languages , like languages , math and games where people can try to try the things that are fast , and see it &apos;s a results of the world , and you see it in the immediately .
Now I &apos;m --
This is a sequence of Fibonacci that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a word of words that is half between Scarabeer and Boggle .
You know , of course , at every turn on a case on every Siftable , Pratically , in every Siftable , to every turn on the Siftletter to the square , and whereas trying to compose it on a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new letters and new possibility to try and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the kids came to the Media Lab , I did in the Media Lab , I did it , and I spent a video .
They are very placeased .
And one of the things of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of education .
You just say , &quot; Compons of words , and they know what to do .
Here &apos;s what other people do it .
This is our younger tester there .
It just wanted to implemed them .
They were only morning .
Now , this is an interactive application of an interactive carton .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of Lui is Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , solid Siftable them .
It can put new characters in the scene , solid Siftable them .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : Sun is source .
David Merrill : Now he took a treater in the scene .
Video : The arange treater .
By work ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yes !
So schooling Siftable and put it close to the characters ,
Video : Bau !
And by inventing their story .
Video : Hiao !
DM : It &apos;s a story with final open , and it can decide him as it &apos;s slide .
DM : It &apos;s a story with final open , and it can decide him as it &apos;s slide .
Video : Volice , gets .
DM : The last example I have the time to show you is a tool , to realize and to walk and to walk and exeguy .
It &apos;s a recently device , to championeer and exeguy .
The Siftable here are against sound as base , based and battery .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choices .
You can also put these sounds in a sequence to comport to your placement .
And modify it just to touch a sound sound and a sequence . &quot;
These are actually control of the vive , like the reverse and the filter .
The acks to a particular sound and then including to the sound .
And then there are the general effects as time and volume , that they just applicate to the sequence .
Let &apos;s look at how it works .
Video : DM : We &apos;re going to start with a sequence in two Siftable , we &apos;re doing it in a series , we can extend , we add to the other base .
Now I put a base line line .
Video : I add to the percussions --
Video : And now I &apos;m going to put the filter to the bacteria , so I can control the effect of the vive .
Video : DM : I can speed the whole sequence inking the whole sequence by one side or another .
Video : And now I &apos;ll add the filter to the base for the bag to date more expression .
Video : DM : I can reombing the sequence &quot; to the fly . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to planning it before , but I can try to make it longer , make it longer longer or more cording .
And now , finally , I can actually smooth the whole sequence , by the Siftable , &quot; volume . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is built new new man &apos;s interface and more like the brain and body &apos;s going to be more like our brain and body .
And I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the results of this lost , and also some possibility that we try to bring out out of the lab .
The concept that I want to transmitting is that it &apos;s coming to this new generation of projects to interact with the digital media , that will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the hour of all .
I &apos;m a written .
Boy books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also the love and the fascrowd of my life .
And I don &apos;t look like that I can change .
But , said , something about this particular happened in my life and in my career , who has bring me to me to recalibrate the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is I recently wrote this book , this biography called Mang , Prega , Prega , &quot; which , often , for some reason I &apos;m going to be a big , for some reason in the world and become a big , sensational became , and sensational burst .
And the result is that everywhere the vada now , people treat me as if I were condanned .
Davigate -- condanned , condanned !
They are from me now , everybody worried and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t have to do you can &apos;t do that ?
You don &apos;t have to continue to continue to write all the life without power without power to make a book that can important someone important ? &quot;
What can you important ? &quot;
It &apos;s rassurant , you know .
But I could go worse , part of the remember that I remember more than 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was a crazy cent -- I wanted to be a written .
I &apos;m going to met the same reaction from the fear .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t themes to me , &quot; Don &apos;t you have succeded ?
You don &apos;t have fear that the humiliation of the refitting you ?
You don &apos;t have to do this for all life without any life without any life-like you ever , and they have to die on a cumulo of snamed , with the mouth of fallimb ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short response to all of these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I have all of those things .
I &apos;ve had always been aframework .
And I have a lot of other things that people can &apos;t inate .
As the algae and other things .
But , as much as about this write what I thought and I was asked , and I asked me , is why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logic that anyone who have to expect to be spavented by a job that you feel to do .
But what is this particular in the impressing creative to make us nervous about the health care about the health of the health care that other career do ?
And as my father , for instance , he was a chemist and I don &apos;t remember one once in his 40 years of activity that he was asked if he was pursued if he had lots of being able to be able ?
There was never -- that block of the engineer John , how does it do it ?
It didn &apos;t work like that , understand that ?
Onestly , chemical engineers as a group have not certainly , in the centuries , they broadnarrow the reputation of being alcolized manized manized .
We have this reputation , we have enough reputation , and not only writers , but creative of all gender , we have this reputation of being enormous instaable mentally .
And it &apos;s not the other than looking at the trists of the deaths of the magnificent ments that , only in the 2th century , they died young people , they died young people .
And even the ones that have no suicidated seems to be really disdisdeed by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , &quot; Every my book killed me a little bit more . &quot; A extraordinary extraordinary affirmation about their life .
But we don &apos;t bad cil of the child when we heard these things that we &apos;ve been interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and the suffering the notion that creativity and the art , it will always conduce it .
And the question I want to get all of the time is , are you agree with this idea ?
You know this thing -- because also , even looked at a centimeter of distance to me not good for anything .
I think it &apos;s odiosa hdiot .
And I think it &apos;s also perecuate and I don &apos;t want to see it lost in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our big beyond our homes to live .
And I &apos;m sure that , in my case -- in my situation -- would be very dangerous to start figing towards that feeling the host of the surrounded , but I &apos;m in my career .
That &apos;s a lot of young , I &apos;m quite a young , I have about 40 years .
I have still about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that any thing I &apos;m going to be right now in the world as the work that was in the world that was used to be successful by my last book .
I &apos;m slay , because we are all more or less friends here -- it &apos;s likely , my biggest success is to my house .
Oh , Gesus , who think !
You know this is the kind of thinking that that &apos;s a person to start to start burn in the nine of the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would stop continuing to do this work that we love .
So , the question becomes , how do it ?
And so it seems to me , after a lot of reflective , that the way to keep write is to create a psychological construct , OK ?
I have somehow to find a security of security between me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxy about what reaction is going to get a year . And as I was looking for the year , and I was looking for it through time , trying to find other societies to see if they could have the best ideas to see if they could have the best ideas and more and more and more and more and more sane and more sane .
how to help people to make the emotional inerent inrisk emotional inerents .
And that research has taken me to the Green and ancient Rome .
I seguitems because it gets into circle and then back .
In the ancient Grex and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity was from men , OK ?
It thought that creativity was this spirit of divine , and that was in the divine , and who was saying , for the distant and southern , for reasons and known .
The Greef of these spirits were a creativity of creativity .
Socrate , wonderful , created to have a demon that was wish wisdom .
Romans were the same idea , but they called the same idea , but they called the kind of a genius .
which is great , because Romans didn &apos;t think that a genius was a particularly intelligent .
They believed that a genius was this kind of divine that has created living in literally walls a study of a study , a little bit like Dobby , and that was a little bit like Dobby , and that was going to hold the work of the artist and model to model the result of that work .
Here &apos;s what it &apos;s been -- here , that &apos;s the distance of which -- that psychological costruck that you have to protect you from your work .
And everybody knew that it was what it was , right ?
So the anticisy artists were protected by certainly , like the too much narcism , right ?
If your work was exciting , you couldn &apos;t take all the market , they all knew that you had been helped by this genioral genior .
If your job work , it was not all all college , it was not all the right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a inable .
And so people han concept to be creativity in the West for a long time .
And then the Rended came and all changed , and all changed , and nacque this great idea ; we put the human inside of the universe , and the mistake and no longer space to make the creatures that write detail from divinity .
This was the rational principle of the rational humanesimum and people began to think that creativity was completely from the isharing .
And for the first time in history , he started to referring to this or the artist as a rather than a person with a genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big herror .
I think that allow someone , a simple person to believe that of being like a recipent , the essence and the surprising of all mysteries , creative , creative , unknown and creative , inknown and inknown is a lot of to give to the bad fragile human fragile to be a little bit of human beings .
It &apos;s like someone ask to someone the sun .
It &apos;s shape and completely distores the ego and creates all of these expectations on the performance .
And I think it was this pression to have destroyed artists in the past 500 years .
And , if that &apos;s true , and I think that &apos;s , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
I will come back to a relationship of the relationship between human relationship of human relationship .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t sing 500 years of rational thinking in a rational talk about 18 minutes .
And there is some people in the audience that there would be scientific legitimate about the notion of the notion of , injected people , and they follow people to do .
I &apos;m not going to convince you all about this .
But the question I &apos;d like to ask is -- why not ?
Why not to think that way ?
Because it &apos;s more sense of all other thing that has ever heard to explain the exasperant exasperant impredicbility of creative process .
A process that , as anyone who I &apos;ve ever been trying to do something -- so , I think , it &apos;s basically , everybody here -- knows , you don &apos;t composed .
And in fact , it can times look completely paranormal .
I &apos;ve done this recently , with the wonderful poetry Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but that was a few years , but that was a few people who were in the ginside the Virginia , working out in the ginrural Virginia , and feel it , in if a poem to the landscape .
He said that it was like a fragorous train .
And he was coming towards of her from the landscape .
He heard it comes to it , because he was going to be tremendous .
He knew to have one thing to do to that point and it was , words , words , words like a math . &quot;
And so it would correct up , and he was wash this poetry , and they wouldn &apos;t have to get a piece of paper and a fast enough , and a fast fast enough , and it would raise it on the page .
Somce sometimes not could be fast enough , so correct and correct and correct and correct wash it , and the poetry was roled through and she would continued to go through the landscape , as he would continued to go through the landscape , as he said , &quot; one other poet . &quot;
And then there were times -- this piece I &apos;ll never sit -- there was a moments that was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was looking for the card and the poetry was wering a math just in a math , and he was switching , and he said , that it was like if you trunning with the other hand and and the hand and .
He was going to cut the poetry and repage it in his body and he would writing the page .
And in these cases , the poetry was presented on perfect and intately but the contrary , from the last word on the last word .
So when I heard it -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly the same thing to my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conducture .
I &apos;m a move , and my way to work is ; I &apos;m wake up to the same high every day and to work and pass and go on and go on it goes .
But I even , in my test test , I &apos;ve been strised against that thing , sometimes .
And I imagine that many of you have the han done .
You know , even if the job and ideas were given by a certain source , I could not honestly know .
What is this ?
And how can we relate to do it in a way we don &apos;t lose the head , but rather , rather , which do you make sure ?
For the best example , the best example of me , that I have is the Musician , which I have is the musician musician .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life was the incarnation of the artist of the artist of the artist , trying to control , to deal with these species of creative impulses of the totally interested in the totally interested in .
But then he got to reach , and one day , and one day as he was driving on a Los Angeles , changed everything .
He was going to be fast and all of a sent tract this little sent melody , which is coming into his head as it does inspiration , elusive , elusive , and the head , and the desidential , and the desidential , but not knows how to take it .
It &apos;s not a piece of card , it has no climbs , it has no record .
So he starts to feel this species of anxioned anxioned in him , &quot; I &apos;m going to drive , and I &apos;ll remark obsessed by this characters .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to go to the panic , he stopped .
He gave the whole process and did something completely new .
He just just watching the sky and said , &quot; Scause , not see that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; You look like that write a song right now ?
If you really want to exist , in a longer moment when I can take care of you .
Although , you go to important something else today .
You go to the Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his work worked changed after this .
Not the work , it was still hoscure as well as it always .
But the process , and the anxy that was retained when he was a genius , the genius , the genius that was out of him , and it turned out it back to the back of where he was going to remove it back to where it was realizing , and it was realized and tools .
but it was wonderful , wonderful , wonderful collaboration a conversation between Tom and this strange thing that was not Tom .
And as I heard that story about changing a little bit even the way I worked and already saved me once .
This idea , he saved when I was writing , &quot; Mang , Prega , Ama , and fall in one of those key cables that we all do on something and we can &apos;t start thinking that &apos;s going to be a disaster , which is what the worst book is going to be a disaster , which is the worst book or never wrote .
Not only , the worst book , just the worst book .
And I started thinking about pecting this project .
But then I remember of Tom who talked to the air and I tried to the air and I tried to do .
So I went to my face in the manoscrits and I made my comments to a house corner of room .
And I said to the voices , &quot; Sensent , what , we &apos;re both , you know that if this book not will be very strong , not be very strong , right ?
Because as I see here I &apos;m going to put everything I have , not more than that I have ,
So if you want to be better , you have to press you and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know , I don &apos;t do anything .
I &apos;ll go to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to do for favor that was recorded to me to do my part , &quot; Because , at the end , OK -- at the end of the North Africa in North Africa , and people would go to the slate , and sacred music sacred sacred sacred sacred to the allow of the hours and to the alb and hours to the allow hours to the allow hours .
And they were always magnificent , because the baleres were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every much , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists had actually been transcending .
And I know what I talk about , because I know you have all , to be a point , a performance so .
It was like if the time , and the balleres , and the balleres walk through a kind of pursuit , and he was not doing anything .
And suddenly not appeared just as a human .
But it happened from the divinside and the divinate in the divinity .
And when this happened to the time , people knew what was , they were called it with her name .
They were congioner to dogen , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , God , Allah , God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curious night -- when the Mom invaded the Spanish of Spain , they took this habitude with them and pronounded changed in the centuries of &quot; Allah , &quot; As , &quot; &quot; Okay , &quot; Ole , &quot; &quot; &quot; Okay , &quot; and then , &quot; which you can still hear in the flow .
In Spain , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , &quot; Obbag , &quot; Brye , &quot; I , &quot; incomprehensible , and I &apos;m going to be -- a God of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need .
But , the problem comes the day , for the dancer , when you wake up and discovered that are the 11 of Martedesday , and I wrote it &apos;s the 11 of God , and I wrote God &apos;s there .
It &apos;s just a dead bate with a big bad to ginocky , and maybe not going to be able to get to the height .
And maybe no one of God &apos;s still while she &apos;s still , and what it &apos;s got to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most sweet recognizes to make a creative life .
But maybe not to be so angosciant if you can &apos;t believe , anzyutto , which the most expects you in your own being coming from you .
But it just believed that there &apos;s data in a further inimagery of this source of the inimages of this square part of your life that you have to go to someone else when you &apos;ve finished .
And , you know , if we think about this way .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s sure , and it &apos;s sure as I thought about a different months in the book that I &apos;m going to do present , the dangerous success .
And what I have to keep tells me when I feel electrized by this is , not going to have .
Not wouldn &apos;t just walk .
It &apos;s going to present you to present your part , whatever can be .
If your work is ball , ball ball .
If the wine , aburd genius to decide to leave some kind of wonderful kind of wonderful , for a moment through your effort , then , &quot; Okay ! &quot;
Altrimments , you do the same dance .
And &quot; You ! &quot; She ! &quot;
I think I think you have to teach it .
&quot; You ! &quot; Sometimes , even for the same for the human had and test later and test tape to be listen to involved .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As I talked about some of these projects on human genome , about what can mean and discovery new set of new genius of new genius .
Now we &apos;re starting a new path . We started digitalizing biology and now to talk about that digital code we &apos;re in a new biology , designing and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing life .
We &apos;ve always been trying to take big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists I think they &apos;re trying to figure out of various levels .
We tried different approaches , reducing it to minimes .
We &apos;re digitizens from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome is treated to pass from the analogical world of the biology world &apos;s digital world .
Now , we can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smaller genome of those that can authority in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the ulteriorly to create a smaller more smaller .
We are able to eliminate a hundred of genes about 500 that are here .
But when we have a look at its metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our .
I think I &apos;m going to do this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this can bring to a living cell living .
So we decided that the only way to design was synthesize this chromosome in a way to be able to make components to get some of these questions of the fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of the adventure of the Pan ? &quot;
Can chemistry to produce these great molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create before ?
And in case , we can make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a chemical piece of inert material chemical material .
The speed that we are able to digitalize life is growing up to exponential rim .
Our capacity to write the genetic code , rather than , but it &apos;s more slowly , but it &apos;s better .
And our most recent retained it to a exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process has required many pass , starting with a bioethical review of the first experiments .
But we discovered that DNA is very hard .
There are decades of thousands of machines in the world that produced small segments of DNA , of the long 30-letters , and it &apos;s a process , more running .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these fragments and correct to correct the herrors .
And this was our first attempty , to start to talk about the digital information of Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , actually , the correction of the herrors and get a molecule of DNA about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material chemical material chemical material and we &apos;ve inserted it in the bacteria , the bacteria , they started to read this genetic code and producing the viral particles .
The viral particles , then they &apos;ve been reped by cells , and they &apos;ve been back back and they destroy the E.
I &apos;ve talked about recently with members of the oil industry that they have certainly compress this model .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build his same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in big .
We wanted to build the whole chromosome of the bacteria .
I &apos;m more than 580 myletters of genetic code .
So we thought we build it in the size of the viruses , so we can change the casses to understand what the components are components of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , they have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard was a herror for every 10 mile .
We &apos;ve discovered , 30 herrors . If we had used that original sequence , we would never be able to do that work .
One part of the process is designing sectity for 50 letters that you have to be a little bit of the other segment of 50 letters to build smaller suburit to build smaller subject .
We &apos;re going to see unclean elements here .
You probably have read that we read that we put a physical physical .
So , I think that we have a genetic code based on four letters : A , C , Gs and T.
Three of those letters together , and there &apos;s about 20 hammitoid , and there &apos;s a specific order of letters for every amming .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , framework , sentences .
What we &apos;ve been done in the beginning was autographs .
Some of the fact that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
We designed these segments to just help to just only only only only only only one enjoy with the environment .
There are enzymes that repursues them .
And we started to assemble parts , beginning with the five to seven to seven to seven to seven to seven to make a sit of 24 myth to make it sure to them , and then it back to 72 mile .
We have produced these segments in abundance so we could sequency them to sequency them , we &apos;re trying to create a very robust -- as you &apos;ll see in a minute robust -- as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems to be a basket of a basket .
When we get to these very long segments , more than 100 midle , more than 100 midle , they will not grow more directly in E.
It comes to the limitation of modern biology of molecular biology .
So we have considered other mechanisms .
We knew of another mechanism called homologist , which in biology , in biology , which in biology , in biology , in biology , can make the DNA to can segments .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinoccurs in the diodd-rad , can make three million rad rad .
You can see in the square superior as his chromosome as his destroy .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s reassembly as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can do completely .
They can live under a vacuum .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life exists in space , and you move to find new environments .
ASA , NASA shown that &apos;s happening .
This is a picture of the molecule we built this processed , just using the lievening with the design appropriate segments to put segments to put .
The lievened them to automatically .
This image was not taken with a electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a task molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that they cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the publishing we &apos;ve done a little time ago .
They are more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the biggest molecule of a defined structure ever created by man .
It &apos;s a weight molecular sent to 300 million .
If we stop it with a 10 without spaces , they would like 142 pages to transcriting this genetic code .
Now , how do we do that ? How can we activate it ?
Of course , you can see a virus is a little girls .
It &apos;s a little more complicated when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s also simpler when it &apos;s cell cells as well as our eucariot as our : you can just extract the nucleo and put another , which is a class and put another , which is a process of clonely clonely clonely .
In the bacteria , the chromosome is integrated by the cell , but we &apos;ve recently demonstrated that we &apos;re able to do a complete transplant of a cell of a cell of a cell of a cell and to another and of activate it .
We &apos;ve got a chromosome of a microbial species .
The two are different than men from topes .
We &apos;ve added some gene in a way we could decide what to chromosome for this chromosome .
And then he switches with the enzymes in a way to kill all protein .
And when we put it in the cell was study -- and you &apos;ll open our software -- and you &apos;ll open our software -- the new chromosoma was going to the cell .
And we were beginning to be beyond , but we tried to be more in the next .
This is one of the major mechanisms .
We &apos;ve discovered that many species have added a second or a third or a third of some part , add in a second thousands of new towards that species .
So who think of evolution as a gene at the time that you modified not a lot of biology .
There are an enzymes called the &quot; enzymes that adds digerish the DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell of it not one .
The cell phone that we have inserito-chromosome that we have it .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other chromosome as extraneous material , and we found it with only the cell and the new chromosoma .
it has become blue because of the genes we have inserted .
And in a short lash of time , all the characteristics of a species have been lost , and it turned around a new kind of new species , based on the new software that we in the cell .
All the protein are changed , membranes are changed , and when we &apos;re reading the genetic code of what we &apos;ve transfer is transferred .
Now , this may seemy genetic altering , but altering the DNA software we we can change things in a very enough .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that here is not talking about three million years , but to program from three million years and a half million years of evolution , and I &apos;ve already said that maybe we &apos;re going to create new species of the Cambrian explosion of this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s enough to be when we think of our necessity .
We &apos;re going to pass six billion people to have to the next 40 years .
Right to give you an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each there in 1946 , in 46 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re going to find problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medicinal and weather , medical and a half billion people .
It &apos;s still going to be more given to do that for nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion pounds of oil .
What does does mean , millions of barrassing a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replaced them , it will be a huge challenge .
In the most of CO2 emission of CO2 emission of these materials that finds in the atmosphere .
And I &apos;m going to discoveries , because of the scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that they are the design components for the future .
The electronic industry only is a dozen about about components , and think about how many different things are coming out .
Our limitations here are principlplples from biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , because of these synthesization of synthesization , able to create what we call combinatory combinatory .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think of these 20 million genes or to get these 20 million genes or to get the processes to make it optimize , new vaccines , new vaccines , we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology that in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standards .
We can choose for possibility of survival , chemistry or carburst , chemistry or carburst , production vaccines .
This is an instantly instantly of some software program that we &apos;re working to be able to seeing and design species to do it .
Well , we don &apos;t know necessarily how they will be .
We know exactly what they &apos;re their genetic code .
Now we &apos;re now focused on carbon about how much generation .
You &apos;ve also seen you extract ethanol from gran experiment .
We have carbons of second and third generation that will use enough of the higher of the higher value as the eight-value or different types of butang .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increasingly increasingly increasingly , the construction of food and limitation would be transform the CO2 in matery before , that we &apos;re working to design cell that can reach this scale , and we think we can actually reach this scale , and we think we could have the first carbons of how to do we have the first carbons of how to do we have the first carbons of the food and limb the first carbons of the food and we &apos;re working on for cells that we &apos;re working on for the first ,
The solar solar light combined with CO2 is a methodownload -- but in our discoveries in the world , we found different metodd .
This is a organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , about 2500 feet of depth of the temperature of the water temperature of water .
It &apos;s in CO2 using hydrogen by using hydrogen as a source of energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can put the CO2 , which can easily be transported through the tubes , converting that CO2 in carburst , to drive this process .
So we think we can think we can be able to be able to increase what the question of the base question , &quot; which is the life , &quot; We have the focus that &apos;s life , we have the goal to replacing the oil industry to replacing the whole oil industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can you do it ?
It would be a main the power of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working for using the same methods to create vaccines .
You saw this year with influence , we &apos;re always forget to a year and with a dollar in less when it comes to find the right vaccine .
I think what you can change by building vaccines in anticipath .
Here &apos;s the future could start to seeing , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating evolution with synththesics , and finally cells , archatheuck , and finally cells .
We &apos;re at so much from the improving people .
Our goal is to do enough to make a long enough to try to try to try to try to make it . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the most foundly possible , some fundamental work , in the new technology that we &apos;ve taken to a pursuit almost a year ago .
It &apos;s a environment that you can interact with a local level of visual data that remote with a huge amount of visual data .
Here we &apos;re seeing a lot of digital pictures of digital pictures with a kind of digital zoom , and I continuous , for a bread bad basic , spone-a-up pictures as we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much the amount of information that we see , how much they are these data or images .
Most of the digital photographs , but this is a example of a discussing from Bibliotecame from the Bilioteca 300 megapielate megapielate .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that the presents of a system like this is the number of a system like this is the number of paper on your screen in any moment . It &apos;s also a very flow .
This is a whole book , you know , of the data not images .
This is Dickens of Dickens . Every colonnaked .
To show you that it &apos;s just about the textbad and not images , we can do one thing like this , to see that it &apos;s a real representation of the textbad , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial to read a little electronic book .
You don &apos;t have to be advice .
This is a more realistic example . This is a number of the Guardian .
Every big picture is the beginning of a seeing .
And it really gives you the pieceure and beauty the experience of a drop of a magazine or a daily juggling , which is for nature a lot of medium .
We also did something with the corner of this number of this particular number of the Guardian .
We &apos;ve created a fasull fasull resolures -- much more than what usually usually usually -- much more than the published -- and we &apos;ve inserted you to extra extra extra content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific specific specific .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the limitations of space on the screen .
We hope that this means to put the pop-up and other nurses , and in other places , they should not be needed .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not going to lose time , if we don &apos;t have contributed to date in this field .
These are all the streets in the USA sovert of a NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually actually from the Web ; you can go to see .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which combinine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual search of a very interesting computer searches in Noah Seady , a student of the U.K. Washington , with the aid of the UW and of Rick Seady of Microsoft Rick .
And it &apos;s from the Weady , Seadron .
You can see that when we do this kind of screen , where we can pass from one picture to another and have this kind of experience to the other and have this kind of experience to the multiple resolution .
But the space of images here has actually a meaning here has a meaningful .
The algorithms of visualization have recorded these images together , in a way that they corresponds to the real place that imaging the real space that images -- all the neighbors of the Rockcil Montne Roccial Montne Roccious , they &apos;re scacked . And then then you see the elements of a slide of slide , and these things were all scacross the space .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some much more space .
I want to pass directly to one of the original data of Noaherself -- and this is from a prototype of Photosynth , we have done in Photosynth , we have to do what I think is really the key behind this technology , Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily the kite behind this technology , and it &apos;s not necessarily watching the environments that we &apos;ve been looking in the website .
We had to worry about the legal exects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of Noththers of Noththers . Flickr . Bastyle &apos;s Plickr . Bastakes and you images of types in magic , others and so on . Each of these arances represents a picture that &apos;s discovered a picture that &apos;s discovered a picture that &apos;s discovery .
So I &apos;m all images from Flickr and they were all connected to the space in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this simplication .
You know , I would never have thought I &apos;d ever thought I was going to be in Microsoft .
It &apos;s very , very , very , very , very , very , very ,
I think you can see that this is a lot of different kinds of different types of fotaming , from those of the cellular phone to those professional phone to the ground of those professional .
And if I can try to try to get those more strange .
There are a lot of faces , etc .
Somewhere you have a photographs of photographs -- etc .
This is a Nothregistred correctly .
We can go from the poster to the vision of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do with the social environment . This is now taking data from the entire memory of how to apply the land , from the entire point of visual , and it all those data together .
All those pictures become linked , most of the parts of the parts .
You have a model of the land that emerge .
Think about this as a prolarming of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as people use it , and the people useful , and the advantages for people who uses use it .
Their pictures are married with metadhert metadhert by other people .
If someone comes to contrast all these several several sant , my picture of Nothers , my picture of Noththers , and I can use the same thing , and I can use the data , and I can use the point of ingress to be ingress to be in the midle of the other , and have a picture of the choice of the choices of the choose , and have a social experience of the chross-mofashion of the ching choose .
Of course , one consequence of all that are extremely elaborate virtual model of the land , which is not only a satellite and images and from satellite and images and satellite and images , but from the memory memory of the collective memory .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What your software will contained us to do is that at a certain point , in the next few years , all the photographs shared by anyone in the world will be going to be reading together ?
BA : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is basically discovered .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the images .
What &apos;s really interesting is if you think about the wealth of simanti-wish information that many of these images possible images .
As when you do a research of images on the web , you get a sentence and the head on the web page has a lot of information about the images of the pictures .
Now , what if that pictures you colleagues all your pictures ?
So , the amount of simantity and the amount of wish and the amount of wealth that &apos;s really huge . It &apos;s a classical effect of the networks .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really amazing .
BA : Thank you very much .
One of the main pleases when you travel and one of the research search is the power to live between who didn &apos;t forget the power of the traditions , between who have the past the wind , the path in the midle , the touch in the foot , the rog it in the flows .
Basts thinking that the Jaguar , they are still beyond the Viia Lattea , or that the Mians are still still meant , or Himalthy , or Himalaya , to remember the Dharm , to remember the central important , and that the world we live in the central important central important , and the idea that the world in which we live in the world we live in the world we live in the world we live in the living , but it &apos;s just a reality , but it &apos;s just a fact , it &apos;s just a reality ,
the consequence of a particular choices that our stirs has done , well , or a bad bad , a lot of generations that we have .
And of course , we all share of the essential towards .
We all all of the nails .
We are subjects in the beginning .
We have to death the inexorability of death , so it doesn &apos;t surprising and ballim ,
We all have a art .
What colpiscoes is the particular rath of canone , the rise of the dance , the dance of all culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that they are the Lanests of Borneo , or the follow-up of Haiti , or the Sahard-Kaisut , or the Kaisut , or a cameleras , or a camelmelting in the Sahara .
He was my journey in the desert a month ago , or a month ago , or a mouth ago , in the values of the Everest , on the Everest , the mother of the world .
All of these people teachers teach us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And , if you reflected a moment , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
And we have the cultures of the world &apos;s cultures a world of spiritual life and cultural life that it &apos;s important for the planet , and it &apos;s important for the planet as a biosphere as a biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural girl as a nosphere , and you can call the ethnosphere , the nosphere of all the concepts , dreams , inspirations , inspirations , inspirations , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , in the consciousness .
The ethnosphere is the fantastic patrimony of humanity .
It &apos;s the simple simple of what we are and what we can be in how inquissue .
And because the biosphere was graveled as it as it was very quickly , and it was too much more quickly .
Nobody biologist , for instance , would say that 50 percent of all species is about extinction , because it &apos;s been falong , or in the extinct of the biological diversity -- in the most of the biological diversity -- and you don &apos;t even have to be a typical hypothemselves -- that of the different cultural hypothers -- that of the different cultural of the kind of cultural diversity --
The injection of all that is , of course , the lost language .
When you have been there 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not only composed by a vocabulary or by a series of grammatical rules .
One language is the spray of human spirit .
It &apos;s the medium with the animal of every culture of every culture is in the material world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a bad , a bind , a thought , an ecosystem .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we are here at Monterey , at least the half of the kids .
They don &apos;t come to teach kids , which means , not wonder that you don &apos;t won something , which they &apos;re already dead .
What is there is more sad of being aved by the silence , to be the last to talk to a language , not having the lingua , of not to transmit the wisdom of the children ?
This is a fate , it &apos;s the state of somewhere in the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks , and it brings with it in the tomba .
And I know someone will say that &apos;s not better ?
The world wouldn &apos;t be a better place if we talk all the same language ? &quot; Benish , then we all talk all . We all talk all about the same way .
We talk to kogi .
You &apos;ll be a suddenly thing to do not talk about their language .
I &apos;d like to do a journey through the ethnosphere .
a little trip in the ethnosphere to give you a massive of what we &apos;re losing .
A lot of us of us that when I say , &quot; when I say , &quot; I really mean , I mean , I really mean , very different ways of existing .
We take for example this Barasana , in Amazon , Amazon , the population of anaconda , which believe at the myth of the anaconda of the latte of the wind of the wind of sacred sacred sacred sacred .
It &apos;s a population that &apos;s not able to distinguished the color blue from the green because the color is the drified in the forest of the forest , where it depends the population .
They have a strange language and a master , degree , degree exogamia , &quot; Law , &quot; you have to must spose a person who talk about a different language .
And this is actually radical past , though the particularity is that in these exists , in these exists that are talking about six or seven or seven linguished .
They limited to listen and then start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribe with the tribe , the Waoran of East Eastador of Easterador , an incredible people , an incredible people in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionararies have tented a compose of a construction .
They &apos;ve been done by the photographs that read them in poses that they were in positive poses , forest that this population of forest pluvial forest .
They &apos;ve collected pictures from the land , they turned them to shaped a shape or a shape , they have conclosed that they were a digure , and they kill the five missionaries with the lights .
But Waorans don &apos;t just killed the straniests .
They kill between them .
54 percent of mortality was caused by them .
We &apos;re sitting at eight generations and we found two natural houses of natural death and when we have been insisted by the way , they &apos;ve been invested , and then they kill it it up , and then they kill it . Raunder . Every they had a way , they had a incredible knowledge of forest .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine animal by 40 pass and recognize it .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned a very interesting job when my Harvard professor asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to intruccrowd up with the base of the power of Dualier and Tonton Murban and of Tonton Most &apos;s power and Tonton Mish &apos;s power to do the bome to do the basic zome to do the broads .
To give a sense of myraculous , I should have to understand the Voodoo culture Voodoo and that Voodoo is not magic .
It &apos;s a little bit of a complex medical complex of the world .
Most interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has no religious feelings . And he did , in the Voodoo is not other than the distilled of these very deeper ground religious concepts of naked naked in the tragic diaspores .
What makes the vooo is the intense report is the intense between life and death .
So , vives make the spirits .
The spirits can be invoed by the Great Aca , they respond to the dance of dance and replaced temporary temporary to the anima way that we had a little bit of the pursue .
So , this voodooists love to say , &quot; You white you go to wait to talk about God .
We give in the temple and become God . &quot;
And from the moment that you &apos;re possitting , is the spirit that you , how can you do the bad of the bad ?
So , you have to these incredible events : followed walking in the state of trance that touches touch a rather straight demonstration rather than the body when it &apos;s catalyes in a body state of the mind when it &apos;s catalyzed extremely exciting .
I &apos;m all the people with the most extraordinary , the most extraordinary Kogi in Sierra Nevada Santa Marta , in Colombia .
It makes a cycle caves that once they live on the carcarcars of Colombia living on the conquered , the population of the conquery , the population that you ery on the crowd planes that you get to the carbon planning .
In a continent of blood , this population has never been conquered by the spagners .
And I &apos;m governmented by a cleradadvanced , but their formation is decided .
The young people are taken away from the families to three or four years , and they live secret in a world , and they live secret in a world of the bag .
Two periods of nine years of proposed to reproduce the nine months of the nine months that transrate in the user of the mother , now are metaphoricly in the Great Mother .
So , for all this time , they are acculate to the values of their society , values that their prayers and only their prayers and they &apos;re going to be the balance of the equilibrium .
At the term of this incredible initiation , they &apos;re suddenly taken out and the first time , 18 years , they see a little bit . And in that actimidle of the first bad , when the sun burst the valence of the first bad , when the sun burst , the sun , and it &apos;s conferred in all of the beautiful time , and it says , &quot; The pret a past past a behind and says , &quot; The pret a past a past a past .
&quot; I &apos;m going to be ? Proprium I said .
It &apos;s study . Now it &apos;s at you protect it . &quot;
They &apos;re called the birth brothers and say that we , frachieve mines , we are the pattern of the world .
This is extremely important .
When we think of Indigene and the environment , we invox Rashseau and the old story of the vage , which is a razy razy concept in his simplicity or maybe we invochieve Thoreau and say that these people are more close to the Earth of us .
Indigenes are not not sentimental sentimental sentimate from nostaly .
There is no space for these things in the paludium of Ashat or in the vents of the TIbet , but because of the time and the rhythle , they created a mystic intuition of the Earth , not on the concept of the world of the car that the Earth can only only be consciously , because it &apos;s infected by human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
It means that a mountain of the Ande who grows in the mountain is a Prito Apu that will be a depth of the Apu that will be a depth of different , and it will have a different raties with the mountain or that place to grow a mountain a Montana that grow is a mountain in a mountain in a mountain is a rock of a rock of the mountain .
which is the dimpowered or a mineral cow is irrievant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia creating that the forests serve to be cut .
And that &apos;s got me a different human being from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the forests are the dimpowered Huk and the histort of the paradise and the download the spirits of the world , spirits that are in the northern beginning to be northern the Hamator &apos;s beginning .
If you start to consider that these cultures can actually actually create reality , you can start to understand some of them , you can start to understand some of them , and we can start to understand this plants .
I &apos;ve taken this picture to open in the norocky noroccurs .
Mayahuge of you have heard of the ayahuge psychoactive , the powerful sushed of the repertory .
What makes the fascinating the ayahuge is not the potential pharmacological potential of substance , but his elements . It &apos;s composed by two elements .
From a side , this lian lian lian lian of huge , and it &apos;s a huge of huge , harmin and slightly slowly .
It &apos;s a little bit of the piece of the bag that alters a little bit the consciousness , but it &apos;s myself choices with the leaves of the family of the family of the family Psychotry .
This plants is powerful powerful , very similar to serotonin the serotonin the deal , methods , methods , methoxyltryltryltryltryltryltrady .
If you ever see Yanomami to the Yanomami to the suscity that make by a different species , which is methods methods methods , it &apos;s methods .
Tirate that pollus on the nose is is a little bit like to be disappeared by a pint-board dies and land on a set of electricity . Rather creates a distorm . Raissue of reality .
I went to often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who had scened the psychedelic , with his discovery of the discovery swalking decade .
And I mean , my tese countries can &apos;t classified these triptames like , because if you &apos;re doing not telling any of being .
It &apos;s possible to horally if you make some other chemicals that money to the MAO .
Now , it &apos;s the beautiful : the carboline , which are the MAO , the same kind of MAO , the same kind of necessary , and the same kind of necessary , in a 80,000 species of plants , like these are the floor of 80,000 species of plants , like these people are in the way , they make these are , but if you combined in this way , they make a version , they make a very much time .
We use the great eufemism of the prova and the error , which can reveal infruit .
But if we ask to the Indians , they will say , &quot; Pholding us are talking about . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribe , Cofan , the Cofan , 17 variety of the Ehububrbringing in the forest , and that our eyes would be in the same species .
If we ask him how they stabilish their tape will tell us , &quot; I thought I was going to say , &quot; I thought I was not going to do it ? &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : they get 17 variety in a notice of the moon of the moon and each one will be a different song with a different tone .
With this is not slaurea Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than contate the prise .
Now , &#91; applauses &#93; the problem is that even the ones that have the people who have to be the house cuer , but somehow reduced the history of history in our world &apos;s history to our real world , and pass beyond .
In fact , the century , between 300 years , not going to be remember for his wars or the technology , but rather as the one of the technology that we stopped and actively actively actively actively , and we have active active degree of biological diversity and cultural distruction , the problem of the planet . Now the problem is not change .
All cultures through centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibility of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians have not to be Sioux when they put up to Sioux when they put it back to the arc and foot as the Americans have when they put out out of the horse and ceiled .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that they mind the integrity of ethnosphere . It &apos;s the power . It &apos;s the power .
South of domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you will discover that these are not destined to disappears .
They are living and dynamic , they &apos;re going to be hyidentifiable to identifiable their ability of adaptation .
It &apos;s a little bit of disbosing in the patries of the Penan --
a population of Sarawak , in Sarawak , a population , a population that has lived in the forest of the forest , and now reduced the next reduced , and now reduced the region of the region of the region of the region that seems to be in the Morth . And then the Japanese Mdiary , where the navi navyours to the horizonomte , where the horizonorce the horipath hories ,
You have to repull the stives with the stream .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that have come with the discovery of the gold .
If we move on the mountains of the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the wall of the political domination .
As the genocide , the extinction of a population , is condanned to the universal level , but the ethnium of life , not only is constructed , but it &apos;s not only condannect , but it &apos;s also a craft in , because it makes part of the development , because it makes part of the development .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of the Tibet until you go from the beginning .
I spent 6,000 miles from China in the Western China in the Western Tibet , and coming in Lhasa with a young , but only came to Lhasa young , but only came to Lhasa I &apos;ve realized what &apos;s behind .
6,000 degrees sacred reduces in pollus and centers .
1.2 million people killed from military military during Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was asked to Panched to Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed to the time of the Chinese invasion .
His guy with Santity in Santity during the diaspora that has brought the people in Nepal .
She was imprisoned and his colpa was recisy .
It was taken to hidden in career to the age of two years , hidden his gonna because he couldn &apos;t have lived without him .
The sister , who did the same , it was put it in a result of reeducation .
A day has inavverted a day wind a raffuring fashion Mao and , for this transgression , was put forced to seven years .
The Tibet of the Tibet can be insatic , but the path reduction of the population is by touched .
And then it &apos;s the end , it all reduces .
We want to live in the world world of the monocring of the world or we want to collect the policromatical world of diversity ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before we died said that its bigger &apos;s bigger , in our own living in this amority of the world , we &apos;re not just going to see the whole amma of human imagination , but one day a limited limited limited to a modality of thinking , but one day we &apos;re going to wake us to be able to be able to be able to be able .
And it &apos;s a humiliating that our species is existed for 60,000 years .
The Rivolution Neolitica , which has given us , which has been doing us to socket to the cult of see , and replacing the poetry of the slide , and by the next next to the next to the clerarchy of specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The industrialized world &apos;s about 300 years .
The history of history not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we &apos;re going to be in the millennia to come .
When these miriadies of the world is asked what it means to say to be human , they respond to to be human voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all return the possibility of being what we are , a kind of consciousness , that we have to be what we are , in a way that everybody &apos;s people and fiord . And there are great moments of optimism .
I &apos;ve taken this picture on the north of Baffin , when I went to the hundred of balene with the Inuit , and this man , and this man , and this man , and he told me the wonderful story of his nonn .
The canadvice is not always gentile with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to stabilier our suprematise , we have to reach them in colonies .
The non-this man of man refused to go .
The family , temples for his life , he bred it all the arms , and all of his own attractivity .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t feel the cold , they sweather .
The pacels of the slites were made of fish floor in the bag .
The non-this man of man &apos;s not made from the artica or of the blizer , or from the blizard that was suffing .
It &apos;s broken out , it &apos;s broken the bag of foca and defecated in their hand . When you did it , they were congeled , it &apos;s working on a model .
He &apos;s spread salive on the dots of this cail crowd and when he became solid , he killed a dog .
He had a dog and created a little bit , with the tory cassa , with the tory cassa sled slate , and it &apos;s slide another dog and it &apos;s disappears on the banchisa , and it &apos;s banchisa in the rest .
We want to talk about cavarsely ? &#91; Raism &#93; . And that , in different ways , &#91; Applausi &#93; is the simple of the population of the population of Indigenes and all the world .
In 1999 , the canadvanced the U.S. She redded to the total control of California and Texmed Texmed together .
It &apos;s their new patries . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a territory territory . They contrict all the mineraries .
One of the splendid-state national state can recognize with his population .
And , finish , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious at least who of us was in these areas of the planet , make it connects that they don &apos;t have remote remote .
For someone &apos;s home .
They know , the sections of human imagination that rising the other time . And for us all , the dreams of these children , as the dreams of our children , as the sample of hope .
For finish , we &apos;re not going to be convints that politicians will never get to anything to be going to be nothing .
We believe that polemy --
&#91; Ausi &#93; are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month our sit 35 million living . Every month our sit 35 million living .
156 countries transmitted our television .
Our reviews are several miles from millions of people .
Our work is traveling to the ethnosphere to bring our public waste to be in the ethnon-broads to how they saw and hopefully , hopes will hope to be in the central reveal of anthropology : the market in the different world , and we have to find a lifestyle in a world , and we have to find a style lifestyle in a world &apos;s living in a world , and we have to find a living in a world &apos;s easy living in a world .
in which the wisdom of all the people can contributed to our collective benefit .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope reone else that I &apos;ve heard and I &apos;m going to evidence some of the colleagues , in case , not notice .
I &apos;d like to start with what I call &quot; the dogm of the official dogma .
The dogma dogma of what ?
The dogma dogma of all the Western industrial society . The drow dogma official , &quot; If we want to men the benefit of our citizens . &quot;
The reason is , from a side , in fact that freedom is in the fact that the freedom is actually a value , useful , for the human beings .
At the other is in fact that if we &apos;re libest , each of us can do it to do everything that massive our benefit , without any one that decided to our benefit .
The way to massive freedom is to men the choice .
More choices people have , more liberedownload , and greater is their freedom , most of them is their well-being .
This , I think , it &apos;s so deply radicated in the society that no one dream of the methor in the society that no one &apos;s going to be in the back .
And it &apos;s also deeply radicated in our lives .
I &apos;ll show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m going to allow a simple review of conducting .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conducts , without contact 10 variety of oil . And the 12 aceties that you can buy a huge number of conduction that you can buy a huge number of conducting in the result of the remarkable conduction that nobody &apos;s already to be a honest .
Here &apos;s the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic to buy a stereo : case , CDDDs , CD , radio , radio , radio , radio , radio , radio ,
And in this single negotial store , there &apos;s a big number of audio .
We can do six million different combinations of different combinations using the components that there are one store .
You have to admit that there &apos;s a lot of choice .
Other fields : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all the phone of the phone of the phone of the phone that they were forniture by mama Bell .
It was born the phone , they didn &apos;t buy it .
And one of that , one of that , one was that the phone was that the phone had never been in .
These times have gone .
Now we have a variety almost the illimited of phones , especially between the cellular phones .
Here &apos;s the future cellular cellate .
My favorite is the midle , MMP3 , MP3 , Mathers , and shapeli for the eyes .
If you don &apos;t have seen you still seen in the house , you &apos;re certaints that will be going to be going to be .
And what &apos;s the end is that people are in the gozes and does this question . And you know what the answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell that doesn &apos;t do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the aquarters , it would be the same explosion of choices .
Asanitarian existence : not happens in the United States that you go from doctor and doctor , what you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do , or B , or B , &quot; As &quot; A , &quot; BB &apos;s these benefits . What do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Dr. &quot; What should I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; You have these benefits and risks , and B has these benefits and these risks . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebats , &quot; Dr. &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not . &quot;
The result of the result of the disease , &quot; expression that makes it seems a bedrop thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not a fish and responsibility to make decisions of having decisions from someone who knows something , which is that there &apos;s no one other -- and almost certainly , and almost certainly , and then not in the condition to make a patient decisions .
There is a huge marketing products , direct to people like me and you , that if you think about it doesn &apos;t have any sense , that if you think there &apos;s no sense , that we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why are they published them ?
The answer is that they want to be dominant to call the doctor to change it .
Something like this is the class of our hythemselves is a question of choice , as you see in this jamped , &quot; we don &apos;t want to be forced to be a hereditive . We &apos;re going to be a right right now , we don &apos;t hert .
And we can reinvent how many times we have to get us .
which means that every morning , to decide that , to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I &apos;m putting the family and mathemselves , a time time , a common , square communicated , almost anyone , and it was going to be able , and he started to make the most possible possible .
The only choice was with who , not when , not even when , not even , and not even what to do after .
Ogyday , it &apos;s really to play .
I teach to a very smart students , and they do 20 percent in less than a time .
And not because they &apos;re not smart , not because they &apos;re not not not because they are less diligent .
But why I &apos;m impensieritites , I mean , I would like to go or not ? I would have to do it now ? &quot;
&quot; I would have to move more ? I have to think about the children or career ? &quot;
They are interrogorant .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this implement doesn &apos;t completing the companies that you don &apos;t get a beautiful vooting a beautiful vity to my exercise .
And they have to do it . I &apos;m really important questions .
Now , the job : we &apos;re lucky , as Carl Soineen , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from Hotel Randolph .
In the parentesis , there &apos;s a angolin , and I &apos;m not going to no one , where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t say , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , this incredible freedom of choice we have to continuously decided to do , continuously , if we have to do it or not .
We can go to the calculate our son , with the cell phone in a task , Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , typically , on the ginockyia .
And even if I &apos;m all spended , every minute that we see our son , we also see our child , we also ask , &quot; I have to spend this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? I have to habboards this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , &quot; that makes the experience of partners of your child , very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the look at , little and big , little and big material and objects , life is a choices , life is a choices .
Once the world was this : Over , there were some possibility , but it was not a choice .
The world today is a dilemma today : The dilemma is , &quot; Is it &apos;s a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Scicil .
We all know , positive layers we all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative ones .
This is a choice of two effects of the people on .
The first , paradoxally , is that produced paralysis that liberation .
And many of the options that choose , it becomes very hard to do it .
You give you an example , significant , a study conducted on the plans of volunteer .
A colleagues had access to the data of Vanhead , the giant society of the source of the workers in 2,000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of adesion , the percentage of switches .
With 50 source , there &apos;s 10 percent of the source of the deadesions to when they are available only five . Why ?
Because with 50 source of the source that choose , it &apos;s maledetailed , and the choice is is remanded to the indomordered .
And domories , and of domories , domories , domories , of course , domored , of course , domorders , of course , domorders , of course , domorders , domorders , domorders , of course , domorange , of course , domories , domories , of course , domorders , of course , domorders , and of course ,
You can &apos;t just mean that these works from old people who are going to be eating for cans because they don &apos;t have enough money , because they don &apos;t have enough money , to say that the decision is so obstic that they lose the complementary complementary .
Not teaching , they &apos;re losing , they &apos;re losing to five dollars a year from the dator of work , which would be going to be going to be going to be .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too much .
And I think that makes the world so .
&quot; And finish , for the ethernity : ketchup , feelape or mayonese ? &quot;
You would like to be the right decision , if it &apos;s for ethernity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and nepurchoices the wrong .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can avoid paralysis , and we finally are less satisfacts of how we would be with less options that choose .
And that &apos;s for different reasons .
One of these is that with many conducts that you choose , if you buy a choose , and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would be better . And what &apos;s happening is that the alternative imagined us , and the repieces of choice , and the repieces of the choice , and the soft defation of the choice , and it &apos;s defation of the decision , and it &apos;s sure ,
even when it was a very good decision .
More choices there are , more it &apos;s easy than any detail of any detail of the option of choice .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call cost-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert aslead very well pressing as the value that we see things that we see on things that we are confronted .
In the rest , when there are many options , it &apos;s easy representing the characteristics of alternative alternative characters and be less satisfying of the option that you have choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m wrong all with all of the ones that are not in New York .
But that &apos;s what you probably would be .
There &apos;s this pia of Hamptons .
A place of light .
It &apos;s splendida . Otyma days . It &apos;s all about them .
Nothing . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , malite , is Agost . &quot;
&quot; All my neighbor in Manhattan are so on . &quot;
&quot; I could talk about the home . &quot;
And it &apos;s spend two weeks that &apos;s lost of the idea that &apos;s lost -- every day -- the possibility of talking where it wants .
The cost-opportunity cos-opportunity cost for what we have , even when the choice was also the choice .
And the more of options we have to consider , the more active characteristics will return out to be against as a construction .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
We talk about the living time , and maybe the living slowly .
But the most important point is that any thing you choice , you choose , you choose to not do other .
The things we don &apos;t choose have a tactivity that can make less attractive what we do .
Tirst point : spiral growing of expectations .
I tried to my skin bought a new jeans .
It &apos;s almost always jeans .
And once the jeans were one of a guy , compressed and they were scomfortable , they were scomfortable , only after they had a life and they were sunce , just after they started to go well .
So I went to buy a couple of it , when the old ones were gone , and said , &quot; I said , &quot; I need a couple jeans , this is my cutting . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Ley &apos;s slim , fit , relaxy , relaxy , relaxed ? &quot;
Who wants to do it or bottons ? &quot; Stonewashed &quot; &quot; or &quot; Stonewashed &quot; or &quot; ? &quot;
&quot; Who wants to be struck ? &quot;
&quot; Sow the blind or street ? Boy bla bag baby .
I was balordit , and after a little bit I was able to say , &quot; I want the guy that was the only guy , &quot; he had no idea , &quot; he had no idea what I tried to be , so for a time I tried to be , then using the best guy , then using the best guy , and then , with the best purst , with the best jeans that I had ever .
It was the best . I had all that choice .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand it .
The reason I was very worse is that with all the choice , the whole choice , the jeans had to be lost .
And I didn &apos;t expectations . I didn &apos;t expectation of exciting . I didn &apos;t expect a kind of , but when there was a different kind of a different kind of , hundred , at least a kind of perfect .
What I had buy was good , but not perfect .
After I had talked to the choose with what I was in the confronted to expectations .
The addition of options in life doesn &apos;t make people that they have to increase the expectations that have respect to the ector of options .
And that will produce less satisfying , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing marketing .
Because if they knew it , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more like this .
&quot; It was better when you were worse when he was worse . &quot; The reason that it was better when you were worse when he was worse , it was still , you could actually meet it .
Ogyday , in the world that we live -- opulents , industrialized , industrialized , the maxpection of perfection -- the massive that we can hope is the things to the height of expectations .
You never surprised places because your expectations , the expectations , they &apos;re ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Basis , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , &quot; Basis , &quot; Do , &quot; Yes , &quot; Basis , &quot; Did , &quot; Basis , &quot; Do , &quot; Yes , &quot; Basse &apos;s
I mean , small moment , the autobiographic moment -- which I &apos;m actually moved and I &apos;m really saying .
I couldn &apos;t have to do better , I didn &apos;t have accomplished .
But it &apos;s not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of buy a couple of jeans scomfortable when there &apos;s only that kind of jeans is that when you &apos;re not satisfied , and ask you , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot; The answer is clear .
The world is the responsible . What could I do ?
When there are hundreds of types of jeans , and you buy a insoft , and you ask you who is the responsible , it &apos;s as a responsible , it &apos;s as clear that you .
You could do better .
With hundreds of variety , there are no scratch scosen .
So when people are decisions , even though the result is valid , they feel insodented and they &apos;re going to be the color to their own .
In the last few years , depression is exploss in the industrialized world .
I think a fatter meaninger -- not the only one , but the only important , of this wave of depression is that people have experiences of the people because standards are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation thinking that the color is they &apos;re .
So the final result is that in general , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely falong . It &apos;s not true .
There is no doubt doubt that a little bit better than they don &apos;t have a lot of choice , but it wasn &apos;t a lot of choice .
There is a critical value , magical . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m quite sure we &apos;ve been survey that we &apos;ve been surrounded by the level that choices better our life .
Now , from the political point of view -- I &apos;ve almost finished -- from political point , the notion is the following .
What allows is the material in industrial society is the wealth of material .
There are many places in the world , and you know about the problem that they don &apos;t have a lot of choice .
The problem is they have too pocket .
So the factor that I &apos;m talking about is a malesclusive of modern , recidly , recidly societies .
And what it does have to do is , Steve Levitt is , Steve Levitt talked about how I those costable and slide to be useful . It &apos;s a spread of money . It &apos;s a spread of money .
I mean , these choices , complicated and dispendepend , it &apos;s not that they &apos;re just useful .
I &apos;m going to be connected .
They do worse .
If a little bit of the choices that are allows a little choice was reversed in those where people have too few possibilities , not just their lives , not just their lives .
This is what economists call a parethan improvement .
A redistribution of the region is good at all -- not only to poor -- because of this choices of choices that go .
To conclusion , you can become everything you want to be , &quot;
You , people , think , &quot; What does that think about , &quot; What does that fishing ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t make anything in a glass of glass . &quot;
&quot; An inactuated , a limited vision of the world -- &quot;
and I &apos;ve been interpreted in this , at the beginning .
But then , thinking about , I realized that that fish the weight knowledge .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you eat the mock , in a way that &quot; everything is possible , &quot; you don &apos;t get freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you romot the broke in a way that all divents possible decrease .
You know , you know , and you reduced the well-being .
Everybody needed a sphere .
This is almost certainly too stricken , maybe even for the fish , and of course for us .
But the axim of some symbolic symbolic for unhappiness and , though , for running .
Thank you very much .
