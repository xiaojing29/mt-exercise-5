The last year I showed these slidemonstrated to show that the cotta climb , which for almost three million years , has had the size of 48 percent of the United States continental continental , has reholding 40 percent .
Yet this underestimate gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice of the ice of the ice .
The cotta climate is , in a sense , the pulser cue is , in a sense , the pulsant heart of the global climate .
It expands inverian and it rities .
The next slide is going to be a rapid cared on on the last 25 years .
The ice lennia are signed in red .
You see , they expand down to the blue .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter , which is the summit .
You can see that the cost ice , the dumb , of five years or more , is like the blood , which is the blood , which is five years from the body .
In 25 years , it was passed by this , at this .
This is a problem because the interests that the interests the ground of the arctic , where there are huge amount of congelated , which , science that , science , which , they come into the microbes .
I read to the totality of the atmospheric inquish , that amount could radical , the amount of the task , super-point point point point , super-point point point point .
In some little laghi in Alaska , the metane is already rebed by water .
The professority Katey Walter of University of Alaska was wonderful lake with a team winter layer .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : The question is if we &apos;re going to be .
A reason is that this term wonder , the term surring the Greenland from north .
This is a fighter in regimes .
The laped had never reached levels .
This is the river Kangerlush , in the South of Greenland .
If you want to know how the level of the sea level for the ice of the ice slide on the terrain of the ice , here is where it is reaching the sea .
These corrents are increasing rapidly .
At the other hand , the biggest block of ice ice , the biggest block of ice planet .
The scientists have declared the ice of the ice is in negative , and the Antarctic , and that the Antarctica , which is particularly on some islands , which is particularly remain the shake .
Equive at six feet of the watching of the wild , like in Greenland .
Sull Himalayas , the third largest block of ice , and they see the new laghot , that a few years ago were glacy .
40 percent of the world population is half of water from the powerful water from the slightly .
Sulle Ande : this ice water source of this city is the source of the water of this city .
The late is increased .
But when it diminises , the same accounts to water .
In California , the Nevada Sierra is decrease , it &apos;s decrease .
The hydrops are in the crisis .
The predictions , as you read , are graves .
The growth of the world is a remarkable increases .
The environmental disasters are increasing in a rhythm out of the normal and without precedented .
Four times more numerous in the last 30 years , I &apos;ve been realized for the last 75 .
This is a sustainable ,
If you look in the historic context , if you can see the consequences .
Of the last five years , we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of tons in the oceans every day .
Look at the area of the East Pacific , from American , and on the American , and on both parts of the Indian subcontinent , where there is a radical impoverments of the obxyging in the oceans .
Most of global warming , together to deforestation , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossil fuels .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States are one of the two of the countries with the most emissions , together at China .
And he was proposed to build a lot of other central central .
But we &apos;re seeing a change of direction .
These are the projects in the last few years and some alternative alternative .
At every way , there &apos;s a politics in our country .
The carbon industries and oil are oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon , which is a hosysts .
That picture me , I remember something --
Natal Very , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion lbox scories of carbon .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the second biggest flow in America .
It &apos;s happened around Natal .
The natalization of one of the carbon industries was this .
Video : the carbon , the carbon is a kind of a high and happy .
It &apos;s above here in America , and growing our economy .
Froseelty is and more and it &apos;s clean .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and work , they keep the stipendent .
Al Gore : From here , and that &apos;s the West Virginia .
The biggest minerary society on the mountains is Massey Coal . This is the amministrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : Sarry , Nancy Pelosis , Nancy Pelosis , Harry Reid -- don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Protection of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Ator : At COALergy see the climate change as a serious mine as a serious tiny .
So , our priority is invest a big amount of money in a effort of a public effort to make public and confuses the truth .
In fact , the carbon is not sporting .
We think it &apos;s clean , it &apos;s also good .
So , not preoconate of climate change .
Let me do .
Video : Ator : Hot bone clean -- you &apos;ve heard a very much .
So let &apos;s take a turn into a stream to a date for how about how about the carbon .
Stradary ! The machines are a little noor , but this is the sound of the technology of the puleg of the technology of the clean .
The carbon consumption is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology of the clean , and the remarkable paper that you see changes everything .
You know , a look , this is the hate watching carbon clean .
Al Gore : Finally alternative alternative and connects to the economic issue and the national security .
Video : Sehy-America is criped ; the economy , the national security , the national security .
The filter that lines all : our dependence from fossil combustible beautiful , like the spork and oil .
But now , there &apos;s a new audace solution for it .
Repower : 100 percent of the clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan for reputting America to make safer safety , and help to stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that &apos;s solving our problems .
Repower .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It &apos;s getting energy to America .
One of the faster ways to get the dependence from the combustible that killed our planet .
She &apos;s : The future is here . Vink , suncle new energy .
She &apos;s going to have two : Novi investment for places of places ,
Commove : Sot America . It &apos;s time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old old old old old , &quot; If you want to go fast , you go .
If you want to go away , go back , you go . &quot;
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED I did a feckliar on the LHC .
And I promise to return you about how the machine works .
So I comes . And for the ones that the other time , there was no LHC is the biggest scientifiever ever trial -- 27 miles of circumstance .
Her compiece is to required the conditions that were present less than a second of the universe -- until at 600 million times a second .
All this is just environment .
This is the machine under Ginevening .
We photographed these mini-Big Bang within the reevening .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- is 44 feet .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in buildings so you can see the proportions .
Ten September 10 wealth , we accent the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was cause of huge festegment in control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first particles that had done all the way of LHC , walking into collision , and with a part of the LHC , and it &apos;s diffonto a part of the LHC , and particles inside the resilic .
In other words , when we see that picture , we saw that picture , we realize that the machine worked , which is a great vicycle .
I don &apos;t know if it was to do it , when somebody went to Google and saw that the page was this .
That means that we had a cultural impact impact to the scientific .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , and it had to these files here -- these dored files .
These files bring 13,000 ampounds when the machine works the powerful of the power .
Now , the technical technicians , and will say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . They &apos;re too unusually . &quot;
And instead , they can do it because when they &apos;re very cold files become the cost of superconductor .
So , at less 271 degrees , at a inferior temperature at that the space between stars , these files can bring that running that rent .
In one of the younger of novemisle , the magnets in LHC , there was a fad of factory .
So the files surprising the watered , and 13,000 ampounds of suddenly met .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magnets weight more than 20 tons , and that have moved of about 30 feet .
They &apos;re damaged about 50 magnets .
We had to take them , what we had to do .
We &apos;ve been repristined and traveled .
Now they &apos;re coming back to their place .
By the end of marzo LHC will be new integro .
We &apos;ll happen it , and we expect it to get the data or light , and continuing our adventure to the way our adventure to find what the morning to find the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these things are doing , these accidents reaccening the debate on the value of science and engineering . It &apos;s easy to confuture .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact of going beyond limits , I think that &apos;s the value of things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of a Institute scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , imagine , in the defense of the inuseful experiments of his pupillo , his pupiler was Michael Faraday , said , &quot; Nithing is so dangerous for the progress of the human mind as the rest of the human mind that the ideas of science as the ideas of defense that our trionds of our trionds , and that our triononers are conquish conquish conquisn &apos;t consues .
Thank you .
I want to start wondering , when , from children , playing , from children , playing caved windownload .
While you &apos;re going to reach them and relate them , take them and get them , and move them , learned actually to think and solve problems and manipulating problems and manipulating relatives .
The reasoning reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , from the information , we were inspired by our interaction with physics , together my consult , and at my hand Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to asking me , &quot; And if we &apos;re going to asking me , &quot; And if we &apos;re going to have the computer , instead of the mouse as a digital polpast as a digital policy that you digital that you move my hands , we could released a walong , we could have the holder ,
and systems our ployment ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a whole active computer as a beautiful .
In a few words , a Siftable is a whole active computer as a beautiful .
You can move them with the hand , they can see , &quot; you know , &quot; you &apos;re in their movement and they have a screen and a radio and a rawireless .
But above , I &apos;m physics , like the morning , you can move them just up with a little bit .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystems to manipping the digital information .
And as they become more physical , consciousness of the movement , and as they become more physical , and as they become more physical , of the other people , how we can explore new and fun size stilds of interaction .
I &apos;ll start with a few example .
This Siftable is configurated to show the video : if I just just incline in a direction , the video , it will rotate from the other hand back .
These are conscious of the other other people .
If I go back and I go around them .
If they come surrounded , they &apos;ll see it and they can act a little bit .
If they come surrounded , they &apos;ll see it and they can act a little bit .
They also have their movement and include .
We realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power to use community of data , for example , &quot; a color like , &quot; a color like a color as if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable as a very center , and I can use them to green color in the central color in the central , where they &apos;re missing .
And I can use them to use them to the color in the central , where they &apos;re missing .
We can actually get too much , we can put a little bit .
They also beautiful possibility of learning , like languages , the mathematics and ployment , where people can try to try things things quickly , and see the immediately .
Now I &apos;m --
This is a Fibonaces that I do with a equations program .
Here we have a game of words that is in the middle of Scarabeo and Boggle .
Pratically , at every turn , you get a letter to a case on every Siftable , to every turn on a case on a case on every Siftable on every Siftable , and while he &apos;s control on a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new sletters and new possibility to try and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s children came to the Media Lab , I did so that they would try them and I spent them and I spent them and I spent them a video .
They &apos;re very lived .
And one of the interesting things of this application is that you don &apos;t have to have to people in the very instructions .
You &apos;ve got to say , &quot; Compons of words , &quot; and they know what to do .
Here &apos;s some other people who come from .
This is our younger tester tester , there on the right .
It actually wanted to implement them .
They were just morning , for him .
Now , this is an application of an interactive cardboard .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of languages is Felix .
It can put the new characters in the scene , suncle , suncable .
It can put the new characters in the scene , suncle , suncable .
Here &apos;s , he &apos;s going to get out of the sun .
Video : Sun is sunce .
David Merrill : Now , it brought a treator in the scene .
Video : The treator is .
Bel work ! Yes ! Yes !
So schooling Siftable and put them close can interact the personally --
Video : Bau !
So , by inventing your story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a story with the open , and it can decide him as it .
DM : It &apos;s a story with the open , and it can decide him as it .
Volas : Get out .
DM : The last example that I have time to show you is a tool , realized by a recent , to sample and exeguy .
It &apos;s a tool , realized by recently , to sample and exeating music .
The Siftable here is moving sound like base , base and the bacteria .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also put these sound in a sequence to compose these sounds in a sequence to your placement .
And modify it just to touch a &quot; sound &quot; and a sequence . &quot;
These are actually control from the vive , like the reverse and the filter .
It &apos;s the date sound to a particular sound and then including it .
And then there are the general effects as time and volume , that they apply to the whole sequence .
Let &apos;s look at how it works .
Video : We &apos;re going to start putting a base in two Siftable , &quot; sequence , we extend it in a series , we extend , add base .
Now I put a baseline .
Video : Now , I add to percussions --
Video : And now I &apos;ll put the filter to the bacteria , so I can control the effect from the view .
Video : I can speed the entire sequence inking the entire sequence by one side or the other .
Video : And now I &apos;ll add the filter to the bottom to get more expression .
Video : I can reombing the sequence &quot; sequence &quot; to the flight . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to plan it before , but I can suddenly make it longer or more corther .
And now , finally , I can smoking the whole sequence , by the Siftable , &quot; Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new man , and more like our brain car and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some possibility that we &apos;re trying to bring out from the lab .
The concept that I want to transmit is that &apos;s coming from this new generation of designed to interact with digital media , that will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time to talk to all of you .
I &apos;m a writer .
Books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , obviously .
It &apos;s also the love and the fascination of my life .
And I don &apos;t expect that it can change .
But , said this , something particular has happened in my life and my career , who bring me me me me to realibrating the entire relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this whography called &quot; Mangon , &quot; which , a lot of the things that are coming out of my books , for some reason best-care , for some reason that was going to be a big , sensitive , sensitional bestseller .
And the result is that everywhere goes now , people treat me as if they were condances .
It &apos;s true -- condanned ,
They come from me now , everybody &apos;s worried and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t fear that you can &apos;t do better ?
You don &apos;t fear to continue to writing for all life without power , without more living to someone ? &quot;
What can you care to somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s rassure , you know .
But it could go worse , part of that I remember more than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent -- that I wanted to be a written .
I &apos;m going to meet the same reaction .
And people said , &quot; You don &apos;t feel you can &apos;t get successful ?
You don &apos;t fear that the humiliation of the refoods ?
You don &apos;t fear of this all life without the living without any life that nothing was going out and die on a cumulo of every infrants with the mouth of date ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I have afraid of all those things .
I &apos;ve always had a pair .
And I also have a lot of other things that people may not inate .
As the food and other things .
But , as much about the writing what I thought and I was wonderful , because ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logical that anyone has been waiting by being a job that you feel like to do .
But what &apos;s so particular in the creative creative to make us nervous about the mind of the mental health .
How my father , for example , he was a chemical and I don &apos;t remember a once in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if she was asked if you fear to be able ?
There was never -- that block in John engineer , how it goes ?
It didn &apos;t work like that , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
Onestly , chemical engineers as group have not , in the centuries , in the centuries , the reputation of being high colized manized .
We have enough , we have enough reputation , and not just writers but creative of all kinds , we have this reputation of being huge , we have this reputation of being huge .
And it doesn &apos;t rests more about the trists of the dead of the magnificent of the magnificent wind , just in the 21st century , died young , they died young .
And even the ones that don &apos;t have suicidated , they &apos;re really very displaced by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before I died , in the last interview said , &quot; Every book killed me a little bit more . &quot; A very amazing for work .
But we don &apos;t bad at the time when we heard these things so long that somehow we &apos;ve heard these things very long that somehow interior and accepted the notion that creativity and the suffering and the ceiling and the art , at the end .
And the question I want to ask everybody here is : are you agree with this idea ?
It &apos;s OK , that &apos;s going to you this thing -- because it &apos;s also not good for anything for anything .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous and I don &apos;t want to see it perpetuate in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better encourage our big creative minds to live .
And I know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start figing to that I was in my career of suppositions , above the circumstances that I &apos;m in my career .
So , really -- I mean , I &apos;m a young , I have about 40 years .
I have still about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything writing in the time , it will be judged by the world as the work that was going after my last book .
I &apos;m going to be cut , because we &apos;re all the bigger friends here -- is likely that my biggest successful is to my hand .
Oh , Gesus , who think .
You know this is the kind of thinking that &apos;s a person to start a burn to start a bere in the nine of morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would keep doing this work that we love .
So , the question becomes , how do you ?
And so it looks like , after a lot , that the way to work to continuing to writing is to create a psychological construct , okay ?
I have to find a distance of safety between me , who I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxy on what reaction is going to get the written the model will get . And as a look at the last year model how to do it begin to find other society to see if they could have better ideas and more and more under ideas and more and more and more under ideas and more and more and more under ideas and more and more under ideas and more and more and more and healthy ideas and and more and more and more and healthy ideas
how to help people creative to make the inerent risks emotional inherent risks of creativity .
And that research has brought me to the ancient Greeat and ancient Rome .
Seguitems because it gets into a circle and then back .
In ancient Greeat and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity to the human human human , OK ?
It thought that creativity was this spirit of the beautiful divine and sell people somehow distant and sell men somehow distant and unknown for reasons and unknown .
The Greeks were called these beyond the beyond the &quot; deons .
Socry , wonderful , he believed to have a demone that elevate wisdom .
The Romans were the same idea , but they call the the kind of spirit without a genius .
which is great , because Romans didn &apos;t think that a genius was a very smart .
They thought that a genius was this kind of divine that was created that that was created literally in the walls of a artist , a little bit like the elphoto , and that came out to the work of the argument of the artist and model the result of that job .
Here &apos;s eye -- this is the distance of which is the distance of which -- that psychological construct you from the results of your work .
And they all knew that was so that it was going to work , right ?
So the anticient artists were protected by certain things , like the narcism , not ?
If your work was except for your job , you couldn &apos;t take all the market , everybody knew that you had been helped by this genius .
If your work , it was not all the fallies , it wasn &apos;t all cool , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be an inable .
And so people han concept creativity in the West for a long time .
And then Rened the Rened came and everything changed , and everything changed , and nacize this big idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe and mysteries and not leaving space to creatures that wrote from the divinced .
This was the principle of rational humanesimum , and people started thinking that creativity was completely about the hydle .
And for the first time in history , he started referred to this or that is like a rather than a genius as a genius with genius .
And I have to tell you that I think it was a big herror .
I think that you allow somebody , a simple person to believe that it &apos;s like a reciplip , the essence and the source of all the divine , creative , unknown and the source of all the divine , and you know , a lot of to give the pagile the poor that human humbers .
It &apos;s how to ask someone to ingoes the sun .
Deform and fully it completely , and it creates all these ingestimates expectations on performance .
And I think it was this pression to destroy artists in the past 500 years .
And if that &apos;s true , and I think that &apos;s , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between human and mystery .
Or perhaps not .
Maybe we can &apos;t sing 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience that would solve required scientific , and you know , you do that , you do , you do that they sfed on their projects .
And I &apos;m probably not going to you all about this thing .
But the question that I would like to ask is -- why not ?
Why don &apos;t you think that way ?
Because it has more sense of everything that you &apos;ve ever heard to explain the exasperant impredicbility of creative process .
A process that , as everybody who ever have tried to do something -- so , fundamentally , everybody here -- you don &apos;t know rationally behavior .
And in fact , it can look completely paranormal .
I &apos;ve done this met with the extraordinary poetched Ruth Stone , who now now 90 years old , but that was a poetic for all life and said that during his childhood in the Virginia , working out in the camps , and feel , in the welells was going to be in the field .
He said that he was like a wonderful slandscape .
And that was rolling up to her landscape .
He heard it , because he was tremendous to the earth under its .
He knew he had one thing to do that point and it was , words , he was words like a map . &quot;
And so correct to the house and he was followed by this poetry , and it wouldn &apos;t have to take a piece of paper and a fairly faster , and it would accurate it and released it on the page .
Sometimes it couldn &apos;t be fast , so correct and correct and correct and correct without having home and the poetry her and the poetry and she losed her and she would continued to roll through the landscape , looking at , and she would continued to be able to a little bit of a poet . &quot;
Then there were times -- this piece , I &apos;ll never forget the extended -- there were moments where the stone was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was looking for the card and the poetry her and the poetry it was going through , and he was spending on , and he said , that she was slowed , and he was going to handle .
He waved the poem of the tail and he would put it into his body and he was page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page and intatta , but the contrary to the contrary .
So when I heard it -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly the same thing .
It &apos;s not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conducture !
I &apos;m a mulo , and my way of work is ; I &apos;m waking up the same horario every day and work and go and work and go and go and go through it .
But even , in my testardaggin , I &apos;ve strisciated against that thing , sometimes .
And I imagine that many of you do it .
You know , even if the work and ideas came up with the work and ideas were given me , I won &apos;t sure it .
What is this thing ?
And how can we relate it to do it , so we can &apos;t lose the head , but rather , what do you get healthy ?
For how much about , the best example , the best example that I have is the Musician , which I have interviewed in a nal day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of the life has been the incarnation of the artist , trying to control , trying to control , trying to control , to drop these species of totally interested in totally interested .
But then he was told , he was driving , and one day as he was driving on a wild in Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
He was going quickly , and all of a switching this little basic melody , which comes into his head as inspiration , elusive and tricky , and the various , and the desiderery , and the desidererery , and the desiderery , but not know how to take it .
It doesn &apos;t have a piece of card , it doesn &apos;t have a climb .
So he starts to feel this species of old old old anxops in him like , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;ll remark oxed by this persemployed song .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to the panic , he stopped .
He was the whole mental process and did something completely new .
And he just watched the sky and said , &quot; Scause , not see that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; You look like that writing a song right now ?
If you really want to exist , you get back to a hand , when I can take care of you .
Although , you go to the other today .
You know , Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his process worked changed after this .
Not the work , the work was still hard as always .
But the process , and the anxy that was regiven the time that was regided when he was the genius , the genius who had nothing else and libered it back from the way that he was going to realize that it didn &apos;t have to be a interior thing that was going to be a interior .
but it was a peculiar , wonderful , wonderful , a conversation between Tom and this external thing that was not Tom .
So how much you feel that story , I was going to change a little way I was working and I was already .
This idea , he saved when I was writing , &quot; Mangy , &quot; and fall in one of those deppped in one of those deppped in the dependent , that what we &apos;re doing on something and we start thinking about something and we can &apos;t start thinking that it &apos;s worst the worst book , which is the worst book wrote .
Not just bad , right , right the worse book .
And I started thinking about thesis .
But then I remember of Tom who talked to air and try to the air and try .
So I went up my face in my face of my house and I would say my comments to a corner of the room .
And I said , &quot; Sent , what we know that if this book won &apos;t shine , you know that if this book isn &apos;t going to be very stripped my , no ?
Because as I see that I &apos;m going to put everything that I have , not more than that I have ,
So if you want to be better , you have to give you and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , you don &apos;t do it .
I &apos;ll get the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to do for my part of the people who was recorded to me to do my part , &quot; Because , at the end is so , OK -- it does in the deserts of North Africa , the people would be gone for the saying of the deaths of the wonderful , dance and music sacred music that they were going to have a hours and hours .
And they were always magnific , because the ballowed , and they were fantastic .
But every long time , rarely something happened , and one of these artists had become actually transfer .
And I know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know you &apos;ve all seen you &apos;ve all seen , a performance that .
It was like time he was time , and the dance wallowed through a kind of lportal and wasn &apos;t doing anything different from the sun , like the 1,000 nights before , but everything was going .
And suddenly , I don &apos;t just like a human .
But it turned out from the divinside and under illumined in the fire of divinity .
And when this was happening , to the time , the people knew what was , they called him .
They were hang up and start to drowning , &quot; Allah , God , Allah , God , God , God , &quot; God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curiosa night historical -- when the More invasero south of Spain , this habits , and the pronoundary changed in the centuries from &quot; Allah , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; &quot; Okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; Okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O, &quot; , &quot; which you can still feel in the flow .
In Spaina , when an artist did something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , &quot; Okay , &quot; burn , &quot; brown , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; God .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes the dance , the dance , the ballowites , when you woke and discovered that are the 11 of Martedesday and I score it from the morning of the morning of the morning of the morning of the morning of the morning , and I discovered that there &apos;s no longer .
It &apos;s just a death with a bad with a hurt of ginocy , and perhaps it will never be able to get to that altitude .
And perhaps nobody name God as a name of God as a name of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most sweet rewalks to make a creative life .
But maybe not to be so angosciant if you can &apos;t believe , anzyutt , that the most extraordinary expects of your being being being coming from you .
But you just believe that you &apos;re just giving you data in a imaginable source of this squt of your life that you have to go to something else when you &apos;re finished .
And , you know , if we think that it &apos;s all changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s sure how about it for different months in the book that I &apos;m going to do present , the dangerous , dangerous , I &apos;m dangerous , very dangerous , very dangerous success .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I fear electrized by this is , not afraid .
You don &apos;t travel . It just your work .
And that &apos;s going to present you for your part , whatever it can be .
If your work is baling , ball .
If the wine , absurd you decide to left some kind of wonderful , for one moment through your effort , for one moment through your efforts , then &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Otriments , you do the same .
And &quot; Ole it ! &quot;
I think it &apos;s got to you .
&quot; Ole you ! &quot;
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can mean and discovery of new set of genes .
Now we &apos;re starting a new patent : we started digitizing biology and now to go from that digital code we &apos;re going into a new biology , designing and synthesizing and synthesizing life .
We &apos;ve always tried to bring big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; is something that many biologists I think they have tried to understand various levels .
We tried different approach , reducing it to the minimum .
We &apos;re digitizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was going to treat the digital world of the digital world &apos;s digital world of the computer .
Now , we &apos;re wondering , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome of the smaller than the ones that can authorum in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome of them , and we try to create a even smaller .
We are able to eliminate a hundred of genes about 500 that are here .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple respect to our .
Credeters , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this can bring to a living cell .
So we decided that the only way that the only way that the only way that the crowd was to modify the components to bring the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
So we started the adventure of the &quot; we can synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Can the chemistry to produce these big molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create before ?
And in case , we can make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of inert chemical material .
The speed that we &apos;re able to digitize life is growing up to the exponential .
Our capacity of writing the genetic code , rather slowly , but it &apos;s improving .
And our most recently , we have a bunch on an exponential curve .
We &apos;ve started over 15 years ago .
The process has required a lot of past , starting with a bioethical review before the experiments .
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult .
There &apos;s deces of thousands of machines in the world that product little switches of 30 to 50 letters and it &apos;s a process : the most most error is longer , the most error is long , more error there there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these fragments and correct the mistakes .
And that was our first attempt , to start to draw from the digital information of the genome of Phi &apos;s genome of Phi &apos;s genome of Phi &apos;s genome of Phi &apos;s genome of Phi &apos;s genome of Phi &apos;s genome of Phi &apos;s genome of Phi &apos;s genome of Phi &apos;s genome of the Phi &apos;s genome of the genome of
It &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , actually the correction of the error and get a molecule of DNA of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material chemical material and we put it in the bacteria , the bacteria beginning to read this genetic and producurn the viral particles .
The viral particles are then , they were left from cells , are come back and destroyed the E.
I &apos;ve talked about recently with members of the oil industry and they &apos;re going to get them that they have certainly compress this model .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build the same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the biggest things .
We wanted to build the whole battery of the bacteria .
They &apos;re over 580 sletters of genetic code .
So we thought we build it in the size of the virus of the virus , so that we can change the casses to understand what the components of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accurateful standard was a mile for every 10 mile .
We &apos;ve found out , we &apos;ve found it , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence , we &apos;d never be able to do that work .
One part of the process is to design segments , letters that have been segment with all the other segment of 50 letters to build smaller subtle to build smaller subtle .
We &apos;re going to see unique elements here .
You probably have read that we put the flip on the flip .
So , think that &apos;s a genetic code based on four letters : A , C , GGs and T.
Three of those letters together , and they code together , and there &apos;s a specific order of letters for every amminacid .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , sentences .
What we did at the beginning was self-doing .
Some of the fact that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
We &apos;ve designed these segment to be able to just join with enhancing .
There &apos;s fenties that they reped them and put them up .
And we started to assemble of the parts , starting with segment of five to seven to seven to seven to form , and they put them up to the segments of 24 sletters until literally get to 72 myself .
So , every step we made these segments in abundance so we can sequenced them by making a very robbang processes that we &apos;re trying to create a very robbbang .
We &apos;re looking for automatize the process .
So , this seems the tabellone players .
When we get to these very long segment segment , more than 100 middle , they will not grow more directly in the E.
It comes to the limit of modern tools of molecular biology .
So we consider other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called recombination , which is going to be repushed to reppull DNA can get segments .
Here &apos;s a example .
This organism called Deinococcus , called Deinococcus , can absorbed three million radiation .
You can see in the high quadried as his chromosome as his croma destroy .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s reassembly as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can do it completely .
They can live under vacuum .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life exists in space , and you get to find new environment of water .
As the real NASA showed that this is going to happen .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built using these processes , just using the lievidence with the appropriate design of the segments to put .
The lievidence that automatically .
This is not taken with a electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a very big molecule that we can see it with a tough slightly .
These are pictures that they cover a period of six seconds .
This is the publishing that we did a little time ago .
They &apos;re over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the biggest molecule of a definitely created by the man .
It has a molecular molecular hours at 300 million .
If you &apos;re stamazing it with a carat 10 without spaces , they would like 142 pages to just transnaked this genetic code .
Now , how do we do it work ? How can we activate it ?
Of course , through a virus , you know , a virus is a game from girls .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria .
It &apos;s simplest when it is cell of eukars like our : you can simply extract the nucleo and inserves to the nucleo and inserves to another , which is practically the clonically process .
In the peaeye , the chromosome is integrated inside the cells , but we &apos;ve recently showed that we &apos;re able to do a very complete trapion of a cell , from one hell to one and activating it .
We had a crownered chromosome from a microbial species .
The two are different men from the topes .
We added some gene in a way that we can decide what he would choose for this croma .
And then he science with the fyenenzyes so that proteins .
And when we put it in the cells was study -- and we &apos;re going to appreciate our graph -- the new croma has gone into the cellent .
And we were very beginning , but we tried to go , but we tried anyway in the way there .
This is one of the major mechanisms .
We found that many species have added a second or a third or a third or a third or a third of a new thousand training in a second thousand trained to that species .
So who thinks about evolution as a only gene at a time that you have not understanding a lot of the biology .
There are a full further called the restriction that adds digerism that address the DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cells didn &apos;t have one .
The cellula-chromosome that we have inserital .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other croma as a wonderful material , and we found it with just the cell and found it with just the cell and the new croma .
it became blue because of the genes that we &apos;ve inserious .
And in a short of time , all the characteristics of a species have gone lost , and it transformed everything in a new species , based on the new software that we insert in the cells .
All the proteins have changed , the membranes have changed , and when we read the genetic code , you know ,
Now , this may look like genetic , but altering the software DNA , we can change things in a very enough suspend .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that here is not talking about this -- but of progress to come from three million years and a half million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create new version of the Camrian explosion process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s enough to think that &apos;s enough when we think about our need .
We &apos;re going to pass six and a half billion people to nine billion in the next 40 years .
Right to give you an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one in 1946 , in 1946 , there will be four .
We &apos;re going to have now to find food , fresh water and clean , medicinal and wealth for six billion and a half billion people .
It &apos;s even more hard to do it for nine billion .
We &apos;re going to use more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion barils .
That means million barrasses a day .
When we &apos;re trying to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replace them , it &apos;s a huge challenge .
We have to hold the emission of all the emission of CO2 from these materials that ends up in the atmosphere .
At the day , thanks to scientific discoveries all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they are the design components for the future .
The electronics is only a dozen , about a dozen of about components , and think how many different things come out .
Our here are principlally from biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , thank you so , these synthesization , able to create what we call the combinatory genomics .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can produce a million croms that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think about this 20 million different genes or try to get the processing processes to make the processes to produce the processes to produce the vaccines , you can change , through a small team , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology than the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for the possibility of survival , chemistry or carbon , production , and production vaccines .
This is an instantly of some software program on that we &apos;re working on to be able to sit and design species to the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how they will be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
Now we &apos;re focusing on the carbons of the quarter of the quarter .
You also see that you extract ethanol from the grain was a bad experiment .
We have a second and third generation that will use enough to have enough to have a carbons of the higher value as the eight or different types of butanol .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increasing the cost of food and limiting the cost of food and limiting the disponal , and we think about to design that they can reach this cell , and we think we can make this sure , and we think we can have the first carbon , and we think we can have the first carbon of how quarters generation in about 18 months .
The sunlight combined with CO2 is a methodoor -- but in our discoveries in our discoveries all over the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism that we descried in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , about 2500 feet of deep on the time of the water temperature of the water .
They &apos;re doing it from CO2 using hydrogen as a source of energy .
We &apos;re trying to figure out if we can incanalt CO2 , which can easily be transported through the CO2 in carbon , to drive that process .
So we think that we might be able to increase what the question of the base question that &apos;s what the basis that life . &quot; What is the life . &quot; We have the modest target of the obial industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do that by TED , where do you do ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working to use the same methods to create vaccines .
You saw this year with influence , we &apos;re always back to a year and with a dollar when it &apos;s going to find the vaccine right .
I think what you can change by building vaccines in anticipate .
So , here &apos;s how the future could look at changing , now , the tree , accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria , and finally cells .
We &apos;re so much better than people .
Our purpose is to make it a long enough to try to try to try to get it . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;ll show you , the most quickest possible , some fundamental work , of new technology that we brought to a very much one year ago . This is Seadragon . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s a environment where you can interact with a local level that remote with a huge amount of data .
So here we &apos;re seeing a lot of digital pictures with a kind of digital ars with a kind of cost and continue for a quick bread , and continue for a quick bread , and continue to images how we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much the amount of information that we see , how big big collection of data or the images .
Most of digital photographs , but this for example is a scanning from Biilliotecy of Congress , and reentrepreneurs in the gama of 300 megapiels .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that &apos;s just just the number of a system like this is the number of plxeless on your screen in any moment . It &apos;s also a very flexeless .
This is a whole book , you know , not images .
This is the Casa desolate of Dickens . Every colonn-represents a capital .
To show you that &apos;s about the text and not images , we can do something like this , to see really is a real representation of the text of the text of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a book to read a book .
It doesn &apos;t recommend .
This is a little bit realistic . This is a number of Guardian .
Every big picture is the beginning of a setion .
And it really gives you the pleasure of a read , and the beauty of a magazine , or a daily revision of a jundaily , which is for nature a lot of medium .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the Guardian .
We &apos;ve created a high-resoluonef solutions -- much more high than what uses usually usually in a published normal content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific specific .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that that means to the population and other hand and other hcheries like , they wouldn &apos;t be necessary .
Now , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not going to lose time , if we don &apos;t have to say that we have contributed to this camp .
These are all the streets in the U.S. , they &apos;re all the streets in the NASA .
So now we &apos;re going to go to something else .
This is actually actually from the Web ; you can go to see .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragonflies and the other is a very interesting search for a very interesting computer that was a very interesting deal with Noah Seady , a student of the University of the UW and Rick Seliski of the UW and Rick Seliski and Research Seliski of Microsoft Research .
And it &apos;s from the web , drive by Seadragon .
You can see that when we do this kind of screen , where we can past from a picture to the other and have this kind of experience to the other and have this kind of experience .
But the space collocation of the pictures here has actually a meaningful .
The algorithms of the computer visualization have recorded these pictures together , so that they &apos;re going to have the real neighbors in the real blocks in the Rockcial Montagne Roccial Montagne Roccial Mount Roccial Montagne Rockcial , and these things have been related . So you see the elements of a slides of a slide-show .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a few more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data of Noahes -- and this is from a Photosynth prototynth prototynth , which is really going to work for the first time , the summer scan -- to show you what I think is really the key technology Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily a lot of website .
We had to worry about the legal aspects and so on .
This is a rebuildings of Noththin Noththree Dimpictures of Flickr . Bauction &apos;s dying Noththtrial and you get images of the campus and you get images in the campus and so on . Ogns , you get a picture that &apos;s discovered an image that you have a picture that you have a picture that you have a picture that you have a picture that you have a picture that you have been discovered a picture of a picture .
So I &apos;m all images prised by Flickr and they &apos;ve been all lined to space in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to be able to see this very simple way .
You know , I would never think I &apos;d be able to work for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratify to get this kind of access here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different kinds of types of focus , from those of the graduate grassroots to those professional graduate grasses , and it together in this environment .
And if I can try to look at the more strange .
Many are blocked by faces , etc .
Some of here is a series of photographs -- etches .
This is a Nothththrecorded poster .
We can go from the poster to the view of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is taking data from the entire collective memory of how to apping the earth , from the vision point of view -- and connecting all the data together .
All those pictures become lined , more than the size of the size .
You have a model of the entire terms that emerging .
Think about this as a prolunging of Stephen Lawler on the virtual Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as people use it , and the people use it , and the which is going to use .
Their pictures are marathed by other people .
If someone comes to a sense of contrast all these saying the name , my picture of the Nothers , my picture of Nothththree Damimprovises , and I can use the data as a point of ingress to the data , and I can use the picture of anyone , and I use the photo use the photo anyone else , and have a social experience of cross-like cause and cross-like cross-like cy-like critical , and have a social experience .
Of course , a consequence of all that are extremely elaborated , very interest in the earth , and not only one of the planet , not just just just by the planes and satellite images and satellite images and similar images , but from the collective memory .
Thank you very much .
CA : I &apos;ve got good ? What &apos;s good ? What your software will contained us to do is that at a certain point in the next few years , all the photographed , all the photographed , all the world are going to be ready ?
BA : Yes . What &apos;s doing is basically doing is basically to find .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the bottom of the images .
What becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of the wisdom of information that many of these images are going .
As when you do a research of images on the Web , you get a sentence and the head on the web page has a lot of information about the picture of the picture .
Now , what if that picture is connected to all your picture ?
So the amount of simancient interconnection and the amount of the amount of it is really huge . It &apos;s a classical effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible . Compliments .
BA : BA : I thank you very much .
One of the main pleased , when you travel and one of the ethnography is the power to live between the people who didn &apos;t forget the antic antic traditions , between who have traditions the past in the wind , the stake in the leaves , he &apos;s watching the float in the leaves of the plants .
Basti think that Jaguar Jaguar traveling still beyond the Via Lattea , or that the Mthantians are still meaningful , or that in Himalaya , the budddddisturt of the Dharm of the Dharm of the central anthropology , and the idea that the world we live in the central world that we live in the world that we live in the world that we live in which we live in the world , but it &apos;s just a very much ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stirles did , good or a bad , a lot of generations .
And , of course , we all share the essential .
All nax . We all procreating .
We are subject to the beginning .
We need to death the inexorability of death , so it doesn &apos;t surprising and ballie --
We all have a art .
What hit is the particular is the particular rate of song , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that they are the Penan forests of Borneo , or the follow-Voodoo , or the Voodoo &apos;s warrighers in the desert of the Kaisut , or a camels in Sahara , or a camellow in Sahara .
He was my companies in the desert of a month ago , or a halleveless in the valley of the Everest , in the Everest , the Mamolanger of the world .
All these populations teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking ,
And if you reflected a moment , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
So , altheme , cultures of the world , they make a spiritual life of spiritual life and cultural life that it &apos;s important for the planet as a biosphere as a biosphere as a biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural nature as a cultural , like a etnosphere , and you can call the ethnosphere , dreams , mites , inspirations , inspirations , inspirations , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions ,
The ethnosphere is the fantastic patric of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be as a very quish .
And because the biosphere was graveled by ethnosphere and unfortunately , and unfortunately very quicker .
No , for example , would say that 50 percent of all species has been or the extinction of all species is on the extinction of the most opened , or in the most openyal , or hypothesis -- and not even near even even near hypothesic -- that &apos;s the most of the most optimistic -- that of the most cool diversity .
The indicate of all that is , of course , the language .
When you &apos;re born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only composed by a vocabulary or a series of rules .
A language is the shake of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the medium with the which the animal of every culture is coming into the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a wild of the mind , a thinking of spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re here sitting at Monterey , at least half doesn &apos;t get suspended in the ears of children .
They don &apos;t come out of children , the which means , unless than not wonderful , not wonderful , not wondered .
What is more sad than the wisdom of being the last one , to be the last to talk a language , not having a language , not having a way to transmit wisdom of the children ?
This is a fairing is the state of somewhere in the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks , the last few weeks of the last silabe .
And I know somebody who &apos;s going to say , &quot; Is it doesn &apos;t better ?
The world wouldn &apos;t be a better place if we talk all the same language ? &quot;
We talk to kogi .
You &apos;ll cover a sad thing you can &apos;t talk about your language .
I &apos;d like to do a journey through ethnosphere --
a little journey in ethnosphere to give you a key of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , &quot; different ways of existence , &quot; I really mean , I mean , &quot; I really mean , you know ,
We take for example this Barasana Barasana , in Amazon , in Amazon , the population of anaconda , who believe the myth to try to try from the side of the latt of sacred sacred .
It &apos;s a population that &apos;s not able to distinguished the color blue from the green because the time of the forest , where the forest is identified in the forest , where the population depends the population .
They have a language and a very matric and a marriage , called &quot; language , &quot; Linguistic &quot; : you have to move a person who talk about a different language .
All this has gone in the mythological past , but the particularity is that in these extent of the country in six or seven or languages , no one languages , no one practice .
They limited to listen and then they start to talk .
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived , the Waorans of Ecuador , an Eastern Eastern , a population that had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , in the 1957 measures have tried a contact that was a comfortable .
They &apos;ve been doing this from the photographs that retraditional poses that they would have advice , forest that this population of pluvial forest pluvial forest .
They straight the picture of the ground , they turned them to the research of a form or a figure , they have concled that they were died , and they killed the dig , and they killed the five missionaries .
But Waorans didn &apos;t just killed the straniests .
They killed between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by them .
We &apos;ve been up at eight generations and we found two cases of natural death and when we insisted for that one of them was inviting , and then they killed that one was invecting that they were invented , and then they killed it .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal of 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned a really interesting compiece when my Harvard professor of Harvard , I was asked if I wanted to go to Haiti for the base of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutout-of-used to the bombie .
To give a sense of the miraculous , I should have have to understand the Vodoun and that Vodoun is not magic .
It &apos;s pretty much a metaphysics of the world .
Very interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Budddddd-, Ebrism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Saharan has no religious . And instead , and Voodoo is not religious . And the Voodoo is not other than the distilled in the tragic religious concepts of naked in the tragic deep .
What it makes the voodoo is the intense report between life and death .
So the living people to the spirits .
The spirits can be invowed by Great Aqua , they respond to the dance of the dance of the dance of the vive soul , so that for a very short , so that for a short , which is the god .
So , the voodoohisti love say , &quot; You go to wonder God .
We &apos;re going to start in the temple and become God . &quot;
And from the moment that you &apos;re playing , is the spirit you , how do you do the wad you ?
So , you assistes to these incredible events : followed the voodoo in the state of trance , infuel infuel infuel of the mind of the mind on the body when it &apos;s catalyzed in a state of extremely excitation .
The people with which I lived the most extraordinary the most extraordinary are the Kogi of Sierra Nevada Marta , in Santa Marta in Septemtentrional .
Tell phone who was a tyranny that once they had a living on the carairs of the Colombia , the population was going to be on the vulage , the population that you ern vulage on the carbically copy planture .
In a continent of blood of blood , this population never been conquted by the spagners .
And that &apos;s now , I &apos;m governments from a cler , but their formation is really extraordinary .
The young followed out of the families to three or four , and they live in a good household , and they live in a handle , and shombers in the stake for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years of proposed to reproduce the nine months of the gestation of the gestation of the gestation of the Great Mother .
So , so that &apos;s acculate to the values of their society , values that they &apos;re going to predicting their prayed , and just their prayers the cosmic balance -- or for better than the equilibrio .
At term of this incredible initiation , they come improvising out and for the first time in life , at 18 years , they see a dalstuff . And in that actim of the first book , when the sun bor brown , when the sun burning the valley of the beauty of the beauty . The precipage is conferred to all its . The pret a steel is conferred . The pret a past a wonderful and says , &quot; The pret a past a past and says , &quot; The pret a pasal wonderful .
&quot; Vish ? Proprize I said .
It &apos;s studies . Now it &apos;s now .
They &apos;re called the greater , and they say that we , brothers , the miners , we are the destruction of the world .
This intuition is extremely important .
When we think of the Indigene and environment , we invod-Rseau and the old history of the veless history of the vage history , which is a rather close to the Earth of us and say that these people are more close to the Earth of us .
Indigenes are not not sentimental sentimal .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the Afat or the car disease , or in the winds of the TIbet , but because of time and the rhythle , created a mystic of the Earth &apos;s not about the concept of the concept of the maintuition of the maybe that the concept that the Earth can only because it &apos;s infected from the human consciousness .
What does it mean ?
It means that a little girl of Ande who grows up making the mountain is a vast of a Hpu spirit of a deep being a very different human being a depth of being depped with the mountain or that place that place that rather than a Montana that you grow up with a mountain , a mountain a Montank-foot men .
What the dimball of a spirit or a mineral is irrelevant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Britannic Columbia creating forests to be cut .
That made me a different human being different from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the forests are the dimora of Hukuk and the history of paradise and the spirits that live in the north of the world , the spirits that have during the Hamati began .
If you start to consider that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of them , you &apos;re going to understand some of them .
I &apos;ve taken this picture to open in the western Amazon .
Mayahuge of you have heard about the Ehuash , the most powerful suspair of the repertory of the repertoire .
What it makes the eye eye is not the potential pharmacological potential of the substance , but the process . It &apos;s composed by two elements .
From a hone side , this lian lian lian huge of carbon , harmine and harmine , harmine and harming , slightly .
Taking the only plant plant smoking , and it &apos;s a little bluxed that up a little bit , but it &apos;s mixed with the leaves of a coffee of the coffee family of the coffee family of the coffee .
This plants , this plants , very similar powerful , very similar to serotonin the demithoxyl-five , methoxyltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryptaminine .
If you ever see the Yanomami tyrare on for the nose ssustaining that they do from a different species , ancheyltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltricen-toamine .
Tiring that wicks on for the nose is a little bit like being disappear by a file pines of the bowl and land on a sea and land on a sea .
I was often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who wrote the psychedelical was psychedelical , with the discovery of the fungi in the 1930s in the 1930s in Mexico .
Second , my text can &apos;t classify these triptames like hallucinogens because if you &apos;re doing not telling anybody to be able .
It &apos;s possible absolutely if they make other chemical stances that money in the MAO .
Now is the beautiful : the carbon the carbon , which is inibitors of MAO , or , the same kind of the type of the triptamines . The most of the time , like this : in a 80,000 species of plants , as they do these people find dead death , but if you combined in this way , they make a version that it &apos;s such a that you can be suggests that it &apos;s superior of the parts ?
We use the big eufemism of the prova and error , which can reveal .
But if we ask the Indians , they will say , &quot; Phts are talking about . &quot;
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 varieties of Ehubes , which distinguished netically in the forest , and that the eyes would reentrall the same species .
If we ask him how they &apos;re saying their tasonomy will tell us , &quot; I thought I was going to think of that , you don &apos;t know everything ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take the 17 varieties in a night of a full and each one will candle with a different .
So , there &apos;s no laurea to Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than contate that to contate the press .
Now , &#91; applaused me , the problem is that even the ones of us that have the people who have to the wind cue , but somehow reduced the margins of the history of the history of our history world , and pass .
In fact , the 11st century , in 300 years , it doesn &apos;t remember for its wars its wars or the technological innovations , but rather as the was in which we stopped and we embractively active or accepted passively , the destruction of the mass of diversity and cultural dealing . Now the problem is not change .
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibility of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux don &apos;t have to be Sioux when they put up and fulfilled up and further as Americans don &apos;t stop being Americans when they put from horse and calf .
It &apos;s not the change or the technology that you reach the integrity of ethnosphere . It &apos;s the power .
The flight of domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you &apos;ll discover that these are not destined to disappear .
They &apos;re living creatures and dynamics out of the existence of identifiable forces that go beyond their capacity of adaptation .
Which is the disbosing of the Penan patria patria .
a population of Sarawak , in the Sarawak , a population that lived lived in the forest to a generation to a generation ago , and now reduced to a generation and now reduced the next region the reduced of the figures , where you can see the river from the living sounds that seem to the Mdional Cinese , where the Naviluminizonic , where the Navy Aean , where the Naves , the Navels , and now ,
It filled the stives with the wood sitting with the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that you have to be the discovery of the gold .
If we move on the Tibet mountains of the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the wall domination .
You know the genocide , the extinction of a population , is condances in the universal level , but the enoisd , the destruction of life , not only is condaned , but even a celebrated in the environment , because it makes part of the development strategives .
And you can &apos;t understand the Tibet , until you &apos;re not part of the beginning .
I &apos;ve spent the 6,000 miles from China in Western China in Western China in the Western Tibet , coming to Lhasa with a young lines , but just came to Lhasa I realized what &apos;s behind the statistics we &apos;re hearing about .
6,000 worldwide den workers in poles and centers .
1.2 million people killed from the military Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascrited to Panchen Lama .
which means that that was killed to the time of the Chinese invasion .
Her , it was further with Santity during the diaspora that has brought the people in Nepal .
Her mother was imprisoned and his colpage was to be rich .
It &apos;s been taking to the age of two nurse in the age of two nasking several years , because he wouldn &apos;t have living without him .
The sister , who did the same , was done in the same way , was put in reeducation .
A day , he &apos;s walked up a Mao , and for this transgression , and for this transgression , was put in the forced for seven years .
The Tibet of the Tibet can be insent , but the spirit of the population is taking .
At the end , it &apos;s all reduces .
We want to live in the world world of the mocrupt of the monoony or we want to accept the policycle of diversity ?
The big anthropology Margaret Mead , before we die said that his biggest fear was that , in our largest fear was that , we &apos;re going to see the whole whole amorous of human imagination is going to see the whole ama of modality of thinking , but one day we &apos;re wake up from a depensive dead , but one day we &apos;re going to be able .
And it &apos;s humiliating that our species is existed for 600,000 years .
The Neolitics Revolution , which has given us the agriculture , which made us to soccombine the cult of the sime , replacing the poem of the slide , and we &apos;re talking about 10,000 years ago .
The industrial modern world has to be 300 years .
That sharks , the sharp that I don &apos;t suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we &apos;re going to be going to be in the millennia to come .
When these cultures of the world is asked what it means to say to what to say to be human , they respond with 10,000 voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all return the possibility of being what we are : a kind of consciousness , which has to all the people and all the people and all the people and all the people and all the people can flow .
I took this picture on the north of Baffin , when I went to the island of Baffin , when I went to the whales with Inuit , and this guy , and this guy , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , and this man , and the man , and he told me the waiting with the Indunt .
The canadvice was not always gentile with the Inuit and in the 1950s to stabilie our teenagers , we switched them in colonies .
The grandfather was refused to go .
The family , themselves for his life , he brought him away all the arms , and all of his attractioned .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t feel the cold , they slow it .
The slets of the slets were actually made of the fish , they were made of caribs .
The grandfather is not made it saying the arctimic or the blizard that was suffipped .
It &apos;s gone out , and it was climbs up the skin of foca and defecated in your hand defecated in your hand . When I did the told them , they work with the lama .
He &apos;s sprured on the shoulder of this cluster , and when he came solid , he killed a dog .
He high schoided the dog and created a short , and he made a sleep , and he sleep on a sleep on a banchisa , and it &apos;s disappeared on the banchisa , and he telephone hand on the cone .
We want to talk about hell with nothing ?
In the 1999 , the Canananathan has reduced to Inuit the total control of a California and Texas a set of California and Texas together .
It &apos;s their new patries . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a independent territory . They controlate all the minerary resources .
One splendid example of how a national state can recognize with his population .
And finish , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious , I think it &apos;s been in these slightly walking zones of the planet , make it remote .
For someone &apos;s home .
They represent setions of human imagination that they get up to the date the date of the daily . And for us all these children , as the dream of the children , become part of the geography .
Finally , we National Geographic Geographic is that the politicians will never get to anything .
We believe that the polemy --
&#91; &#91; Ausi &#93; are not persuasive , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and perhaps we think the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month , our site remarkable site , our site remarkable site .
156 countries transmit our television .
Our revists are several millions of people .
Our work is traveling in ethnosphere to bring our public to bring our public wonders from what they saw and , hopened out , and hopes , hope , hopology will hope for the central revealing of the anthropology , and we need to find a lifestyle of life in a pluralistic and multural world and multural reveal and multural world and multively to find a lifestocus in a places of lifer , and we have to find a style and men in the care of a
where the wisdom of all the people can contributing our handwell-being .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope recorded to another one that you heard and I &apos;ll try to evidence some connecting connecting .
I want to start with what I call the &quot; the &quot; officer . &quot;
The dogma offices what ?
The dogma offices of all the Western industrial industrial society : &quot; If we want to men the well-being of the well-being of our citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; The way to do it is to male the individual freedom . &quot;
The reason is , from a side , in fact that freedom is in the fact that freedom is very precious , for essential , useful , essential for human beings .
An the other is that if we &apos;re free , each of us can act for it to do everything that makes our benefit to do everything that massive our benefit , no one that decided to our well-being , no one that decided to our well-being , no one that decided to our well-being , and nobody who decided to name what makes our wonderful , if you &apos;re free , you can act everything that messes our benefits ,
The way to male the freedom is to move the choice .
More people have , the more people have , the more liberty , and more is their freedom , greater is their liberty , most of them .
This is so deeply radical in the society that nobody would dream to put it in the society that nobody would be able to the doubt .
And it &apos;s also deeply radical in our lives .
I &apos;ll show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m allowed a simple note on conducting .
In my supermarket there are 175 conducts , without content , without content the 10 varieties of oil and 12 acetacetes that you can comprehensive to make you a huge number of conducting in the rescired recircums that nobody of the 175 proned to your death .
Here &apos;s the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic store to buy a stereo , CD , pleased , plastra , lify , fashion .
And in this single negotide , there &apos;s a big number of components .
We can do six and a half million different combinations using components that there are only one negotial .
You have to admit that there &apos;s a lot of choices .
Other fields : the world of communications .
Once I was a child , you could get all the services of the phone phone phone phone phone phone , at the stone that were fornite from the Bell .
It was born the phone , it didn &apos;t buy it .
One of that , by the other , was that the phone was that the phone would never slow .
These time , they &apos;ve been .
Now we have a variety of phone , almost limited phone of the cellular phone .
Here &apos;s the cellular cellular cellular .
My favorite is the middle , MP3 , tapels of the nose , and strong the bag , and strong for the cryster .
If you don &apos;t have seen in the store under the house , you &apos;re going to be certain that it will be .
And what &apos;s going on is that people get into the newsphers and do this question . And you know what the answer ? The answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cellphone that doesn &apos;t do too much things .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the acquire , you really really grew the same explosion of choices .
Assistence : Sanitan has no longer in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor , what you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we might do it , or B &quot; Aid these benefits &quot; B has these benefits . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You said , &quot; Doctor , what should I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A has these benefits and the risks , and B has these benefits and the risks . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebats , &quot; Doctor she was me , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor : &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result that we call it &quot; autonomy of the disease , &quot; expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But actually it &apos;s not a lot of a weight and responsibility to someone who knows something , which is the doctor , someone who doesn &apos;t know anything -- and almost certainly it &apos;s disease to make decisions that real decisions the patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing products , direct to people like me and you , who if you think about it doesn &apos;t have any sense , but if you think about it doesn &apos;t be buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why are they published ?
The answer is that they want to ask us to say , we call the doctor to change it .
Something so critical as our hyesis is is a question of choice , how you see in this gap , &quot; we don &apos;t want to force children . They &apos;re going to stress children . They &apos;re going to stop .
And we can reinvent how many times you get us .
which means that every morning , to the risk , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I &apos;m a little bit of family and marriage , a time next time , a common perspective , almost for everybody , was that you would have the most most possible , and he started to get the most soon possible .
The only choice was with who , not when , not when , not even what to do after .
Ogyday , it &apos;s really to play .
I team at very smart students , and I do do the 20 percent of work in less than a time .
And not because they &apos;re not smart , because they &apos;re not smart , they &apos;re not because they &apos;re going to be .
but why are I impensive , I mean , you know , I would say , &quot; Would I go to move it right ? &quot;
&quot; Do I have to think about the kids or the career ? &quot;
They &apos;re slogorananants .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this implement doesn &apos;t completing the compitor and not get a good vote to my won .
And they have to do it . They have to do it .
Now , the work : we &apos;re fortunate , as Carl South Carl was allowed , every day , every day , every single corner of the planet , though , every corner of the planet , but from Hotel Randolph .
In the time , there &apos;s a angolin , and I don &apos;t tell anybody who , where , WiFi works .
I don &apos;t say , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , this incredible freedom of we have about work ? It &apos;s going to work ? It &apos;s going to continually decide , if we have to work or not .
We can go to our son , and we can look at the hot , with the cell phone in a tank , the Blackberry , the Blackberry , on the ginocy .
And even though they &apos;re spended , every minute that we see our son , we &apos;re also wondering the partner , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; Do I say , &quot; Do I say , &quot; I have to answer this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? &quot; I have to wait this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , &quot; that makes the experience of your child very different from what would be in other conditions .
So , what we &apos;re looking at , little things , and big materials , and objects and lifestyle of life , life is a choices .
Once the world was this : Ovally , there were some possibilities , but it was not a question of choice .
The world today &apos;s worth like this : The dilemma is : &quot; Is it a good thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is SScially , you know ,
So we know all know , we know all , so I &apos;ll talk about that negative .
All this choice , two effects , two negative effects on people .
The first , paralysis that produces in the liberation instead of liberation .
So many of them , which I &apos;m going to choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
So I offer you an expensive example : a study conduct on the plans of volunteer .
A college has access to the data of Vanoundary , the society of the Vankfully , with about a million employed climbers in 2,000 companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offered , the percentage of adesion , the percentage of adesion is taken by two percent .
With 50 funds , there &apos;s 10 percent of offering , less than when I are available to the available , only five . Why ?
Because with 50 funds between which choose , is dieclose , is dieclose , and the choice is remanded to decide ,
And domorders , and again domorders , domorrow , domorange , domoranges , domorders , of course , domanances , domorders , domorders , and of course domances , domorders , and of course domoranangs , and of course domorances , domorders , and of course domorders , domananan
You know that it doesn &apos;t mean just that these workers will eat workers because they don &apos;t have enough money , because they don &apos;t have enough money , you want to say that the decision is so obstic that they lose the complementary of the labor .
Not teaching , they &apos;re even giving the way to five dollars a year from work , which would be willing to versarsarsary them .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too much .
And I think that it makes the world .
&quot; And finish , for the eternity : ketchup , or mayonese ? &quot;
You &apos;d like to take the right decision , if it &apos;s for ethnity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and nepure the wrong , and neppure the wrong conditions .
So that &apos;s the first effect . The second is that even if we can avoid the paralysis and make a choice , at the end , we &apos;re less satisfying from the result of how we would slow .
And that &apos;s different reasons .
One of them is that with a lot of conducting , which you &apos;re going to buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , is easy to imagine that you might have to make a choice that you could make a better choice . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us to bring the choice of the choice , and the repieces of the slums , and the repionef of the snative , and the sodently decreated by the decision , and the snurse , and the sodgets of the sure that the several consummit &apos;s one . And you can &apos;t have a very much better .
even when it was a good decision .
More choices there are , more easy , fully displeasy of all detail .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call cost .
Dan Gilbert has closed very well practices like the value that we have to depends on what we &apos;re going to confront .
In the rest , when there are so many possible options , it &apos;s easy represent the tools of alternative , and be less satisfying than the option that is choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m sure all with all of the ones that are not New York .
But that &apos;s what you would think you &apos;d be .
There &apos;s this copy at the Hamptons .
A place of light .
It &apos;s ballowing . Otyma day . It &apos;s all for them .
It doesn &apos;t do anything . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , malediition , is Agust . &quot;
&quot; All my neighbors are away . &quot;
&quot; I could talk about it right in front of home . &quot;
And it goes two weeks that it &apos;s losing -- every day -- every day -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The cost opportunity decrease , the sodddle for what we have , even when the choice was eccellent .
And the more are the options that we have to consider , the more attractive features that we will return to the opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This jet tells us a lot of things .
It &apos;s about the time , and maybe it &apos;s perhaps slowly .
But the most important point is that whatever you choose , you choose not to do other .
The things that we don &apos;t choose have a tactive that they can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : the growing spiral of the expectations .
I tried it on my skin , and I tried it a new jeans .
I realized almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were one of a type , comproud them and dress , they were just later , they were just after they took them a life and they were washed a lot of times , began to go well .
So I went to buy a couple of them , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeweled , and I said , &quot; I need a couple jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Who wants slim , fasy fit , relaxphonable ? &quot;
It takes them with the cerniera or with bottons ? &quot; Stonewashed , &quot; or &quot; acidwashed ? &quot;
&quot; Would you want to be stream ? &quot;
&quot; Seight the bble , or stretching ? &quot;
I was very hurt , and after a little bit I was able to say , &quot; I want the guy that was the guy , &quot; I want the only guy that was , so for a time , I had all of the diejeans , and then use the best pair , and then you use the best , I &apos;m sure , with the best pair , I would have ever .
It was the very big . I had the whole choice . I had got the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand it .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice is that with all the expectations were very high , the jeans had to be perfect .
I had a minime I had expectations . I didn &apos;t expected anything when there was only a kind of a kind of 100 different , stealthemselves , at least a kind of hunt .
What I was buy was good , but not perfect .
After I talked about that choose with what I was trying to get in the expectations .
The advice of the people don &apos;t do that they do people don &apos;t do that these things that have respect to the eccellence of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options that are not going to increase the expectations that have respect to the expectations that have no expectations that have been re
And that will product less satisfying , even when the results are good .
No one in the world of marketing if it makes it .
Because if they knew it , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth looks like this .
&quot; It was better when he was worse when he was worse , &quot; The reason that was better when he was worse , it was that when he was worse was still possible to meet the source sprint .
Ogyday , in the world where we live -- opulents , citizens with the perfection of perfection -- the maxpath that we can hope is that the things are at the heith of the expectations .
You &apos;ve never been placed , because your expectations , my expectations , they &apos;re ingiganted .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Hey wexpectations &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , you want . &quot;
I mean -- little moment , a moment , which I &apos;m really moving and my wife is really stupend .
I couldn &apos;t have done better , I didn &apos;t have told .
But it &apos;s not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of buying a couple jeans scomfortable when there &apos;s only the kind of jeans is that when you &apos;re not satisfacts , and say , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot; &quot; , the answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What would I do would I do ?
When there are hundreds of types of jeans , and you buy a insodenter , and you ask , you ask , is very very much the responsible you .
You &apos;d have better better .
With hundreds of varieties , there &apos;s no scuse .
So when people are decided , even though the result is valid , they feel feel insoddle , and they give the cold .
Over the last depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a factor meaningful -- not the only one , but -- of this wave of depression is really that people have experiences of depression is too much high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that the color is them .
So the final result is that in general , we &apos;re better , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the dogma officer , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely false .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than it , but not save that it doesn &apos;t want to be better than a lot better than a lot better than a little bit .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m pretty sure we have overovered by a piece where the choices the level that choices improvement our life .
Now , from political point of view -- I have almost finished -- from political point , the nocle is the following .
What allows all this choice in the industrial society is the material wealth .
There are a lot of places in the world , and you know , where the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too much .
So the facility I &apos;m talking about is a disease of modern , the Western society .
And what it does deprove and arrand is this : Steve Levitt spot , and spot seat as the cost and sat seat car seat , for whatever those are . It &apos;s a waste of money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and dispendious , it &apos;s not that they &apos;re just unuseful .
They &apos;re going to be very bad .
They do it worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows a lot of choices , in where people have too few possibilities , not just the way our life , not just would be impressing , but also our life .
This is what economists call a a focus .
A redistribution of the reduction is good at all -- not just the poor -- because of this choice , in excess that comes back us .
To conclude , you can become everything you want to be --
You know , people of culture , you think , &quot; What does that believe that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t be a glass in a glass of glass . &quot;
&quot; A case imagination , a limited vision of the world -- &quot;
and I &apos;ve been interpret in this , at the beginning .
But then , you think , instead , I realized that that that fish the long knows .
Because the fact of the fact of the fact that if you eat in the broke , so that you can &apos;t be freedom .
If you read the brow so that everything become possible as you can decrease the satisfaction .
You know , you &apos;re going to go to the well-being .
They all need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too much , perhaps even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the asthough some of symbolic symbolic and , I &apos;m going to rince the roup .
Thank you very much .
