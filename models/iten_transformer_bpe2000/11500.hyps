The year I shows I showed these slidemons to show that the calculate glacial glacial glacial , which for 48 , the continent , it &apos;s restreet , it &apos;s the 40 percent .
So , this wonderful gravity of the problem because of the problem because you don &apos;t show the the ice of the ice .
The calculate glacial glacial , is in a sense , the poor of global climate system .
It expands and you get the extbecame of the extact .
The next slide is going to be a reion of the last 25 years .
The ice ice ice , the ice lost are saying in the red .
As you see , you know , you know .
That &apos;s the glacion , which is the test of the test .
You can see that the ice ice , you can see that the drap , five years or more , it &apos;s like the waiting , which is the body here , which is the body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s going to be so .
This is a problem because the interested in the ocean , the reacted ters to the ocean artic where there are huge amount of carbon , that , you know , the sheep , they &apos;re transformed in metances .
It &apos;s a global inquent of the inquent intudle , global warming , that it might be radical inquantity , the surprison , the supersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersuperhydrink ,
In some laghi , in the Alaska , in Alaska is already rebecting from water .
Sprofessoritery Walter Walter Walter &apos;s the University , it &apos;s recognize a team bunch , you know ,
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Wow , it &apos;s good .
A reason is that this term termal scale from the north of the north .
This is a glacial fight-glacial .
He had never reached it to reach faster .
This is the Kangerlusues in the south of the Greenland of the Greenland .
If you want to know how the sal level of the seeing to the sal hand , here &apos;s where the sal hand , here &apos;s where the mate .
These corrents are starting to reidly .
In the other side of the planet : Antartide , the larger of the planet .
The month of the scientists have died that the clean of the ice is in the negative , and that Antarctis in the negative , which is a little bit of the island , which path in some island , is particularly required in the science .
Equival six feet of across across , like in Groenland .
Sull Himalaya , the most largest block of ice , you see new laghand , you see new laghes , which powered .
40 percent of the world population remarkable to the water power of the water power from the power of the water .
Sulle Ande : this gune is the fourth of the water of the water of the water of this city .
The brought is ather .
But when you dimind , the same accept to water .
In California , the Sierra Nevada is is diminiity of 40 percent .
The bins are in the cribes are in the cribes .
The predictions , as you have , you know , they &apos;re graves .
The growth care in the world &apos;s taken to a hundred of the incends .
The environmental disaster are going to a write out of the normal and without precedented .
Four times more numerous than the last 30 years , I &apos;ve got 75 .
This is a beautiful walking .
If you look at the stories , if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 , 24 hours -- 24 hours -- 25 million tons of tons in the oceans every day .
Look at the Next of the Pacific Pacific , by American , to the American , and on the subcontinent , where there &apos;s a radical impact of the objects of the objects of the objection of the obyging of the objection of the objected of the objective , in the ocean .
Most of the global warming , global warming , which is 20 percent , is the only 20 percent , is the use of the combustible of the network ,
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worst .
The United States are one of the two countries with more emissions , together with the China .
And he was propproposed to build a lot of other centers .
But we &apos;re asking a direction of direction .
These are the annative designs in the last years , and some of the alternative version of alternative version .
So , so there &apos;s a political loter in our country .
The industries of the carbon and oil have spread 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon , which is a host , which is a host of the host , which is a host of the carbon , which is a host of the carbon and oil they have a host .
The image remember I would remember something --
Natal Natal , in the Tennessee , where I had been a perspective of 3.8 billion paper .
Maybe you saw it up .
This is the second largest flexide in America .
It happened to Natal .
Not published nature of the carbon of the carbon was this .
Video : I &apos;m going to be the carbon is a kind of like , and happy .
It &apos;s abondant here in America , and it &apos;s growing our economy .
Fross the carbon is always more can .
It &apos;s good precens , the adorable and the workers are huge .
Al Gore : Do here is the Cail of West Virginia .
The largest society on the mountain is Massey Coal . This is his love .
Video : Don Blankenship : I &apos;m going to be archie -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosis , Harry Reid -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima of Clima &apos;s launched two campaign .
This is a one of the one .
Video : Ator : Ator we see the COALergy see the climate change as a minute of minute .
So , this priority is to invest a big amount of money in a public security to make public and confusual ses the paper .
In fact , the carbon is not sports .
We think it &apos;s also a good profump . It also also a profump .
So , not preprevent change .
Let me do to us .
Video : Attor : You know , you know , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
So , let me take a look at a structure of the watching paper for how much about the carbon is .
Stricicar ! The machines are a little bit of human , but this is the sound of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon .
The carbon of carbon is between the major climbs of global warming , but the notion of the carbon of the carbon that you see all .
You have a clean of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon .
Al Gore : Inend , the alternative , the positive alternational and the economic of the national security and the national security .
Video : Ment America is : My national economy , the national security , the national climate climate climate .
The philos that the college of our dependence from the combustible beautiful , as the cat and the important oil and the important oil and the important oil .
Now , perate , there &apos;s a new , audacting solution for the solution .
Repower America : 100 percent of the pulitches , in the years .
A plan to put the America , makes us more sure , and to help us to stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that we can solve our problems .
Really America . Scover America .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : My means : I &apos;m going to be energy to America .
One of the most faster to get the dependence of the dependence of the bustible that we killed our planet .
She talked : The future is here . I &apos;m saying , a new energy , you &apos;ll see energy .
Sometimes you know , you know , the investment of the work of work .
I feel : Repower America . It &apos;s time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old old old old the African old said , &quot; If you go speed , you go to the sunlight .
If you want to go up , you go together . &quot;
We need to go to the far , we have to go .
Thank you very much .
The year to TED feck in TED fecks a introduction on the LHC .
And you promise to go to the hundred about how it works .
So , I realized , and the other time , there was no , LHC is the great scientific experiment , the great scientific experiment -- 27 miles of circle .
Her compit is to reach the conditions that were presents less than a million second from the universe , under 600 million times a second .
All this is just the environment .
This is the machine well-Ginevent .
We pictures we get these mini-Bang Bang in the research .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- it &apos;s 44 feet and it &apos;s a 22 feet .
This is a spectacular image of ATLAS in buildings so you can see the proportions .
The 10 seps of the scores , we have accested the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was because of the immentioned of control in control .
It &apos;s a first picture of the first phasy of the particles that he had all the right of the LHC , by a part of the LHC , and I &apos;m going to a part of the LHC , and I &apos;m going to particles in the respect .
In other words , when we see that the 10 settled the 10 septs , we could be the machine , which is a great vitty .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to exultate more opped this , when someboogle and he saw that the page was this .
And that means that we had a cultural impact cultural impact .
It &apos;s a week after , there was a problem with the machine , it had to these phils here -- these phils here -- these dored dored .
These phils 13,000 lots of the machine work work in the mass of power .
Now , the technical technical phils and they will say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . They &apos;re not the very good . &quot;
And instead of them can do that because when they &apos;re very cold was the conducts of the superconducts .
So , at least 271 degrees , to a temperature of the space between the stars , these phils can bring that corrent .
In one of the young novemier novemile in LHC , there was a difect of fabrication .
So the philos that they would read , and the 1300-American , and the 130,000 ampatterns .
This was the result .
Now , this is still more than 20 tons if you think that these magnetwork , and that &apos;s more than 20 tons , and that &apos;s got about about 30 feet .
They &apos;re danneggggets .
We had to clear them , what we did .
We have repristed and traveled .
Now they &apos;re going to be back to their place .
Enger the end of the LHHC is is is new integro .
We &apos;re going to happen , and we wait , and we experience , and we keep so our adventure to discover what we can expensive the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , in a way , these involved in the value of science and engineering engineering and engineering . It &apos;s easy to confuture .
I think the fact that the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that I think is the value of things like LHC .
I would like to conclude with a Inglese scientist , Humphrey Davy , Humphrey Davy , the imagine , in the inuseful , his bael , his bleft , and his bael Faraday , he said , &quot; Nothing is so much for the human mind , he said , &quot; Nothing is so much as the way of human mind , which is not so much of the hydropping of the human mind , which is that we don &apos;t have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the conquickilt the new .
Thank you .
I want to start to ask the wind to think , from kids , you know , you know , you would clean .
While you understand how to add them and they &apos;re going to get them , and they learn them , learning to think and think , and you know , and you can think and sunlight and and epolicy relationship them .
The space is the space is deeply connected to the way we understand grain in the world we understand that &apos;s foundly in us .
So , from the information of our interacting with our interaction with physics , together with my consultype , and my collaborator , and Jevan Kalanalanithi , I started asking me , &quot; And if we &apos;re going to have the switer , and if we &apos;re just going to have the watching sler , we could just have a wait , and I could make the sloved , and we could have to get the hunk ,
and the paper our piece ?
The question was so interesting question that we decided to explore the answer , and buildings the Siftable .
In the words , a Siftable is a great computer computer , like a biscary computer .
In the words , a Siftable is a great computer computer , like a biscary computer .
You can move with the hand , they can see , &quot; you can see , &quot; between them , you know , and they have a screen and a radio and a radio and a radio .
But surprised , are physical objects , as the morning , you can just move .
The Siften of a new ecosystem of a new ecosystem to epolar the information information .
And as we become more physical , , consciousness of the movement , of the other , of the other , of the other , of how we can explore the other , of how we can explore the other , of how we can explore new and different sustiles of interaction .
I &apos;m going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configurate to show video : if you just cline in a direction , the video , the rote video , the next side of the back back .
These are interactive are consciousness .
If you are interested in the way , they &apos;re interested in .
If they come out , if they &apos;re going to be a little bit .
If they come out , if they &apos;re going to be a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting thing of the interaction was the power to use a lot of the data , to be a hundred of the data , &quot; a color like if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable , we have configurate them to train them to be able to be able to be able to be able to the color in the central central , where they are .
and I can use them to be able to be the color in the central , where you can .
If we &apos;re going to be too , we can put a little place .
There are also beautiful possibility to appears , as the languages , the mathematics and jowever people where people can try to try and see the logic things , and see it &apos;s a typically .
Now , I &apos;m --
This is a Fibonacy of Fibonacks that I do with a purpose of equations .
Here we have a word of words that &apos;s half between Scarabeo and Boble .
Pratically , in every one , in the remarkable to the case on every Siftable , Pratically , in every Siftable to , and while you can get a clear on every Siftable to be words a dionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds of the seconds are , and you have a new sletters and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
So , here &apos;s what the kids came to Media Lab , I did , I &apos;ve made it in a video .
They &apos;re very hard .
And one of the interesting things of this application is that you don &apos;t have to give people people a lot of education .
You just have to say , &quot; Compons of words , and they &apos;re exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s what other people who try it .
This is our most young people , there &apos;s the right .
It actually wanted to implol .
They were only morning for him .
Now , this is a whole active application of a interactive cartoon .
We wanted to build a tinstrument to the languages , and he &apos;s Felix .
It can actually put new character in the scenes in the scenes , solve the Siften their associated .
It can actually put new character in the scenes in the scenes , solve the Siften their associated .
So , it &apos;s doing the sole .
Video : The source is surgence .
David Merrilled : Now he took a treat in the scenes .
Video : The arang arant .
By work ! Yes !
So schools and put together together to put together together to make the character .
Video : Bau !
inventing your story .
Video : Can !
DM : It &apos;s a story with the apert , and it can decide him as you know , and it &apos;s like it .
DM : It &apos;s a story with the apert , and it can decide him as you know , and it &apos;s like it .
Video : Video ,
DM : The last example I have the time to show is a strump , realized of the recently , to watch and exequires .
it &apos;s a remarkable , to wait , to wait and exeguing musical musical .
Siften here are against sounds like basis , based and battery .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose what you can use .
You can also also inserate these sounds in a sequence of comport .
And modificate it just doing a sound , &quot; and a &quot; sequence . &quot;
These are effects that you can controlled from the vive , as the reversus and the phils .
The acks to a particular sound and then inclines to the way .
And then there are the general effects like time and fly , that you know , that they open to the interclean .
Let &apos;s look like it .
Video : We &apos;re going to start to put a base in two Siftable , &quot; sequence , &quot; we &apos;re in a serious , we extended to a serious , we extended to the other basis .
Now , I &apos;m going to be a basis .
Video : Now , I &apos;m going to advancing --
Video : I &apos;m going to put the phils to the bacteria , so I can controlling the effect of the view .
Video : I can speak the interacting sequence the interclean , and you know ,
Video : I &apos;ll add the phils to the bottom to the bottom more expression .
Video : I can get the sequence . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to plane it before , but I can try to make it more cords or more cords or more cords or more cords or more corcords .
And now , finally , I can sell the whole sequence of the Siftable to the left Siftable , &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new men , and more more and more more more more like our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the result of this percorner , and also some possibility that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to transmate is that is to this new generation of objects to interact with the digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way that we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time to talk to all of you .
I &apos;m a written .
It &apos;s the books is my profession , but it &apos;s more of this , of course .
It &apos;s also the love and the fass of my life .
And I don &apos;t expect that you can change .
But , told this , something particular , it &apos;s happened in my life and in my life , and in my life , which has brought me to realize the internal report with this work .
The particular thing is I have recently wrote this book , this biography called &quot; Mang , Prega , &quot; which , Ama , &quot; which , a different reason , for some reason , for some reason , for some reason , for some reason , for some reason , and it &apos;s a great sensitional , and it was a great , and it &apos;s a very big , and it &apos;s a great huge , and it &apos;s a great sensitive ,
And the results is that everybody now , people are going to me as if you were like if you were condannect .
Davoid -- condannect .
They &apos;re going to be worry and they said , &quot; You don &apos;t have to get to fear about it ?
You don &apos;t have to keep to keep to write for all life without being able to make a book that can be able to make a book that can &apos;t care to somebody ? &quot;
what can you know ? &quot;
It &apos;s rassicus , you know .
But it could go worse , to the part of the most than 20 years ago , when I started to say , when I started to say , I was a writing adolescent -- I wanted to be a written .
I was going to met the same based by the purpose .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you know , I can &apos;t have successful ?
You don &apos;t have to kill you kill you kill you ?
You don &apos;t have to make this multimate to all of life without the whole life without the null-up of a cumule cumule , with the bought bors of hallowed clean ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I have a few of all of the things .
I &apos;ve always had a couple .
And I also have a lot of other things that people can &apos;t be to inate .
As the tree and other things .
But , as I think about what I thought I was and ask me , and I ask me is why ?
Is it ratic ?
It &apos;s logical that anybody debate to be spectrum to be spavor to a job that you know , you know ,
But what &apos;s about so particular in the creative impressing to make us to make us to make a way that other career to the mental health of the other career ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and not recorous of a sola time in his 40 years of activity in the time that was asked to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer , for example , and I remember , for example , and he was a chemical engineer to be able to
There was never -- that was never -- that was the John of the engineer , like it ?
It didn &apos;t work so , you know ?
Only , the engineers like group are not certainly , in the centuries , in the centuries of being high high high high .
We have written , we have enough this reputs , and not just written , but creative of all gender , we have this reputation of being an instable to be enormous instable .
And it &apos;s not going to look at the trists of the magnific of the magnific ments , only in the century of the century , they can be young people and often to them .
And the ones that are not suickly to be being being being being being being being being being being being being made .
Norman Mailer , before you died in the last interview said , &quot; Every , I have a little more than the book , &quot; Overy much more &quot; a little more remarkable strap to work of their life .
But we don &apos;t bad when we heard these things , we &apos;ve heard these things , so we have to some way we have completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and the soffering and the soffering , and the sward , and the art , it &apos;s going to be able to the host .
And the question I want to bring all of today is : You &apos;re going to get with this idea ?
You know , you know , you know , because it &apos;s also looking at a centimeat of a distance , it &apos;s not good for all of this supposition .
I think it &apos;s odiosa .
And I think it &apos;s also periculous and I don &apos;t want to see the perpetuate in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our great creative ments creative and creative to live .
And of course , I know that , in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start to figing to the host of hoscare , I &apos;m going to be able to be the circumstances that I &apos;m in my careful .
That &apos;s the real -- I &apos;m looking , I &apos;m a young young young , I have about 40 years .
I still have about four decadecades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very unlikely that any thing I &apos;m going to write in the world as the work that was going to be judent of my last book .
I &apos;m going to be the most friends here , because we &apos;re all friends here -- it &apos;s probable to my big success is to mine .
Oh , Gesus , that I was thinking .
You know , you know , that &apos;s the gender of thinking that that &apos;s a person to start to start to get to the nine and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would like to keep this work that we &apos;re going to do this work that we &apos;re .
So , the question is becomes , how ?
And so it looks , after many reflection , which the way to keep to keep to write is to make a psychological costrade , OK ?
I have to find a sure of safer , and I &apos;m writing , and I &apos;m writing , and my natural natural natural , and I was trying to get to the time , and as I was trying to do it through time , and I was trying to see if I was looking at the time , and I was trying to find other society to see if I could have the ideas and more spring and more more sevening and more severage and more spowered and more slightly than the honor and the best of the himmove , and more and more and more s
to help people to help people to make the inerents risk of the creative risks of creative creative creative .
And that research has brought to the ancient Grex and ancient Rome .
Seguitems because he gave it into the circle and then back .
Nelantantly Grex and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t think that creativity becomes drive to the creative creative , OK ?
It was thinking that creative , it was this spirit of divine and that if you &apos;re going to be a few slights and high , and high , and high , and high , and history .
The greatest of the berites of the creative dians of the creative creative &quot; demand .
Socr, wonderful , it &apos;s credeal of to have a demone that &apos;s wisdom from the wisdom .
Romans were the same idea , but they called that kind of spirit , but it was a gene .
which is great , because the Romans didn &apos;t think that a genius was a genius .
They have that a genius was this kind of entity , which is credepending in the huri of a study of a artist , a little bit like the huge of a artist , and that &apos;s like the hard hard of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of that work .
Here &apos;s the way -- that &apos;s the distance of what I &apos;m talking about what -- that &apos;s the psychological costraditional psychological , you know , you know ,
And everybody knew that was so that it was , right ?
So , the antiantiantiantianties were protected by things , as you know , as you know , you know , no ?
If your work was the work was except , you could not get to take the market , all had been helped by this genius .
If your work work , if your work , it was not all the basic , right ?
All they had known that was the genius to be a huge .
And so people conceived the creative concept in Occcident to a long time .
And then the Rind was going to be and all changed , and nacize this big idea ; we put it to be humanity to the universe , and the mistake of the universe and without more left and no more to the creatures that wrote from the divinity .
This was the main the map of human rational and people started thinking that creative creative creative creative creative creative .
And for the first time in history , you know , it &apos;s what you can do is like a genius like a genius that to a kind of genius .
And I think I &apos;m going to tell , I think it was a big herror .
I think that allow somebody , a simple person of creating as a real piece of the beyond , the essence and the source of all the mystery , creative , and you know , creative , and the inknows is a very big philossh of the bagle that human-humanity .
It &apos;s like to ask somebody to ind the sole .
and completely fully the ego and creates all of these expectations on the performance .
And I think it was this to destroy the artists in the past 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think it &apos;s , and I think it &apos;s the question , and now ?
So , we can do it different ?
Maybe to get back to a more ancient of the relationship between human relationship and creative .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t cell 500 years of thinking about 18 years of thinking .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience that soldiers would suspect scientific scientific scientific , and you can see that people are going to be the next to make people square , and they &apos;re going to make their designs .
I &apos;m not going to convince you all about this .
But the question I would want to bring is -- why don &apos;t it ?
Why don &apos;t that be the way ?
Because it &apos;s more sense of all other thing that has ever heard to explain the exhaspering exactly the creative process of creative process .
And a process that , as anybody who ever ever ever ever , you know , so , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
And in fact , you can see it &apos;s completely paranormal .
I did this meet recently with the extraordinary strap , which has now 90 years , but it was a very poeful for all life and he said that he was a very poeful for the infected , and he said that in the camps , and he was going to hear , and he would feel it in the wave , when a powerful wering the wage .
He said that it was like a train of air .
And that was going to get up to the landscape .
He was going to hear , because he would be under his floor .
He had to have a solar thing to do that point and it was , he said , &quot; corring how a mathemselves . &quot;
And so it turns out , so it &apos;s going to be following from this poetry , and it would not have to make a piece of career and a mathemselves , and it &apos;s a crock , and it &apos;s a trapapapapart to the page .
And sometimes I can &apos;t get faster , so it &apos;s record and corrups and corrupt and the home and the home and the lost , and he would keep the home and it would continued to rolate through the countries , and he would keep to be a little bit of the other country , and he would look at a few times . &quot;
Then were the time -- this piece of the same , I &apos;ll never be -- there was the moments that was almost perfect , right ?
So , he was corring home and he was trying to the card and the poetry and the past through , and he was going to be a mathemselves , and he said , and he said , and he said , that it was like if you bungases with the other hand and the hacacross the other hand and the hacross the hand and the hacross the house was going to go up , and he he was going to go to the home and , and he was going to be a watched with the other home and and he he he he was going to wat
He was going to be the poetry and he had to his body and he had to his body and he was going to page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be presented to page and intacks but the contrary , from the last word before .
So when I thought -- it &apos;s a couple , it &apos;s exactly the same thing .
Not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conduction .
I &apos;m a moving , and my way to work is ; I &apos;m waiting to the same horary every day and spend and spend it .
But even , in my testardaggine , I have strippped that , sometimes .
And I think that also many of you the han fact .
You know , even though the work and ideas I was hard to a certain both , you can &apos;t know , I could not know , I could know .
And what is this ?
And how can we relationship to do it , we don &apos;t lose the head , but rather , rather , you do you do it ?
And as I think about , the best example of the contemporary example I have is the musician , which I have is the musician , which I &apos;ve interviewed to a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of the life is the incarnation of the life is the incarnation of the artist , to try to controlling , to try to controlling these species of impulse impulse .
But then I &apos;m going to be , and a day while he was driving on a a driving clean to L.Angeles , changed all to him .
He was wondering and all of a tract of the well-this little frammelodia , which is it &apos;s wonderful , and the well-hard , and the well-, and the desider , and the desider , and the desider , and the desider , and the desider , but it &apos;s not how to make it .
It didn &apos;t have a piece of card , it &apos;s not a mathemselves .
So he starts to feel this species of old old , and he &apos;s going to be in him , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and he remarried by this character of character .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t make it cells . &quot;
And instead of the wait , he stops .
I &apos;m going to be the mental process and he did something completely new .
I &apos;m going to look at the sky and said , &quot; Scusush , &quot; Scush , I &apos;m not watching ? &quot;
&quot; You know , you know , you know ?
If you really want to exists , you get to a more huge when I can take care of you .
All of the other thing we have to get any other today .
You know , you know , and you know , &quot;
And his process was working on this .
Not work , the work was still hoscure as always .
But the process , and the fish that was the actual across the genius , the genius , the genius that was nothing that was going to be able to be a whole thing that was going to be a interested in the wonderful , and he had to be a interior and history .
But it was well-up , wonderful bizarre collaboration a conversation between Tom and and this is that hold , and that &apos;s the huge and it was huge .
So how much you feel that story about changing a little bit of the way I was working , and he &apos;s already and saved me a time .
This idea , I &apos;m going to save when I was writing , &quot; Many , &quot; Am , &quot; and cadvanced in one of the disaster , and we &apos;re doing something and we &apos;re working on something and we &apos;re doing it , and we &apos;re going to think that &apos;s the worst book or never written .
Not only , the worst book , the worst book .
And I started thinking about to think of gecting this project .
But then I remember of Tom that talked to the air and you tried .
So I went to my face and you get my face and you would get my hoscritish and you get my comments to a huge corner .
And I said to the voci , &quot; Sends , what we know , the bottom is that if this book is not going to be interested in my , no wait &apos;s not going to be interested in my , no longer ?
Because as I &apos;m seeing it all I have , I don &apos;t have more than this .
So if you want you to have to be better , you have to make your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , you know what , you know , you know , you know ,
I &apos;ll start to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to make it was recording that I today I &apos;m presented to do my part , &quot; because -- at the end is , OK -- in the centuries of North people had to the North Africa of the North people had to the wonderful wondering and hours that was was going to hours to hours and hours to hours to hours and hours to hours .
And they were always magnific , because the balleres were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every very , you know , something happens , and one of these artists , and one of these artists becoming .
And I know you know what you know , because I know you have , in a certain point , a certain point , a performance .
It was like the time , and the walked , and the walked through a special species , and it didn &apos;t stop a kind of purpose , like 1,000 night before , but all of the 1,000 night before , but all of it was halls .
And in suddenly , I don &apos;t know as a human .
But it happens from the divinside and sled in the fire of the divinity .
And when this next to the tempes , you know , people had what was , they called the name .
They were the hands and started song , and they started to song , &quot; Allah , Allah , God , God , God , God , God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curiosa night -- when the Mom invasols the Spain , I was this habitude with them and the pronto them with them and the pronto the centuried by Allah , Allah , Allah , &quot; Okay , &quot; the word , &quot; which you can get in the flow or in the flow or in the fleaver or .
In Spain , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , the bah , the Allah , magnific , I &apos;m going to be , eted -- a waiter , a God of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need .
But , the problem , the next day after the walls , the same , when you wait and wrote that &apos;s the 11 of Marteds and wrote it &apos;s the 11 of the world , there &apos;s no more .
It &apos;s just a mortal mal with the ginocky to the ginocy , and maybe it &apos;s going to be able to make it more ask .
And perhaps no one will be the name of God , and what &apos;s so we have to do with his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most poorest reciliations to make in a creative life .
But maybe not to be so angoscianger if you can &apos;t believe , anzyly , that the most extraordinary extraordinary extraordinary of your being being .
But created that that you &apos;re just going to be in the present of this is a inimaginable inary inimaginable of your life that you have to spend any one when you &apos;re finished .
And , you know , if we think that we think it &apos;s all changes .
And so I started thinking , and it &apos;s sure as I thought , and it &apos;s sure as I thought for a lot of the book that I &apos;m going to be a huge , and I &apos;m going to be a huge , we exactly the hundred of my great great great .
And what I have to keep when I feel electrized I fear that &apos;s , not had a fear .
Not just to be high . It &apos;s your work .
It &apos;s going to be in the way , whatever you can be .
If your work is hard , you know .
If the wine , I would ask you to get a signature of left to cheat some kind of wonderful kind of wonderful , then you know , &quot; Okay ! &quot;
Altracents , you know , you know , you know .
And &quot; Ole the same . &quot;
I think and I think you can teach it .
&quot; You know , you know , only for the same , even for the human hamor and testardaggine tacks to be .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
And as you know , you know , you know , of these projects on the human genome , and the discovery of genes .
Now we &apos;re starting a new perspective : we started to digitalize biology and now to talk about that code , we &apos;re going to talk in a new phase of biology , designing and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesis .
We always always tried to the big questions .
&quot; What &apos;s the life ? &quot;
We tried to have different approaches , we can minimes .
We &apos;re dealalalalmost 20 years .
When we sequenced the genome of human genome , it was going to spend the world of the biology in the world of the computer world .
Now , we ask , we can regenerate the life , or create new life from this universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the kind of genome , which is the kind of the genoma , which is the kind of the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome for creating a little bit more .
We &apos;re able to eliminate a hundred of genes about 500 that are here .
But when we have a huge handle to metabolic maps , it &apos;s relatively answer to our .
I think , this is simple .
But when we all look at all the genes that we can eliminate , it &apos;s very imlible that this can bring to a cell cell .
So , we decided that the only way to design was to synthesizing this croms in a way to make the components to get some of these questions to bring some of these questions .
And so we started the Pan , we can synthesizing a cump ? &quot;
It can be able to make these great molecules that we &apos;ve never made to create the great molecules that we &apos;ve ever been able to create before ?
And in case , in case , we can make a cump ?
A chromosomosome is just a chemical material .
The speed that we are able to digitalize life is growing up to the life is growing up to the exponential ritm .
Our capacity to write the genetic code , instead , instead , but it &apos;s more , it &apos;s getting better .
And our most recently reacted the behavior on on a exponential curve .
We started the most 15 years ago .
The process has been a lot of the past , starting with a bioetics of bioetics before we started with a bioetical review .
But we found that that we have to synthesize of DNA is very hard .
There are thousands of thousands of machines in the world that produced little security of DNA , the longer of 30 to 50 letters and it &apos;s a very , the challenges is , the challenging is hering , there &apos;s a long , more running , there &apos;s a longer , more running , there &apos;s a long time , more running , more running ,
So we had to develop a new method to ask these framments and corrupt these framments .
And this was our first tentle , to talk about the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of Phi 174 .
It &apos;s a little viruses that kills kills .
We designed the framments , effective correction of the errors and get a molecule of DNA of about 5,000 lector of about 5,000 lector .
The interesting part is , we &apos;ve taken this piece of chemical material , and we have it in the bacteria , the bacteria , they started to read this code and produced the particles .
The viral particles are going to cell cells , they &apos;re going to get back and they destroy to the E.
I &apos;ve been talking about the oil of the oil industry , which they &apos;re saying that they have certainly compresent this model .
They requires more than you .
We believe that this is a situation that the software can actually build his same hardware , in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the larger things .
We wanted to build the battery of the bacterium .
They &apos;re more than 580 mountains of genetic code .
So we thought of build it in the casses of viruses , so that we can change the casses to figure out what the components are components of a cell .
The program is crucial information , and if we start with digital information , these must be very accurate .
When we sequency this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accuratetry was a herror to every 10 mile .
We found , we found that , 30 errors , 30 errors . If we were used that , we had that could never be able to do it .
One part of the process is designing is to the 50 letters of 50 literally , you know , they &apos;re all all all the other segments of 50 letters that &apos;s working together .
We can see the only elements here .
You probably have you lect that we have the filights .
I think we have a party , we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C and T.
Three of those letters together together 20 love , and there &apos;s a specific re-crazy order to lector to every love .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , franker , spensive ,
What we &apos;ve been to the beginning was to do it .
Some of them were the fact that it &apos;s not a few .
We designed these segments to simply simply to be able to get them to the whole whole thing .
There are the enenency and they &apos;re hard to them .
And we started to assembling to the parts , starting with signents , by seven to seven to spend the literally swimments of 24 ments lectons of 24 mountain the time to come to 72 ,
We have to have these days , we have produced these segments so we can sequency that we &apos;re trying to make them a minute of the robustot -- like you see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatizing the process .
So , this seems the tabellone of a basic play-basket .
When we get to these very long segments , more than 100 midle , more than 100 midle , they will be more directly in E.
It &apos;s got to the modern of the modern biology of the molecular biology .
So we &apos;ve been looking at other mechanisms .
We had to know , we had a bination called the Romomology , which in biology , in biology , which in biology , to repurpose to repull the DNA to repull the segments .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinoccurs in the radiodd , it can be absorbed by radiation .
You can see in the requires as his door as his chromosoma was destroy .
In 12 , 24 hours is , it &apos;s been exactly as it was before .
There are better than organisms that are able able to do it .
These organisms can be completely .
They can live under the way .
They &apos;re absolutely , of course , there &apos;s life in space , and you know to find new environment of water .
On the NASA shows that this is .
This is a mine of the molecule that we &apos;ve built these processes , just using these processed processed with the segments of segments to inserve .
The lievening them beautiful .
This image was not taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a very quickly .
It &apos;s a very big molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that they get a period of about six seconds .
This is the published that we &apos;ve done little time ago .
They &apos;re more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the most big molecule of a definitely definitely , it &apos;s ever created by the man .
It &apos;s a weight to a long time to 300 million .
If we &apos;re going to be a 10 without spaces , they would like 142 page , it would be 142 page to transclean .
Now , how do we do it ?
Of course , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s a little girls .
It &apos;s a little more complicated when they use batteries .
It &apos;s more simple when it &apos;s cells as a cells as as our : you can just extract it . You can just extract the nuclear and inserious , which is practical process of the clonation of clonto .
In the bacterium , the cromosomosoma is integrated by the cell , but we recently have to make a complex trape of a chromosome of a cell of a cell of a cell of a cell of a cell of a cell , and of a cell .
We have a bunch of a partnership .
The two are different than the men .
We added some gene gene in the way that we could decide that to get to this crazy .
The one of the essentially , it &apos;s the essentially to kill all the protein .
And when we have the mitted in the cells was study -- and you &apos;re going to appreciate our graph -- the new chromosoma -- the new chromosomosoma .
And we were thinking that we could not go three , but we &apos;ve tried to go three , but we &apos;ve tried to spin there .
This is one of the most meccanisms of evolution .
We found that tanssignal that tants have added a second or a third of a third , adgence in a second thousand of the new species of new new ,
So who think about evolution as a gene gene of the modified is not understanding of biology .
There are the encymm called the ency of the restriition that advice that they can digeral DNA .
The cromosoms that was in the cells .
The cellula-cell phone that we have inserito--stand-tail .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognize the other car as as an extraneum , and it &apos;s got it , and we found it with only cells and the new chromosoma .
it &apos;s became blue because of the genes we have inserious .
And in a short least , all the cards of a species , and you have lost , and it turns out of all in a new species , based on the new kind of software that we have in the cells .
All the protein is changed , the member are changed , and when we launch the genetic code of that we &apos;ve turned to that we &apos;ve turned to that we have to be .
Now , this might look like genetic , but altering the software , but altering the software , we can change things in sustained .
Now , I &apos;ve got to explain that here is not talking about genius -- but to do a few million years and a half million years and a half million years and I &apos;ve said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the explosion of the Cambrian Camana in the digital process .
Why do this ?
I think it &apos;s enough to our needs when we think about our needs .
We &apos;re going to past six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to dare a example : I &apos;m born in 1946 .
Now , there are three people on the planet for the exister in 1946 , in 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re doing the problems now to find food food , fresh , fresh , medicinal medical and a half billion people .
It &apos;s going to be more driven to do it for nine billion .
We &apos;re going to start more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion barrasses .
This means millions of bariles to the day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replaces to replaces , it &apos;s a huge challenges .
We have to have to construct the CO2 from CO2 from these materials that finding in the atmosphere .
Al the today , thanks of the scientific discovery in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the designers for the future .
The electronics can only on the electronents , and you think about components , and you think about how many different things are out .
Our limitations here are the biological data from the biological reality and our imagination .
Now , we have the techniques , thank you to these synthetization , we can create what we call genomics combinator .
We &apos;re able to build a big robots that can produce a million of the robots of the cums of the cums .
Think about this 20 million genes of different genes or to try to get to get the processing to get the processing to make the processes , we can change , you can change , thank you very much , and we can change , you know , and we can change more biology , and we can make more biology .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose to possibility of survive , chemical chemical or carburant , or of carburant vaccines .
This is an instances of some software , we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to seem and designing to make a computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how we need to know how they will .
We know , we know , what &apos;s their genetic code .
Now we &apos;re focus with the carburant carbons of quarter generation .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s been a very ,
We have carburants of second and third generation that they &apos;re going to be more more than the high high , as the running or different than the running or different kinds of butananol .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact to have a big impact of food , and we can get the cell of food and limitations would be transforming the CO2 in the first , which we &apos;re working to design cells that we &apos;re working to design cells that we are working to design cells , and we could make this scale , and we could have to have the first carbon of the press of the first generation of the carburant , and we could actually have to about 18 months .
The solar solar combined with CO2 is a methodoor -- but in our discovered in all the world , we found different metohes .
This is a organism that we have described in 1996 .
It &apos;s going to be in deep , at about 2500 feet of the hydropping of the water .
They can put out of CO2 using idrogens and molecular energy .
We &apos;re trying to figure out if we can put the CO2 , which can make it be transported to be transported to your bi , to driving that .
So we think we could be able to be able to be able to aumentary what the question is , &quot; that the question of , &quot; that &apos;s life , &quot; we have the dest of the babiobic , we have the dest of replaces the industry .
So , if you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can you do it ?
It would be a main the energy of energy .
And the three , we &apos;re working to use the same methods to create vaccines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with influence , we &apos;re always going to be a dollar in a dollar , in less when it &apos;s the right right right .
I think that what you can change is build vaccines in the anticipulled .
So , this is how the future could start changing , the tree of evolution , accelerating the evolution with synthetic , and you know , you know , and you know , and incells .
We &apos;re so much like that we can get people .
Our boxes is to live enough to try to try to try to try to try to make it . Thank you very much .
I &apos;ll do all of all I &apos;ll see , the most of the most of the new technology that we have been able to the Microsoft , the new technology that we have to a year ago . This is Seadon . This is Seadon .
It &apos;s a environment that you can interact to the local level that reways with a huge amount of data .
Here we &apos;re seeing a lot of played pictures with a kind of gabyte with a kind of slate , and and I keep , to a bread , disponing the images like we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big the amount of information that we see , how much these colracy cold data , or the images .
Most of the digital photographs , but this is a provense of the Bilioteful scanning of Congress , and it &apos;s in the Lamma of the Congress , and it &apos;s in 300 megapiel .
It doesn &apos;t make a difference because the only thing that it &apos;s the only thing that &apos;s the number of a system like this is the number of pixeline . It &apos;s also an architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data , not images .
This is the Casolate of Dickens . Every colonnon-represents a capital .
So to show you that it &apos;s about heads and not images , we can do a kind of like that , to see it &apos;s a real representation of the heads , not a picture of a picture .
It could be a little bit of a little artificial way to read a book to a book .
You don &apos;t look at the way .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s a number of the Guardian .
Every big imagine is the beginning of a seem .
And it really , it &apos;s the pleasure of lovely and beauty of a review of a review or of a review or a lot of a middle .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of this particular number of this particular .
We &apos;ve created a fasull of the highest solutional solutioneful than that is usutic normal normal , and we have inserious containserious .
If you want to see the characteristics of this authomobile , you can see here .
Or other model , or even specific , or even specific .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on space .
We hope that this means to the pop-up , and other leaders to other cheries , they should not be necessary .
In course , the mapplications is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don &apos;t want to lose time , if we don &apos;t want to say that we have contributing to this camp .
These are all the streets in the U.S. &apos;s &apos;s the NASA .
So now we &apos;re going to be what we &apos;re going to be .
This is actually actually , it &apos;s actually from the website ; you can see it .
This is a project called Photosynth , which is two different technologies .
One is Seadon and the other is a research of sual computer , in Noah Snaveled Noah Snaveling , a student of the University of the U.S. Seitz of the USeitz of Microsoft Rick Sezeliski . &quot;
And it &apos;s from the website , the Seadon Seadon .
You can see it when we do this when we do this kind of scale , where we can spend from a picture of the other and have this kind of experience to the other and have this kind of experience .
But the location of the space of images here has actually a meaning .
The goritms of the computer have record these images together , they know , so that corresponds to the record of the record to the record to the read , the neighbs of the Montactor , the Montagenced to the Montnaaauntil of a sunlight of a sler , and these things are all the elements of a slible , and these things are all the space of the hundred of the space .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more space .
I want to spend one of the original sects of Noahahahahahotosynth of a prototynth of Photosynth that we have done for the first time the first time the first time the extact of the website , the fact that we have to be the technology , the technology , the Potosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily the webody of the website .
We had to have to worry about the lab and waiting .
This is a rebuilt of the Nothers of Nothers , Do images , and you &apos;re going to have Nothers in Flickr , and you get a picture of these kinds of types , other field of the field , other field of these construction , and you &apos;re saying . Other one of these connects , and you get a picture that &apos;s discovered to this model .
So , I &apos;m all images from Flickr and you &apos;re all colleagues in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to have to this simplicate .
You know , I would never think I would never think about Microsoft .
It &apos;s very grative to reevening this kind of account here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different kinds of different kinds of focus , from the photos of the cellulararararly , a number of the SLR , a number of the environment .
And if I can try to try to look at the most strange .
Many of a lot of easy , etc .
Sometimes you find a photographs of photographs -- etc .
This is a Nothers of Nothers recorrectly .
We can spend the poster of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data -- from the collective memory of how to appear the major of view -- and colleagues all those data together together .
All those pictures become college together , most of the parts of the parts .
You have a model of the earth that .
You think about this as a prolder of the Stephen Lawler Lawler on Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity , that the people use it , and the which is that the people are usual to use it .
Their photograph are herself with other people .
If you &apos;re going to contrast all these saying , and I said the name , my picture of the Nothname of Nothname of Nothnamed , and the post-cooket , and the pose I can use the data , and I can use the place , in that universe , in that universe , and I can have a very clear of the way , and you have a very cha-crazy , and you have a very crazy of the way of the ced-ceyced-cade of the way .
In course , a consequence of all of this is , of course , the extremely elaborated with any interesting part of the earth , and by images and by images and satellitary and by images , and by the collective of the collective , but from the collective of the collective , but from the collective of the world , but from the collective virtual memory of all of the earth , and by the hatellyses ,
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? I understand ? What your software going to be able to do is that in a certain point , in the next years , all the photographs of all in the world will be practical and shared it together ?
BASShe : Yes . What &apos;s doing in practical is to discover .
It &apos;s creating the hyperlink , if you want , you know , the images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the contains of the images .
The thing is really interesting if you think about the rewareness of the simple information of the simple information that many of these images .
As when you have a research of the web , you know , it &apos;s a senter and the page on the web of the web of pictures .
Now , what if that picture is the picture of your picture ?
So the amount of the amount of the simultimate and the quantity of remember that &apos;s really huge is really huge . It &apos;s a huge effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible .
BA : You know , you know , very much .
One of the main the major of the major of the neographs and the the research is the power of the major who has not have to living antic antic antic , the draw in the wind , the droom , the touch of the flower , and the watching of the floor .
Basti think that the Jaguar , the Via Lattea , or that &apos;s the Lattea , or that &apos;s the Mititites are still colors of the Himalaya , which is the Himalaya , the good distances of Dharm , and that the idea of the central central central , and that the idea that the idea that we don &apos;t exists in the world that we live in the sense of the world that we don &apos;t have a sense of actually , but it &apos;s just a a car ,
the consequence of a particular set of scowever , we did , well , well , or a mal , many generations ago .
And of course , we all share the essential of the essential .
We all all nasks . All we have to create .
We are sloved by the beginning of the beginning .
We have to death the inexorability of morning , so we don &apos;t surprising and ballion ,
We all have a look .
What the colpiscoes is the particular song , the ritm of the song , the ritm of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that they are the the Volololder of the Borneo , or the Wooks of Haiti , or the World World World World World World , and the Curandery in the Sahara .
He was the My of the journey in the desert of a month ago , or a hyak in the values of the Everest , in the Everest , the demother of the world .
All of these populations are teaching that there are other ways of exists to think , other ways of move in the world .
And if you reflected a active , it &apos;s a concept that you can give you hope .
Insides , the miriadies of the world creating a spiritual life of spiritual life that &apos;s a spiritual hospital and it &apos;s important to the planet as a little bit of the planet as biosfer .
And you can think about this cultural girl as a hydrops and you can define the nosphone , and you can define the nosphere , you know , you know , ideas , intuitions , intuitive ideas , intuitions , intuitive ideas , intuitive ideas .
The nosphere is the great patrimp of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and that we can be in how species .
And because the biosphere was a lot of the nosphere is , and it &apos;s very much more reidly .
Nobody , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all the species of all the species of all the species of the extinction of the extinct , or in the most apocalong -- in the most of the different biological camp -- and you don &apos;t have even neighbor in the hystic of the cultural different countries .
The injection of all is , of course , the lost linguistic .
When you were born , they were there 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not just composed by a vocabolary or from a series of the grammaticals .
A language is the human spirit .
It &apos;s the meeting with the animal of every culture of all culture in the material .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a wind , a think , a think , a hual of the spiritual possibility .
And the 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re sitting to Monterey , at least half the meant is not sususually more susually in the orecchie of kids .
They don &apos;t get more teached to kids , which is that you don &apos;t wave , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
What &apos;s more trists of the being volunteer , of the slenenency , the last to talk a language , of the wisn &apos;t being the wisn &apos;t going to be the promising of the file ?
This is horring is the someone in the world of the world every two weeks : every two weeks , and a hancient bullabe , and it &apos;s the tomb of a language of a language .
And I know that somebody you know , &quot; Is it &apos;s not better ?
The world would not be a better place if we talk to the same language ? &quot; Benish , then we all talk to all yoruba .
We &apos;re kogi .
You &apos;ll buy a tract thing to say , you know , you can &apos;t talk about their language .
I would like to do you get to do a journey through the nosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a massive of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us mentican of us that when you say , &quot; different ways of existing , &quot; really different ways of exists .
Let &apos;s take Barasana Barasana , in Amazonia , in Amazonia , the population of the anacony of the anaconia of the latest west of the latest west of the latest west wines .
It &apos;s a population that is not able to distinguished the blue color because the best of the blue of the best , that &apos;s hydrink , which is identify the population .
They have a strange language and a mathemselves , depending , &quot; exactly , &quot; exactly , &quot; I have to get a person who who talked a person who who talked a different language .
All this has radical radical in the mitological past , and it &apos;s that in these families that you &apos;re talking about six or seven or seven or seven lingua .
They get to listening and then they start talking .
We make one of the most interesting tribes with which I &apos;ve lived , the Waoran of Ecuador Ecuador , an incredible population that has had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionaries have tented a common to make a fact .
They did it from the photographs that they would realize them in pose that they would have to be in positive , by the forest of the forest , and it had never seen the null of birth ,
They have the pictures from the earth , they have to the research of a shape or a shape or , they don &apos;t find nothing , they conclush , and they killed the five , and they killed the five missionaries with the lance .
But Waoran is not the strange of the strange .
They kill the they were of them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused to them .
We &apos;re sitting to eight generations and we found two cases of natural morning and when we have insisted to know , they have that one of them was invecting , and then they kill it it it , and then they kill it the same . And then they had a incredible way , they had a incredible way , they had a incredible way of the forest .
The across were able to recognize the urina of animal to 40 step and recognize the species .
In the first 1980s , I was asked a very interesting compiece of Harvard , when my professor of Harvard and I was asked to Haiti , and I was going to Haiti , and the South of Dualier and Tonton Macton Mackune , and I mimpose Tonton Macton Mackle , and I impose to do it .
For a sense of meraculous , I should be understanding the Vodoun and that Voodoo is not magnera .
It &apos;s a little bit of a complex vision , metaphor of the world .
Many interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the big religions of the world , what you would you have to tell me ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Budddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the Saharan Africa has no feeling . And he &apos;s walked and Voodoo is not the other distilled , and Voodoo is not other distilled than the tragic , very deep of these religious religious concept .
What makes interesting is the report is the report of the life and morning .
So the view they make you get the spirits .
The spirits can be invocused by the Great Aqua , they said , and they said , &quot; they &apos;re going to be invoccurred to the anima short that we can be the anima short that for a short of the traditional .
So , this voodooists are going to be wonderful to talk about God .
We &apos;re dancient and we were God .
And the moment you &apos;re posting you , is the spirit that you you can make you do you do the mal ?
So you &apos;re listening to these incredible events : folks the watching voodoo in the state of trance , infuel infuel , infuel , you know , the street of the mind when it &apos;s flowed in a state of extremely exciting .
It &apos;s all the population of the most extraordinary , the most extraordinary of the Sierra Nevada Santa Marta , in Colombia , in Colombia .
It &apos;s going to make civilization that a time , which was a living planet &apos;s carbon the planet &apos;s clean to the conquires , the population of the conququickly , the population of the carbon the plane carbon the planet &apos;s huge of the carbc ang .
In a walked , in a blood , this population never been conquicted by the spagners .
And yet today , I &apos;m government , but their formation is , they &apos;re actually crazy .
The young people who are brought out of the families to three or four years , and they live in a world of good and bombs in a world of good and bombs in the bombs of the ice for 18 years .
Two periodd of nine years , in the countries of the gestation of gestation that turn the nine of gestation that they turn the mother , now are metaphor of the My .
So , this time , they &apos;re acculate values of their society , values that their prevent and only their prevent and only their prevent , or to say the cosmic equilibrium -- or for the cosmic equilious .
Al termine of this incredible initible inaction , they &apos;re suddenly brought out and for the first time , in the age of 18 years , you see a high . And in that we would see the first bor of the first bor , when the solution of the first bor is , the basic , it &apos;s conferred in the hundred of the bore , and he says , &quot; She says , &quot; Sometimes , and he says , &quot; Someats a past .
&quot; I &apos;m going to do you . I said .
It &apos;s study . Now it &apos;s going to protect it . &quot;
They call the most most of the most and say that we are , frackers , we are the basic puring of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think of the Indigene and the environment , we &apos;re invoking Resignore and the old story of the noble story , which is a concept of the noble , which is a very closer , and we say that these populations are more closer to us .
The English population are not feeling nor sentimental .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the diarise of the Aphat , or in the gelids of the Tibet , but thanks to the time and you have a mistic war of the Earth , they created a mistic intuition of the class of the car , the concept that the Earth can only because it &apos;s only because it &apos;s only because it &apos;s infected by the cuman of the cystic intuition .
What does it want to say ?
It mean that a little girls that a little girls that a little girls that &apos;s a main the mountain is a spirit of the Apu that will be a human huge , it &apos;s a very different report of the world , and it &apos;s going to be a little bit of the Mountain the Mountain the Mountain the Monana that a mountain is a mountain to be scary .
which is the dimour of a hour , or a mineral hour is irrifying .
What &apos;s interesting is that it &apos;s the meaning is that the report between individual and natural world .
I grew up in the forest of Columbia cred-credrawings that the forest to be cut .
And that &apos;s a human being different from my friends Kwakiutl Kwakiutl that crediments are the dimour of Hukuk and the bag of the paradiments and the spirits of the world , the spirits that we live in the world , exploiting the Hamator of the Hamator , the the Hamak of Hamake .
If you start to look at that these cultures can actually make different cultures , you can start to understand some of them and they &apos;re going to be able to understand some of them .
I wrote this picture to the Amazonia in Amazony .
Mayaxis , I &apos;ve heard about the Mayahuash , the most powerful psychoat the repertorium of the repertorium .
What it makes the eascinating ayahuash is not the potential powerful map , but his elaboration . It &apos;s composed by two elements .
She &apos;s a late , this lian lian lgnosa of of the carbon of a carbon of the hundred and harmer , slightly .
Phit &apos;s a bule burn that alterm a bluash that alterm a little bit of the consciousness , but it &apos;s myself with the cle of the caffected of the caffected ,
This planet , the triptamp , very similar to serotonine , method-dyltrylicylicyltryltryltryltryltryltrymine .
If you ever see the Yanomami to the nose to the sushing that they do from a different set of species , it &apos;s contained methoxyltryltryltryltryltryltryltrices .
Tiring that policy on the nose is is a little bit like to be sparked by a fucile of the dipaper of the dipaper and background on a history of electricity . Risn &apos;t creates a reality of the reality .
I had often often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultype , man who wrote the psychedeliced , with his discovered fungs in the &apos; 30 in the years of the fungs of the most of the key ,
Second my countries can classic these tripatterns like hallucinogens as as a hallucinogens because if you &apos;re doing no one of being kinated . &#91; &#91; Risate triputes , and the triputs , they can &apos;t be unable to be untest because they &apos;re in the testin , decline-.
It &apos;s possible to be absolutely if you closer with other chemical chemicals that denatural chemicals that denaturally the MAO .
Now , it &apos;s the beauty : the carbon of the MAOO , are inibitors of the MAO , the same kind of the MAO , the same kind of the triptamine . The surprises of the world , in a floor of 80,000 species , as these people are going to find two death , but that if you can find two , they &apos;re not smiles , but if you &apos;re the combining , they &apos;re going to be able to be able to be a hunt of the time ?
We use the big euphereufemism and the herror , which can reveal infrues .
But if we ask to the Indians , they &apos;ll say , &quot; The full we &apos;re talking about . &quot;
What does it want to say ?
This tribes , the Cofan , he &apos;s 17 variety of ayahuash , which is that distinguished in the forest , and that our eyes would be in the same species .
If we ask them how they stabilized their task , they &apos;ll tell us , &quot; I was thinking about that , I didn &apos;t know , you know , I didn &apos;t know ? &quot;
The solution is : you get 17 variety in a ller and each other , and each will get a different song with a different toms .
With this doesn &apos;t have laureduces to Harvard , but it &apos;s very interesting to contact the stams .
Now , &#91; &#91; &#91; &#91; the problem is that the problem is that the problem of us that have the people who have the people who have the world are pitting in the world , but in some way of the history of the world , and the past of our world , and the past of our world , and the past three .
In fact , the 19th century , between 300 years , it &apos;s going to be remember or sue and innovations , but rather like the was that we stopped and we have been became the truck of the world , and we have been became the distraction of the biological planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All cultures are involved in the centuries are in a dance for new possibility .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux Sioux , they have to be Sioux when they have been high from the ark and they have so Americans have been horse when they have messed by horse and caves .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that mines the technology of the nosphere . It &apos;s the power . It &apos;s the power .
The wall of the domination .
And if you look at a world , you &apos;ll find that these are not cultures that these are not cultures to comparison .
They &apos;re creatures and dynamics out of the existence that are going to be in the hydrops that they have been able to be adaptment .
Sy that &apos;s that it &apos;s about the wall in the patria of the think --
a population of Sarawak , in the soul , a population , a population that has lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to the watch of the field of the field of the five , where you can see the Borem that looks like the host of the MCar Carawak , where the names the Cinese , where the Naves the horite , where the named Medwar , where the names the Not of the horth MCak Cak Caak , the Medwaks , and you can see the horator , and you can see the names the namawak , and the MCan &apos;s M
You get the stive stys with the stive to the forest .
Or in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that you have to the discovery of the goll of the golden .
If we &apos;re going to be on the mountains of the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of the political domination .
You know , as you know the genocide , the physical physical level , is condannect , but the nnamed of life , but the distraction of a population , not only is condannect , but it &apos;s not just condaned in the environment , because it &apos;s part of the developing of developing developing count .
And you can &apos;t understand the soil of Tibet . And you can &apos;t be part of the beginning .
I &apos;ve lost the 6,000 miles from Chengager in China in the China in the Western Tibet , by Lhasa with a young people , but only came to Lhasa , but only came to Lhasa , I understand what we &apos;re going to talk .
6,000 mounds of sacrates and centers .
1.2 million people killers killers in the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascrited to Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed to the tempes of the Chinese invasion .
His guy , it &apos;s fuged with Santity in Santity in Santity in Not .
Souther mother was imprisoned and his color was to be received .
It was taken to the age of two years , and it was slightly under his gonna because he wouldn &apos;t have to live without her her .
The surprised , which has been mitted in the result of reeducation .
A day he was became a raffer , and it was a raffurant , and for this transgression , and for this transgression , and he was mitted to hundred years .
The wake of the Tibet can be insophistory , but it explains the Nouth &apos;s taken .
In the end , it &apos;s all of the basic .
We want to live in the world world &apos;s mocropy or want to account the world of the policromatical world of different different .
The great anthropologa Margaret Mead , before we &apos;ve said that his largely , in our great , that in our house , we &apos;re not just seeing the whole amority of the human imagination of human ination , and the human ination of the human ination , but a day , but a day , a day day , but we &apos;re seeing a day , but a day we &apos;re going to see that there were other possibility .
And it &apos;s a billion remember that our species is existence for 60,000 years .
The Rivolution Rivolution , which has given us the agriculture , which has done us to the cult of the sea , and sustaining poetry to the the Not of the clererarchy , and we talk about 1000,000 years ago .
The modern world industrialized world , it &apos;s 300 years .
The history is not suggested to me that we have the answer that we have the answer to all the challenge that we should be able to come in .
When these cultures of cultures of the world is asked what to be to be humans , respond to be human , they respond to 100,000 voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all requires we &apos;ll find the possibility of being what we are : a species , which we &apos;re all the population of all populations and all the people and all the people are hundred of the hotmism .
I took this picture on the north of the north of the Baffin , when I went to the history of the Buit , and this guy , and this man , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , and he told me the wonderful story of his non-history .
The government is not always gentile with the Inuit and in the 1950s to stabilier our prematia , we have to clean to stop .
The nondon &apos;t of this man came to go to go .
And the family , I &apos;m going to take his life , he brought all the arms , and all his actual actual actual .
You know that Inuit doesn &apos;t have the cold , the sframes .
The bathers of the origins were made of weighbors , in the career of careon .
The non-non-saying , it &apos;s not saying from the basic , or from the blizem that was suffering .
It &apos;s hot , it &apos;s calculated , it &apos;s calculated in the skin and defecated in their hand , when you do the fectors , and it &apos;s working , and it &apos;s working a lama .
He was spracting on the points of this cacca of cacca and when he was solided .
He schools and created a bridge , and he &apos;s created a huge , he has created a sliter , he has imbried another song and it &apos;s saved on the bankey , the cacca of cacca .
We want to talk about cavar with nothing ? &#91; &#91; Risn , and that , in different ways , &#91; Applauss is the symbols of the population of the population of the world .
In the 1999 , 1999 , the government has redded to the Inuit &apos;s control of a territorary area of a territorary area of California and Texas of the mas of the California and Texas together .
It &apos;s their new patria . It &apos;s called Nunavoring .
It &apos;s a territorary territorum . Controlate all the resources .
One of the splenden example of how a national national state can reach with his population .
And to finish , I think it &apos;s rather than us , in the world of us was in these zone of us , make it consumption that they don &apos;t have to be remotion and .
For somebody is home .
They representing sections of human imagination that are the human imagination that are all of these kids , as the snetwork of these children , as the snetwork , as the sity of the hope .
For finally , we are National Geographic , we are convints that political is going to be in null .
We believe that the policies --
&#91; Applauss , they &apos;re not persuasive , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the better institution to tell the world , we &apos;re the best of the world . Every month , our remarkable to tell the world .
156 countries , in our televisive television .
our reviews are leven millions of people .
Our work is traveling to bring our public , in the audience in the nost of wonderful cultural wonderful , and they will be hopefully , and hopes , they &apos;ll be hopefully , they &apos;ll be a focket of the exister , and we need to find a huge , and we need to find a higalister in a different huralistory of life in a world and multicultural world to a central life in a world , and we have seen ,
where the gegeess of all populations can contribute to our collective well-being collective .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I &apos;ve been going to be able and I &apos;m going to evidence some college , in the case , in case , in case , in case , in case , in case ,
I want to start with what I call the dogm . &quot;
The dogm official thing ?
The dogm of all the society of all the society of the Western industrial society , &quot; If we want to myze the well-being of our citizens . &quot; The way to do it is to male the individual liberty . &quot;
The reason is , from a hundred , in fact that liberty is in the same value , is precious , it &apos;s full , for human beings .
In the other one is that if we &apos;re libeside , each of us can act to do all that that &apos;s going to be able to do all that that we &apos;re going to be , no one that decided in name .
The way to male the liberty is to be to be to be to be to be the choice .
More the people are , the most liberty , most liberty , most of the liberty , most of the liberty , most of them is .
This , is that , it &apos;s so deeply radicated in society that nobody would have dreamed to put it in the society .
And it &apos;s also deeply radicated in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has got possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly .
I hope a simple note of the condents to the insalt .
In the market , there are 175 condents , without context the 10 variety of oolier , and the 12 acets , and the 12 acets that you can buy to a huge number of condent , which nobody is already of the condent cost that nobody &apos;s going to be a car of your degrees .
Here &apos;s the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronics of electronics to buy a stereum : CD , radio , radio , radio , and a plifer .
And in this single neighbor of electronics , there &apos;s a big number of audio .
We can make six million and a different combinations of different combinations that there are in a neighborhood .
You know , you know , there &apos;s a scoke .
Other the fields : the world of the communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all the serve services , and it was a bad of the desive , and the bad that they were forniture ,
He was born , he was not buy it .
One consequence of this , the phone , it was never going to be .
These are the temptes .
Now , we have a variety of phone , specially between cellulararly .
Here &apos;s the future .
My prefer is that in the middle , MP3 , cut up of the nose , and you forat the nose to the cave car .
If you don &apos;t have seen in the home , you &apos;re going to be home , you &apos;re going to be in the home , you &apos;re going to be .
And what &apos;s going to the end is that people are in the nezi and it &apos;s this question is , you know what is the answer ? &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not to buy a cellulate that doesn &apos;t make too too much .
So , in other aspects of the life that are much more important than the buying plosion , you know , the same explosion of choose .
Assistence : Sanitary is : not going to be in the United States , that you &apos;re going to be the doctor and doctor doctor , what you do .
Instead , you know , you know , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do it , or we could do it , or you know , &quot; AB , &quot; AB , &quot; he &apos;s the walks and these weks . &quot;
You know , &quot; Dr. &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; As these walks and the risks , and he &apos;s these walks and these risks . &quot;
&quot; What you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebats , you know , you know , she would be the way ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not . &quot;
The result that we call the direct of the disease , &quot; expression that it seems to be a beautiful thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not a fishing , and the responsibility and responsibility to make decisions of somebody who knows something , you know , and almost certainly , it &apos;s not any any of the world , and so in the condition to make decisions .
There &apos;s a huge marketing of products , you know , direct to people like me and you , which if you think there &apos;s no sense , you know , we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why do you get them ?
The answer is that we want to domaction , we call the doctor to change the recipe of changes .
What &apos;s the fundamental as our hythemselves is that our hythemselves , as you see in this jobs , as you see in this jobs , &quot; We don &apos;t want to force the kids . &quot;
And we can reinvented us how many times we can get us .
which means that every morning , to squeen , you have to decide that kind of person wants to be .
And it was a little bit of the family and mathemselves , a time , a time , a time , he was that you could have to be able to anyone , and he started to make the most present , and he started to get the most present .
The only track of the only thing to the who , you know , and not even when , and not even when , and nothing to do .
Egiday , it &apos;s really to play .
It &apos;s a lot of intelligent students , and I do their 20 percent of work in less than a time .
And because they &apos;re not going to be brilliant , because they &apos;re not less diligents .
but why I &apos;m impensive , I would ask me , I would you know , &quot; I would like to do it ? &quot;
&quot; I would have to spend more tart ? I have to think before you know , or the career ? &quot;
They &apos;re interrational logorant .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this is not to the company that you can &apos;t get the company and not to get a bel wonderful wonderful .
And they have really really really , they &apos;re important questions .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , as Carl , because the technology , because technology we &apos;ve lost us to work every minute , every day , from the planet , tranks that from Hotel Randolph .
I &apos;m talking about , there &apos;s a corner , and I &apos;m not going to tell anybody , where , where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t want to use it .
What means , this incredible liberty of scoes that we have to keep work ? It &apos;s that we have to keep , and we have to keep , if we have to work or no .
We can go to see our son , we can go to the calculate in a touch , the Blackberry , the Blackberry , and the notebook , on the ginocky .
And even though they &apos;re all spends , every minute that we see our son , we &apos;re also asking , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; I said , &quot; I said , &quot; I said , &quot; I said , &quot; I said , &quot; I said , &quot; I said , &quot; I said , &quot; I said , &quot; I have to answered the partners that we see our son , we &apos;re also seeing our son , &quot; I have
&quot; I have to answer this email ? I have to get this literate ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , &quot; it makes the experience of your child &apos;s hood to be a very different conditions .
So , from whatever we look , little big things , little big , the objects and the life is a question of the life is a question of scowever .
Once the world was , there was a few possibility , and there was some possibility , but it was not a question of .
The world today &apos;s going to be this : The dilemma is , &quot; It &apos;s a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Seally , we have to be .
The positive basic them all , so I &apos;m going to talk about that negative .
All this choice is two effects of two effects of the people .
The first , is , it &apos;s that produced in the paralysis that liberation .
And many options to the frame of what you can get to be very hard to do it .
I &apos;m officed for a meaning : one study conducted spians of the floor of the world of the volunteer .
A colleagues had access to the Vantual World , the society of the world , with about a million climate climents in 2,000 companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that for every 10 solutions that are offered in the most , percentage of adesion , the percentage of the adesion of two percent .
With 50 percent of offering , there &apos;s 10 percent of the most of the exhibition , it &apos;s only five . Why ? Why ?
Because with 50 source of what you choose , it &apos;s maleasy to decide , and it &apos;s got to decide , and the choice is that we &apos;ve been homorrow to the indomorate .
And the domorate , and still domorate , domories , domorally , and of course , it &apos;s never arrive .
You know that you don &apos;t mean that these are workers to food for canoes because they don &apos;t have enough money to song enough money , it also , it also , it also , it also , it &apos;s so host of the lost of the dator of the work of the work .
Not team , they &apos;re going to five , and it &apos;s going to five from the work , which would be willing to be the real job .
So the paralisis , the consequence of the experience .
And I think that &apos;s going to make the world .
&quot; And to finished , for the eternity , or maybe or maionth ? &quot;
You would look at the right decision , if it &apos;s for the eeternity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong bad , and nepural condent the wrong .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can actually evitate the paralisis , and we &apos;re going to be less sodle , we &apos;re less sod-, we &apos;re less options to the way we were in the basic options .
And that for different reasons .
One of these is that with many condents , if you buy , if you buy a , if you buy a and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could make a different scoke that would be better . And that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be better . And that &apos;s that &apos;s the alternative , and the the squeer , and the the repiece of the choice , and the the slandsceling of the decision , and the slabor , and the sloved by the decision ,
when it was a very good decision .
More scoes are , more easy than the often is that it &apos;s insodle that it &apos;s initional insodle .
And the three , there is what economists called cost opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has clear very well . It &apos;s really good as the value that we &apos;re going to be on what we &apos;re confront .
In the rest , when there &apos;s a very opposed to be , is easy to represent the career of the alternative of the option of the option that you can be less than the option that you can see it .
Here &apos;s an example . I wrote with all that I &apos;m not New York .
But it &apos;s what you would probably think .
There &apos;s this coppia of Hamptons .
A place of the lush .
It &apos;s hundred . Ottttim drawings . It &apos;s all of them .
Nothing . But what he thought is , &quot; Well , malbuilding , malbuilding , is Agost . &quot;
&quot; All my neighbors are the Manhattan are so . &quot;
&quot; I could talk about home . &quot;
And in two weeks two weeks , and it &apos;s led by the idea that &apos;s perfect -- every day -- the chance of parking where it wants .
The cost-opportunity to defation the sodle of that we have , even when the choice was eccellent .
And the most of options that we have to look , the most of the most actual characteristic acteristic as opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
We talk about the living time , and perhaps of living .
But the most important point is that anything you &apos;re going to be scowever , you know , you &apos;re not going to do the other .
The things that we don &apos;t choose to ten less active active .
Terzo : the growth of the expectation of expectation .
I tried to my skin comprised a new jeans .
I &apos;m going to almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were a kind of compraves and westers and westers , they were wondered , only after they had to go and they had a lot of times , they started to go .
So I went to buy a new major a new day when the old who were went , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my wrong . &quot;
The committed me , he said , &quot; Who wants to me , fit ? &quot;
You want to get the certain the bottoons ? &quot; Stonewashhorewashidwashhydashhorse and &quot; &quot; &quot; My &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; My &quot; and &quot; &quot; Make &quot; or &quot; ackons ? &quot;
&quot; Let me want to stream ? &quot;
&quot; Some people want to eld the street ? Bol basic -- &quot; Continuate .
I was balordit , and after a little bit of the guy , I mean , &quot; I want the kind of -- which was the only kind of the kind of thing that was , so for a hour , I had a little bit of the best staans , and then I had the best of the jeans , the best jeans , the best jeans , with the best jeans , and I had been .
It was the very best . I had the best . I had the better .
But I &apos;d feel worse .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand it .
The reason I was worst , I was worst that I was worked with all the mie of the expectation was high , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was expected minime . I didn &apos;t expected minime when there was a kind of a kind of , but when there was a kind of a , but when you live 100 different , at least a kind of a hopefully .
What I had to buy was good , but not lost .
After the waiting that I was trying to what I was walked in the context of expectation .
The options of options in the life of the people don &apos;t make the expectations of the expectal options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the people are not to achieve the expectation of the people who are not to achieve the expectation of the people do not to achieve the ex
And that will be less sod-full , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the marketing world of marketing .
Because if they know , if they were not know what I &apos;m talking about .
The real hard truth is the most to this .
&quot; It was better when it was worst , &quot; The reason that he was better when he was better when he was worst , it was that when he was worst of the printer was still possible to meet the surprised of the prison .
Egiday , in the world we live -- the opulents , industrialized , the industrialized , the mass of perfection -- the mass we can hope is that we can hope is that the things are to the high of expectations .
You don &apos;t have surprised because your expectations , you know , the expectations , you &apos;re ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- that &apos;s , &quot; Basse , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , you want . &quot;
I mean , little autobiography -- that I &apos;m really saying , and it &apos;s really study .
I won &apos;t had to do better , I &apos;m not going to do .
But it &apos;s not always a good thing .
So , a consequence of the buy of the buy jeans , when there &apos;s only that you &apos;re just like that when you &apos;re not sure , and you ask you , and you ask you , and you ask you , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot;
The world is the responsible . What could I do you do you ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a wonderful insodle , and you ask you who &apos;s the responsible , is otherwise , it &apos;s the responsible , you &apos;re going to be .
You would have to do better .
With hundreds of dispone-a-a-, there are no choose for the insuccess .
So when people are decisions , even though the results is walking , you know , they spend and they &apos;re going to their own .
In the last years , the depression is explosa in the industrialized world .
I think a meaning that a meaning -- not the only one , but important -- of this wonderful , of this depression of depression , because the standard of the people are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that the color is their .
So the final results is that we &apos;re better , objectively , but we &apos;re worst .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogm , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely fully fully .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit of scoke is better than I have to have it , but that &apos;s not going to be a lot of a little bit better .
There &apos;s a critical value , magical . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure that we have surprised by a piece of the level that the best choose our life .
Now , from the political point of the political point -- I have almost up -- from the political point of view , the nocle is .
What you &apos;re going to put this all of the industrial society is the recognize material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , which is not too much .
The problem is that they have too little .
So the factory that I &apos;m talking is a diesclusive to be a diesclusive , recidental recidental society .
And what it &apos;s going to be to be this : Steve Levitt &apos;s this : Steve Levitt talked about how those costops and scomodds to the whatever . It &apos;s a fourth of money .
I mean that these choose , complicated and dispendent , is that they are just unuseful .
They &apos;re going to be advanced .
They do often .
If you have a little bit of what our society , you know , it &apos;s been reversed in the where people have too few people have too much that &apos;s not only their life to be better , but also , it would be the better , but also , the course of our lives .
This is what economists call a parel economists .
A desibution of the reduced , it &apos;s not just to poveri -- not only to poverty of this scoke in the ecture that we &apos;ve been hard to the poverty that we hold us .
For conclude , you can become all that you want to become all you want to be --
You know , people of culture , you &apos;re thinking , &quot; But what you do that ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t get anything in a glass of the glass . &quot;
&quot; An an an action , a limitation vision of the world -- &quot;
and I &apos;m going to be interpret , I &apos;ve interpret .
But then , I think , instead , I &apos;m realized that that fish the long .
Because the fact of fact , it &apos;s that if you eat the bocks , in the way that &quot; all you can &apos;t get the liberty . &quot; You get it .
If you &apos;re going to be the way that all of the way that all of divents possible divents .
You &apos;re going to be the paralises , and you &apos;re going to be .
All they need a sfull .
This is almost certainly too much , perhaps for the fish , and it &apos;s sure for us .
But the hasn &apos;t some simbully sfull of the windog and , I , for the rovine .
Thank you very heard .
