The year I showed these slide to show that the calculation to show that the calculation , which for almost three million years has had the size of the U.S. continental continental continental , it &apos;s restream restream .
However , this sub-up , because it is not shows the ice of the ice , because it doesn &apos;t show the ice of the ice .
The arctic calculation is , in a sense , the pulsing heart of the global climate system .
It &apos;s expanded inverter and it &apos;s rities .
The next slide is going to be a remarkable requires of the last 25 years .
The ice lose loss are signed in red .
As you see , they expand up to blue .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter , which is the winter .
You can see that the ice cosidly ice , five years or more , it &apos;s like the blood , which is like the blood , which is the blood , which is the blood .
In 25 years , it was going to be like this .
This is a problem because the interest in the ocean , the landing of the glacker , where there are huge quantities of the artage that , science , which , science , are transformed into metane from the microbes .
I &apos;m putting to the totality of the atmospheric inquiture , that quantity might radical , supered this point of not .
In some laghi pattern in Alaska , the metane is already rebecting from the water .
The Katey Walter of the University of Alaska , Alaska has been full led with a team that winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Wow , &quot; The question is if we &apos;re going to be .
A reason is that this term , the term I &apos;m going to be the Greenland from north .
This is a figured out in the glacial .
The brought didn &apos;t have reached levels .
This is the Kangerlush &apos;s Kangered in the South of Greenland .
If you want to know how the squeen squeen for the sea ice of the ice of the ice on terrain , here &apos;s where the set .
These runents are increasing rapidly .
At the other part of the planet : Antarctica , the greatest block of the planet .
The month scientists have diclosed that the ice of the ice of ice is in negative , and that the Antarctica , and that the Eartica , which pograrain on some under the squeen .
Equeeiving six feet of the switches , like in Greenland .
Sull Himalayas , the third greater block of ice , you see new laghi , which a new laghi were glaged .
40 percent of the world population is going to be half of the world &apos;s power from the leaving .
Sulle Ande : this ice ice is the source of the water of this city .
The led is increased .
But when it diminishes , the same happens to water .
In California , the snow on the Sierra Nevada is declined .
The hyrices are in the crisis .
The predictions , as you read , are favorable .
The growth of the world is for the income to a remarkable inside of incends .
The environmental disaster are increasing a rhythm , and without precedented .
Four times more numerous than the last 30 years from the precedented 75 .
This is an involved .
If you look in the historic context if they can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 25 million tons in the oceans every day .
Look at the area of the East Pacific , from American , to American , and on the west parts of the Indian subcontinent , where there &apos;s a radical impact of oxygen in the oceans .
Most causes of global warming , with the deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossil fuels .
The oil is a problem , and the paper is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with the most emissions , with China .
And he was proposed to build a lot of other central central .
But we &apos;re seeing a change .
These are the projects in the last few years and some of the last few years and some of the verse verse verse .
In the way , there &apos;s a lots of political in our country .
The carbon industries and oil are spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the paper , which is a hosymous symbol .
That image I remember something --
Natal , in Tennessee , where I live , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion pounds of paper scores .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen it on the news .
This is the second bigger of scories in America .
It &apos;s happened around to Natal .
The nature of one of the carbon industries was this .
Video : My the carbon , the carbon is a type and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it makes our economy .
Maybe the carbon is always more clean .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and work , and they keep the stipendent .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest society in the mountain in the mountains is Massey Cot . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosis , Harry Reid -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Protection of Clima Clima has been launched .
This is one of them , one .
Video : Attor : Attor : Attor , we see the climate change as a tiny minute .
So , our priority is to invest a big quantity of money in a publishment of a publishment to make public and confused the truth .
In fact , the charcoal is not sporting .
We think it &apos;s clean -- it &apos;s also good profuman .
So , you don &apos;t preoctation of climate change .
Let me do .
Video : Attor : Attor : You &apos;ve heard a lot of you heard .
So let me go up a town in a stream in a stream of advancing .
Strading ! The car is a little bit , but this is the sound of the car of the car .
The carbon of the paper is between the main the world &apos;s climbing , but the remarkable technology , but the remarkable paper that you see all see .
Do a look , this is the technology of the clean of the clean of clean .
Al Gore : Inally , the positive alternative , the positive alterm and the economic issue .
Video : My America is in the way ; the national economy , national security , national security , climate crisis .
The philos that connects : our holding from fossil of fossil , like the spork and the oil .
Now , perhaps there &apos;s a new , audace solution for using circle .
Really America : 100 percent of energy , 100 percent of the wealth , 10 years .
A plan to put America to make us more safety , and help to stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that &apos;s solving our problems .
Really America . She cover .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It &apos;s about this : It &apos;s about energy to America .
One of the fastest ways to bring up the trend of the beautiful ways that are killing our planet .
Comparts : The future is here . I &apos;m winning , soles , a new energy network .
Something has been able to be two : Noves investment for places of the babies .
Commove : I &apos;m going to be realists .
Al Gore : A old old old old old old old African says , &quot; If you want to go fast , you go to the way .
If you want to go away , go together . &quot;
We need to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
The year at TED I did a feckle on the LHC .
And I promise to return you to become how the machine works .
So I did . And for those who was not , the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever ever ever been trying to -- 27 miles of circumstence .
His joined to recognize the conditions that were less than a billion-second from the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
All of this is just environment .
This is the machine under Gineveness .
We are photographing these mini-Bang dang inside the respects .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- is 44 meters , and it has a 22 meters .
This is a spectacular image of ATLAS in buildings , so you can see the proportions .
The 10 sector of the last year we have access the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was because of immense failed festegs in the control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first particles that had done all the LHC , and entering in LHC , and it &apos;s a part of the HC , and I &apos;m going to a part of the HC , and particles in the resiliance .
In other words , when we see that image 10 secember , we knew that image , we knew that the machine worked , which is a big vitting .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to make us exultent , when somebody went to Google and he saw that the beginning was this .
What means we have had a cultural impact cultural impact to that scientific .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , just to these phils here -- these dayers .
These phils are 13,000 lampits when the machine works in the most power .
Now , the technical technical of you will look at the phils and will say , &quot; It &apos;s true . &quot; It &apos;s not true . &quot;
And they can do it because when they &apos;re very cold , they &apos;re very cold phils .
So , at less 271 degrees , to a inferior of the space between the stars , these phils can take that running that running .
In one of the players of the novemielest novemiels in LHC , there was a fect of fabrication .
So the phils squeeen slightly , and the 13,000 loves improvising an electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressionant if you think that these magnets weight more than 20 tons , and that are moved of about 30 feet .
They are damaged about 50 magnets .
We had to take them , what we did .
We returned them and traveled them .
And now they &apos;re coming back to their subtition .
By the end of marzo LHC is will be new integrist .
We &apos;re going to happen it , and we expect the data to get to the jugly , and we continue our adventure to discover what the morning is the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these accidents are going to be able to be the dibate on the value of science and engineering . It &apos;s easy to confuture .
I think the fact that the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact of going to beyond limits , I think this is the value of things like LHC .
I &apos;d like to close with the words of a Inglese Inglese , Humphrey Davy , which , imagine , in difesifesa , the spot was Michael Faraday , he said , &quot; Not is so dangerous for the progress of the human mind as the restoration of mind as the rest of the human mind as the science that ideas of science as the ideas of science that our triflowed , and that are not going to be able to be able to be able . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to rethink when , from children , from children , played , you played to be .
While you know how to reach them and make them , and take them and go and go and move them , learned actually and thinking about and resolve problems and sticking space .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , from the information , from the uslity of our interaction with physicists , with my own Patre , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to ask me , &quot; And if we use a computer , I started to ask me , &quot; And if we use a computer , just just like digital polysically , we could have a digital information with the digital information , we could make a desktop with physically walk ,
and we &apos;re going to do it with our placement ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , by buildings , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable , it &apos;s a big computer interactive , like a biscale .
In a few words , a Siftable , it &apos;s a big computer interactive , like a biscale .
You can move them with the hand , they can see , &quot; You can see &quot; between them , &quot; and they have a screen and a radio , and they have a radio .
But above , I &apos;m physical objects , like the morning , you can move just stand up .
The Siftable is an example of a new ecosystem of instruments for the digital information .
And as we get more physical , consciousness of their movement , others , and others become more physical , , consciousness of the other , of how we &apos;re going to explore the other , how we can explore new and fun interaction .
I &apos;m going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configurated to show , if you incline in a direction , the video , the video , it will rote this , if you just cline from the other hand .
These are interactive of the other .
If you go , they &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re interested in .
If they come circumstates , they can be a little bit .
If they come circumstates , they can be a little bit .
They have their movement and inclination .
And then we realize that one of the interesting interesting implications of the interaction was the power to use communals , &quot; to be a color as if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable , as a center of the versor in the central , and I can use them to true color in the central , where they missing .
and I can use them to use them to true color in the central , where they missing .
And if we &apos;re going to do it , we can put a little place .
They are also beautiful possibility of learning , like languages , the math and logic and logic of logic and logic and logic and see the results .
Now I &apos;m --
This is a sequence of Fibonacing I do with a tune of equations .
Here we have a game of words that is half between Spabeo and Bobs .
Procely , to every turn out a letter on every Siften , in any Siftable , Pratically , every turn on every Siftable on every Siftable on , and while he was trying to figure out a diontilate .
Then , after about 30 seconds , they remissing , and you have a new sletters and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
And that &apos;s the children came to the Media Lab , I did it , and I did a video .
They were very placed .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people to the people .
You &apos;ve got to say , &quot; Compons of words , and they know what to do .
Here &apos;s the other people who come to it .
This is our bigger birtest , there on the right .
In fact , it was just to care .
They were just morning , for him .
Now , this is an application of an interactive character .
We wanted to build a tool for learning of languages . He &apos;s got Felix .
It can put up new characters in the scene , sunclear the Siftable them .
It can put up new characters in the scene , sunclear the Siftable them .
So , he &apos;s got the sun .
Video : The sun is : The source is .
David Merrill : Now he brought a treatment in the scene .
Video : The arange tree .
By job !
So school , Siftable and put them near can interact the characters --
Video : Bau !
And by inventing their story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a story with open final open , and he can decide him as it .
DM : It &apos;s a story with open final open , and he can decide him as it .
Video : Volice away , gets .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , realized of recently , to walk and exeguess .
It &apos;s a recently , realized by recently , to sampling and exeguing music .
The Siftable is sounds like base , base and battery .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose what use .
You can also put these sounds in a sequence to comport to your light-acket .
And modify it just touch it , &quot; and a &quot; sequence . &quot;
These are actually you can control from the alive , like the reverse and the filter .
The acks to a particular sound and then clines to go to the way .
And then there are general effects as time and volume , that they &apos;re going to be applicate to the whole sequence .
Let &apos;s look like that .
Video : DM : We &apos;re going to start a base in two Siftable , &quot; sequence , we &apos;re going to put it in a series , we extend to the other base .
Now , I &apos;m going to put a basis .
Video : DM : Now I add of percussions --
Video : And I &apos;m going to put the bacteria , so I can control the bacteria , so I can control the effect of the bacteria .
Video : DM : I can speak the whole sequence , by the way or the other side .
Video : And I &apos;m going to add the lower lower to the basic philter to give more expression .
Video : DM : I can reombing the sequence &quot; to the flight . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to planning it before , but I can try it , make it longer or more correct or more correct .
And now , finally , I can make smoke the whole sequence , inking to the left Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is built new man &apos;s interfaces , and more like our brain and more like our brain and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the results of this lost , and also some possibilities we &apos;re trying to bring out from the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that &apos;s coming to this new generation of projects to interact with digital media , that will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the hour of speaking with all of you .
I &apos;m a written .
Boes books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the fashion of my life .
And I don &apos;t look like that .
But , said , something about this , something particular happened in my life and in my life and in my career , which bring me to the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I &apos;ve recently written this book , this biography called Mangia , Prua , Prua , Am , &quot; which , Am , &quot; which , I think of my precedented books , for some reason , well-light-interational .
And the result is that everywhere where where the welse is going to be like I was condanned .
Daveling -- condanned , condanned !
They are all worry about me and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t fear of fear that we can &apos;t do fear more ?
You don &apos;t have to continue to write all life without power without power , without power to create a book that can important ? &quot;
What can you take somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s rassurant , you know .
But I could go worse , part of that I remember more than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a written .
I &apos;m going to meet the same as based by the same .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t I &apos;m going to have successful ?
Don &apos;t you fear that the humiliation of the refocusing you ?
You don &apos;t have to do this in the whole lives without any lives that nothing came out and die on a spot , and you can die on a sunny saming cumule ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I have all of the things .
I &apos;ve had always been afraid .
And I &apos;ve also been afraid of many other things that people can &apos;t inate .
As the false and other things are spavening .
But , what about what about is about what I thought and I was asking me , and I &apos;m asking me is why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logic that anyone who have been expected by a job that you feel like to do .
But what is this particular in the creative creative to make us nervous about making us nervous health is about the mental health , in a way that other careful ,
How my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don &apos;t remember one once in its 40 years of activity that was asked if he was asked if he had fear ?
There was never -- that block of engineer John , how do you do ?
Don &apos;t that , you know ?
Onestly , the engineers as a group , in the centuries , in the centuries , in the centuries , I &apos;m going to holized manized manished .
We have enough , we have enough this reputation , and not just writers , but creative of all gender , we have this reputation of being enormous instable mentally .
And it &apos;s not the other one that &apos;s connected trists of the magnifies that are only in the last century , just in the last century , they die young people die .
And also the ones that are not suicidated to be really disdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdispleased by their dones .
Norman Mailer , before I died , in the last interview said , &quot; Every book killed me a little bit more . &quot; A extraordinary remarkable to work about their life .
But we don &apos;t bad at the child when we heard these things , because we &apos;ve heard these things that we &apos;ve been interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering the suffering and the suffering , and the art , it &apos;s going to conduce the host .
And the question I want to bring all over here is : are you agree with this idea ?
You know , that &apos;s good -- because I also looked at it from a centimeter , I don &apos;t really well for anything that suppose .
I think it &apos;s odiosa .
And I think it &apos;s also performance and I don &apos;t want to see it in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our big minds to live .
And I know that , in my case -- in my case -- in my situation -- would be very dangerous to be supposed to be supposed to be supposed , above the circumstances in which I &apos;m in my careful .
That &apos;s really -- I &apos;m looking , and I &apos;m rather young , I &apos;ve about 40 years .
I have still about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything I &apos;m going to write in the world , then it &apos;s going to be judged by the world as the work that was going on after the world &apos;s successful .
I &apos;m going to be cut , because we &apos;re all more or less friends here -- it &apos;s likely my biggest successful is to my biggest .
Oh , Gesus , which think .
You know , this is the kind of thinking that that &apos;s a person to start bing gin the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would keep doing this work we do this work we .
So , the question becomes , how do this is ?
And so it looks like , after many reflection , that way to work to keep write is to create a psychological construct , okay ?
I have to find a few way to find a safety of me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxiety of what reaction is going to get to get . And as I was trying to do this year , I started looking through the year , trying to find other societies to see if they could have the better ideas and more under ideas to see if they could have the ideas and more and more under and more under ideas to see if they could have the better ideas and more under ideas . And I &apos;m going to writing the way , and I was looking for all the
how to help people make creative to make people to care emotives of creativity .
And that research me to the ancient Great and ancient Rome .
Seguiting because I play in circle and then go back .
In ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity is from men , OK ?
And it was thinking that creativity was this spirit of divine , and that was to a few sources , and sell , for distant , and swine , for distant reasons and known .
The greatest called these &quot; Dighbors of creativity &quot; demons .
Sowns , wonderful , created to have a demon that led wisdom .
The Romans were the same idea , but they called the spirit that kind of spirit , no body .
That &apos;s great , because Romans did not really think that a genius was someone &apos;s a particularly intelligent .
They would have a genius was this kind of divine that was created literally lived in literally in the walls of a artist , like the Dobby , and that was like Dobby , and that was going to assisted to hidden the work of that artist and model that work .
Here &apos;s what &apos;s been -- that &apos;s the distance of which is the distance of which talking about -- that psychological costruck that protected you from your work .
And everybody knew that was so that worked , right ?
So the antients were protected by certain things , like the narcism , like the narcism , right ?
If your work was exceptional job was not able to take all the market , everybody knew that was helped by this genioral genior .
If your work , if your work , it was not all cold , right ?
Everyone knew that was your genius to be an unable .
And so people han concept creativity in the West for a long time .
And then the Renasing came and all changed , and all changed , and nacque this big idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe , and we &apos;re not leaving to the creatures that they write detail from divinity .
This was the principle of human principle , and people started to think that creativity was completely from the ighborhood .
And for the first time in history , you started to refer to this or the artist as a rather kind of like a person .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big herror .
I think that allow somebody , a simple person to believe that I &apos;m like a recipient , the essence and the source of all mysteries , creative , unknown and feeding , creative , and it &apos;s a very big phild to be a too big phild to the huge fragile humanity .
It &apos;s like to ask somebody to get the sun .
Deape and completely distores the ego and creates all of these expectations on the performance .
And I think it was this pression to have destroying artists in the 500 years .
And , if that &apos;s true , and I think it &apos;s , and I think that &apos;s the question , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe we go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and creative .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can &apos;t sing 500 years of rational thinking about a rational thinking of 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience that sold laitself would have a scientific , income , and you know that following people , and you know that following people , sfairs .
Probably not convinced you all about this .
But the question I want to ask is , why not ?
Why don &apos;t I think about this way ?
Because it &apos;s more sense of anything that I &apos;ve ever heard to explain the explanation of the exasperant process .
A process that , as anyone who ever ever have been trying to do something -- so , basically , everyone here -- it knows , you know , you don &apos;t understand rationally .
And in fact , it can be sometimes seeing completely paranormal .
I did this met recently meeting with the extraordinary poetry to the extraordinary poetry , and it was a poetic for all life and said me that during his childhood in the Virginia , and he was going to feel , in the time , and I felt , in the way , when a poem came from from the landscape .
And he said , I &apos;m like a fragorous train .
And she was coming up to her landscape from the landscape .
He felt it happened to be , because he was going to be under his feet .
He knew to have one thing to do to that point and it was , words , words , &quot; running like a good . &quot;
And so it was going to go home and , he was walking up from this poetry , and it would not have to take a piece of paper and a faster enough , and it &apos;s faster , and it on the page , and he was on the page .
Sometimes , it was not able to be fast enough , so it &apos;s got and running and run and run and the poetry and roled up and the poetry was going to get through and lost and he would continue to rolling through the landscape , trying , like , &quot; one another poetry . &quot;
Then there were the time -- this piece I will never forget to -- there were the moments that was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and , he was trying to paper and the poetry went through , and he was going through , and he was going to go through , and he said , that was like it , and he was going to spend the hand and the stake .
He was going to cut the poem from the tail and he was put in his body and he was page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page and intact , but the last word on the first word .
So when I felt it -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly the same thing to my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conducture !
I &apos;m a moving , and my way to work is ; I &apos;m wake up to the same horarian every day and work and go and go and go and go on and go out .
But even I was in my lest , in my later , I &apos;ve been stripped against that thing , sometimes .
And I imagine that many of you have done .
You know , if the work and ideas were giving me from a certain source , I could not be sure .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relationship to do it , but , rather , rather , but , rather , rather , what do you make healthy ?
And as much of the best contemporary example that I have is the Musician musician musician , which I &apos;ve interviewed in a few years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life has been the incarnation of life has been the incarnation of the artist , trying to control , to tom-construct , ducted these species of towards , totally interested in the entire totally interested in the way .
But then he was invented , and he was driving , and he was driving on a L.A. , changes all over him .
He was going to be fast and all of a sent tract this little basic melodies , which comes into his head like ispiration , elusive and hall-forth , and the lesson , and the purpose , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the desidency , but not knows how to take it .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , it has no matter , it has no matter .
So he starts to feel this species of old old old old old old anxioned , &quot; I &apos;m going to remark , and I &apos;m going to remark up , and I &apos;m going to remark .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t make it . &quot;
And instead of going to the panic , he stopped .
And I &apos;m going to be the whole mental process and did something completely new .
And I &apos;m just going to look at the sky and said , &quot; Scause , I &apos;m not seeing that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Do you know , what can he write a song right now ?
If you really want to be a more than when I can take me care of you going to take care of you .
Although , you go to important something else today .
You know , Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his process worked changed after this .
Not the work , the work was still hoscure as well .
But the process , and the anxiety that was reeded when he was pressed when he was pressed the genius , the genius who was going to sent it , and it &apos;s going to remove it back to where it came from , realizing that had no had to be a interior .
but it was a little bit of this peculiar , a wonderful collaboration a conversation between Tom and this strange thing that was not Tom .
So , I felt like that , I was going to change a little bit , and I was working on and saved me once .
This idea , I was saved when I was writing &quot; Mangia , &quot; and Prua , Ama , and , Ama , and we &apos;re going to be able , and we &apos;re going to be in something and we &apos;re going to think that &apos;s going to be a disaster , which is the worst book , which is the worst book or ever written .
Not just the worst book , right , right ,
And I started thinking about to throw this project .
But then I remember Tom who talked to the air and I tried to the air and I tried to the air and I tried to the air and I tried to the air and I tried to the air and I tried to the air and I tried to the air and I tried to the air and I tried to the air and I tried to the air and I tried to the air and I tried to the air and I tried to get me .
So I went up to my face in the way from the manoscritism and I made my comments to a room .
And I said to a high voices , &quot; Sends , what , we &apos;re going to be short the book will not be crazy , right ?
Because as I see us , I &apos;m going to push all I have , not more than that .
So if you want to be better , you have to tell you and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , I don &apos;t do anything .
I &apos;m going to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to favor that was recorded to me to do my part , &quot; because , at the end of the way , OK -- at the end of the deserts of Africa , the people would sell to the people were saying to the sacross the sacross the hours of the sacred of the sacred , and to the hours to hours .
And they were always magnific , because the balleres were fantastic and they were fantastic .
But every time , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists actually become actually transcendent .
And I know what I know what I know , because I know you &apos;ve all got a point , a performance .
It was like the time , it was the lander , and the balleres through a kind of branches and it was not doing anything , like the 1,000 notes before , it was going to be able .
And I know , suddenly not apparently as a human .
But it happened from the didriver and spot in the divinity .
And when this happened , to the time , the people knew what was , people knew what was , called him .
They were hands and , and they started sing , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , God , Allah , God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curious night , when the Memery was invaded the Spain , they took this habits and the pronounced in the centuries of &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , Allalah , &quot; Oklah , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , A
In Spain , when an artist did something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , broken , okay , Allah , magnificent , etable , etlessly , a God .
And it &apos;s great because we need .
But , the problem comes the day , the balleres , when you wake up and down that are the 11 of Martedests , and it turns out that are the 11 of Martedests and I &apos;m going to go to the watch of God , there &apos;s no longer .
It &apos;s just a dead with a lot of bad to ginocky , and maybe not ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever to get to that .
And maybe no one of the God still , and what does does does with his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most sweeping recognizes to make a creative life .
But maybe not to be so angosciant if you can &apos;t believe , anzyutt , which the most extraordinary expected in your same .
But it just makes you have data in the same way from an unimaginable unimaginable to the squt of your life that you have to go to something else when you &apos;re finished .
And , you know , if we think that this way .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s sure as I thought for different months in the workers in the book that I &apos;m going to try to take , the perangeful , spavently , expected , expected , expected , expected my graphor , existence , so I &apos;ve been doing this .
And what I have to keep me when I hear me , I hear , is not achieving .
Don &apos;t beach . It just your work .
It &apos;s inuates to presented you for your part , any can be .
If your work is balling , balling .
If the wine , absorbed , I assigned to leave some kind of wonderful kind of wonderful , for a moment through your efforts , then &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Although , I did the same dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot;
I think I think , you have to teach it .
&quot; You know , &quot; to you know , just for you have had a human love and test , and test in tape , you know , you &apos;re going to tell you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can meaning and the discovery of new genes of genes .
Now we &apos;re starting a new perspective , we started digitizing biology and now to go from that digital code we &apos;re going to a new biology phase , designing and synthesizing and synthesizing life .
We &apos;ve always been trying to bring big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists I think they &apos;re going to have told to understand various levels .
We tried to make it , reducing it to the minimes .
We &apos;re digitizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to spend from the analogic world &apos;s digital world .
Now , we can regenerate life , or create life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smaller genome of the ones that can self-replicate genome .
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome for creating one more smaller .
We are able to eliminate a hundred genes of the 500 that are here .
But when we &apos;re a look at its metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple respect to our .
Creden me , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this can take to a living .
So we decided that the only way to design was synthesize this croma way to be able to be able to be able to make some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of the &quot; Can we synthesis ? &quot;
Can the chemistry to make these big molecules that we never ever ever ever ever ever make before ?
And , in case , we can make a croma chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a chemical material chemical material .
The speed we are able to digitize life is growing up to exponential .
Our capacity to write the genetic code , rather , rather slowly , but it &apos;s better .
And our most recent retained the landscape on an exponential .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process has requires many past , starting with a bioethical reats before the first experiments .
But we found that DNA DNA is very difficult .
There are deces of thousands of thousands of cars in the world producing little segments of 30 50 letters and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the more than the segment is , the more errors there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments and running the errors .
And this was our first attempt , to talk about digital information from the digital information of the genome of Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills .
We designed the fragments , actually , the repair of the herrors and got a molecule of DNA about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material chemical material , and we &apos;ve been inhert in the bacteria , the bacteria started to read this genetic and producing particles .
The particles are then you stand back to cells , they &apos;re going back and they destrofit .
I talked about recently with the members of the oil industry and they &apos;re saying that they have been taken this model .
They review more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build its same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the bigger things .
We wanted to build the whole battery of the bacterium .
They are more than 580 myths letters of genetic code .
So we thought we build it in the cassette of the virus of the virus , so we can change the casses to understand what the casses are components of a living cell .
The progress is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , they have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standards was a standards for every 10 mile .
We found , 30 errors . We had a 30 errors . If we used that original sequence , we would never be able to do that work .
One part of the process is designing sectity , 50 letters that they are going to be running with all the other segment of 50 letters to build smaller subject that works together .
Let &apos;s try unclear here .
You &apos;ve probably read that we &apos;re going to put it in the grains .
Think about this : we have a genetic genetic code on four letters : A , G and T.
Three of those letters together , about 20 loves , and there &apos;s a specific order of letters of letters .
So we can use genetic code to write words , frasures .
What we did in the beginning was self-doing .
Some of them were deluses from the fact that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
We designed these segment to be able to be able to be able to get them with enzymes .
There are enzymes that they repect them .
And we started to assemble of the parts , starting with the seven to seven letters , and it together together in a segment of 24 myself spoke to them to be 24 myself to get to 72 myth to come to 7,000 letters .
Every step , we made these segment in abundance , so we can set them sit to sequencing that we &apos;re trying to create a very robustot processes -- as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems to be a basket of a bad play-basket .
When we get to these very long segment , more than 100 midle , more than 100 middle , they will grow more directly in E.
It comes to the limit of modern molecular biology tools .
So we &apos;ve seen other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called a homology , which is in biology , which is using to be able to repair DNA able to get the segment .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinocus , called Deinocus three million rad rad .
You can see in the spret of the superior as his chromosome is destroying .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s been like it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be completely .
They can live under the vacuum .
They &apos;re absolutely sure that life in space , and you can find new environment of water .
Actually , NASA showed that this happens .
This is an image of molecule we &apos;ve built these processes , just using the latest with the design appropriate segment to inserve .
The lievening them assembly .
This image was not taken with an electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a very big molecule we can see it with a microscope .
These are photograph that they cover a six seconds .
This is the published we &apos;ve done a little time ago .
They are more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the biggest molecule of a definitely definitely created by man .
It &apos;s a weight molecular spring to 300 million .
If we stop it with a 10 pounds , they would like 10 , we would like 142 pages just to transcare this .
Now , how do we work ?
Obviously , you can see a virus is a game from girls .
It &apos;s a little more complicated when you use the bacteria .
It &apos;s simplest when it &apos;s cells as well as it is cells as our eucleo , you can just extract the nucleo and inseriously , which is practically the clonto the clonto .
In the bacterium , the cromosome is integrated inside the cell , but we &apos;ve recently demonstrated we &apos;re able to make a complete trape of a cell to one another and a cell to another and to another and to another and to another and to another and to another and activate it .
We got a cromosome chemosome from a microbial species .
The two are different than men from topes .
We &apos;ve added some genes in a few genes more to decide what to chromosome for this croma .
And then the slighting with the encies so that we kill all proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was studied -- and you opened our soopening soopen -- the new croma -- the new croma has gone into the cell .
And we were thinking we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried anyway , we tried to spin there .
This is one of the most mechanisms of evolution .
We found that many many species have added a second or a third or a third chromosome from some part , adding in a second thousands of new himself .
So who think about evolution as a gene just as a gene modific has no understood of biology .
There are enzymes called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The entertained .
The croma that was in the cell of the cell .
The cell phone that we have inserito-cell phone that we have inserito---
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other croma like extraneous material , and we got it , and we &apos;ve only got the cell and the new chromosome .
it became blue because of the genes we &apos;ve inserious .
And in a short lass of time , all the characteristics of a species have been lost , and it turned around the new species , based on the new software we in the cell .
All the protein are changed , the membranes have changed , and when we read the genetic code that is exactly what we &apos;ve transfer .
Now , this may seem genetics , but by altering the software , we can change the software .
Now , I &apos;ve got explained that here is not talking about genese -- but we progress to talk about three million years and a half years of evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion in which will be created by the Cambrian &apos;s going to be created .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s enough when we think of our need .
We &apos;re going to spend six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Gust to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now , there are three people on the planet for each of each other in 1946 , there are four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find fresh fresh fresh , medicinals and clean , medicinals and a half a half of people .
It &apos;s still going to be more dare doing it for nine billion .
Let &apos;s use more of five billion pounds , more than 30 billion pounds of oil .
That means a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replaces , it &apos;s a huge challenge .
In the way we have to hold all of CO2 from these materials that ends up in the atmosphere .
In the day , I &apos;m going to discoveries in the scientific discoveries all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they are the design components for the future .
The electronics is just a dozen about components , and you think about how many different things came .
Our limits here are maybe data from biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , because of these synthetization , we can create what we call combinatory genomics .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can make a big robot that can make a million cump a day .
Think about these 20 million genes of different genes or to try to get to optimize the processes to make the processes to make the processes , we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology , and create more biology , and we create more biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standards .
We can choose for the possibility of survival , production or carburaning , chemistry and carbons .
This is an instantly of some software program that we &apos;re working for being able to be able to sit and design species on the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how they are necessarily .
We know exactly what they are their genetic code .
Now we &apos;re focusing on the carbons of how quarter generation .
You &apos;ve seen that you extract ethanol from the grain was a bad experiment .
We have carbons of second and third generation that will use enough from the birth of the higher value as the open-value , like the eight-different kinds of butanol .
But the only way biology can be a big impact without increasing most to increase the cost of food and limitarine the cost of food and limiting the CO2 in the first way we &apos;re working to design that can be transforming CO2 in the first carbon , and we think of the first carbons of the head of the fourth generation in about 18 months .
The light light light light bined with CO2 is a metodom -- but in our discoveries in the world , we found different metodds .
This is an organism we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , about 2500 feet of depth of the house of the water .
They &apos;re going to put from CO2 using hydrogen molecular as the source of energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can put the CO2 , if we can put the CO2 , which can be transported through the touts , converting that CO2 in carbons , to drive this process .
So we think we can be able to be able to increase what the base question of , &quot; which is the life is Not , &quot; which is life , &quot; We have the goal modest , we have the goal modest of replacing the oil industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can you do that ?
It would be a main the way of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working for using metods to use the same methods to create vaccines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with the influence , we &apos;re always back to a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s right .
I think that this can change building vaccines in anticipate vaccines .
That &apos;s how the future might be starting to change , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating the evolution with synthetic bacteria , and I was , archaaaatheists .
We are at so much from better .
Our goal is to make a long enough to live long enough to try to try to make it . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the most quickly possible , some fundamental work , in the new technology that we &apos;ve taken to a very much one year ago . This is Seady guys .
It &apos;s about an environment where you can interact is to the local level that remote with an enormous amount of visual data .
And we &apos;re seeing that digital playgabytes of digital photographs with a kind of expensive , and I keep the images as we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big the amount of information we see , how big these column of data or images .
Most of digital photographs , but this is a scanning , but this is a scanning of the Congress , and it &apos;s reentrepreneurs in the gama of 300 megapieling .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that limits the presents of a system like this is the number of a system like this is the number of the best thing . It &apos;s also an execsible architecture .
This is a whole book , you know , data doesn &apos;t images .
This is Casa desolate of Dickens . Every column . Every column .
And to show you that it &apos;s about exactly , and not images , we can do something like this , to see that &apos;s really about a real representation of the head , not a photograph .
It could be a little artificial way to read a book to read a book .
I don &apos;t have to be advice .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s about a Guardian .
Each of the big image is the beginning of a seeding .
And it really gives you the pleasure and beauty to read the version of a near version of a newspaper , which is for nature , which is for nature a lot of medium .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of this particular number of the Guardian .
We made a fashion published to be solutions -- much higher than that uses in a published normal -- and we &apos;ve inserious -- we &apos;ve insert you to the extra extra extra .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see it .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that this means to the pop-up and other porcheries , and other systems , they should not be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not going to lose time , if we don &apos;t say that we have contributed to give this camp .
These are all the streets in the USA overrappositial image of NASA .
So , we go to something else .
This is actually from the web , and you can go to the web .
It &apos;s about a project called Photosynth , which combines two different technologies .
A is Seady guy , and the other is a very interesting computer searching in Noah Snavelely , a student of the University of Washington , with the Steve Seitz and Rick Seady of Microsoft Rick Seliski and Rick Seliski . It &apos;s a very collaboration .
And it &apos;s from the Web , the Seady guy from Seadragon .
You can see that when we do this kind of screen , where we can spend a picture to the other and have this kind of experience to the other and have this kind of experience .
But the space of images here has actually a meaning of the images here has actually a meaning .
The size of the computer visualization of the computer have recorded these images together , so that they correspond to the real places that the imaging -- all the near of the laghi Grasses on the Montanagne Roccial Montne Roccial Montne Roccial , you know , you see the elements of a slide , and these things are all the space .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more space .
I want to spend one of the original data set of Noahes -- and this from a Photosynth prototype of Photosynth , we &apos;ve done the first time for the first time , the last time , the last time , the Sap of what I think is really the key behind this technology , the technology , the technology , the Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily as an environments that we &apos;ve put in the website .
We had to worry about the legal expects and so on .
This is a rebuild-up rebuildings of Nothththree-Dunger images from Flickr . Bastake , and you get images of types in magic , and you get images of types in magic , others and so on . Each of these argument , and you get out of this model .
So I &apos;m all images from Flickr and they &apos;ve been all been connected to the space .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this way .
You know , I &apos;d ever thought I &apos;d ever thought of finished to work for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratificant to this kind of account here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s about a lot of different kinds of foods of fotaming : from those of the cellular phone to the size that the professional sionally , put together in this environment .
And if I can , try and look for the strange .
Most are blocked by faces , etc .
Somewhere there is a few photographs -- etches .
This is a Noththththree-Dunder recorrectly .
We can spend from the way to the view of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is taking data from the entire memory of how the land , the collective point of view , and the point of visual point of visual -- and those data together .
All of those photograph become linked , greater than the parts .
You have a whole model of the land that emerge .
Think about this as a prolent of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as well as people use it , and the people use , and the advantages for the who are using .
Their pictures are marked with other people .
If someone comes to the idea of contrass all these several several several , my photograph of Nothththreat of Nothththreat , and I can use as a point of all those data , and I can use the way to use of the other people , using the photograph of anyone else , and I can use the photograph of anyone else , and have a social experience of the ceiling .
Of course , a consequence of all that are extremely elaborate , extremely elaborate , every interesting part of the Earth , and from the satellite images and satellite and images and satellite and images , but from memory memory .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I did that what your software is going to be going to be going to be going to be a point , in the next few years , all the photographs shared by everywhere in the world are going to be going to be reading together ?
BA : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is what &apos;s doing is to find .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And he &apos;s doing it in the basic content of the images .
And what &apos;s really interesting is if you think about the wealth of the set of simantic information that many of these images .
As when you do a research of images on the web , you get a sentence and the web on the web , it &apos;s about the picture of the picture .
Now , what happens if that photograph is that pictures ?
So the amount of the amount of the set of interconnection and the quantity of wealth that &apos;s really huge . It &apos;s a classical effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible . Computers .
BA : I thank you very much .
One of the main pleasant when you travels and one of the ethography research is the power to live between who has not forgotten the way , the people who have the past in the wind , the past in the wind , the spring in the flows .
Basts thinking that the Jaguar Jaguar traveling beyond the Via Lattea , or that the Inuit are still connected , or that in Himalaya , the budddged the respire Dharm , remember the central important central important , and that the world in which we live in the world in which we live in the world in which we live in the world in which we live in the living , but it &apos;s just a reality , is just a reality , but it &apos;s just a realm ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stirs did , well or a bad , well , or a mal stirs ago .
And of course , we all share of essential .
All we do . We all procreating .
We are subjects in the beginning of beginning .
We need to stand to death the death of death , so it doesn &apos;t surprising us if we we stop and ballie --
We all have a art .
What hit is the particular is the particular rate of canone , the rise of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that they are the Penan forests of Borneo , or the following of Haiti , or the Haiti , or the Kairs , or the Kairs , the Candle of Ande , or a camelat in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my journey in the desert of a month ago , or a messer of yak in the value of the world &apos;s Everest , in the world &apos;s valuable .
All of these populations teach us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And , if you reflect a second , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
Insit , the cultures of the world are creating a girl of spiritual life and cultural life that is the planet , and it &apos;s important for the planet as the planet as as well as as the biological biological girl .
And you can think about this girl as a cultural girl , and you can define the ethnosphere , and you can define the eths , dreams , under , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , in the human imagination from the consciousness .
The ethnosphere is the fantastic patrimonium .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how inquisitive .
And because the biosphere was graveful consumed etheless , and it was unfortunately , and it &apos;s very quickly .
Not biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species was on the extinct of the extinct of the extinct , or in the most apocalytic diversity -- in the more opening field , and you don &apos;t have near even have near even even near hypothesis , in the most optimistic hypothesis .
The initize of all that is , of course , the language loss .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just a voice , it &apos;s a voabolarian or from a gramp of rules .
A language is the bake of human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle with the animal of every culture is going to be in the material world .
Each language is a forest of mind , a book , a purpose , an ecosystem of spiritual possibility .
And of the 6,000 languages , as we are here in Monterey , at least half the way , it &apos;s not sussurrounds in the ears of children .
They don &apos;t come out of the children , which means , not wonder that the people don &apos;t walk , which is already dead .
What is there is more sitting from the spot , from the silence , to be the last to talk to a language , not have a way to transmit the wisdom of the bag ?
This is a fairing was somewhere somewhere in the world &apos;s two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks , and it brings and it with it in the tomb .
And I know somebody who &apos;s going to say , &quot; Is it &apos;s not that ?
The world would not be a better place if we parlash , everybody &apos;s the same language ? &quot; Benish , so we &apos;re all talking about yoruba .
Let &apos;s talk about kogi .
You &apos;re going to try a tract thing to say , not to talk about language .
I &apos;d like to do a journey through the ethnosphere --
a little traveling journey to give you a little bit of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , &quot; different ways of existing , &quot; I really mean different ways of exists .
We take for example , this baby Barasana , in Amazon , Amazon , the population of anaconda , which creates the myths of the latte of the latt of the sacred of the sacred sacred sacred .
It &apos;s about a population that &apos;s not able to distinguished the blue color , because the blue color is identified in the forest , which depends the population .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial , degree , &quot; language , &quot; Linguistic , &quot; Listic , &quot; Look , &quot; you have to sent a different language .
And this is that has been roced in the mythological past , particularly the particularity is that in these country , in the country in the country , no languages a non-linguishment .
They &apos;re limited to listening and then start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived , the Waorani Waorani of Eastern Eastern order , an incredible population that has the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 five means have been trying to be a committing connected .
They &apos;ve done from the photographs that they reach them in poses that reening them in poses that this population of places that this population forest had never seen anything in the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the sional forest pl
They hit the picture from the land , they turn them to the research of a shape or a figure , they have conclosed that they were the flowing , and they killed the favorable .
But Waorans don &apos;t just kill the straniests .
They kill them .
For 54 percent of mortality was caused to them .
We &apos;ve been up to eight generations and we found two natural cases of natural death , and when we insisted to know , they &apos;ve seen that one of them was invected , and then they knew it . And then they knew it .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps and recognizes .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned a really interesting job when my Harvard professor asked me , if I wanted to go to Haiti to intrue me to intrue me to intrue the base of the power of the power of Duvalier and Tonton Mackish , and I imposed me to use the art to use the art zome to use the arbie zome zome zombie to use to the fast site to the site zome .
To give a sense to miracular , I should have to understand the Voodoun culture and that the Voodoo is not magnera .
It &apos;s rather than a complex medical vision of the world .
Many interesting interesting .
If I asked you tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left , and thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has no religious fefeelings . And in the Voodoo is not the distilled of these religious concepts of these very profound religious concepts of these very profound religious tragic tragic concepts .
What makes interesting interesting is the vooo is the intense report of life and death .
So the way the view are going to be .
The spirits can be invoded by Great Acqua , they respond to the rise of the dance and replace temporary to the soul of the vive in a way that for a short .
So , the voodoohisti love to say , &quot; You go to ask God .
We give in the temple and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re posset , is the spirit you , as you can do the bad of the bad ?
So , you &apos;re going to these incredible events : following voot in the state of trance that touches touched a rather straight demonstration rather than the body &apos;s mind on the body when it &apos;s catalyzed in a state of extremely exciting exciting .
I &apos;m all the people with the most extraordinary people I lived the most extraordinary are the Kogi in Sierra Nevada Devada , in Colombia .
Dilization of ancivilization that once they lived on the carairs of Colombia , the population of the conquist , the population was about the massicrock that &apos;s herself on the massicult of carbon planning .
In a druged continent , this population never been conquered by the spagners .
And so , I &apos;m government today , but their formation is really extraordinary .
The young people are brought away from the families to three or four years , and they live in a good world , and they live in a good world , and they &apos;re sitting in the ice for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years , in the nine years of the gestation of gestation that transcorrate in the user of the mother , now are metaphorically in the uterly of the Great Mther .
So , this time , they are acculate to values of their society , values that they predict their prayers and just their prayers , they keep the balance balance .
At term of this incredible initiation , they &apos;re improvisive , and for the first time in their own , at 18 years , they see an alba . And in that actim of the first basic bad , when the sun basic bad , when the sun basic bad is going to conferm it all the things that have learned in theorem , and it says , &quot; The preventing a steady behind a behind and says , &quot; The precient one steal and says , &quot; The next step ,
&quot; I &apos;m going to be ? Proprium as I said .
It &apos;s study . Now , it &apos;s going to protect it . &quot;
They are called the greater frree brothers and say that we , brothers , we are the holds of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about Indigenes and environment , we invox Rousu and the old history of the old history of the old non-running concept in its simplicity or maybe we invoasted to the Earth of us .
The Indigenes are not not indebolites from nostalgap .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the disease in the disease in the gelids of the Tibet , but because of the time , and they made a mystical mestic of the Earth &apos;s not about the concept of the Earth can only be consciously consciously , but on an intuition that the Earth can only live because it &apos;s infected from human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
He mean , a little girl of Ande who grows in the mountain is a Prito is a spirit of the Apu &apos;s a spirit to be a deply different human being depppped and it &apos;s going to have a different mountain that place , and it &apos;s going to have a mountain a Montana who grow is a mountain in a Montana , which is a mountain .
That &apos;s the dimpot of a spirit or a mineral ceased or a mineral ceased .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that &apos;s interesting is that defines the relationship between individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia creating Britannical Columbia creating forest .
And that made me a different human being from my friends from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the Hukuk dimpowered Hukuk and the paradimmet , and the paradise of the paradisong , and the cannery that are going to the Hamats-day .
If you start to consider that these cultures can actually actually actually make different reality , you can start to understand some of them discoveries .
I &apos;ve taken this picture to open in the West North Amazon .
Mayahuge some of you have heard about the Eayahuge psychoactive of the repertorium repertorium .
What makes the fascinating ayahuge is not the drug potential of the pharmacological potential , but his elements . It &apos;s composed to two elements .
From a side , this lian layer , this lian layer of a headquarters , harmed and harmed , sleep , sleep , sleep .
And it turns out the plant , you have a blueasy that alters a little bit of the consciousness , but it &apos;s smisceled with the leaves of the family of the coffee .
This piece of triptams , very similar to the serotonin , very similar to the serotonin five , methoxyltryltryltryltry-methodd .
If you ever see Yanomami tyrow up to the suspicity that they make from a different species of species , which is methoxyltryltryltryltryltrydimethods .
Tirling that pollution on the nose is a little bit like being disappeared by a bad field of pines and bacteria on a set of electricity . Rison &apos;t believe a distorsion of reality .
I was often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who had been the psychedelical , with his discovery of the workers of the swalking decade in the &apos; 30 in Mexico .
I think of my text , you can &apos;t classified these triptames like sallucinogens because if you &apos;re done , you can &apos;t tell anyone of being .
It &apos;s possible to be absolutely only if you make some other chemicals that denaturing the MAO .
Now , the beautiful : the carboline , the charcoal are inhibitors of MAO , the same kind of needs to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able . The expected question : in a 80,000 species of plants , like these are , but that if you are the same thing , creating a biochemical , which is the such of the same thing that is the superior of the parts ?
We use the big euphemism of the experienced and error , which can reveal .
But if we ask the Indians , they will tell us &quot; . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribes , Cofan , has 17 variety of Euash , which distinguished in the forest , and that our eyes would reentring in the same species .
If we ask them how they staff their tasonomy will tell us &quot; I thought , &quot; I thought I &apos;d realize it ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : they take 17 variety in a night of llots and each one will song with a different song .
With this is not lauret to Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting to contact the stami .
Now , &#91; &#91; ophistory &#93; the problem is that also the ones of us are the people are points , the people are points , but somehow reducts to the history of the history of our world &apos;s history , and it &apos;s pass .
In fact , the century , between 300 years , not will be remember for its wars , and it &apos;s technological innovations , but rather as the one where we stopped and we have been active and we were active or passively , or passively the mass of diverseveral diversity and cultural of the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All cultures through the centuries are involved in a new possibility of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians have no stuck to be Sioux when they put from the areas , and they fast as Americans have no stopped to be Americans when they put from horse and ceeled .
It &apos;s not the change or the technology that are integrity of etheless . It &apos;s the power .
The wall of the domination .
And if you look at a world , you discover that these are not cultures are destined to be able to disappear .
They are living and dynamics out of the hydes out of hyentifiable forces that go beyond their capacity of their adaptation .
And the way , it &apos;s disbosing in the patries in the patries of the Penan --
a population of Sarawak , in Sarawak , a population , a population that has lived in the forest to a generation , and now reduced to a generation and the next region the region of the region the region of the rivers of the way to bring away the way to the Bornear Corrowed Morawak Cinese Mornear Cinese Morest , where the Japanese , where the Japanison , the horizonest , the horizons , and the way the the the Japan .
It &apos;s requires to reach stives with the sottract .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that are the disease that are coming out with the gold .
If we move on the mountains of the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the volt of political domination .
As the genocide , the physics of an extinction , is condanted in the universal level , but the ethnium of life is not just condantly , it &apos;s not only condanced , but it &apos;s also not only condannect , because it &apos;s a part of the development .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of the Tibet , until you go from the beginning .
I know 6,000 miles from Chengaged in China in West China in West China , through the West , coming to Lhasa with young colleague , but just came to Lhasa , I &apos;ve got been able to Lhasa I &apos;ve got to know what we &apos;re talking about .
6,000 mountain sacred , sacred up and cening .
1.2 million people from the military military in Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was absolutely ascrited to Panchen Lama .
That means that it means that was killed to the time in the Chinese invasion .
His uncle with Santity in Santity in Santity in Santity in Nepal .
His mother was imprisoned and his colan was recipes .
It was taken to hidden the age of two years , hidden under his gonna because he wouldn &apos;t have living without him .
The sister , which made the same , was put in the reeducation camp .
A day , he has been calculated a Mao office , and for this transgression , and for this transgression , was put forced in seven years .
The pain of the Tibet can be insatisor , but the record of the population is from tener .
And the end , it &apos;s all of the way to a choice .
We want to live in the world world world &apos;s world &apos;s the mocrops or we want to take the policromatically ?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead , before we die said that his biggest fear was that , in our light-a-world , we &apos;re not just seeing the whole gamma of the world &apos;s instrucation is a modality of the human imagination is that we &apos;re going to see from a landscape , but one day we &apos;re able to see us .
And it &apos;s humiliant to our species is that our species is existing for 60,000 years .
The Revolution , which has given us the agriculture , which made us to be able to the cult of the see , and replacing the poetry of the skiing , by the skiing of the skiing , and we &apos;re talking about 10,000 years ago .
The industrialized world &apos;s in the industrialized world &apos;s about 300 years .
That squeeered me , I &apos;m not suggested to me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we &apos;re going to be .
When these myriades of the world is asked what it is to say to be human , they respond to be human , they respond to to be human voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all rescire the possibility of being what we are : a consciousness , which has to be what we are , and all the people can fire . And there are great moments .
I went to this picture on the north of Baffin , when I went to the bunch of Baffin , when I went to the broke , and this man , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , I was telling me the story of his nonno .
The canadvice was not always gentile with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to stabilie our own spring , we &apos;ve got them in colonies .
The non-man of this man was going to stand .
The family , tempting for his life , he brought to the throw , and all of his tools .
You have to know that Inuit is not the cold , they &apos;re going to know .
The paces of slites in origin was made of fish skin bag .
The non-men doesn &apos;t have to sure from the arctic note arctic note , or the blizard that was suffing .
It &apos;s been broken away , it &apos;s copped the balloons in the foces of focus . When I did the feckles are congeled , they &apos;re working on a lama .
He was spoke up on the points of this clue , and when it was solid , and when it came up , he killed a dog .
He had schools and created a brilliant , with the actual casses , and he &apos;s made a slaughter , he &apos;s got a slated , and it &apos;s slide on the banchisa , and it &apos;s slide on the banchisa , and it &apos;s slide .
We want to talk about cavarening with nothing ?
In the 1999 , the canadvice of the canadver has reduced to the Inuit &apos;s the bigger of California and Texas , and Texmessed together .
It &apos;s their new patries . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a wonderful territory . They contructs .
One of example , one example of how a nation-state nation-state , he can recognize with his population .
And , finally , I think it &apos;s rather obvious , and I think it was in these areas of the planet , make it remote of the planet , make it remote .
For somebody &apos;s home .
They know , the sections of human imagination that are rising to the other times . And for us , the dreams of these children , like dreams of our children , become part of the swim , they become part of the hope .
For finally , we are National Geographic is that political will never get anything to anything .
We believe that polemies --
&#91; Applauses &#93; are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month , our sit size recognizes . Every month , our sit size 35 million living .
156 countries our television , we transmitted our television .
Our revists are several miles from millions of people .
Our work is to travel in ethnosphere to bring our public in the way , and the beautiful cultural places from what they saw and hope , hopefully , hopefully , they will hope to get a central reveal of anthroughout of anthroughout of the world , and we need to find a style lifestyle and multical world , and we need to find a style lifestyle and met myticultural revealong the
where the wisdom of all the people can contribute to our collective benefits .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote about this book that I &apos;m going to talk about the other you &apos;ve heard and I &apos;m going to try to available some colleague , not note .
I &apos;d like to start with what I call &quot; the official official . &quot;
The official dogm of what ?
The official dogm of all the Western industrial society . The dogm is the official official , &quot; If we want to move the benefits of our citizens &quot; The way to do it is to be to massive the individual freedom . &quot;
The reason , from a side , in the fact that freedom is in the fact that freedom is very much , essential , essential for humans .
The other is in fact that if we are free , each of us can be able to do all that that massive , our benefit , no one that &apos;s our benefit , no one that decide in our name .
The way to massive freedom is to be to be caught .
More people have , more , the people are libers , and greater is their liberty , greater is their liberty , greater is their well-being .
This is , I think , it &apos;s so deeply radically radically , no one dream of the way to put it in the society .
And it &apos;s also deeply radically radical in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m going to allow the simple conditions for insalt .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without contact the 10 variety of oil , and 12 acetes and 12 acets acets that you can buy to be a huge number of conditions in the research circumstance that nobody &apos;s 175 is of your degrees .
This is the supermarket .
Then go to the electronic to buy a stereo , CD , Be , CD , Let CD , Let &apos;s record , radio , radio , radio , radio ,
And in this single negotial store , there &apos;s a big number of audio , there &apos;s a big number components .
We can make six and a half million different half of combinations using the components that there are in a store .
You have to admit that there &apos;s a lot of choice .
Although the fields : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all the services , you could get all the serve phone , the basic services , and they were forniture from the Bell .
He was born the phone , it was not compressed it .
A consequence of that , in the other , was that telephone was never requires .
These times , they went .
Now , we have a variety almost the illimited phones , especially between cellular .
Here &apos;s cellular cellular cellphone .
My favorite is the middle in the MP3 , MP3 , tape , and forts for the cram crather for the cram cram .
If you don &apos;t have seen it in the store under the house , you &apos;re looking at the time , you &apos;re going to take it .
And what &apos;s the end of the end is that people are in the staff and does this question . And you know what the answer is , &quot; No .
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t make too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the aqueered , you actually grew the same explosion of choices .
Asanitarian health : not happens in the United States , you go from the doctor and the doctor , what you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we can do it , or B , &quot; At these benefits , &quot; BB &apos;s these benefits . &quot; BB has these benefits . &quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Dr. &quot; What should I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A has these benefits and these risks , and the risks , and these benefits . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebats , &quot; Dr. &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result of it , we call it &quot; autonomy of the disease , &quot; expression that makes it look like that .
But actually , it &apos;s not that one spot the weight and the responsibility to someone who knows something , which is the doctor , someone else that doesn &apos;t know -- and it &apos;s not about -- and so it &apos;s not in the condition to make the real patient to make real decisions .
There &apos;s a huge marketing products , directly , people like me and you , if you think about it doesn &apos;t have any sense , because we don &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why do they published them ?
The answer is they want to be that we call the doctor to ask , we call the doctor to change .
Something like this fundamental identity is our hythical identity , as you see in this jet , &quot; we don &apos;t want to forced children . They &apos;re going to chear children . They &apos;re going to get the right time . &quot;
And we can reinvent a few times us .
That means that every morning , in the spot , you have to decide that kind of person want to be .
I &apos;m standing to the family and matriage , a time the common , spoke , almost anyone , it was that there was that there was the most possible possible , and it was that they started to make the most possible possible .
The only choice was with who , and not even when , and not even , and not even what to do after .
And so , it &apos;s really to play .
I teach in very smart students , and I do do the 20 percent in less than a time .
And it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less brilliant , because they &apos;re not unless diligent .
but why are I impensierites , I mean , &quot; I &apos;m going to spose me , &quot; I would like to do that right now ? &quot;
&quot; I should be able to move more ? I have to think before the children or career ? &quot;
They are logoranants .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this implement doesn &apos;t completing companies that you &apos;re wasking and not get a beautiful vote to my exercise .
And they have to do that . They have important questions .
Now , the job : we are lucky , as Carl was , because the technology allows us to work every day , every day , from Hotel Randolph , every day , from Hotel Randolph .
And I &apos;m talking about , there &apos;s a angolin , and I &apos;m not going to tell anyone , where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use me .
What does this mean , this incredible freedom of choice we have about the work ? It &apos;s that we have to do the work , and we have to work or not .
We can go to our son , we can play , with the cell phone in a tank , Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , and the notebook , on the ginockynamed .
And if they &apos;re all spending , every minute we see our son , we &apos;re going to see the partner , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; I have to say , &quot; I have to answer this ? &quot;
&quot; I have I answered to this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is no , &quot; that makes the experience of the partite of your childhood from what would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of all , we look , little and big materials and big materials , and life , life is a choices , life is a choices .
Once the world was this : Over , there were some possibilities , but not all of the choice .
The world today is this : The dilemma is , &quot; Is it &apos;s a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Short .
So , we know , we know , we all know , I &apos;m going to talk about that negative .
And this choice is two effects of two negative effects on people .
The first , paradoxally , is that produces paralysis that liberation .
And many of the options that choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I &apos;m offing a meaning example : one study conduct on the plans of volunteer .
A colleagues had access to the data of Vantuent , the gigantic society of the sources , with about a million climents in 2000 different companies .
What she found out of the one of 10 solutions that are offered in the more , the percentage of adesion comes from two percent .
With 50 sources , there &apos;s 10 percent of offering , in less than five when I &apos;m are available only five . Why ?
Because with 50 sources of the source , it &apos;s diem , it &apos;s disease , and the choice comes to the indomorate .
And domories , and again , domorange , domorange , domorances , of course , domorange , and of course , domorange , domored , and of course , domorders , domored , domorances , domorances , domored , and of course , domored , and of course , domored , and of course , domored , of course , dom
You know , that doesn &apos;t mean that these workers are going to eat for cancer because they don &apos;t have enough money , it also want to say that the decision is so obstic that decision is so obstic that they also lose the loss of the labels of work .
Not teaching , they &apos;re losing to five dollars from work , which would be willing to be going to be going to be .
So the paralysis is a consequence of having too much .
And I think that &apos;s makes the world .
&quot; And finally , for the eternity : ketchup , feelape or maionese ? &quot;
Would you like to take the just decision , if it &apos;s for eternity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the background , and nepure the wrong conditions .
So this is the first effect . The second is that if we can avoid the paralysis , and we &apos;re less satisfacts from the result of how we would be with less options .
And that &apos;s why for different reasons .
One of these is that with many of these is that you would choose , if you buy choose , and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would be better . And that &apos;s what happens is that the alternative imagined us , and it &apos;s repipieces the squeet , and the repipieces of the choice , and the repieces the squeet , and the repieces of the squeet , and it &apos;s repear ,
even when it was a good decision .
More choices there are , more easy than anything that is insodenting of any detail that &apos;s insosure .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call cost .
Dan Gilbert has asleft very well practices like the value we &apos;re going to depend on what we are .
In the rest , when there are many options , it &apos;s easy to represent the alternative characteristics , and be less satisfacts less than the option of options that you have choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m sure with all that I &apos;m not in New York .
But that &apos;s what you probably think .
There &apos;s this copy to Hamptons .
A place of lussize .
It &apos;s splendida . Ottype . It &apos;s all of them .
It doesn &apos;t miss anything . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , maledition , is Agost . &quot;
&quot; All my nearly nearly in Manhattan are away . &quot;
&quot; I could talk about home . &quot;
And it &apos;s two weeks , asking the idea that &apos;s losing -- every day -- the possibility of talking about where it wants .
The cost opportunity is the soon is the satisfaction for what we have , even when the choice was except .
And the more are the options we have to consider , the more active characteristics , we will return out as a constitute .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
We talk about the living time , and maybe the living slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you choice , you know , you cheaper , you know , you don &apos;t do the other .
The things we don &apos;t choose have a lot of attractive that can make less attractive what we do .
Tirst point : spiral growth of expectations .
I tried it on my skin , I bought a new jeans .
I &apos;m going to almost always jeans .
Once jeans were a kind of guy , I bought them and bought to the best , they were scomfortable , just after they took a life and workers , they were wasking a lot of times , they started to go well .
So I went to buy a couple of them , when that old the old ones , and I said , &quot; I &apos;m sure a couple jeans , and I said , &quot; I need a couple jeans . &quot;
And the committed me , &quot; Who wants slim , fit , relaxphit , relaxed ? &quot;
He wants to the cerniera or with the sonewashed ? &quot; Stonewashed &quot; or &quot; acidwashed &quot; ?
&quot; Who wants ? &quot;
&quot; Sow the basic , or street ? Bs bla bla -- &quot; Continured to elencing .
I was balordie , and after a little bit I was able to say , &quot; I want the guy that was the only guy , &quot; I didn &apos;t have idea what was , so I was going to be in the diejeans , then I went out of the best , I was going to use my best jeans , I &apos;m going to use my best jeans I &apos;ve ever had .
It was the very big . With all that I had got the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand it .
The reason I was worse for worse is that with all that choice , the jeans had to be high , jeans had to be perfect .
I had expected minime . I didn &apos;t expect me anything about it when there was only a kind of thing , but when there &apos;s 100 different , but when it &apos;s visual , at least a kind of must be perfect .
What I was burst , but not perfect .
After I had talked to the choose to what I was slighted in the expectations .
The advice of options in life , people don &apos;t make expectations that these have respect to the ectable of options .
And this will produce less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the marketing world if I realize it .
Because if they knew it , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more like this .
&quot; It was better when it was worse , &quot; The reason was better when it was worse better when it was worse , it was that when it was worse , it was even able to meet the surprised .
Egyday , in the world we live -- opulent , industrialized citizens with the perfection , the most of the most of the most of the things are to the height of the height .
You never have been surprised places because your expectations , my expectations , they &apos;re ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Basse expectations , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , &quot; Basse , &quot; You want to do it . &quot;
I mean , little time , the room , I &apos;m really moving , and I &apos;m really moved and my wife is really stupend .
I couldn &apos;t have to do better , I didn &apos;t have to be able .
But it &apos;s not always good .
And finally , a consequence of buying a couple of jeans scomfortable when there &apos;s just that jeans are that when you &apos;re not satisfacts , and you say , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot; , the answer is clear .
The world is the responsible . What could I do do you do ?
When there are hundred types of jeans , and you buy a little bit of you , and you ask , and you ask who is the responsible , it &apos;s otherwise that you are .
You could have better .
With hundreds of variety , there are no screen , there are no screen for the insuccess .
So when people are decisions , they &apos;re going to be the result is valid , they &apos;re feeling insodented and they give them the color .
In the last few years , the depression is exploss in the industrialized world .
I think a meaning that a meaning -- not the only one , but the only one -- this wave of depression is that people have experiences of the standards because standards are too high-high .
And when they have to explain this situation thought that the color is they think they are .
So the final result is that in general , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogm , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely fake . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than it happened , but it doesn &apos;t make it that much better than it &apos;s better than a bit .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve been sure from a piece of the level where the choices are better than our life .
Now , from political point of political view -- I &apos;ve almost finished -- from political point , the nocle is the following .
What allows this choice in industrial society is the material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know parts , where the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is they have too much .
So the factory of which I &apos;m talking is a modern malesclusive of modern , recidly societies .
And what it makes to be involved and array is this : Steve Levitt talked about how much those expensive and scomfortable seats for bies . It &apos;s a spread of money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and dispendious , it &apos;s not that they &apos;re just useful .
They are addiction of deleteries .
They &apos;re doing worse .
If a little bit of what our society allows a lot of choice , it was revered in the where people have too few possibilities , not just their lives , not just their lives .
This is what economists call a partner is a paretry .
A redistribution of the income , right to everybody -- not just the poorest -- not just the poorest -- because of this choice that &apos;s going to go .
And so , &quot; Folder , you can become all you want to be --
You , people of culture , you think , &quot; But what does it create that weight ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t make it in a glass . &quot;
&quot; United States , a homeless vision of the world -- &quot;
and I &apos;ve been interpret in the beginning .
But then , thinking about , I realized , I realized that that weight the long knows .
Because the reality of fact is that if you &apos;re managed to bought the bouths , so that &quot; all you can &apos;t get the freedom .
If you romes the books in a way that all divent possible divents .
Are paralysis , and you reduced the well-being .
Everyone need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too street , maybe even for us .
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic symbolic and , I &apos;m in the rovine .
Thank you very much heart .
