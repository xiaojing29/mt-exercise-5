Last year I showed these slidemonstrate that the cotta arctic glacial , which for almost three million years had the size of 48 percent of the U.S. continental , it was 40 percent .
But this subject of this subject of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the spexpensive because it doesn &apos;t show the spexpensive .
The arctic calotta is , in a way , the pulsant , the heart of the global climate system .
It exppputting out summer , and it &apos;s expanding .
The next slide slide will be a rapid fast carried on the last 25 years .
The ice lost least dences are signed .
And you see , they expand down to the blue .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter , which is summer extended .
You can see the cosidst ice perenn , of five years or more , it &apos;s like the blood , which is like the blood , which comes out of the body .
In 25 years , it went from this way .
This is a problem because the rescale interested in the arctic , and the arctic quantities of carbon congel that , and there are enormous amount of carbon that , and they turn into metane from microbes .
Risect to the totality of the atmospheric pollution , global warming , that amount could double , super-rading point , super-rading point .
In some laghi short laghi in Alaska , the metane is already rebolling from the water .
The professoreat Katey Walter of the University of Alaska team that was a team that was a team that winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : She &apos;s good . The question is if we &apos;re going to be .
And that is that this termal exchange that &apos;s Greenland exchange from north .
This is a river in regime regimes .
The led was never afraid .
This is the Kangerlush , Kangerlush , in the South of Greenland .
If you want to know how the sea level of sea sea shelter for the sea of sea gars of the sea sea sea .
These runs are increasingly .
At the other side of the planet : Antarctica , the largest ice block of the planet .
The month the scientists have declared that the balance of the ice is in negative , and the Antartica , which is the Antarctica , which is particularly rapid in some island in the slide .
Equival six feet of the watching watching , like in Greenland .
Sull Himalayas , the third biggest block of ice , and you see new laghi , which a few years ago , they were glacier .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population is going to be able water by the slide .
Sulle Ands : this glacier is the source of the water of this city .
The led is increased .
But when it decrees , it &apos;s the same accept to the water .
In California , the Sierra Nevada is decrease in the Sierra Nevada .
The households are in crisis .
The predictions , as you read , they &apos;re favorable .
The growth in the world leads to a remarkable increase in the world &apos;s purpose .
the environmental disasters are increasing a rhythm outside the normal and without precedented .
Four times more numerous in the last 30 years than the previous 75 years .
This is an unsustainable thing .
If you look at it in the historical context , if you can see the consequences .
And in the last five years , we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every day -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day .
Look at the East Pacific area , from Americas , to the West , to the West , and on both partnership , where there is a radical impoverments of oxygen in the ocean .
Most of global warming , together to deforestation , which is the 20 percent , is the use of fossil fuel .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worst .
The United States are one of the two of most emissions , together to China .
And it was proposition to build a lot of other central carbon .
But we &apos;re seeing to a change .
These are the annoylated projects in the last few years and some of the high-green alternative .
Every way , there &apos;s a bad political broads in our country .
The carbon industries and oil are spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon cleaning carbon cleaning , which is a hosymle .
And that picture I remember something --
Natal , Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion pounds of carbon .
You may have seen it on the news .
This is the second largest flow of scores in America .
It happened around Nanal .
The published nature of one carbon industries was this .
Video : carbon carbon , carbon is a kind of food .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it makes growing our economy .
It &apos;s more and more cleaner is and more clean .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and the workers are management .
Al Gore : From here &apos;s a lot of the West Virginia .
The largest society on the mountain is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Don Blankenship : Don Blankenship -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelososossive , Harry Reid -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for Clima Protection , he launched two campaign .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Ator : Ator : Ator , we see the climate change as a serious tiny set of our business .
So , our priority is invest a great amount of money in a bad ad ad ad ad ad for advertising and confuse the carbon .
In fact , the carbon isn &apos;t seeing .
We think it &apos;s clean -- it also has a good profuman .
So not preocattention of climate change .
Let me do .
Video : Ator : Ator : Caribone . You &apos;ve heard about it .
So let &apos;s go to a stream in a struggle to how clean carbon .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little bit of rumor , but this is the sound of climbing technology .
carbon consuming is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology of cleaning clean clean clean cleaning clean .
Take a look , this is the clean od-clean technology .
Al Gore : Inally , the positive alternative , the positive alternational question and national security .
Video : America is in crisis in crisis ; the economy , the national security , climate crisis .
The films that connects all : our dependence from fossil fuel and the oil beat and the oil .
Now , though , there &apos;s a new audace , audace solution for using .
Repower : 100 percent of cleaning energy , in 10 years .
A plan to put America &apos;s work , make us safety , and help to stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that &apos;s solution that &apos;s our problems .
Repower . Scom . Scom .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : That &apos;s about reducing energy .
One of the fastest ways of assignment of dependence from the combustible that kill our planet .
She &apos;s : The future is here . Wind , sunny , sunnetwork .
She &apos;s got two : Novi investment for places of broads .
Something : America . It &apos;s time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old proverbid proverbid proverbid , they say , &quot; If you want to go to fast .
If you want to go far away , you go together . &quot;
We need to go far away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED I did an introduce on LHC .
And I promise to return you to figure out how the machine works .
So here I am . And for the ones that the other time , there were no , the LHC is , the largest scientifiever ever ever trial -- 27 miles of circumstances .
His task is to rein the conditions that were present less than a billion second from the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
All of this is simply environmentally .
This is the machine under Ginevening .
We picture these mini-Bang Big Bang in the relevators .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLATLAS -- is 44 meters .
This is an image picture of ATLAS spectacular image .
Ten September 10 section year we &apos;ve access the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was causes of fest fest fest fest in the control of control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first particles of particles who had done all the whole of LHC , in collision , in a collision , with a part of the LHC , and it &apos;s spread in the sevator .
In other words , when we see that image 10 section , we realized that the machine worked , which is a great vitting that machine worked , which is a great vitting .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to do more or this , when somebody went to Google and saw the page was this .
That means that we had a cultural impact cultural impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with machine , and it had to these files here -- these dored files .
These files taking 13,000 ampers when the machine works to the powerful of power .
Now , the technical technical . They &apos;ll be true . And they &apos;re not true . I &apos;m very good . I &apos;m very good . &quot;
And they can do that because when they &apos;re very cold became the cosid-called superconductor .
So , unless 271 degrees , at a hell temperature to the space between the stars , these files can bring that run .
In one of the guns between the most of the novel of novel in LHC , there was a factory defect of factory .
So the files surprising slightly , and 13,000 ampings of suddenly met a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think these magnets are more than 20 tons , and that have been moving about 30 meters .
They &apos;re damaged about 50 magnets .
We had to take them , what we &apos;ve done .
We restraged them and traveled .
Now , they &apos;re coming back to their sub-place sub-war .
By the end of the LHC is , it &apos;s going to be new integrate .
We &apos;re going to accenate it , and we expect to get right or swimming and to continue our adventure to discover what the universe is .
Now , of course , in a way , these crashing , these crucial debate on the value of science and engineering in frontier . It &apos;s easy to confuture .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so difficult , the fact that I think is the fact that it &apos;s the value of things like LHC .
I &apos;d like to end with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , imagine , in the defense useful experiments of his pupillo , his pupillo was Michael Faraday , he said , &quot; Not is so dangerous for the progress of the human mind that the ideas of the human mind that ideas of defens are , which our triumfens , and our triumble monkey , and our triumphonce that our triumphysical monkey words . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to rethink when , from children , played with the morning .
And as you can figure out how to get them and get them , take them and move them , learning and to do them , learn , and to do it , and we learn how to think and resolve problems .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way that we understand most of the world around us .
So , by information , from the uslity of our interaction with physical objects , together my consultor , and my Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to asking me , &quot; And if we use a computer , and I started to have the only cursor of the mouse as a disease of the mouse mouse as a digital mouse that we could have a information with a desktop , we could actually deal with a information ,
and systemate to our placement ?
The question was so interesting question was that we decided to explore the answer , making Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a great computer interactive computer as a beat .
In a few words , a Siftable is a great computer interactive computer as a beat .
You can move them with the hand , they can see , &quot; they can see between them , feel their movement and they have a radio and a radio wireless .
But above , they &apos;re physical objects , like the morning , you can move it just to deal with it .
Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as a become more physical , knowledge of their movement , and other people , and as a become more physical , of their movement , of how we move them , of how we move new and fun is , we can explore new and fun .
I &apos;m going to start with a simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show video : if you cline it in a direction , the video will rotate , if you cline from the other hand back .
These interactive realized realized realized realizes .
If I face them , they &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re around .
If they are surrounded , they can see it and they can act a little bit .
If they are surrounded , they can see it and they can act a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclinclinure .
And then we realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power to use common gestures , for example , &quot; a color like , &quot; a color like , &quot; a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable of the trained century , and I can use them to be able to real color in the central , where they smissing .
and I can use them to real color in the central , where they spend .
If we &apos;re too much , we can put a little bit of it .
They also have a beautiful possibilities of learning , like languages , math and logic games where people can try to experience the people can try to try things fast , and see the results .
Now , I &apos;m now --
This is a sequence of Fibonaces I do with a program of equations .
And here we have a game of words that is half between Scarabeo and Boggle .
Pratically , to every turn on every turn on every Siftable on every Siftable , Pratically , to every turn on every Siftable on every Siftable , and cers of them to compose words , and cers of them controlling a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the kids in the Media Lab , I made a way that they tried them and I spent them and I spent them and I spent them a video .
They &apos;re very placeased .
And one of the interesting things about this application is that you don &apos;t have to give people many instructions .
You just say , &quot; Compons of words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s what other people who try it .
This is our most younger toest , there on the right .
He really wanted to implement them .
They were just morning .
Now , this is an interactive application of a interactive cardboard .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of Lui languages . He &apos;s Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , suncle , suncable them .
It can put new characters in the scene , suncle , suncable them .
And that &apos;s what it &apos;s doing sun .
Video : Sun is sunsurprising .
David Merrill : Now , he has led a tractor in the scene .
Video : The arange tractor .
By work ! Yes !
So , Siftable and put them neighborhood to interact the person-interact in the ...
Video : Bau !
-- inventing their story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide him as it is .
DM : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide him as it is .
Volice : Vololy , cat .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , that &apos;s a tool , that &apos;s a recent , to sampling and to exequiet and exequiet .
it &apos;s a tool , that &apos;s a recent , to sampling and exequiet .
The Siftable here are sounds like base , and the battery .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also put these sounds in a sequence of compose sequence .
And modifying it , just by touch a sound &quot; and a sequence . &quot;
These are effects that you can control from alive , like the reverse and the filter .
And then the drive of a particular sound and then inclines to fix it .
And then there are the general effects like time and volume , which is applied to the whole sequence .
Let &apos;s look at how it works .
Video : We &apos;re going to start with a base in two Siftable , &quot; sequence , &quot; sequence , we can systems , we can do it , we add it , we add it .
Now I &apos;m going to put a best line .
Video : Now , I add some percussion --
Video : I &apos;m going to put the filter to bacteria , so I can control the effect of the battery .
Video : I can fast fast the whole sequence , inclining the whole sequence by one side or another .
Video : And I &apos;m going to add the basis to give more expression .
Video : I can reombing the sequence . &quot;
So I didn &apos;t have to plan it first , but I can suddenly , making it longer or more cords .
And now , finally , I can spent the whole sequence by inclining on the left the Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new man &apos;s new man and more like , and more like our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the result of this path , and also some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to transmit is coming to this new generation of design objects to interact with digital media , that will bring information in our world in the way that we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the hour of speaking with all of you .
I &apos;m a writer .
Boy books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the fascine of my life .
And I don &apos;t expect that it can change .
But , said , something particular happened to my life and my career , and in my career , which brought me to receiver the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this book , this biography called &quot; Manda , Prega , &quot; which , in my previous reason , for some reason that I had been a big , sensational best , for some reason that has been a big , sensational ,
And the result is that everywhere &apos;s going to be convicted as if I was convicted .
Daveled , condanned , condanned .
They come from me now , everybody worried and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t fear more ?
You don &apos;t fear to keep writing all of life without power of being able to create a book that can important to someone ? &quot;
What can you care ? &quot;
It &apos;s rassuring , you know .
But I remember that I remember more than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent -- I was a cent .
I met the same reaction based by the pure .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you can &apos;t be able to be successful ?
You don &apos;t fear that the humiliation of the refuse you ?
You don &apos;t feel that you do this mestimates all of life without the one ever comes out and die on a cumulo of dreams of infrants with the mouth of loving full of full of full of full of full full of fallimb ? &quot;
And that , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I fear about all those things .
I &apos;ve always been afraid .
And I &apos;ve also fear of many other things that people couldn &apos;t have to inate .
As the food and other things .
But , as much as it is about what I thought and ask me , and I ask , I have a literally , because ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logical that anyone who should expect to be spavented by a job that you feel like to do .
But what is this particular in creative enterprises to make us nervous about mind health in a way that other career are not doing ?
Like my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer , and I don &apos;t remember a once in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if he was crazy could be engineer ?
Never -- that was -- that block of John engineer , how do it ?
Not work like that , you know ?
Onestly , chemical engineers like group have not , in the centuries , in the centuries , they &apos;ve gone out of the reputation of being alculation .
We have enough reputation , we have enough this reputation , and not only writers but creative of every gender , we have this reputation of being enormous instables .
And it doesn &apos;t research to look at the conteam of the dead of the magnific dead of creative minds that only in the 21st century , they die young people die .
And the ones that have not suicidated suicidated to be really dishistory from their dons .
Norman Mailer , before I die , in the last interview , he said , &quot; Every book , I killed a little bit more than &quot; a little bit of more . &quot; An extraordinary des about their life .
But we don &apos;t bad at the time , when we heard these things that are so long that we &apos;ve heard these things that we &apos;ve been doing this very much interiorized and the notion that creativity and suffering , and the art , it will conduce the end .
And the question I want to ask all over here today is : are you agree with this idea ?
That &apos;s good -- because it &apos;s also like , it &apos;s a centimeter of distance to me not good for nothing to me for nothing .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous , and I don &apos;t want to see perpetured in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our great creative minds to live .
And I know that , in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start figting to that I was suppose to start out to the surrounding circumstances where I &apos;m in my career .
That &apos;s what that is looking at the time , I &apos;m quite young , I have about 40 years .
I still have about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything write about what I write about the world that came out of the world that came out of the world that came out of my last book .
I &apos;m going to be huge , because we &apos;re all more or friends here -- is probably my greater success is to my hell .
Oh , Gesus , who thought .
You know this is the kind of thinking that &apos;s brings a person to start bere in the nine and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would stop doing this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how do you ?
And so , after many reflective reflective , which is a way to work to keep writing is to create a psychological construggle , okay ?
I have to find a safety distance of safety between me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxim to what the reaction is going to get out of the last year , trying to find out the last year , trying to find other society to see if they could have had ideas to see if they could have had ideas and more healthier ideas to see if they could have some ideas and more healthier ideas to see if they could have had ideas and more healthight .
how to help people to manage the inerent risks emotional risks of creativity .
And that research has taken me to the ancient Green and ancient Rome .
I &apos;m lead because I play in circle and then back back .
In ancient Grex and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity was from men , OK ?
And he thought creativity was this spirit of divine , and he came to a few distant people someone distant and known , for reasons , and unknown for reasons , and unknown .
The Greeks called these &quot; Deign divents of creativity &quot; demons . &quot;
Socry , wonderful , belief that was that I had a wisdom that was wisdom .
The Roman were the same idea , but they called the spirit of spirit without a genius .
which is great , because Romans didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly smart .
They thought that a genius was this kind of divine that was created in the walls of a study of a study of an artist , a little bit like the Dobby , and he came out to hidden work in the walls of the work of the artist and model of that job .
Here &apos;s the way -- that &apos;s the distance of which is the distance of which -- that psychological costruth that protection from your work .
And they all knew that it was working , right ?
So the antic artists were protected by certain things , like , for example , the too much narcism , right ?
If your work was exceptional , you couldn &apos;t take your house and all the way , they all knew that you had been helped by this genius encourary .
If your false job , it wasn &apos;t all flies , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be an inable inable .
And so people han concept creativity in the West for a long time .
And then Rened the Rened , and everything changed , and nacks , and nacks , and we put the human beings and name more to leave the misteries and leaving space to creatures that are wrong the creatures that write from the divinity .
This was the principle of rational humanity and people began to think that creativity was completely from hyd-cle .
And for the first time in history , it began to reference to this or the artist as a rather than a person with genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big herror .
I think that we can allow somebody , a simple person to believe that as a replaces like the source , and the kind of creative , and the kind of creative , unknowledge and ethernnal responsibility to give to the psychquickly hard to hold the psychics that humanity .
It &apos;s how to ask somebody to enjoy the sun .
Deform and fully the ego and creates all these expectable .
And I think it was this pression to destruct the artists in the past 500 years .
And , if that &apos;s true , and I think it &apos;s , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do that different ?
Maybe back to a more older than the relationship between humans and creative mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t sing 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people between the audience that there would have any scientific scientific that would have a notion of the notion , you make people sfit on their projects .
I would probably not convince you all on this .
But the question I want to ask is -- why don &apos;t it ?
Why don &apos;t you think that way ?
Because it has more sense than anything that I &apos;ve ever heard to explain the exasperant impredicbility of creative process .
A process that , as anyone who I &apos;ve ever tried to do something -- so , basically , all of here -- it doesn &apos;t be rationally , all of here -- it doesn &apos;t be rationally .
And in fact , it can sometimes seem completely paranormal .
I did this met recently with the extraordinary poetch Ruth Stone , who was now 90 years , but that was a poeetah for all life and said that during his childhood in Virginia , he was working out in the Virginia , and he heard of , when a poem coming from the landscape .
He said that it was like a fragorous train .
And she was rolating to her landscape .
He heard him arriving , because he was tremendous land under his feet .
He knew to have one thing to do at that point and he was to do with his words , &quot; running as a matta . &quot;
And so it was ran out of this poem , and he was wouldn &apos;t have to make a piece of paper and a fairly fast , and a fairly fast , and he would raise and raise it on the page .
Sometimes he couldn &apos;t be fast enough , so ran and ran realized and ran back to the home and the poem , and she would keep rolling through and she would continued to rolling through the landscape , and he would continued to roll through the landscape , and he said , &quot; another poet . &quot;
Then there were those times -- this piece of the day , I won never forget -- there were any time that was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was trying to pay and the poem and the poem through , and he was going to be a crap in , and he was going , and then he was going , and he was going to flow and the step .
He wasn &apos;t the poem from tail and he said in his body and he said to the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be on the perfect page and intact page , but the last word to the first word .
So when I thought -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly equal to my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conducture .
I &apos;m a mess , and my way of work is ; I &apos;m wake up , and wake up and work and sweating and work and go on and work and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and work and go on and work and go on and work and go on and go on and work and work and work and work and work and work and you go to the way .
But even I , in my test , in my test , I &apos;ve strisciled against that thing , sometimes .
And I imagine that many of you have the han done .
You know , even though the work and ideas came up with me , and the ideas came from a source source , I can &apos;t honestly know it .
And what is this ?
And how can we relate it to that way that we don &apos;t lose the head , but rather , what do you have healthy ?
And as much as I was , the best contemporary example that I have is the musician that I &apos;ve been interviewed for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life was the incartooned in the house artist mented , trying to control , to manage these species of creative impulses .
But then he was drive , and one day as he was driving on a &apos; highway in Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
He was going fast and everything of a sent sum of a sent such a little bit of melody , which comes into its head as inspiration , and the various , and the wants , and the wants , and the wants , and the wants , but not knows how to take it .
It doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a regier .
So , he began to hear this species of old old old aneem to lose , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;ll stay obsessed by this more song .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t make it cell . &quot;
And instead of going to the panic , he stopped .
And it was a whole process , and he did something completely new .
He just watched the sky and said , &quot; Scush , not see that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Do you seem to write a song right now ?
If you really want to exist , you go back to a care of a care of you .
Otriments , you go to important something else today .
You know , Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his process , it worked after this .
Not the work , it was still hoscure as always a hard .
But the process , and the anxiety that attack him was reeded when he came to his genius , the genius who was out of him , and I &apos;ll remove it back from , and I &apos;ll remust that didn &apos;t have to be a interiorized thing that was interiorized and came out of it .
but it was well-huge , wonderful , wonderful , a conversation between Tom and this strange thing and this external thing , and it was not Tom .
So how I felt that story started changing a little bit of how I worked , and I save me once .
This idea , he saved when I was written , &quot; Manian , &quot; and fall in one of those of the deperspective of the disaster that we all have to work on and we &apos;re all working on something , and we start thinking that will be the worst book , which will be the worst book , which is going to be the worst book .
Not just book , right , right ,
And I started thinking about themselves to throw this project .
But then I remember Tom who talked to the air and I tried to the air and I tried to try to us .
So I went up my face in the manoscrits and I made my comments to a vacuum of the room .
And I said to the high voices , &quot; Senters , what we &apos;re smart , if this won &apos;t really shining my book , it won &apos;t that ?
Because as I see me I &apos;m putting everything I have , I have , not more than that .
So if you want to introduce you and do your part .
Okay . But if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , I don &apos;t do that .
I &apos;m going to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I want to do my home part of the recorded that I today for me to do my part , &quot; because , at the end is so , OK -- it does in the deserts of Africa , the North Africa was raded for the North Africa , and sacred , and sacred music .
And they were always magnificent , because the dancers were professioners and they were fantastic .
But every once , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists had been transmitting .
And I know what I talk about , because I know you &apos;ve all seen you &apos;ve all seen it , a performance .
It was like the time , he was stopped , and the dancers through a kind of landscape and it wasn &apos;t doing anything different from the usual , like the 1,000 nights before , but everything was going .
And suddenly , it doesn &apos;t just like a human .
But it turns out from the ded-inside and under the illumined dependent .
And when this happened to , to the time , people knew what was , they called it with his name .
They were broken and they started sing , &quot; Allah , God , Allah , God , Allah , God ,
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curious night -- when the Mori invasive Spain , they took this habits , and they had this habits , and pronounded , and the pronoundary changed in the wind of &quot; Allah , &quot; , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Onlah , &quot; Onails in the flamens .
In Spain , when an artist did something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , and , and , Allah , magnificent , and I can be a great great , and I cold , and I can -- a God score of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes the dance , for the dance itself , when you wake up and it turns out that are the 11 in the morning of Martedesday , and I scores the wind of God , it &apos;s not .
It &apos;s simply a lot of bad to the ginocky , and maybe not to be able to get to the altitude .
And maybe no one of God still while she &apos;s name God , and so what &apos;s to do with rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most sweat several sound of creative recognizes .
But maybe not to be so anglost , if you can &apos;t believe , in fact , that the most extraordinary expects that extraordinary expects of your being coming from yourself .
But I just believe that you have data in the floor of this iminimaginable source of this source of your life that you have to go to someone else when you &apos;ve finished .
And , you know , if we think that it &apos;s all changing .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s certainly like the book , and it &apos;s just like the book that I &apos;m going to do this , the book , the dangerous , I was dangerous , so that I was following my great success .
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel electried by this is , not afraid .
Not down . It just your job . It just your job .
It &apos;s a review of your part , any of all of the way to be .
If your job is baling , baling .
If the devine , absurd , assigned decides to leave some kind of wonderful kind of wonderful , for one moment through your efforts , then , &quot; then , &quot; Okay . &quot;
Otriments , you do the same .
And &quot; Okay , &quot; to you . &quot;
I think , you &apos;ve got to teach it .
&quot; You know , &quot; to you know , even for you had human love and test love and test later , you &apos;re going to make you sure it again .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Yeah .
And as you know , I &apos;ve already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what it can meant and discovery of new set of genes .
Now we &apos;re starting a new percoral , we started digitize biology and now starting from that digital code , we &apos;re going into a new phase of biology , designing and synthesizing and synthesizing life .
We always tried to ask big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; is something that many biologists I &apos;ve tried to figure out in lots of levels .
We tried different approaches , and we tried it to the minimes .
We &apos;re digitizing for about 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome , it was to go from the analogical world of the computer world &apos;s digital world .
Now , we can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome of the smallest genome of the ones that can authority in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome to create a little bit more smaller .
We are able to eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 of the 500 that are here .
But when we &apos;re a look at his metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our .
Cretemes , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at a time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this can bring to a living cell .
So we decided that the only way that we decided that the only way to synthesize this chromosome in a way to make some of these things .
And so we started the adventure of the &quot; Pan we can synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Can the chemistry to make these big molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create before ?
And in case , we can make a crowd , can we make a crowd ?
A chromosome is simply a piece of inert material .
The speed that we are able to digitize life is growing to exponential life is growing to exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , rather slowly , progrediscuss rather than it &apos;s improving .
And our most recent recent retakers the late to a exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process has requested a lot of passionally , starting with a bioethical review that we started the early experiments .
But we found that DNA is very difficult . It &apos;s very difficult .
There are thousands of machines of machines in the world that produces small sector in 50 to 50 letters , and it &apos;s a degenerative process , and it &apos;s a degenerative process , more errors there are .
So we had to develop a new metod to assembling these fragments and running the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , to start by the Phi genome of Phi genome of Phi genome of Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , actually , the correction of the errors and got a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material , and we put it in the bacteria , the bacteria , the bacteria have started to read this genetic code and producurn the viral particles .
The viral particles have been released by the cells , and they destroying the E.
I talked about recently with members of the oil industry , and they &apos;re saying , they &apos;re certainly understanding this model .
They &apos;ve got more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where software can actually build his same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the largest things .
We wanted to build the whole chromosome of the bacterium .
They &apos;re over 580 middle of genetic code .
So we thought we &apos;d build it in the size of virus , so that we could change the casses to figure out what the casses are for a living cell .
The design is critical , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accurateful standard was a mile for every 10 mile of mile .
We found out , we found that , 30 errors , we had that original sequence that original sequence we would never be able to do that work .
One part of the process is to design seat a long time , and they &apos;re sovereign with all the other sides of 50 letters of 50 letters to build subjects that work together .
We &apos;re going to try unique elements here .
You probably read that we put a full we put a free free .
Think about it this : We have a genetic code based on four letters : A , CA , CA , CA , CA , Cange , C.
Three of those letters code together , about 20 amminods , and there &apos;s a specific order of letters for every amminoid .
So we can use genetic code to write words , frassions , frassignment .
What we did the beginning was to throw it .
Some have been deluses from fact that it wasn &apos;t poem .
We designed these segments to simply join the way .
There are enzymes that they repair them .
And we started assembling parts , starting with segments five to seven ments from five to seven mile segments of 24 mile letters , and they &apos;re going to get 72 mile ,
We made these segments , we made these segments so that we could sequencing them from us to sequencing the dance process that we &apos;re trying to create a very robbbust .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems to the tabellone broad .
When we get to these very long segments , more than 100 midle , they &apos;re not going to grow more directly in E.
It comes to the limits of modern tools of molecular biology .
So we &apos;ve been considered other mechanisms .
We knew a mechanism called homologist , which is in biology , which is using to repairing DNA can can actually get the segments .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodus , can absorbing three million rad of radiation .
You can see in the swimming of superior how his chromosome comes out .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s removed by exactly the first .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can drive out .
They can live under a vacuum .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life exists in space , and you &apos;re moving to find new environments .
ASA real , NASA showed that this happens .
This is an image of the molecule that we built using these processes , just using the free segments to put the design appropriate segments to put .
The labor assembs them .
This image was not taken with a electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a task that we can see it with a microscope .
These are photos that cover a second period of six seconds .
This is the publishing that we did a little time ago .
They &apos;re over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the largest molecule of a definitely definitely ever created by man .
It has a molecular spring to 300 million .
If you switch this on a 10 without spaces , it would like 142 pages to just make this genetic code .
Now , how do we do that work ? How can we active it ?
Of course , through a virus is a virus is a game from kids .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when they use battered .
It &apos;s simplest even when it comes to the eucariote cells like our : you can just extract it it &apos;s a nucleo , which is basically the nucleo , which is basically the clonce process of .
In the archaea , the huge bterms , it &apos;s inside the cell , but we &apos;ve just demonstrated that we &apos;re able to do a complete traph of a cell , from a cell , and to activity .
We had a chromosome , from a microbial species .
The two are different than men from men .
We &apos;ve added some gene in a way that we could decide what to choose for this chromosome .
The candle then with the floor enzymes , so that they &apos;re going to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was study -- and you &apos;ll open-like -- and you &apos;re going to our graph -- the new croma -- the new croma .
And we were beginning , we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried anyway to spin more .
This is one of the major mechanisms .
We found that many species have added a second or a second or third chromosome somewhere , add in a second thousands of new training to that species .
So who thinks evolution as a only gene at a time that you modified has no realized a lot of the biology .
There are enzymes called &quot; &quot; restriction enzymes that are actually going to digerize DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell of it .
The cell phone that &apos;s cell phone that we &apos;ve inserito-hand .
He was expressed , and he recognized the other crowd , like it , and we found it , and we found it with just the new cell and we found out with just the cell and the new chromosome .
it became blue because of genes that we &apos;ve inserious .
And in a short of time , all the characteristics of a species have gone lost , and it turned out of all in a new species , based on the new software that we in the cell .
All proteins are changed , membranes have changed , and when we read the genetic code , exactly to what we &apos;ve transfer .
Now , this might seem genetics , but altering the software , but altering DNA , we can change things in a way .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that here is not genesius about three million years , and a half million years of evolution , and I &apos;ve already said that maybe we &apos;re going to create new version of the Cambrian explosion of the Cambrian explosion this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty obvious when we think about our needed .
We &apos;re going to spend six and a half billion people at nine billion in the next 40 years .
Just to give example : I was born in 1946 .
Now , there are three people on the planet for each other existing in 1946 ; there will be four years , and there will be four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find food , fresh water and cleaning , medicinal and medicinal , medicinal and a half billion people .
It &apos;s even more hard to do that nine billion .
We use more five billion carbon , more than 30 billion coal , more than 30 billion barrel .
That means million barrasses a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replace them , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to realize all the CO2 emission of CO2 from these materials that ends in the atmosphere .
At day day , thank you for scientific discoveries all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that they are the design design components for the future .
The electronic industry can only have a dozen about components , and think about how many different things come out .
Our limits here are principlally from biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , thank you to these synthesization of synthesization , in degree of creating what we call genomics .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can make a big robot that can make a million chromosomes a day .
Think about these 20 million genes or try to try to optimize the processes to make the processes to make the processes to make a tiny team , we can change , because of a little team , and create more biology , and create more biology than the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s simply a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , production , chemical vaccines or carburn , production , production of vaccines etic vaccines .
This is an instantly , some software programmed on which we &apos;re working on to be able to be able to sit and design species on the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know necessarily how they &apos;re going to be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
Now we &apos;re focusing on the carburants of how quarters generation .
You &apos;ve seen that extract ethanol from the grain was a bad experiment .
We have second and third generation carbon , which is going to use enough of sugar to carburanants of higher value as opopposed to the eight-types .
But the only way that biology can have a great impact without increasingly increasingly the cost of food and limitarily the cost of food and limitarily the CO2 in the first , so we can work to design cells that they can get the first carried on , and we think we could think we think we could have the early carburanks in about 18 months .
The sunlight combined with CO2 is a metodoor -- but in our discoveries all over the world , we found different metodds .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , at about 2500 feet of deep-foot ocean temperature of the water temperature of the water .
CO2 using CO2 using hydrogen using hydrogen using molecular source .
We &apos;re trying to figure out if we can sing CO2 , which can easily be transported through the touch , convertising that CO2 in carburst , to drive this process .
So we think that we could be able to increase the floor to increase what the base question , what is the base question , &quot; that &apos;s life . We have the goal to replace the whole obium to replace the whole oil industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do that TED , where are you ?
It would have a main source of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working to use the same metods to create vaccines of instantly .
And you saw this year with influence , we &apos;re always back a dollar in less when it &apos;s about a dollar in less when it &apos;s right .
I think that what you can change by building vaccines in anticipate .
And that &apos;s how the future could start seeing , the tree of evolution , accelerating evolution , accelerating the evolution with synthetic bacteria , and finally electing it .
We are so much like that from impressing people .
Our purpose is to do a way of living enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the most quickly possible , some fundamental work , of the new technology that we &apos;ve taken to a very much one year ago . This is Seadragon . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s a environment where you can interact in the local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data .
And here we &apos;re seeing a lot of digital photos that &apos;s gigabyte , with a kind of constant photos , and I continue , for a panoramic speed , and I &apos;m going to images as we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big the amount of data or images .
Most of digital photographs , but this for example is a scanning of the Bibliotecame from the Bibliotecame from the Bibliotehyxel .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that the only thing that &apos;s the number of a system like this is the number of pixeline . It &apos;s also a very flexel architecture . It &apos;s also a very flexelecture .
This is a whole book , you don &apos;t images .
This is Dickens of Dickens . Every column . Every column .
To show you that it &apos;s really about text and not images , we can do something like this , to see really that it &apos;s a real representation of the text of a real representation of text .
It could be a little artificial way to read a little artificial book .
I don &apos;t need to recommend that .
This is a more realistic . It &apos;s a number of The Guardian .
Every big picture is the beginning of a seeption .
And it really gives you the pleasure and beautiful experience of a magazine or a newspaper or a newspaper , which is for a lot of medium .
We also did something with the corner of this number particular number of The Guardian .
We made a high-resoluate advertising solutions -- much more than what you use in a publishing published -- and we &apos;ve inserious content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific specific .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that this means to put the pop-up and other porches like , and other assimilar porches , they shouldn &apos;t have to be necessary .
Of course , maps is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not to lose time , if you don &apos;t say that we have contribution to give this field .
These are all the streets in the USA overlapping out a geospace of NASA .
So , we &apos;re going to go to something else .
This is now from the Web on the Web ; you can see it .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
A is Seadragon and the other is a visual computer very interesting -- by Noah Snavely , a student of the University of Washington , with the help of Steve Seitz of the UW and Reszeliski Seitz , and Research Seliski Microsoft Research . It &apos;s optic .
And it &apos;s from the view on the web , Seadragon .
You can see that when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from a picture to another image to the other and have this kind of experience to multiple solution .
But the space of pictures here actually has a meaningful meaningful .
The computer algorithms of visualization have recorded these images together , in a way that they &apos;re corresponding to to the real place where the imaginion -- all the neighbors -- all the neighbors -- all the nearly of a slides of a sanadhesian elements of a slide-show or of a slides of a slides of a slides of a spaceship .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are much more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original Doah-set -- and this is from a precedent prototynth of Photosynth that we &apos;ve done in the first time , the last time , the first time , the last time , the last time , the technology Photosynth . And that &apos;s not necessarily the key Photosynth . And that &apos;s not necessarily evidence by the Web .
We had to worry about the legal aspects and so on .
This is a rebuild of Nothtrial Nothtrial Reham images from Flickr . Bast Din Flickr , and you get images of types , and you get images of short , and so on . Each of these arancies , it represents a picture that &apos;s discovery .
So , they &apos;re all images from Flickr and they &apos;ve been all been all lined to space in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this very simple way .
You know , I would never have thought I &apos;d ever thought I &apos;d end up to Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifying to get this kind of access here .
I think you can see that this is a lot of different types of different types of foot of those professional cellphone to those professional cellphone , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try and look for those more strange .
Many are block , and they &apos;re stuck .
And some part here is a series of photographs -- etches .
This is a Nothtrial Nothtrial .
We can go from the poster to the view of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is taking data from the ential memory of how the land , from the ential memory of how the land , from the vision point of view -- and connecting all those data together .
All those pictures become connected , greater than the sum of parts .
You have a model of the entire land that emerge .
Think about this as a prolound-labor Stephen Lawler on the virtual Earth .
It &apos;s something that is growing in complexity as well as people use , and the vantages that are using it .
Their pictures are married by other people .
If someone comes to the idea of contrast all these several several several , my photo of the Nothtrial of Nothical Darricchies , it &apos;s how to use the data , and I can use the way of inground , and I can use the picture of all these things , and have a universe of anybody else , and have a social experience of critical cause of all of the kind of critical coss-cycle .
Of course , a consequence of all of that are extremely elaborate , extremely elaborate , which is not only afraid aerious , and from satellitarians and satellitarians , but from the collective memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What your software will contain us to do is that at a certain point in the next few years , all the photographs shared by everybody in the world will be going to connect together ?
BA : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is basically discover .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , you want , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of pictures .
What becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of simantic information that many of these images are going on .
As when you do a research of images on the Web , you get a sentence and the page on the page , it has a lot of information about the picture .
Now , what happens if that picture is connecting to all your photos ?
So the amount of simantity interconnection and the amount of wealth that &apos;s really huge . It &apos;s a classical classic .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really amazing . Compliments .
BA : I thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure , when you travel and one of the ethnographic research is the power to live between who didn &apos;t forget the ancient traditions , between who who have the real traditions , the touch the touch , the drilllls him in the foods .
Basti thinking that Jaguar Jaguar &apos;s still beyond the Vy Way , or Mattea , or the Mceanish Milders are still meaningful , or Himalaya , to remember the central machine of the anthroughout of the central of the anthropology , and that the idea that the world in which we live in the world that we live in a sense of fact , but it &apos;s only a model of reality , but it &apos;s just a very much ,
the consequence of a particular set of adaptative , that our stirram has done , well or a lot of generations that our stirram has been doing .
And of course , we all share the essential .
We all do . We all procreating . We all procreating .
We are subjects in the beginning .
We need to death the inexorability of death , so it doesn &apos;t surprising if we cleaning and ballee .
We all have a art .
What hits is the particular rate is the particular rate of the song , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that they are the Penan forests of Borneo , or the followers of Haiti , or the follower-Kaisut , or the Kaisut settled Kenya , the Except of the Saharan Sahara .
He was my companies of journey in the desert a month ago , or a hallevator of yak in the value of Qomolumest , the Everest , the world &apos;s mother .
All of these populations teach us that there are other ways of thinking , and other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , moves in the world .
And , if you reflect a moment , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
Insigned , the myriades of the world creating a spiritual life and cultural life that has the planet and it &apos;s important for the planet as a biosphere as a biosphere as a biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural nature as a etnosphere , and you can define the ethnosphere , the ethm , every , though , ideas , myths , inspirations , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , and you can deal with the human imination .
Ethnosphere is the fantastic patrimonio of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be as inquisitive .
And because the biosphere was very quickly consumed ethnic and it was very quickly .
Nobody biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species was on the ey-ox-to-toorran , or -- because it &apos;s falong , or -- in the most apocalytic diversity -- and not even near to the most typically the optimistic hypothesis -- that of the cultural diversity .
The whole thing is , of course , is , of course , the language .
When you were born , there were 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only a vocabulary or a series of a vocabulary rules .
A language is the spracet of human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle with which the animals of every culture comes into the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a thought , a bad thinking , an ecosystem of spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re sitting in Monterey , at least the half doesn &apos;t come out in the ears of children .
They don &apos;t come out of the children , the means they want to say , unless they &apos;re dead .
What is more sad of the sad of being flew from silence , to be the last to speak a language , of not to transmit , not a way to transmit wisdom of the children &apos;s broads ?
This is a fate state of somewhere in the world every two weeks . every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks , and it takes to the tomb silabe of an ancient language .
And I know somebody who will say , &quot; Isn &apos;t that ?
The world wouldn &apos;t it be a better place if we all talk to everybody the same language ? &quot; We talk to all the same language . We talk to the cancer .
We talk to koges .
You &apos;ll take a sudden thing like , what it means is not to talk their language .
Now , I &apos;d like to do a journey through ethnosphere --
a little journey in the ethnosphere to give you a massive of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , &quot; different ways of existing , I really mean , &quot; I really mean , &quot; I mean , &quot; I really mean , &quot; I mean , &quot; I really mean , &quot; I mean , &quot; I really mean , &quot; I mean , &quot; I really mean , &quot; I mean , &quot; I really mean , &quot; I mean , &quot; I really mean , &quot; I mean , &quot; I really mean , &quot; I mean , &quot; I really mean , &quot; I mean
Take for example , this Barasana Barasana , in Amazon , the population , the population of anaconda , which creates the myth of the hest satte in the house of serious sacred sacred sacred .
It &apos;s a population that &apos;s not able to distinguished the blue color because the green color is identified in the forest , which depends the population .
They have a linguistic and a marriage , and a marriage , called &quot; &quot; exogamic , &quot; : you have to move a person that language different language .
All this radical past mythological past , though the particularity is that in these house families that are talking about six or seven languages .
They limited to hear and then they start to speak .
Take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived , the Waorani of Ecuador , an incredible population , a incredible populable population that had had had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionaries have tried a construction that was a fact ,
They &apos;ve been doing the photography that reports them in poses that they had adiches , forget that this population of pluvial forest pluvial forest had never seen anything that &apos;s been seen .
They &apos;ve been taken the photos , they turned them to the research of a form or a figure , and they didn &apos;t find anything , they have conclosed that they were about dig hell with the light .
But Waorans don &apos;t just kill the strange .
They killed between them .
54 percent of mortality was caused by them .
We &apos;ve slown at eight generations , and we found two cases of natural mortgage , and when we &apos;ve been insisted to know , they &apos;ve been aging , so they were so much aging , and then they kill it the same .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps of recognizes .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned a very interesting tassigned when my Harvard of Harvard , asked me , if I wanted to go to Haiti in the bottom of Duvaliver and Tonton Macouver , and I imposed to do the basic zing for the Really , and I was used to do the basic zing for the bombie .
To make sense of miraculous , I should have to understand Vodoun culture and the Vodoun culture .
It &apos;s pretty much of a metaphysics of the world .
Very interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no religious faith . And yes , and the Voodoo is not religious that the distilled of these religious concepts of these very profound deep tragic .
What makes the interesting interesting is the intense of the intense is intense between life and death .
So the alive is born .
The spirits can be invowned by Great Aqua , they respond to the rhythm of dance and replace temporary themselves , so that for a very short actim that for a very short actim , the following .
So , the voodoohisti love say , &quot; white white you go to wait to God .
We give us in the temple and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment that you &apos;re playing , is the spirit that you , how can you do the bad ?
So , you assist these incredible events : followed voodoo in state of trance that touches infuel infuried a demonstration rather straight on the body when it &apos;s catalyzed in a state of extremely exciting state .
And I &apos;m all the people with which I lived the most extraordinary are the Kogi of Sierra Nevada Marta , in the Santa Marta , in Colombia .
Sendent depending on ancivilization , which was a time , they were living on the carairs of the conquist , the population was going to be on the massicully willing on the career massicully .
In a blood continent of blood continent , this population never been conquered by the spagners .
And so , they &apos;re government today , they &apos;re government government is really extraordinary .
The young people are taken away from the families to three or four years , and they live in a good world , and they live in a good world , shombs in a hair of the glaciers for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years of the exactly to reproduce the nine months of gestation that transruns into the user of mother , they &apos;re metaphorically in the Great Mther .
For all this time , they are acculate to the values of their society , values that predicted their prayers and only their prayers are management -- or to say the cosmic balance .
At term of this incredible beginning , and suddenly taken out and for the first time in their age of 18 years , they see a floor . And that &apos;s in that actim of the first bad , when the sun bad the sun values the bad of the great landscape , all the they &apos;ve learned in theory is confered all of its own head . The precier a step back and says , &quot; The forth a step back and says , &quot; Last , priver a step back , and he says , &quot; The nice a step back ,
&quot; I &apos;m like ? Proprion ? Proprion .
It &apos;s study . Now it &apos;s about you protect it . &quot;
They call bigger brothers and say that we , frathers , we are the destruction of the world .
This is an intuition is extremely important .
When we think about Indigene populations and environment , we invodge and the old story of the old old wild of the old nice history of the old noble , which is a raised razy concept Thoreau , and we say that these people are closer to the Earth of us .
The Indigenes are not not not sentimental sentimental nor indebols .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the paludiquitous paludium , or in the winds of Tibet , but thank you to get a mystic of the Earth , and they &apos;ve created a mystic of the Earth , but on a concept that the Earth can live in consciousness : the concept that the Earth can live in the consciousness that the Earth can live in the human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
It means that a child of the Ands who grows up the mountain is a mountain in a Prit of Apu who will be a deeply different , and it &apos;s going to be a deeply different than a Montana , and it will have a lot of different than a Montana , who grows a Montana Montana who grows in a Montana of rocket rock of rocket to be scale .
which is the demonstrate of a spirit or a mineral of the spirit .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia &apos;s forests to believe that the forests serve forests to be cut .
And that made me a human being different human being different from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the forests are the Hukuk and the history of the paradise and the history of the cannibs that are live in the northern Northern Islate .
If you start to consider that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of them sensationally sensational real . We take this plants .
I took this picture to open them in the noroccurred .
Mayahuge of you &apos;ve heard about the Eahuge , the powerful substance of the repertoire of the repertoire .
What makes the eyahuge ehuge is not the pharmacological potential of substance , but his elaboration . It &apos;s a very good thing .
From a hauns , this lian lady series of healthy , harming and harments , slightly , harmful hallucinogene .
She &apos;s a plant plant , you have a smoke that alters a little bit of the consciousness , but it &apos;s mixed with the leaves of a class of the coffee family of the coffee .
This plants contains powerful tripptamines , very similar to serotonin , methoxyltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltrack .
If you ever see Yanomami , you &apos;ll see Yanomami suspance in the nose set of species , in the methoxyltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltrained .
Tiring that pollution on the nose is a little bit of like being disappeared by a fucies of path of the gymen . And you can &apos;t make a distortion of reality .
I was often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who went the psychedelic was , with his discovery of the hallucinogens in the &apos; 30s in the Mexico .
Secondly , my tesis can &apos;t care these triptames like hallucinogens because if you &apos;re doing you can &apos;t tell anyone who are trucinated .
It &apos;s possible absolutely , if you unabuntil other chemicals that money to MAO .
Now , the beautiful : the carbon is the beautiful , the carbon is inhibitors of MAO , the same kind of necessary to be able to potentiate triptames . The question question is in a 80,000 species of plants , like these are two phologically dies are not similar , but if you combined in this way , create a creating version that &apos;s perior that &apos;s perior perior high perior the similar ?
We use the great eufemism of the prova and error , which can reveal infruit .
But if we ask Indian , they &apos;ll tell us , &quot; The plants are talking about . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribes , Cofan , has 17 variety variety of Ehuggash , which is network of our eyes would requires in the same species .
If we ask him how they &apos;re going to say , &quot; I thought , &quot; I thought , &quot; I thought I read to that I said , &quot; I didn &apos;t know anything ? &quot; I said , &quot; No .
The solution is , you take 17 variety in a notice of a broke , and they &apos;re going to sing with a different tanterm .
With this is not a degree laurea to Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting to count to contact the pright .
Now , the problem is that also , the problem is that also the ones of us who have to have the history of the people are points , but in some way to our history of history of history of our real world &apos;s history , and it &apos;s over .
In fact , the 11th century , in 300 years , it won &apos;t come to his wars or technology , but rather as the era where we have stopped and we embraced actively actively , and we embractively actively , the problem is mass of the mass of biological diversity and cultural of the planet . Now the problem is not change .
All cultures , through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibilities .
And the problem isn &apos;t technology .
Indians Indians don &apos;t have to stop Sioux when they put up in the horse and flows like this , as the Americans don &apos;t have to be Americans when they put up in the horse and hot .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that threatening the integrity of ethnosphere . It &apos;s the power .
The flight of domination .
And if you look at the world , you &apos;ll discover that these are not destined cultures .
They are creatures and dynamics , and dynamics , and they &apos;re going to beyond their ability of adaptation .
Sy that &apos;s disbone of the Penan in-field --
Sarawak of Sarawak , in the Sarawak , a population that has lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now reducing to a generation ago , and now reducing the rivers of the physical region the region the region the level of free , which seems to get out of the Borneo . And the Japanese , where you had the gotten orizonic mge , where the horizonte orizonte , and then ,
It filled the stives with the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that &apos;s coming with the discovery of gold .
If we move on Tibet of the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the wall of the research of political domination .
How you know the genocide , the physics of a population , is convicted at the universal level , but the enocide , the ethnic of the style of a population of the world , because it &apos;s not only condanted , but celebrated in the environment , because it makes part of the development .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of Tibet as much as you don &apos;t start .
I &apos;ve spent the 6,000 miles from China in the West China in the West China , through the South Tibet , coming in Lhasa with a young lines , but only came to Lhasa , I realized what &apos;s behind the statistics that we &apos;re hearing .
6,000 thousacred monuments that are reduced in policy and centers .
1.2 million people killed from the military Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascrited to Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed to the time of Chinese invasion .
Her , uncle was out with Sua Sant Sant during the diaspora that has brought the people in Nepal .
His mother was imprisoned and his cheaper was rich .
It was taken to hidden at the age of two nasde years , hide his grandmother , because he couldn &apos;t have lived in his grandmother .
The sister , who made the same , was , it was put in reeducation .
And one day , he got a day , he had been bested a fashion Mao , and for this transgression , was put in the forced works for seven years .
Tibet of Tibet can be insatic , but the redenter of the population is from tenpractical .
And then , it &apos;s all reduce a choice .
We want to live in the world world &apos;s world &apos;s a monoil or we want to collect the policromatical world of diversity ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before we die said that his biggest fear was that in our grew vision of the world , we won this vision of the world , we won this whole world &apos;s about a limited limitation of human imagination , but a day we &apos;re wake up from a sledg-up , but a day we &apos;ll wake up from a sledmental sleep , almost , we &apos;ll see it .
And it &apos;s umiliating that our species is existed for 600,000 years .
The Neolitics Revolution , which has given us the agriculture , which has done us to make us to the cult of seed , and replacing the poem with the next few of the cler , creating the hierarchy of specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world industrialized world has about 300 years .
The sharks that story sharks not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we &apos;re going to have to go in the millennia to come .
When these myridge cultures of the world , it &apos;s asked what it means to be human , respond with 10,000 different voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all rediscover the possibility of being what we are : a kind of consciousness , which has to be what all the people and all the garden . And there are great moments of these people and there are great moments .
I took this picture on the north of Baffin , when I went to the hundred of bales with the watching of the whales with Inuit , and this man , and this man , and this man , he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The Canadvice was not always ltile with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to stabilie our suprematise , we &apos;ve been involved in colonies .
The grandfather was going to get us .
The family , temptation for his life , and all the arms , and all his attractive , and all his attractioned .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t feel the cold , they explain .
The slices of the slites were made of the basic skin spaceship .
The grandfather had this man didn &apos;t fit out of the arctic note of arctic night .
It &apos;s been broke up , you got the skin , and it was howned in their hand . When I did the broke , and when I did the frow , they worked them , they worked them creating a light .
He sprayed out on the dots of this clue , and when he came out , and when he came out , he came up , he killed a dog .
Shit schools and created a bricy , with the Ataxide , and he made a slites , and it &apos;s imbriled another dog , and it &apos;s disappeared on the banchisa rock , and it &apos;s slightly clear in the rests .
We want to talk about cavarsely ?
In the 1999 , the Canadvice , the Canadvanced the total control of a largest area of California and Texas set .
It &apos;s their new patria . It &apos;s called Nunavak .
It &apos;s a independent territory . They contrict all the mineraries .
One splendid-example example of how a nation-state can recognize with his population .
And , finally , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious at least to who of us was in these remote zones of the planet , make it remote they &apos;re not real at the real act .
People , it &apos;s home .
They know the setions of the human imagination that are up the dy-round of the day . And for us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of of our children , become part of the geography .
Finally , we National Geographic Geographic , that political will never come to anything .
We believe that polemies --
&#91; Applausi &#93; : They &apos;re not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and perhaps we &apos;re the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month our site reves 35 million visit . Every month our site reves 35 million visit .
156 countries , they transmit our television canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal cangeries .
Our resulies are slabes of millions .
Our work is to travel in ethnosphere to bring our public in the audience of wonderful cultural watches , and hope , hopefully , hugly , hopefully , hopefully , the world of exists : the world of exists in the diversity , and we have to find a pluralistic world , and must be a pluralistic world and multicultural world and multural world to a places in a places of pluralistic world . And muralists and mystery ,
where the wisdom of all the people can contribute to our well-being .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope to recall other than I &apos;ve already heard and I &apos;ll try to evidence some connects .
I want to start with what I call the official dogm .
The official dogm of what ?
The official dogm of all the West industrial society . The dogma ures : &quot; If we want to massive the well-being of our citizens &quot; &quot; The way to do it is to massive the individual freedom . &quot;
The reason , from one side , in fact that freedom is in fact that freedom is in itself a value , it &apos;s precious , useful , for human beings .
As the other is that if we are free , each of us can act for their own to do everything that massive messes our well-being , no one that we name .
The way to massive freedom is massive to mate the choice .
The more choices are more free , and greater is their freedom , and the greater is their liberty ,
And that &apos;s so deeply radicated in society that nobody would dream of feed to put it in a society that would be able to put it in a doubt .
And it &apos;s also deeply deeply in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarketeting . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I allowed a simple note on the conditions for injection .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conduction , without conting the 10 variety of oil , and 12 acetes of oil , and 12 acetes that you can buy for a huge number of conduccile to the very surprison your rediments that nobody already is about 75 of your degrees .
Here &apos;s what the supermarketing .
Then you go to the electronic store to buy a stereo : case , leter , CD , radio , radio , radio , radio , radio ,
And in this single negotial negotiate , there &apos;s a great number of audio .
We can make six and a half million different combinations of combinations using the components that there are in a negotiate .
You have to admit that there &apos;s a lot of choice .
Oththers : the world of communications .
Once I was a child , you could get all the services of all the phone calls that were stream services , they were strong by a mom .
And it was born the phone , it didn &apos;t buy it .
A consequence of that , the phone was that the phone had never been shromed .
These time , they &apos;ve gone .
Now , we have a variety of phone phone , especially between the cellphones .
Here &apos;s the cellphone of the future .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , cut it &apos;s cut .
If you don &apos;t have seen it in the house , you &apos;re going to get it out of the house , you &apos;re going to do that .
And what happens is that the answer is that people come into the needed , and you know what &apos;s answer ? And the answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell that doesn &apos;t do too much things .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the bubs of bubbbought , you actually grew the same explosion of choices .
Assistence of health , it doesn &apos;t happen in the United States that you go to the doctor and doctor , you have to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor , you know , &quot; Okay , we could do it , or you have these benefits , &quot; A , &quot; Thanks and these goods . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Doctor , what should I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; At has these benefits , and these benefits , and these benefits . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebats , &quot; Doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; I &apos;m not her . &quot;
And we call it the basic autonomy of the malseeing , and expression that makes it seems a beautiful thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not that a marriage and responsibility to make decisions of someone who knows something , which is the doctor , someone else who doesn &apos;t know -- and so it &apos;s not about -- and so it &apos;s not in condition to make the patient condition to make patient decisions .
There &apos;s a huge marketing products of drugs , direct to people like me and you , who think about you don &apos;t have any sense , given we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why do they published them ?
The answer is that they want to ask , we call the doctor to change it .
Something that fundamental as our identity is hyentity , is a picture of choice , how you see in this jet . &quot; We don &apos;t want to force the children . They will be able to be right now , &quot; erited . We don &apos;t have to invent .
And we can reinvent how many times we have to get us .
which means that every morning , to the risk , you have to decide that kind of person wants to be .
I spoke at the family and marriage , a time perspective , a common , uncontemplate as much as possible , was that you could have the most soon as possible .
The only choice was with who , not when , and not even what to do after .
Ogyday , it &apos;s really to play .
I teach to very smart students , and I do do give them 20 percent in less than a time .
And they &apos;re not not smart because they &apos;re not not not smart because they &apos;re not not not a brilliant .
but because they &apos;re impensieritites , I mean , I &apos;m going to go , &quot; I would have to go to ? I should I do that now ? &quot;
&quot; I should be spositive to me more ? I think before children or career ? &quot;
They are interrogorant .
And they try to answer those questions , even though this implement , although this doesn &apos;t care the compassisive to my exactly .
And they really have to do it . They really have important questions .
Now , the job : We are lucky , like Carl underlying , because technology allows us to work every day , every day , from Hotel Randolph .
And I &apos;m talking about , there &apos;s a anglin , and I &apos;m not going to tell anyone where , WiFi works .
I don &apos;t have to use it , because I want to use it .
What does it mean , this incredible freedom of choice that we have to keep on work ? It &apos;s that we have to keep on every moment , if we have to work or not .
We can go to our child , and we can play our child , with the cell in a pocket , the Blackberry , and the night , typically , on the knees .
And even though they &apos;re all spend , every minute that we see our child , we also see our child , we also ask , we ask , &quot; Do I respond to this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have I respond to this email ? I have to hemail ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , &quot; that makes the experience of your child , very different than what would would be in other conditions .
So , from any part , we look , small things , small and big materials , and life , and life is a style of choices .
Once the world was this : Over , there were some possibilities , but it wasn &apos;t a whole thing .
The world of today is this : The dilemma is : &quot; Is it a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Some .
We know all know , we know all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the negative ones .
All this choice is two effects of these two effects of the people .
The first one , paradoxally , is that it &apos;s produced paralysis that liberation .
And many of the options between which choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I offer an example , the meaningful example : a study conduction .
And my college had access to the Vanguard data , the giant society of sources , with about a million climbers in 2000 different companies .
What she found out is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of adhesion , the percentage of adhesion ,
With 50 sources , there &apos;s 10 percent in less adhesions than when they &apos;re available to only five . Why do they do it ?
Because with 50 sources that picks up , and it &apos;s disease , it &apos;s hard-up , and the choice is remanded to the domorders .
And domorange , again domorders , domorders , domorders , of course , domorders , and of course , domorders , and of course , domorders , of course , domorders , and of course domorances , of course , domorders , and of course , domorders , of course , domorderly domories , and of course , domances
You know that it doesn &apos;t mean only that these old workers will eat cogs because they don &apos;t have enough money , they don &apos;t have enough money , it means that the decision is so obstic that they also lose the complementary of the trouble of work .
They &apos;re not participating , they &apos;re losing up to five dollars a year from the work , which would be going to be spending them .
So the paralysis a consequence of the hot .
And I think that &apos;s a world like this .
&quot; And finally , for the eternity : ketchup , you know , or maionese ? &quot;
You &apos;d like to make the right decision , if it &apos;s for eternity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and near the wrong conduction .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even though we can avoid the paralysis , and we &apos;re less satisfying out of how we would be with less options that we would have been with less options .
And that &apos;s for different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of condition between which you choose , if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could make a choice that would be better . And what happens is that the alternative imagines , and the repiece of the choice , and the record defit with a city , and the record of the decision , and the record of the decision , and the decision ,
even when it was a good decision .
The more choices , the more , it &apos;s easy to displaces anywhere who details is insoddle .
And , there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunities .
Dan Gilbert assignment that we &apos;re going to depend on what we do depends on what we do is .
As the rest , when there are many options , it &apos;s easy to represent the tools of alternative , and being less satifying than the option that is choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m not in New York City .
But that &apos;s what you probably would think .
There &apos;s this copy copy to Hamptons .
A place of lussied .
It &apos;s beavoring . Otttttype . It &apos;s all for them .
Nothing . But what he thinks is , what he thinks , is August . &quot;
&quot; All my nearly nearly to Manhattan are away . &quot;
&quot; I could talk about home . &quot;
And it goes to two weeks , assiled from the idea that &apos;s losing -- every day -- the possibility to go .
The costo-opportunities decrease for what we have , even when the choice was excellent .
And the more are the options that we have to consider , the more equivalent to attract as a constitute opportunities .
Here &apos;s another example .
This vision , gives us a lot of things .
It &apos;s about the time , and maybe of living slowly .
But the most important point is that whatever you chose , you chose to the other people don &apos;t do other .
The things that we don &apos;t choose have a lot of attractive attractive that can make less attractive tress that we do .
Third point : spiral growth of expectations .
I tried it on my skin buying a new jeans .
I remember almost always jeans .
Once jeans were one of the one kind of buying them and dress , they were switched , they were just later they were sitting them a lot of times , they were washing them a lot of times , they began to go well .
So I went to buy a couple of it , when the old ones were landers , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Would you like flew up floor , relaxy , relaxy , relaxy ? &quot;
They want to do them with the ground or bottons ? &quot; Stonewashed , &quot; or &quot; acidwashed ? &quot;
&quot; Would you want to be huge ? &quot;
&quot; Sow the basic voices or street ? &quot; He was a bble -- &quot; Continured to elency .
And I was a little bit , and after a while I was able to say , &quot; I want the guy that was the guy , &quot; I didn &apos;t have any idea what was , so for a hour , and then I got out of the store , and then I came out of the best jeans I &apos;ve ever had .
It was the maximum . I had got the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand that .
The reason I was worse is that with all that I was really the whole expectations were high , the jeans had to be perfect .
I began to be minime , I didn &apos;t expect anything about exceptional when there was only one of them , but when you saw 100 different steps , steps , at least a kind of perfect .
What I was busted was good , but not perfect .
After I talked to that chose what I was trying to do , I was trying to confront expectations .
The addition of people don &apos;t make that care that they &apos;re going to increase expectations that have respect to the eccellence .
And this will product less satisfying , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing if I realized .
Because if they knew that , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth looks more like this .
&quot; You had better when you were worse when you were worse . &quot; The reason they were better when you were worse , it was that when you were worse , it was still possible to meet surprises .
Oggiday , in the world where we live -- opulents , industrialized citizens with the perfection of perfection -- the maxpatterns that we can hope is that the things are in the height of expectations .
You never surprised because your expectations , my expectations , you &apos;ve never been a lot of expectations .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Basis expectations , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , you want . &quot;
I mean , a little moment , self-grade moment , and my wife is really study .
I couldn &apos;t have a better , I didn &apos;t have across .
But to be not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of buying a couple of jeans soul , when you &apos;re only that you &apos;re you wouldn &apos;t you satisfied , and say , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot; , the answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What would I do ?
When there are hundreds of types of jeans , and you buy a insodently , and you ask who is responsible , it &apos;s as clear that the responsible to you .
You &apos;d had to do better .
With hundreds of disponible variety , there are no screen for the insuccess .
So when people are decisions , even though the result is valid , they feel insodented and they give the crap to them .
In the last years , depression is exploss in the industrialized world .
I think a meaningful factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this wave of depression is that people have experiences of depression is that people have experiences because the standards are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation they think that the colpath is them .
So the final result is that in general , we &apos;re better , objectively , but we hear worse .
Let me remember .
This is the official dogm , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely fake . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than they have to have that , but it doesn &apos;t want to have a lot of choice .
There &apos;s a critical value , magical . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m really pretty sure we &apos;ve been surgery by a piece of level where the choices choices are .
Now , from political point of view -- I finished -- from political point , the nocle is .
What allows all this choice in the society is the material wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know about it , where the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is they have too much poulder .
So the factory that I &apos;m talking about is a malbeing a malbeing malbeing malbeing in the West , recidental recognizes .
And what it does deprove and arrage is this : Steve Levitt has talked about how those expensive and sthemselves , and unbledyers for library . It &apos;s a waste of money .
I mean these choices , complicated and dispendependent , it &apos;s not that they &apos;re just useful .
I &apos;m going to be a deleteries .
They do . They do things worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows a little choice was revered in those where people have too few possibilities , it would not be better life , it wouldn &apos;t be better life , but also our own .
This is what economists call a paretian ethan .
A redistribution of the regibution is good for everybody -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in excess excess that goes us .
To conclude , you can become everything you want to be what you want --
You , people of culture , you think , &quot; What do you believe that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t make anything anything in a glass of glass . &quot;
&quot; An imagination , a limited view of the world -- &quot;
