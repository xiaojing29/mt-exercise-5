The year I showed these slide to demonstrate that the cotta calculation , which is almost three million years , and for almost three million years , has the size of 48 percent .
But this is a lot of the gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the spessor of the ice .
The arten typical glacial is , in a sense , the health of global climate system .
It &apos;s winter and it &apos;s ritiical and it &apos;s ritizens .
The next slide is going to be a re-related foundary for the last 25 years .
The ice loss are signed in red .
As you see , they expand until the blue wish .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter , which is the glasses .
You can see that the ice cosidly , five years or more , five years , it &apos;s like the blood , which is the blood , which is that there &apos;s a body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s so , in 25 years .
This is a problem because the interested in the entire glacy of the arten , where there are enormous amount of conged , where there are huge amount of conged , and they &apos;re turning into metane from the microbes .
Read to the totality of the atmospheric inquantity , that quantity could rading , that amount of the totality , super-right-right-back .
In some laghi , in some deep Alaska methane is already rebecting from the water .
The professor Katey Walter in the University of Alaska team literally with a team lake labor .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Lake &apos;s good . The question is if we &apos;re going to be .
A reason that this is that this termal scale the Greenland from the north .
This is a glacial queen .
The brought had never reached free .
This is the Kangerlusual Kangerlush in the south-west in the South of Greenland .
If you want to know how to the sea level of the sea of the glasses on the way , here is where you can get the sea .
These corrents are increasing rapidly .
Another part of the planet : Antarctart , the biggest block of the planet .
The month scientists have died cleared that the ice of the ice is in the negative , and that the Antartarctis , and that the Antartartis , particularly quarly quarter in the science .
Equires six feet of the actual level , like Greenland .
Sull Himalaya , the third biggest block , you see new laghi , that a few years ago , which a few years ago , they were glacier .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population recognizing water from that he &apos;s powerful water from that he &apos;s leaves .
Sulle Ands : this glacier is the source of the water power of this city .
The led is increased .
But when you dimining , the same accept to water .
In California , the nnow is about 40 percent .
The hyrices are in the crisis .
The predictions , as you have read , they &apos;re favorable .
The growth of the world &apos;s sure for a remarkable increase in the world &apos;s inherself .
The environmental disaster are increasing to a rhythm out of normal and without previous .
Four times more numerous in the last 30 years , I &apos;ve been realized for 75 .
This is a whole sustainable to all sustainable .
If you look in the storic context , if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of tons in the oceans every day .
Look at the time of the Pacific Pacific , by Americans , to the American , and on the West , and on the subcontinent , where there &apos;s a radical impact of oxygen in the oceans .
Most of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the 20 percent , is the use of fossil of fossil .
The oil is a problem , and the charcoal is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with the China .
And he was proposed to build a lot of other centers .
But we &apos;re seeing a change of direction .
These are the annulled in the last years and some of the world , and some of the verge veras alternatives .
Every , there &apos;s a lotta politics in our country .
The industries of the carbon and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting the carbon , which is a host , which is a host .
And that picture me me something --
Natal , in Tennessee , where I live , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion lbox .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the second biggest of scories in America .
It &apos;s happening around Natal .
The published published of one of the industries was this .
Video : I &apos;m going to be the carbon , and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it &apos;s growing our economy .
Fross the carbon is more and more and more pulightly .
It &apos;s good price , it &apos;s good , adorable and work work in the stipendium .
Al Gore : From here , in the West Virginia .
The biggest society in the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his frightening .
Video : Don Blankens : Sarry Al Gore , Nancy Pelosis , Harry Reid -- don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Protetion of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is a part of them .
Video : Ator : Ator , we see the climate change as a minute sery of the deal .
So , our priority is to invest a great amount of money in a public boundary to make public and confuses the trity on the carbon the carbon .
In fact , the carbon doesn &apos;t sport .
We think it &apos;s clean -- it also has a good profumb .
So , not preoctation of climate change .
Let me do .
Video : Ator : Carbone , you &apos;ve heard a lot of them .
So let &apos;s give you a turn in a structure to the advance of the basic carbon .
Straditional . The machines are a little bit , but this is the sound of the clear technology .
The carbon of carbon is between the car causes of global warming , but the notion of the carbon is that you see change everything .
Do a look : this is the technology of the clear clear .
Al Gore : Inally , the positive positive to economic this economic issues to the economic issues of national security .
Video : My America is in crisis ; the economy , the national economy , the national crisis .
The phils that the game all : our dependence from fossil beautiful , like the heads and oil .
Now , there &apos;s a new solution for it .
Really , 100 percent of the full , in 10 years .
A plan to remove the work , to make more sure , and help to stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that &apos;s solution to solve our problems .
Really power . She &apos;s reading more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It &apos;s about to reducing energy to America .
One of the fastest ways of bring to bring up the beautiful dependence from our planet .
She &apos;s like the future is here . I &apos;m winning , a new energy .
It &apos;s a number of two : Novi investment for places of the basic job .
I &apos;m going to be realists . It &apos;s time to be realists .
Al Gore : A proverwhelming African saying , &quot; If you want to go faster , you go to the sun ,
If you want to go away , go together . &quot;
We have to go away , very quickly .
Thank you very much .
The year at TED year I did a laughter on the LHC .
And I promise to go back to the return to you about how the machine .
So there was a lot of circle . And for that the other time there were no , the LHC is is the largest experiment , 27 kilometers of circonference .
His compit is to receiver the conditions that were present less than a billion second from the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
So , this is just cool .
This is the machine under Gineveness .
We picture these mini-Bang Bang in the research .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- it &apos;s a 44 meters and it &apos;s a 22 feet .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in buildings so you can see the proportions .
The 10 section of the last year we have accested the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was cause of immense immense in control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first particles that had all the time in LHC , in the collision , with a collision , with a part of the HC , and it &apos;s a part of the HC , and it &apos;s very hard in the resevator .
In other words , when we see that picture the 10 secember , we can actually realize that the machine works , the machine worked , which is a great vitting .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to make us exultent more than this , when somebody on Google and the page was this .
What means we &apos;ve had a cultural impact cultural impact to the scientific .
About a week after , there was a problem with the machine , and it had to these films here -- these phils .
These phils are taking 13,000 ampounds when the machine works in the massive .
Now , the technical technical in you and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . &quot; I &apos;m too good . &quot;
And they can do it because when they &apos;re very cold to be a superconducts .
So , at least 271 degrees , to a temperature to that delight-standing the stage of the stars , these phils can take that run .
In one of the younger novemior in the LHC , there was a fest of the LHC , there was a fest of the gap .
So the phils sy saying , and the 13,000 ampounds , and the 13,000 ampounds improvide a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressioning if you think these magnets are more than 20 tons , and that &apos;s moving about 30 feet , and that &apos;s moved about 30 centimeters .
They &apos;re damnetes about 50 magnets .
We had to take them , what we did .
We repristinated them and travel .
Now they &apos;re coming back to all the sub-place .
By the end of marzo , the LHC will be again .
We &apos;re going to happy it , and we expect to get the data , and we &apos;re going to get our adventure to discover which are the morning to discover which are the morning .
Now , of course , in a certain a way , these involves the dibate on the value of science and engineering in frontier . It &apos;s easy to the frontier .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that I think it &apos;s the value of things like LHC .
I would like to end with the words of a Inglese scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , imagine , in the defense of his bael , his bats , his bath , his bath bleael , said , &quot; Nothing is so the the way of the human mind that the remote of the human mind that the ideas of the human mind that the ideas of science that the ideas of the science of the human mind that is that our own own , and that the world ,
Thank you .
I want to start wonder to rethink about when , from children , ploy , you please clock .
Whereas you &apos;re going to reach them , and take them , take them and move them , learned to actually think and solve problems , and you know , to think about space and solve problems .
The reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand a way of the world around us .
So , from the usual information of our interaction with objects , with my own Patts , and my collaborator , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to wonder , I started to wonder , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of having the digital mouse that &apos;s moving a digital , we could have a desktop with the central information , we could actually have a information with the manify ,
and systems to our placement ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , by building the answer , by buildings .
In a few words , a Siftable , it &apos;s a very big computer interactive computer .
In a few words , a Siftable , it &apos;s a very big computer interactive computer .
You can move them with the hand , they can see , &quot; I can see , &quot; I can see it , and they have a screen and a radio .
But on the top , they &apos;re physicists , as the morning , you can move them .
The Siftable is an example of a new ecosystema new ecosystems to manipulate the digital information .
And as they get more physical , knowledge of the other , of the other people , and as as well as well as the physical , to the other people , as we can explore new physical , we can explore new stils and fun fun systems of interaction .
I &apos;m going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configurated to show you the video : if I incline it in a direction , the video , it will rotate it so , if you cline from the other back back .
These retroduced , they &apos;re conscious to other .
If I &apos;m like them , they &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re around .
If they come circonditions , they notice and they can act a little bit .
If they come circonditions , they notice and they can act a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the potential to use communals , to example , &quot; a color as if it was a liquid color as if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable , as a center of the versity , and I can use them to versing color in the central , where they &apos;re missing .
and I can use them to train the color in that central , where they misquiet .
If we &apos;re too , we can actually , we can put a little place .
I also &apos;m beautiful possibility of appears , like languages , mathematics and games of logic and games of logic , and see it &apos;s about immediately .
Now I &apos;m --
This is a sequence of Fibonacross that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a game of words that &apos;s half between Scarabeum and Boggle .
Pratically , every turn on every Siftable on , in a case on every Siftable , to every turn on a literal in case , and you know , you know , and you &apos;re trying to fight with a diontone-on-a-one-on-a-on-once .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new set of letters and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s what the children came to the Media Lab , I did it in a way that they tried them and gave a video .
They &apos;re very high very ,
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of education .
You have to say , &quot; Mush of words , and they know what to do .
Here &apos;s what other people who try it .
This is our younger tester testing , there on the right .
It actually just wanted to implement them .
They were only morning , for him .
Now , this is an interactive application of a interactive cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool for the aper appeared in Lui is Felix .
It can inserious characters in the scene , solid Siftable .
It can inserious characters in the scene , solid Siftable .
Here , it &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : The sun is surprised .
David Merriled : Now he brought a treater in the scene .
Video : The arange tree .
By work ! Yes !
So schooling Siftable and put them close to the characters --
Video : Bau !
To their story .
Video : I &apos;m like .
DM : It &apos;s a story with final opened , and it can decide him as it &apos;s fly .
DM : It &apos;s a story with final opened , and it can decide him as it &apos;s fly .
Video : Vola on ,
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , realized recently , to watch and exeguy .
It &apos;s a recently , recently recently , to watch and exeguy .
The Siftable here is against sound as base , base and the bacteria .
Every one of these has four different variations , and you can choose .
You can also also also , you can also insert these sounds in a sequence to your focus .
And modificate it just putting a &quot; sound &quot; and a sequence . &quot;
These are effects that you can control from the vive , like the reverse and the filter .
I would be in a particular sound and then inclines to the way .
And then there are general effects like time and volume , that they just just to the interests .
Let &apos;s look like it works .
Video : DM : We &apos;re going to start paying a base in two Siftable , &quot; sequence , we &apos;re extend , we add to the other base .
Now , a base line of the base .
Video : Now add of percussions --
Video : And I &apos;m going to put the phily to the bacteria , so I can control the effect from the vive .
Video : I can speak the entire sequence inking the entire sequence from a side or the other .
Video : And now I &apos;ll add the philer to the best phillion .
Video : DM : I can recognize the sequence &quot; to the fly . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to playing it before , but I can suddenly , it &apos;s going to be a longer or the more coral .
And now , finally , I can smooth the entire sequence inking the Siftable , &quot; volume . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is built new man , and more more and more like the works like the brain and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the result of this lost , and also some possibilities that we &apos;re trying to bring out from the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that &apos;s coming back to this new generation of objects to interact with digital media , that will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the hour of you .
I &apos;m a writer .
It &apos;s my profession is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the fass of my life .
And I don &apos;t expect that can change .
But , said , something particular happened recently in my life and in my career , who bring me to recently the entire relationship with this work .
The particular thing is I recently wrote this book , this biography called &quot; Mang , Prua , Prua , Ama , &quot; which , very , very , for some reason , for some reason that the world and becoming a great , became a great , bathlester .
And the result is that everywhere goes , people treat me as if they were condanned .
It &apos;s condannated , condanned , condanned !
They &apos;re all going to be worried and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t have to do you couldn &apos;t do you can &apos;t do anymore ?
You have no fear to continue to continue to writing all of life without being able to create a book that can important to someone ? &quot;
What can you important to somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s rasses , you know .
But I could go worse , part of the I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was a writing -- I was a writing -- I wanted to be a written .
I was in the same reaction .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t themselves to have success ?
Don &apos;t you fear that the humiliation of the refer ?
You have no fear of doing this all all of life without you have ever been out and died on a cumule of all infrankers with the bought to love cumule ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I have a couple of all those things .
I &apos;ve always had fear .
And I also have a lot of other things that people could not be involved .
As the algap and other things .
But , as I &apos;m going to write what I thought and I was wonder is why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logic that anyone has been waiting to be spavented by a work that &apos;s high herself to do .
But what &apos;s about so particular in the impressing creative to make us nervous about health health is to the mental health , in a way that other carrier do they do it ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemistry and not recury about a sunce in his 40 years of activity in his 40 years of activity in which he was wondered to be engineer ?
There was never -- that &apos;s the block of the engineer John , how does it ?
Don &apos;t work that , capital ?
Onestly , chemicals like group have not certainly , in the centuries , in the centuries of being alcolized , depressive manized manized manishing .
We have a writers , we have a really really , and not only writers , but creative of all genes , we have this reputation of being enormous instasible mentally .
And it &apos;s not about the other that you look at the contains of the magnifies that , only in the windownload , just in the writing of young people and often to them .
And the ones that don &apos;t have suicidated to be really disciples from their dons .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , &quot; Every book killed me a little bit of a little bit more . &quot; A extraordinary region the work of their life .
But we don &apos;t bad it , when we heard these things so much that we &apos;ve heard these things that we &apos;ve completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and the suffering and the suffering and the car , it &apos;s going to conduce the corner .
And the question I want to take all over today is : Do you &apos;re agree with this idea ?
I &apos;m going to you to be this thing -- because it also looks like a half distance to me , not really well for anything .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I also think it &apos;s perforeculian , and I don &apos;t want to see it lost in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encouraging our big minds to live .
And I &apos;m sure that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start figing towards that heard of suppositions , surprised the circumstances that are in my career .
That &apos;s really -- I &apos;m a young of young , I &apos;ve about 40 years .
I have about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that whatever writing about the world as the work that &apos;s used to be a job that was that after the spaventer of my last book .
I &apos;m going to be wonder , because we &apos;re all more or less friends here -- is likely that my biggest success is to my high .
Oh , Gesus , who think !
You know this is the kind of thinking that &apos;s the kind of thinking that &apos;s a person to start bing in the middle of the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would keep going to keep this work we do this work .
So , the question becomes , how do you do ?
And so it seems , after a lot of reflective reflective , that the way to continue is to create a psychological costruck , okay ?
I had to find a security of security between me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxium anxyges that wrote can get . And I was looking for all the year , I started to watch up with the year , trying to find out of time , trying to find some of the best and more healthy than than the best and more healthy than than healthy and more healthy than and more healthy than a . And I &apos;m writing to some of the best and the most people and more and more sites and more and
about how to help people to make the emotional inerents risk of creativity .
And that research has taken me to the ancient Green and ancient Rome .
Seguitems because I &apos;m in circle and then back .
Nelantics and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity is sell to the creativity to the man , OK ?
It thought that creativity was this spirit of divine and that came to a vine and that &apos;s known to a few people , and known , for distant reasons and known , for distant and knowledge .
The greatly called these vines of creativity of creativity .
Soy , wonderful , credeeper , credeal to have a demone that was wisdom .
Romans were the same idea , but they called the kind of spirit , but they had a genius .
which is great , because the Romans didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly smart .
They would have that a genius was this kind of divina that has been created of a divina , in the wuri of a study , a little bit , a little bit like Dobby , and that came out to the work of the needs of the artist and model , and that &apos;s moon , and moon the work .
Here &apos;s the distance of what I &apos;m talking about -- that &apos;s the distance of which I &apos;m talking about -- that psychological that you have to protect you from your work .
And everybody knew that worked , right ?
So the anticient artists were protected by some things , like the too narcism , right ?
If your work was exciting , it was exciting , you could not take it all the market , everyone key helped by this kind of incorporate .
If your work work , it wasn &apos;t all all of the color , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a incapable .
And so people have been concept to the creativity in the West for a long time .
Then the Rind came and all changed , and I was born this great idea ; we put it human being in the universe , and we put it to the universe and without literally leaving the creatures and without literally leaving from divinity .
This was the principle of rational humanity and people began to think that creativity is completely to think that creativity is completely .
And for the first time in history , you started to reference this or the first artist as a rather than a person with a person .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big error .
I think that allow someone , a simple person to believe that that I &apos;m like a recipient , the essence and the kind of all the beings , and the kind of creative divines , unknowledge and ethering to the psychquickly as a very big philty to the basic human .
It &apos;s like to ask someone to income the sun .
And it &apos;s a shape and creates all of these expectations about performance .
And I think it &apos;s this pression to destroyed the artists in the past 500 years .
And , if that &apos;s true , and I think it &apos;s the question is , and now ?
Can we can do it different ?
Maybe you can go back to a more ancient comprehensing human relationship .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t sing 500 years of rational thinking about a rational rational talk about 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people between the audience that &apos;s just about the basic sustained in the notion of , you know , they follow people to be watched by their projects .
I &apos;m not going to be convince you all about this .
But the question I would like to ask is -- why not ?
Why don &apos;t I think that way ?
Because it has more sense of all other thing that has ever heard to explain the exaspering exaspering the dedicbility of creative process .
A process that , as everyone who ever ever ever been excited to do something -- so , I mean , everyone here -- it &apos;s not a rationally .
And in fact , it can sometimes seemed to be completely paranormal .
I did this meeting with the extraordinary poeter , Ruth Stone , who now 90 years , but it was a very poetic for all of life and said me that during his childhood in the Virginia , working out in the Virginia , and feel that was in the welds , and he heard , and he heard , in the welse .
He said that he was like a fragorous air .
And that was rolating towards of the landscape .
It was going to be , because he was tremendous to his feet .
She knew to have a solid thing to that point and it was , words , &quot; run like a matta . &quot;
And so it turns out to the home and he was walking up with this poem , and it would not have to take a piece of a faster and a faster math it , and a faster it on the page .
Sometimes it could not be fast , so correct and correct reverse , and the roler weleless and the poem wered the poem and she would continued to rolate through the landscape , and he would continued to rolate through the landscape , as he said , &quot; one other poetry . &quot;
Then there were times -- this piece of the piece , I &apos;m going to be -- there were some moments that was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was looking for the card and the poetry was going through , and he was walking a math in the way that he was going , and then he said , that it was like the gap with the other hand the watching .
He was the poem of the cade of the tail and he put in his body and he was writing on the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page and intatta , but in the last word .
So when I heard it -- it &apos;s really cool , it &apos;s exactly the same creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conducture .
I &apos;m a move , and my way to work is ; I &apos;m wake , and I &apos;m wake up and work and work and then to work and go on the watch on the watch .
But I &apos;m in my testate testlic , I &apos;ve been strisciated against that thing , sometimes .
And I also imagine that many of you the han done .
You know , even if the work and the ideas came to a certain source of the source I could not be honestly known it .
And what is this ?
And how can we relationship us to do it , but , rather , rather , what does it remains it ?
And as I &apos;m about , the best example I have is the Musicy-contemporary , which I &apos;ve been interviewed for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of the life has been the incarnation of the artist of the artist , to try , trying to control , to connect these species of control , dominate these species of the totally interested .
But then he invested , and a day as he was driving on a day as he was driving on a Los Angeles , changed everything .
He was wondering and all of a kind of a well-like , wonderful , which is wonderful , that it &apos;s wonderful , elusive and head , and the head , and the head , and the variety , and the desidery , but not known as to take it .
It has no piece of card , it has no matter , it has no record .
So he starts to feel this sort of old old old old old old old , &quot; I &apos;m losing to the lost , and I &apos;m hossessionate by this characters .
I &apos;m not good enough , I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of walking in the panic , he stopped .
He gets the whole mental process and did something completely new .
And what did I just watching the sky and said , &quot; Scususes , not see that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; What does seems to write a song now ?
If you really want to exist , I &apos;m going to be a more when I can take me care of you .
Altriments , you &apos;re going to important something else today .
You know about Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his process works changed after this .
Not the work , the work was still hoscure as always .
But the process , and the weighing it was retaking it was retaken when the genius , the genius that was taking nothing else and liberated it was re-re-up , and it liberated it back to where it came to the back , realizing that didn &apos;t have to be a interior and formented .
but it was a peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this lost thing that it was not Tom .
So how much I &apos;m working to change a little bit of the way I was working , and he already saved me and saved once .
This idea , I was saved when I writing , &quot; Mang , Prua , Ama , &quot; and fall in one of those cave the deperation that we all have when we &apos;re working on something and think that &apos;s going to think that it &apos;s going to be a disaster , which is the worst book or ever wrote .
Not just book , just the worst book .
And I started thinking about to make this project .
But then I remember Tom who talked to the air and I tried to the air and I tried us .
So I &apos;m going to go down on the manoscritish and I &apos;ve got my hit to a rowd of the room .
And I said , &quot; You know , &quot; You know , what , we &apos;re both , both , what we know if this book is not going to be very strong , not wonder , right ?
Because as I &apos;m looking at all I &apos;m going to put everything I have , I don &apos;t have more than that I ,
So if you want to be better , you have to be better , and you have your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , you don &apos;t do it .
I &apos;ll start to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I would like to do that it was recorded to do I &apos;m presented to do my part of &quot; because it &apos;s -- at the end of the North Africa &apos;s deserts of the North Africa of North Africa &apos;s wondering to the watch of the wonder of the watch , and until hours that they went on for and hours .
And they were always magnific , because the balls were professionals and were fantastic .
But every very , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists had been actually transcending it .
And I know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know you &apos;ve all all been in a certain point , a performance so .
It was like the time you stop , and the walking walking through a kind of landing and wasn &apos;t doing anything from the sun , like 1,000 nights before , but all the time , it was all winning .
And in suddenly , I don &apos;t apparently like a human .
But it &apos;s happening from the divinside and soul of divinity .
And when this happened , you know , the people knew what was , they called it with her name .
They were congioned to sing , and they started to sing , &quot; Allah , God , Allah , God , God , God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curious storytelling -- when More invasian investigation , I present this habits with them and pronounounnot change in the centuries of the Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , Elah , &quot; to &quot; Okay , &quot; , which you can still hear in the flamena .
In Spain , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , the magnifictional , Allah , magnific , I can understand , etary , etary , etary , etc , a God .
And it &apos;s great because we need .
But , the problem comes back , the problem comes in the day , to the same , when you wake and discovery that are the 11 in the morning of Martedicians and I &apos;m going to be the 11 in God , there &apos;s no longer .
It &apos;s just a mortal with a ginocy myy , and maybe not to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the tree .
And maybe no one of God still while I &apos;m going to be a rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most sweet to make a creative life .
But maybe not to be so angled to be so angosciciples , white , which is the most extraordinary expect , which the most extraordinary expect ,
But I just think you &apos;re just going to be a data that &apos;s inimaginable to a source of this squisite part of your life that you have to go to something else when you got to something else when you got to go to something else when you got to come .
And , you know , if we think that all changes .
And so I started thinking about , and it &apos;s sure as I thought I was in a different months in the worky of the book that I &apos;m going to stand , that I &apos;m going to be a very success .
And what I &apos;m going to keep when I feel electried to say , I &apos;m not fear .
Don &apos;t wonder . It &apos;s not just your work .
It &apos;s just to presenting you for your part , whatever you can be .
If your work is balance , ball .
If the wine , I &apos;m saying a game to leave you decide to leave some kind of wonderful wonderful , for a moment through your forcing , then you go through your forcing , then &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Altriments , you know , you &apos;re your dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot;
I think it &apos;s taking to teach it .
&quot; Himself ! &quot; to you , even for the same , even for human-later , and testing table to be you &apos;re going to be presenting you to deal with it .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : June !
As you know about some of these projects about some of these things about human genome , what can meaning and discovery of genes .
We &apos;re now starting a new way : we started to digitalize biology and now to speak from that digital code we &apos;re both in a new biology , designing and synthesizing and synthesizing life .
We always tried to bring great questions .
&quot; What &apos;s life ? &quot; Is it something that many biologists I think they &apos;re tented to figure out to various lively .
We &apos;ve tried different approaches , reducing the minimes .
We &apos;re digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome is to pass from the world of the digital world of the digital world of the digital world .
Now , we can we can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome of those that can autorog in lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome to create a more smaller .
We &apos;re able to eliminate a hundred of genes about 500 that are here .
But when we &apos;re looking at his metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple , it &apos;s relatively to our .
I think I &apos;m just a simple .
But when we &apos;re looking at all the genes that we can eliminate , once it &apos;s very likely that this can take to a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to be synthesize this croma , to be able to be able to modify the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of the &quot; Can we can synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Can the chemistry to produce these big molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create before now ?
And in case , we can make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemistry .
The speed that we can digitalize life is growing up to the life is growing in the exponential .
Our capacity to write the genetic code , instead , rather lently , but it &apos;s improving better .
And our most recent retains the bringing on a exponential curve .
We &apos;ve started more than 15 years ago .
The process has been requires , in a lot of pass , starting with a bioethics before the first experiments .
But we discovered that DNA DNA is very difficult .
There are deces of thousands of the world that produces small segments in DNA , the longer of 30 to 50 letters and it &apos;s a process : the most errors is a long , more run , more herrors there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assembly these fragments and correctly to the herrors .
And this is our first tenty , to start to go from digital information of the genome of Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills kills .
We &apos;ve designed the fragments , actually , the correction of the errors and optened a molecule of DNA .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemistry , and we &apos;ve inert it in the bacteria , the bacteria , the bacteria , the bacteria , and to produce this genetic code and producing the viral particles .
The viral particles are then you standing from the cells , they &apos;re back back and they destroyed the Evi .
I talked about recently with members of oil industry , and they have certainly compress this model .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build the software in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the biggest things .
We wanted to build the whole chromosome of the bacterium .
They &apos;re more than 580 mount letters of genetic code .
So we thought we built it in the size of the viruses , so that we can change the casses to understand what the casses of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accurateties was a herror for every 10 mile .
We &apos;ve discovered , 30 errors . If we used that , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence , we &apos;ve ever been able to do that work .
One of the process is designing segments a long way that you have to be healthy with all other segments to build a little bit of 50 letters to build smaller subjects working together .
We can see unclear elements here .
You &apos;ve got a read bed that we have a broken bably a flift-grain .
Think about that : we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , C , Good and T.
Three of those letters together , and there &apos;s about 20 amminacids , and there &apos;s a specific re-leting order to every ammind .
So we can use genetic code to write words , framework , spensive .
What we &apos;ve done in the beginning is to autographic .
Some of them were deluses that it wasn &apos;t been poem .
We &apos;ve designed these segments to simply them to just engage them .
There are an enzymes that they reped them .
And we started to assembly assembly , starting with segments from five to seven to seven move in a way to form to form to form to form of 24 ments a letters of them to be at 72 mile .
We have all past these segments in abundance so we could sequency them , we &apos;re trying to create a very robust process of creating a very robust -- like you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re looking for to automatize the process .
So , this seems to be the tabellone of a basket basic play-bag .
When we get to these very long segments , more than 100 mila , more than 100 mila , they &apos;re not going to be more directly in E.
It &apos;s coming to the limits of the modern modern tools of molecular biology .
So we &apos;ve consider other mechanisms .
We had another mechanism called a recognizes , which in biology is going to repair DNA to repair DNA to repair the DNA degree to bring the segments .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinocus radiod-diod-rad , can absorbing three million rad of radiation .
You can see in the fast required as a cromosome as his chomosome .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s been been before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be completely .
They can live under the vacuum .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life in space , and you &apos;re places to find new environment of water .
Actually , NASA showed that this has been .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built these processed processed , just using the lievidence with the design appropriate segments to inserious .
The lievening them to automatically .
This picture was not taken with a electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a very big molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that they cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the publishing we &apos;ve done a little bit ago .
They &apos;re 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the biggest molecule of a definitely define by man .
It has a lot of a lot of a lot of a 300 million .
If we &apos;re going to be a tool with a 10 without spaces , it would like 142 page just to turn this genetic code .
Now , how do we work it ? How do we activity ?
Of course , you know , you &apos;re a game from kids .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when they use the bacteria .
It &apos;s simplest when it &apos;s about the mile cells as our : You can just just extreme nucleo the nucleo and inserious one other , which is practice , which is practice .
In the archaea of the chromosome is integrated integrated in the cells , but we just demonstrated that we &apos;re able to do a complete cromosome to one of a cromosome to one another and activity .
We have got a chromosome chome from a microbial species .
The two are different as the men from the topes .
We add some gene in a way to decide what I could decide that choose for this croma .
It &apos;s then it science with the scientims in a way to kill all proteins .
And when we put it in the cells was studying -- and you appreciate our soopen-fisticatoften graph -- the new croma is going to the cells .
And we were thinking that we couldn &apos;t go to beyond , but we tried to spush more in there .
This is one of the most mecchanisms of evolution .
We discovered that many species have added a second or a third or a third of a second , adding in a thousand new new new ones of new new new ones of the species .
So who thinks about evolution as a just gene as a kind of modified has no further than biology .
There are the scientist called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The restriition that admonstrikes the DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell of it doesn &apos;t have a cell .
The cell phone that we have inseritous cellphone that we have inseritous .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognize the other croms like extraneous material , and we found it , and we found with just cell and the new chromosome and the new chromosome .
it &apos;s became blue causes we &apos;ve inserted .
And in a short of time , all the characteristics of a species , and it turned out of all in a new kind of a new kind of software that we inserted in the cell .
All the proteins are changed , membrane , and when we reach the genetics code , and when we reach it .
Now , this might seems to genetics , but altering the software DNA software , we can change things in the way .
Now , I &apos;ve been explained that here is not talking about genesis -- but to progress from three million years and a half million years of evolution , and I &apos;ve already said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion that digital process .
Why do this ?
I think it &apos;s enough to be obvious when we think about our necessity .
We &apos;re going to past six billion people to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to give you an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each other existing in 1946 , there are four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find fresh fresh fresh , medicinal and pull , medicinal and a half of people .
It &apos;s going to be more dare to do it for nine billion .
We &apos;re going to start five billion carbon , more than 30 billion barrel , more than 30 billion barils .
That means million barili barili a day .
When we try to find biological processing , or whatever you have to replaces to replaces them , it &apos;s a huge challenge .
We have to be concerned about all the CO2 , from these materials that finds in the atmosphere .
At the day of today , thanks to the scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the design design for the future .
The electronics can only have a dozen dozen about components , and think about how many different things are coming out .
Our limits here are mainly from the biological reality and our imagination .
We now have techniques , thank you , because of these synthesization , in degrees , in degrees , in the way we call combinatory .
We can build a big robots that can produce a million croms that can produce a million croms a day .
Think about this 20 million genes of different genes or to try to get a very good time , or to make a lot of the processing processes , new vaccines , we can change , thank you , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for possibility of survival , chemistry or whether it &apos;s a chemistry , and a vaccines of eetc .
This is an instantly instantly instantly instantly , we &apos;re working for being able to be able to sit the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know , we need to be .
We know exactly what is their genetic code .
We &apos;re now focus on the carbons of how much generation .
You &apos;ve also seen you to extract ethanol from the grain of the grain was a very finished .
We have a second and third generation that will use enough to be a fairs of the higher , as the open-value as the open-value as the open-to-butan-to-butanal .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact with without increase without increase in the cost of food and limiting the disponbility would be to transform CO2 in the first , which we &apos;re working to design cell the first , and we think we can work to design this scale , and we think we could have the first carbon how much generation in about 18 months .
The solar solar sunlight with CO2 is a metodownload -- but in our discovery in the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , about 2500 feet of deeply deep the temperature of the water .
It &apos;s in CO2 using the CO2 by using mydrogen as as the source of energy .
We &apos;re looking for understanding if we can incanalate CO2 , which can be fly be transported by the CO2 , which can be that CO2 in carbon , to drive this process .
So we think that we could be able to increase to increase to increase what the question is , &quot; that &apos;s life , &quot; We have the base of life is Noes , we have the foot , we have the foot industry to replacing the entire oil industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can you do ?
It would be a main the source of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working to use the same metods to create vaccines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with influence , we &apos;re always forward to a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s the right wine .
I think what you can change build vaccines in anticipated vaccines .
Here &apos;s how the future could start to be changing , the tree , account of evolution , accelerating the evolution with synthetic bacteria , and then finally cells .
We &apos;re so much from the improving people .
Our purpose is to make a long enough to try to try to make it . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show , the most quickly possible , some fundamental work , of new technology that we brought to the Microsoft in the following in the following in the following in the way . This is Seadon .
It &apos;s a environment that you can interact with a local amount of visual data that remote with a huge amount of visual data .
Here we &apos;re seeing a lot of digital pictures with a kind of digital , with a kind of digital , and I continue , to a slide , dispond sweet , dispond sweet , dispone-of-cost , and I continue , to be .
And it &apos;s not import how big the amount of information that we see , how big these colraces of data or images .
Most of digital photographs , but this is a scanning scanning , but this is a provening scanning , and it &apos;s in the gama of 300 megapiel .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that &apos;s the one thing that limits the number of a system like this is the number of floor in your screen . It &apos;s also an architecture . It &apos;s also a very flexel .
This is a whole book , you know , of the data doesn &apos;t images .
This is the Casolate of Dickens . Every colonnavery , a capital .
And to show you that &apos;s about it , and not images , we can do something like this , to see a really , to see that it &apos;s a real representation of a representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a electronic book .
I don &apos;t think that .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s a number of the Guardian .
Every big images is the beginning of a seeing .
And it really gives you the please and beauty of a landscape of a newspaper of a daily revision of a daily signing , which is for nature a lot of medium .
We also made something with the corner of this number of this particular number of the Guardian .
We &apos;ve created a fasull the high-resolures -- much more than that you use in a publisher than that it uses in a publishing normal content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific specific .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space .
We hopefully that means to put the pop-up , and other challenges like , they should not be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this camp , I don &apos;t want to lose time , if we have contributed to date in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. .
So now we pass to something else .
This is actually actually from the Web , you can go to the website .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which is two different technologies .
A is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting research in the computer very interesting computer that was in Noah Snavely , a student in the University of Washington , with the U.S. S. Seliski and Rick Seliski &apos;s Rick Seliski . It &apos;s a collaboration .
And it &apos;s from the Web , and it &apos;s from Seady .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from one picture to another and have this kind of experience to the other and have this kind of experience to the multiple .
But the space collocation of images here has actually a meaning meaning .
The signed algorithms of the computer visualization have been taken together , in a way that corresponding to the real place that the imaging -- all the close to the record to the Montne Roccial Montne Roccian Roccian Roccian Montne Roccian Roccial or the elements of a slide-stable , and these things have been all the space of the space .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original set of Noahs -- and this is from a prototynth of Photosynth , we &apos;ve done for the first time the first time the last time , the first time the last time , the last time , the last time , the technology Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily the question we &apos;ve got to be watched in the website .
We had to worry about the legal aspects and so on .
This is a rebuilt of Nothers of Nothers Dimimages from Flickr . Bast Do , digiting Nothers and you get images of type in magic magic , others and so on . Each of these fields , and so on . Each one of these connections a picture that &apos;s discovered .
So I &apos;m all images from Flickr , and you &apos;ve been all been colleagues in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this way we can navigate this way .
You know , I would never be thought I would ever be thinking about the Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifying this kind of account here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of a different types of focus , from those of the cellphone to those professional professional , the number of the ground , which is a very significant , and it was a significant myself .
And if I can , I try to try to find those more strange .
Many of them are block , etc .
Somewhere you find a photographs of photographs -- et-eccoland .
This is a Nothers in the correctly correctly .
We can go from this physical vision of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the ential memory of how to apply the land , from visual point of visual visual , and they all those data together .
All those pictures become connected , most of the parts of the parts .
You have a model of the earth that emerge .
Think about this as a prolament of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as the people uses it , and the advantages that are used to be used to use .
Their pictures are marks with metadated by other people .
If someone comes to contract all these saying , and I can say , my picture of Nothers , my picture of Nothers , and I can actually get a very caught of all those data , and I can use a point of all that data , and I can use the picture of the space , in that middle , using the challenges of the challenges of the cross-like , and to have a cross-like social experience of the cross-like social experience and .
Of course , a consequence of all that are extremely elaborated with all of the interesting part of the earth , that &apos;s not just as much as the planet , and from images and satellitary , but from the memory of the collective .
Thank you very much .
CA : I realized ? What &apos;s good ? What your software is going to be doing is that in a certain point , in the next years , all the photographs that &apos;s going to be going to be going to be practically connected with ?
BA : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is , it &apos;s doing is to find .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want to be , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the pictures .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the recognizes of simple information that many of these images .
As when you &apos;re a research of images on the Web , you get a sentence and the head on the web on the images of the picture .
Now , what if that picture is that picture to all your picture ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of recchedom that &apos;s really huge is huge . It &apos;s a classical classical effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really amazing .
BA : BA very much .
One of the main the major , when you travel and one of the research , is the power of the living research that the power of the traditions , between the wind , the wind the past in the wind , the touching in the floats , the room is in the floating of the floats .
Basts thinking that Jaguar Jaguar , still travel the Via Lattea , or that the world &apos;s Midites are still meaning , or that in Himala , or that in Himalaya , or that the world that we live in the Dharm , to remember the central importance of anthroughout of anthroughout of anthroughout , but it &apos;s just a model , but it &apos;s just a model of reality , but it &apos;s just a model , but it &apos;s actually not exists ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stirles has done , well , or a bad , a lot of generations ago .
And , of course , we all share about the essential towards .
All nasks . We all properties .
We are subjects in the beginning of beginning .
We have to death the inexorability of mortges , so it doesn &apos;t surprising it , and we &apos;re ballie .
We all have a art .
What &apos;s the class is the particular rate in cancer , the third of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that they are the Than forests of the Borneo , or the Voodoo of Haiti , or the World Woman , or the desert Kenya , or the Curander , or a camelmas , or a camelmels in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my journey in the desert of a month ago , or a month ago , or a mth ago , or a mth of yself in the world .
All of these populations teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , others of move in the world .
And , if you reflect a moment , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
And with them , the cultures of the world , they make a very nature of spiritual life that &apos;s the planet , and it &apos;s important to the planet and it &apos;s important for the planet as a biosphere as a biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural girl as a ethnosphere and you can define the ethnosphere , the though of all the concepts , until , inspirations , inspirations , inspirations , inspirations , inspirations , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , and you can be the kind of the conscious .
The ethnic is the fantastic patriage of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how unquises .
And because the biosphere was really really really consumed by ethnic ethnic and unfortunately too much faster .
Not biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species is about the extinction of the extinction , because it &apos;s falthough , or -- in the most apocalysical , and you don &apos;t even have to the most of biological diversity -- and you don &apos;t even have to even even more than that -- that you can &apos;t even be in the most often of the world .
The indict of all that is , of course , the lost linguistic .
When you &apos;re born , they were there 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just a voyn-composed or a series of grammaticals .
A language is the basic of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the medium with which animal of every culture of every culture of all the world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a tiny of mind , a thought , a lot of spiritual possibility .
And the 6,000 languages , as we are sitting in Monterey , at least half no longer in the orecchies of children .
They don &apos;t come to the children , which is that means , less you wonder that doesn &apos;t wait something , which are already dead .
What &apos;s more trists of being fly , you know , the last one , of the last to be the last to talk a language , not have a way to transmit the wish of the wisdom or to anticipate the promise of the children ?
This is a state of somewhere in some of the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks , and it &apos;s saying with the tomba .
And I know someone who &apos;s better ?
The world wouldn &apos;t be a better place if we &apos;re talking about the same language ? &quot; Benish , so we &apos;re all talking to yourself . We &apos;re all going to be a cancer .
Let &apos;s talk about it .
You &apos;re going to be a tract thing to say , not to talk about their language .
I &apos;d like to do a journey through ethnosphere --
a little journey in the ethnic eye to give you a lot of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , &quot; I really mean , &quot; I really mean , I mean , a different ways of exists .
We take for example , this Barasana , in Amazon , in Amazon , the population of anaconda , which creates the middle of the lats of the latest wats of sacred in the sacred sacred .
It &apos;s a population that &apos;s not in the population that &apos;s not in the blue color from the green color because the cells is identified in the forest , which depending on the forest , which depends the population .
They have a linguistic rules , and a matrimonious rule , &quot; exogamia , &quot; You have to move a person that &apos;s a different language .
So , all of this has been in the mythological past , and yet the particularly of the country that you &apos;re talking about six or seven or seven lingutips .
They &apos;re limited to listening and then they start to talk .
We take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived , the Waoran of Ecuador , an incredible population , a incredible population , a incredible population that has the first contact in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionaries have tented a common contact .
They &apos;ve done from the photographs that they retrading them in poses that they would have advanced , dimenting that this population of the forest pluvial forest .
They have been collected by the ground , they turned it to the research of a or a figure , they have concluses that they have a diavol , and they have killed the diavol , and they killed the five missionaries .
But the Waorans don &apos;t just killing the strange .
They have killed between them .
54 percent of mortality was caused by their own .
We &apos;ve been saying eight generations and we found two of death , and when we insisted to know , they have a lot of them , they have a very until of them , and then they killed it . And then they had a killed knowledge of that .
The sun-degrees were able to recognize the animal of 40 pases and recognize the species .
In the early 1980s , I was a very interesting compiece when my professor of Harvard professor was assigned to Haiti , and I wanted to go to Haiti and the Prite of Dualier and Tonton Muses , and imposed me to the zombie of Duvalier and Tonton Musbs , and imposed me to do the zombie that zombie to do zombie zombie , and I was a fairly impose to do the zombie for the zombie of the zombie
To give a sense to miracular sense , I should have to understand the Vodoun , and that the Voodoo is not magnera .
It &apos;s a full of a medical medical medical vision of the world .
Very interesting .
If I asked you to tell me about the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Budddsam , etc .
A continent is always leaving out , thinking that the sub-Saarian Africa has no religious feeling . And he was not not the other that the distilled distilled of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of naked in the tragic diasport .
What makes interesting is the voot is the intense is the relationship between life and death .
So the vives are nakes to the spirits .
The spirits can be investigate from Great Acqua , answer to the dance of the dance and replace temporary to the animal in a way that we would have a short that for a short that we like a short .
So , the voodooists love saying , &quot; You white white white white .
We &apos;re in the temple and we &apos;re going to be God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re playing , is the spirit that you , how can you do it ?
So , you &apos;re extremendous events : following windoo in the state of the touches that touched full the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the mind on the body the body of the mind when it &apos;s been catalyzed in the body of the mind of the power of the mind .
I &apos;ve all been the people with the most amazing people who lived the most amazing world are the Kogi in Sierra Nevada Santa Marta , in Colombia .
It &apos;s going to be the ancivilization that once they had a living planure in the carcars of the Colombia , the population of the conquist , the population of the vulsea that &apos;s canding on the planation planture .
In a drug continent , this population has never been conquisted by the spagnes .
But in fact , I &apos;m government by a clero , but their formation is really extraordinary .
The young people are taking away from the families to three or four years , and they live in a world of a good world of good and bombs in a world of the bag and bumbs in the bag of the ice for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years choose to reproduce the nine months of gestation that turn into the user of mother , now are metaphor , now are metaphor metaphor in the Great Man .
For all of this time , they &apos;re acculated to their society , values that they predict their pregning and only their prayer , and only their prayer to the cosmic balance -- or to say the balance .
At the term of this incredible initiation , they &apos;re improvide taking out and the first time in their own life , in 18 years , and they see a gap . And in that activity of the first best , when the sun bules of the first bad , all that they learned in theory is connected , everything that has learned in the heavy . The pret passion ago and says , &quot; The pret a passion ago and says , &quot; : &quot; The pret a past and says , &quot; The landing a pass and says , &quot; The first time ,
&quot; I &apos;m going to say , I said ,
It &apos;s really about it . Now it &apos;s looking at you protect it . &quot;
They &apos;re called the most most of them and say that we , the brothers , we are the hundred of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about Indigene and environment we &apos;re looking at Rseseau and the old story of the old story , which is a razy concept , which is a razy concept in his simplicity or maybe we call Thoreau and say that these people are the close to the Earth of us .
The digenes are not not unsentimental feeling nor indebolites .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the disease in the disease of the Aphysical vents of Tibet , but because of the time and the time and the ryes , they created a mistic of the Earth is not about the concept of the most of the most of the most of the world that the Earth can only because it &apos;s infected as much as infected as the world that the Earth can only because it &apos;s infected from the human conscious of the world .
What does that mean ?
It means that a little bit of a Ande of the Ande who grows in the mountain is a spirit of Apu that will be a deeply human being a deeply human being a deeply foundly different , and it will have a fountain or that place to a Montana that grow a mountain a Montana that grows to be scaved .
That &apos;s the dimour of a spirit or a mineral cool is irrievant .
What &apos;s interesting is the methaphor that &apos;s the methaphor the relationship between individual and natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Columbia credating that the forests serve to be cut .
That has a different human being from my friends Kwakiutl Kwakiutl who credrop forests are the Hukuk and the history of the paradising and the song of the world , and the song of the world , spirits that live in the world , spirites that are in the Hamatory of the world , spirites that have been in the Hamatory of the world , the spirits .
If you start to consider that these cultures can actually actually actually , you can start to understand some of them , you can start to understand some of them . We take this plants .
I wrote this picture to the open-a-in Amazon .
Mayahuge some of you have heard about the ey-sustaining , the most powerful sustaining of the repertorium .
What makes the ey-fascinating eayahuash is not the drugs of sustaining , but his elaboration . It &apos;s about two elements .
From a side , this lian ly-carbon that contains a series of a boline , and harming , slightly slightly .
It &apos;s a basic basic is a bluef that altera little bit that altera , but it &apos;s myself choices with the leaves of a basic family of the caffee ,
This plants is a triptamines , very similar to serotonin , dimethoxyltryltryltryltryltryltrack .
If you ever see the Yanomami tyly-sustaining the sustaining that they do from a different kind of species , which is methoxin methoxin .
Tiring that pollution is a little bit like to be a little bit like being spared by a fire of the board and landing on a basic broken . Raoting a distortion of the reality . Raws : you don &apos;t believe a distortion of reality .
I was often often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , man who wrote the was psychedelical , with his discovery , with his discovery of the 30-in the 1930 in the &apos; 30s in the 1930 in Mexico .
And I &apos;m going to be able to classified these triptames like slow , because if you &apos;re doing you can &apos;t tell anyone of being told . You can &apos;t be sure anyone of being kinated . Rish triptames can &apos;t be absolutely because they &apos;re money because I &apos;m saying in the testiny , dead of course , in the mount , dead mount of the testin , dead mount .
It &apos;s possible to be alone if you unasses with other chemicals that money money , the MAO .
Now , the beautiful : the wheels that are in this lian inibitors are inhbitors of the MAO , the same kind of the type of the triptams . The question is that &apos;s about 80,000 species of plants , like these people are find two dies of plants , like these people are , but that if you realize in this way , crean whatever , creating a biochemistry that &apos;s about the way that is the time ?
We use the great euphysical euphemism and the error , which can be infruit .
But if we wonder to the Indians , they &apos;re talking about it . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , 17 variety of Eayahuash , which distinguished in the forest , and that our eyes would be in the same species .
If we ask them how they stake their tasks , they &apos;ll tell us , &quot; I thought , &quot; I was thinking about the plants , you don &apos;t know everything ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you get the 17 variety in a note of a loth and each one will song with a different song .
With this is not laure-laurees , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting to the stami .
Now , the problem is that the problem is that also the problem is that the ones that have to us who have to the basic people are pitting them , but in a few way to our reduces of our world &apos;s history , and the world &apos;s ballowing .
In fact , in the 19th century , 300 years , it &apos;s not going to be remember for his war or innovation , but rather as the way we stop and innovation of the world that we stop and actively actively dealing , or the problem of the world &apos;s mass and cultural distraction of the planet . Now the problem is not change .
All of the cultures were involved in a dance for new possibility of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux don &apos;t have to be Sioux when they put out of the ark and founds as well as Americans have not stuck to be Americans when they put out from the horse and ceeling .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that threatens the integrity of ethnic . It &apos;s the power .
The wall of the domination .
And if you look at the world , you &apos;ll find that these are not destined to be that these are not destined to disappeared .
They are creatures and dynamics spines out of the hyth-existence that go over the ability of adaptation .
It &apos;s what it is disbosing in the patries of the thinking --
a population of Sarawak , in the south asiatic , a population that has lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to a generation , and now reducing the ress of the living of the living of the living Borneo Cinese Merioni Cinese Merioni Cinese Merioni Cinese Merionas , where the navi navi Japanese , where the Japananiszonte , where the naves the Nort-asiasiasiats , a
It &apos;s a basic stys with the basic stys with the basic .
Or in case of the Yanomami , are the diseases that are coming with the discovery of the gold .
If we move on the Tibet of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the dall of the politics .
As you know the genocide , the physics of a population , is condanned to the universal level , but the ethnic , the distraction of life , not only is condannated , but to deal with the world , because it &apos;s part of the developing strategy , because it &apos;s part of the developing strategy of the development .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering Tibet . And it &apos;s not part of the beginning .
I know the 6,000 miles from China in China in the Western China in the Western Tibet , and by Lhasa with a young colleagues , but only came to Lhasa , but only came to Lhasa I realized what we &apos;re hearing .
6,000 monuments sacred in the watching and cens .
1.2 million people killed from the military Rvolution .
The father of this guy was abrited to the Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed to the time of Chinese invasion .
I &apos;m unclear with Santity in Santity during the diaspores that he brought the people in Nepal .
She was imprisoned and his color was a car .
It &apos;s been taking to the age of two years , hidden in the age of two years , and he could not living without him .
The sister , who has been the same , it was taking in the camp .
A day , he &apos;s been wondered a fasx phassembled , and for this transgression , and in this transgression , was in the seven years .
The Tibet of the Tibet can be insopy , but the spirit of the population is from the world is from tener .
At the end , all of it redues a choice .
We want to live in the world world world a monotony of the monotony or we want to account the world policycle of diversity ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before we died told her biggest , in our lightly largest vision , we &apos;re not just seeing the whole gama world , we &apos;re not just going to see the whole gama climitation of human instractil , but a day we &apos;re seeing on a sound wave us to a sound won &apos;t even themselves .
And it &apos;s a humiliating that our species is in 600,000 years .
The Neolitics Rivolution , who gives us agriculture , which has taken us to the cult of the sees of the sees , and replace the poem of the spread , and we &apos;re talking about 10,000 years ago .
The industrialized world is 300 years .
And that &apos;s a history of history that we have the answer to all the challenges that we should be in the millennia that we &apos;re going to come .
When these myriades of the world is asked what it is to say to be human , they say , &quot; His , they say , &quot; as a different vooyes .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all return to be what we &apos;re : a kind of conscious species , which has to be what we &apos;re : a kind of conscious times that all the people and all the people can fall . And there are great times .
I wrote this picture on the north of the north of Baffin , when I went to the hundred of the balene with the Inuit , and this man , and this man , and this man , and this man , and he told me the wonderful story of his nonno .
The government has not always been gentile with the Inuit and in the 1950s to stabilies our premistabilies , we have them in colonies .
The grandfather was refed to go .
The family , teming for his life , and he brought away all the arms , and all his toles .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t teme the cold , they don &apos;t tempted the cold .
The bag of slites in original , they were made of fish .
The nonless of this man doesn &apos;t have to be intimidddle from the artica or , or the blizing blizing .
It &apos;s been taking up , it &apos;s howned the bag of foca and defecated in their hand . When the failed them , and then he &apos;s taking them , and they &apos;re taking it , and they &apos;re working creating a lama .
It &apos;s burned spring up on the car of this crows , and when it was solid , he &apos;s killed a dog .
It &apos;s schools and created a little bit , with the hactic casses , and he &apos;s imbridge a sliter , and it &apos;s brog on the banchisa , and it &apos;s banchisa , and it &apos;s slies on the banches .
We want to talk about named with nothing ?
In the 1999 , the government of the government has been redded to the total control of a largest area of the California and Texas a myself .
It &apos;s their new patries . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a territory territory . They construct all the third resources .
One of how a national national state can recognize with his population .
And , to finish , I think it &apos;s quite obvious to the planet , I think it &apos;s been in these zones of the planet , makes it not remote remote .
For someone &apos;s home .
They know , the seats of human imagination that are rising to the time . And for us all , the dreams of these children , as the dreams of the children , as the dreams of hope .
For finish , we are convints that politicians are not going to be in the politicians ever ever to anything .
We believe that polyming .
&#91; Auses &#93; they &apos;re not persuasive , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month to tell stories of the world . Every month , our site 35 million living .
156 countries , we transmitted our television .
Our revistes are several millions of people .
Our work is to travel in the ethnosphere to bring our public in the ethnic , and that will go out of how they &apos;re going to go away from how they &apos;ve seen and hopes , they &apos;re going to get a central reveal of anthropology : the world of the world of existing world , and we have to find a style world , and we have to find a style world , and we have to find a world , and we have to find a world , and we have to find a world world &apos;s myticultural style to the world to the world of the world to a style and mels in a style in a style
where the wisdom of all the people can contribution to our collective benefits .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope is about it , and I &apos;m going to evidence some of the colleagues , in case , not notice them .
I &apos;d like to start with what I call &quot; the dogma official . &quot;
The dogma official of what ?
The dogma official of all of all of all of the Western industrial society . The dogma official is , &quot; If we want to male the benefits of our citizens &quot; The way to do it is to male the individual liberty . &quot;
The reason , from a side , in the fact that liberty is in the fact that freedom is , useful , is , useful , for human beings .
Again in the fact that if we are libers , each of us can act for all the way to do all that that maximizing our benefits , without no one that decided in name .
The way to male the freedom is to male the choice .
More choices people have , more libers , and most of their liberty , most of their liberty , most of them is their well-being .
This , I think , it &apos;s so deeply radicated in the society that no one would be able to put it in the society .
And it &apos;s also deeply radicated in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what the progress has possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly great .
I &apos;m losing a simple notes on the conditions for injury .
In my supermarket , there are 175 condents , without content 10 variety of oil , and the 12 oil , and the 12 acets that you can buy a huge number of conditions that nobody in the research that nobody &apos;s about 175 proned , which no one of the 175 proned ,
Here &apos;s the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronics to buy a stereo : My , CD , radio , CD , radio , radio , floor , plastra , amplify .
And in this single negotial negotial , there &apos;s a big number of audio .
We can realize six million different half of combinations that there are a components that there are only a negotiate .
You have to admit that there &apos;s a lot of choice .
Other fips : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all the serve phone of the desires , and the bat , the best mama Bell .
It was born the phone , it was not buy it .
A consequence of that , between the other , it was that the phone was never .
These type of the time .
We now have a variety of phones , especially illimited phones , especially between the cellphones .
Here &apos;s the cellphone of the future .
My favorite is that in the middle , MP3 , cut the nose , and the bull-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-a-to-throw .
If you don &apos;t have seen in the middle , you &apos;re not in the house , you &apos;re going to be in the same .
And what &apos;s going on is that the people are in the news and does this question . And you know what &apos;s answer ? The answer is , &quot; No .
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cellphone that doesn &apos;t make too many things .
So in other aspects of life that are much more important than the buy , you know , it &apos;s the same explosion of choices .
Assistence : Don &apos;t happen in the United States that you &apos;re going to be from the doctor and the doctor what you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do it , or whatever , or the B , &quot; As &quot; A B has these benefits and these risks , &quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Dr. &quot; Dr. I should I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; It &apos;s these benefits , and the risks , and the risks . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebats , &quot; Dr. I was , what would it do ? &quot;
And the doctor : But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result that we call it &quot; autonomy of malsees , &quot; expression that makes it looks like a beautiful thing .
But in fact , it &apos;s not a head or the responsibility to take a decisions from someone who knows something , and whether it &apos;s not known -- and whatever you -- and almost certainly is malated -- and so that it &apos;s not the patient to remarkable decisions .
There &apos;s a huge marketing products of drugs , direct to people like me and you , that if you think there &apos;s no sense , because you think it &apos;s not a sense , that we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why do they published them ?
The answer is that they want to be , we call the doctor to ask them to change the recipe .
Something that &apos;s our own hythemselves is a question of choice , as you see in this gap , as you see in this gap . We don &apos;t want to force the children . They &apos;ll choose their right right now at the time . &quot; We don &apos;t have to invent .
And we can reinvent us how many times we can reinvent us .
which means that every morning , to the risk , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I &apos;m going to be in the family and mathemselves , a time time time , a common , almost anyone , and it was that you could have the most prespossible , and he started to get the most of the most of possible .
The only choice was choice , not when , and not even when , and not even less what to do after .
Everyday , it &apos;s really to play .
I teach in very smart students , and I think about 20 percent in the work in less than a time .
And not because they &apos;re not saying less , because they &apos;re not because they &apos;re feeling less diligences .
but why I &apos;m impensierites , I mean , I would say , &quot; Do I would move it now ? &quot;
&quot; I should move more tarcle ? I have to think about the kids or the career ? &quot;
They are interrogorant .
And they &apos;re trying to answer to these questions , even if this implement is not to be the compiting compititing and not get a bel voting my woot .
And they have to do it . They have to do it .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , as Carl , because the technology allows us to work every day , from every day , from every day , from Hotel Randolph .
It &apos;s talking about , there &apos;s a angle , and I &apos;m not going to no one who , where the WiFFi works .
I don &apos;t say that , because I want to use it .
What does , this amazing freedom of choice we have to be about the work ? Is it that we have to continuously , if we need to work or not .
We can go to the head , with the calculation , with the cellphone in a task , the Blackberry in the other , and the night , on the ginocy .
And even if they &apos;re all spending , every minute that we see our son , we also see our son , we also asking , we also said , &quot; I have to answer to this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? I have to habboard ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , this makes the experience of your child very different from the way that would be in other conditions .
So , as any part of the set , little things , little things , and the stillion life , life is a choice , life is a question of choice .
Once the world was this : Over , there were some possibility , but not all that was a choice .
The world today is a positive this : The dilemma is , &quot; Is it a positive , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Short .
We all know , we all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about that negative .
All this choice , two effects negative effects on people .
The first , paradoxide is that it &apos;s produces that liberation .
I &apos;m a lot of options that choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I &apos;m going to give you an example : a study study conduct on the planet of volunteer .
A lot of my colleagues , the giant society , the gigantic society of thinking , with about a million climate works , with about a million climbing care .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of adesion , the percentage of adesion ,
With 50 source , there &apos;s 10 percent in less adesions , in less adesions to when they &apos;re available to five . Why ?
Because with 50 source between which I choose , it &apos;s malethy to decide , and the choice is is remanded to the indomances .
And at domances , and again , domain , domain , domances , and of course , domances , of course , it &apos;s never going to be .
You know , that &apos;s not just that these works as well as well as they &apos;re eating food for canes because they don &apos;t have enough money , it also , you want to say that the decision is so hostica that they also have the complementary of the dator .
Not teaching , they &apos;re losing until fied to the work of work , which would be waste to be it .
So the paralysis is a consequence of having too choices .
And I think that &apos;s what it makes the world so .
&quot; And finish , for the ethernity : ketchup , or maionese ? &quot;
You would like to take right right to take the right decision , if it &apos;s for ethernity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong source , and nepurpure the wrong .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can even avoid the paralysis , and we &apos;re at the end , we &apos;re less satisfying out of how we would be with less options that we were with less options .
And that &apos;s about a lot of the reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of the condents , if you buy a choose , if you buy a bad , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that you could have a better choice that would be better . And that &apos;s that &apos;s that alternative imagines us to the choice , and the dimining satisfaction of the decision , and the defation of the decision , and the most defull the spring of the decision , and it &apos;s not not to be able to be a saves from the decision , and it &apos;s not not not not not not not perfect to be .
even when it was a good decision .
More choice there are , more easier , it &apos;s easier than whether it &apos;s insod-like choice .
There &apos;s what the economists call cost costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has aslear very well , as the value we &apos;re depending on things that we &apos;re going to be depending with .
First , when there are a lot of options , it &apos;s easy to represent the characteristics of the alternative , and it is less satisfying the option of the option that &apos;s choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I write with all that I &apos;m not in New York .
But that &apos;s what you would probably think you would think .
There &apos;s this copy to the Hamptons .
A place of lussions .
It &apos;s beat . Otym . It &apos;s all about them .
Nothing . But what he thinks it &apos;s , &quot; Well , malite , is Agost . &quot;
&quot; All my near near Manhattan are away . &quot;
&quot; I could talk about home . &quot;
And it &apos;s two weeks , and it &apos;s losing the idea that &apos;s losing -- every day -- the chance of parking where it wants .
The cost-opportunity is declining the sod-on that we have , even when the choice was , as well as the choice .
And the most of options we have to consider , the more characteristics will be returned to us as a cos-opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This jet us saying a lot of things .
We talk about the living time , and maybe of living , and maybe of living .
But the most important point is that whatever you choice , you &apos;re choice to do other .
The things that we don &apos;t choose have a tactivity that can make less attractivity what we do .
Tirst : it &apos;s growing of expectations .
I tried it on my skin compraying a new jeans .
I &apos;m going to almost always .
Once the jeans were a kind of a , I bought them and wresh wondering , they were just later , just after they were taking them a life and washing a lot of times , they began to go well .
So I went to buy a couple of jeans , and I said , &quot; and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cutting . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Who wants to me , &quot; Who wants to fit , relaxy and fit ? &quot;
Who wants to the certain or or both ? &quot; Stonewashed ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; hypes ? &quot;
&quot; Lave them street them ? &quot;
&quot; Sow the basic or stretch ? Bla bla basic basic basic .
I was balance , and after a little bit , and after a little bit I was able to say , &quot; I want the kind of -- that was the only guy that was , so I &apos;m going to try all of the best stayed , and then I came out of the best , and then I &apos;m going to be a grid , with the best jeans , with the best jeans , and I was a little jeans , and I was a little bit of the best , and I was a little bit of what I was , so for a little bit of the same jeans ,
It was the maximum . I got all that choice the best .
But I was worse .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand it .
The reason I was worst that I was worst with all that choice , and the jeans had to be perfect , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was about 100 minime . I didn &apos;t wait of it . I wasn &apos;t expectations of 100 , but when it was a 100 different , but when you videal , at least a type .
What I was good at the good thing , but not perfect .
After I talked about that choose to what I was trying to insoon in the waiting .
The advancing of the people don &apos;t do that to increase the expectations that these have been replaces to the ectell of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the people who are not to increase the expectations that these have been in the ectations of the
And this will product less satisfying , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing it .
Because if they knew it , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more about this .
&quot; It was better when it was worst , &quot; The reason why he was better when it was worst , it was worst when it was worst the worst the worst of the prese sprise .
Everyday , in the world that we live -- oil , industrialized industrialized , the major of perfection -- the most of the perfection -- the most of the heighborhood .
You &apos;ve never been surprised places because your expectations , expectations , they &apos;re ingigantners .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Well , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , you want . &quot;
I mean , little moment , very little autobiographic -- that I &apos;m going to be move and my wife is really stupend .
I couldn &apos;t have to do better , I &apos;m not going to do better ,
But it &apos;s not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of comprize a couple of jeans is that when there &apos;s just that kind of jeans is that when you don &apos;t sure , and you say , &quot; Why ? &quot;
Who is responsible ? &quot;
The world is the responsible . What could I do do you ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a disastasting insodle , and you ask you who is the responsible , it &apos;s otherwise you .
You would have to do better .
With hundreds of variety , there &apos;s no scoes , there are not out of the insuccess .
So when people are decisions , even if the result is valid , they feel unlike , they feel insodge , and they &apos;re going to their own own .
In the last years of depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a meaning meaning -- not the only one , but the importance , of this depression is just that people have experiences of depression is that people have experiences of the drop because the standard of the drop .
And when they have to explain this situation thinking that the color is their .
So the final result is that we &apos;re better better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely falong . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit of choice , but it &apos;s better than it &apos;s not going to be able , but from this is better than a lot of choice .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we have surface from a piece of the level that choices .
Now , from the political point of view -- I &apos;ve almost finished -- from political point , the nocle is the following .
What allows this all of the choice in the industrial society is the material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too late .
So the factory I &apos;m talking about is a disease of modern modern , the Western society .
And what does it do is to be to be this : Steve Levitt has talked about yesterday as those things , and I &apos;m saying a lot of the things that are useful , it &apos;s a recognize of money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and dispendious , it &apos;s not that they &apos;re just unuseful .
They &apos;re conditions of the eths .
There are worst .
If a little bit of what our society allows , it &apos;s been revered in those where people have too few possibility , it would not just be their life to be improving , but also the life to be better , but also our life .
This is what economists call a partnership .
A distribution of the reduction is good at all -- not only to poor -- because of this choice that &apos;s going to us .
To conclude , you can become all you want to become everything you want &quot;
You know , people of culture , you &apos;re thinking , &quot; What does that weight ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t make it in a glass of glass . &quot;
&quot; A casess imagination , a limited vision of the world -- &quot;
and I &apos;m interpret that , I &apos;ve been interpret ,
But then , thinking about , I realized that that fish the weight knows that that weight the length knowledge .
Because the reality of the fact that if you manda in the human bees , so that &quot; everything is possible , &quot; you can &apos;t get freedom . It &apos;s going to get the health .
If you can get the broke in a way that everything diminute you can declining the satisfaction .
Look at the paralysis , and you &apos;re going to reducing the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too laugh , maybe even for the fish , and of course for us .
But the asthemselves of some symbolic symbolic , and I , for the rovine .
Thank you very cue .
