Last year I showed these slidemonstrate to demonstrate that the caloty glacial , that for almost three million years had the size of 48 continental United States continental , it &apos;s restriped 40 percent .
But this underestimate the gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the spexpected of the ice .
The arctic climate glacial is in a sense , the pulsant heart of the global climate system .
You expand invert of summer , and it &apos;s expanding .
The next slide is going to be a quick carried on the advenues of the last 25 years .
The ice loss are denia in red .
And as you see , they expand up to the blue blue .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter , which is the summer of summer .
You can see that the ice cosidst ice perenn , of five years or more , it &apos;s like the blood , which is like the blood , which is where it comes from the body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been like this .
This is a problem because the interests of interested in the ground , and the glacier around the ocean arctic where there are enormous amount of coal that , and they &apos;re transformed into methane .
Rest to the totality of the atmospheric inqution , that amount could radical , that amount could radical , overall this point of not come back .
In some short laghi in Alaska , the metane is already rebecame rebroken by the water .
The professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska was based with a team ready ready laugh at the winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : The question is if we &apos;re going to be .
A reason is that this termal exchange that &apos;s a termal Greenland from north .
This is a river in glacial klacial .
The carported wasn &apos;t reached led .
This is the Kangerlush &apos;s river , in the South West .
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the sea , here is where it reaches the sea .
These running are increasing rents .
On the other side of the planet : Antarctica , the greatest block of the planet .
The month scientists have been declared that the balance of the ice is in negative , and that Antarctica , which can be in some western islands , which can be particularly in the shelter .
Equival 16 feet of watching watership , like in Greenland .
Sull Himalaya , the third biggest block of ice , you see new laghands , which a few years ago , they were slaghered .
40 percent of the world population has been in the middle water from that the leaves .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the water of this city .
The carcartoed is increased .
But when it decrees , the same account to water .
In California , the Sierra Nevada is decrease in the Sierra Nevada is decrease .
The house crisis in crisis .
The predictions , as you &apos;ve read , they &apos;re gravef .
The growth of the world &apos;s pursuing a increase .
The environmental disasters are increasing a rhythm out of the normal and without precedented .
Four times more numerous than the last 30 years of previous 30 years .
This is a whole thing that is an unsustainable .
If you look at it in the historical context , you can see the consequences .
We &apos;ve added 70 years we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 25 million tons of CO2 in the oceans every day .
Look at the time of the Pacific Pacific , from American , and the West , and the bottom parts of Indian Indian , where there is a radical impoverments of oxygen in the oceans .
Most of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossil fuels .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worst .
The United States are one of the two more emissions , with China .
And he was proposed to build a lot of other central central .
But we &apos;re seeing a change of direction .
These are the annulled projects in the last few years and some of alternative alternative .
And every way , there &apos;s a political lotta in our country .
The carbon industries and oil are spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon cables , which is a hosystiped .
That picture me up to something --
Natal , Tennessee , where I live , there was a loss of 3.8 billion waste waste .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen it on the news .
This is the second largest flow of scories in America .
It happened around Natal .
The nature of carbon industries of one of the coal industries was this .
Video : carbon the carbon is a kind of food and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it makes our economy .
Actually , carbon is more and more and more and more clean .
It &apos;s good , the workers and the work is the stipendent .
Al Gore : From here &apos;s a lot of the West Virginia carbon .
The largest societies on the mountain is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Don Blankenship : Don Blankenship -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelososs , Harry Reid -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima Protection has launched two campaign .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : At COALergy : ALergy , we see the climate change as a serious screen to our business .
So our priority is to invest a big amount of money in a very much money in a bad ad and public effort the truth .
In fact , the carbon isn &apos;t sepork .
We think it &apos;s clean , it also has a good profuman .
So , not preoconate of climate change .
Let me do .
Video : Carbone : Carbone . You &apos;ve heard about it .
So let &apos;s take a turn into a clean to a clean to the carbon as a clean clean .
Strtraordinary ! Maches are a little noise , but this is the sound of the car technology of clean clean .
The coal coal is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology of clean clean clean clean clean clean is between the clean clean clean clean clean is between the main causes of global war
Take a look : this is the coal wonderful technology of clean clean .
Al Gore : Inally , the positive alternative alternative , and the national security , the national security .
Video : America is in crisis in crisis ; the economy , national security , national security crisis .
The filter that connects all : our dependence from fossil fuels , like carbon and oil and oil oil .
Now , there &apos;s a new , audacy solution to the circumstances .
Repower : America : 100 percent clean energy , 10 years .
A plan to required America to make safer safe , and help to stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that &apos;s burst to solve our problems .
Repower .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : That &apos;s a : That &apos;s about to reduck energy .
One of the fastest ways of bring up dependence from the combustible that kills our planet .
Compared : The future is here . I feel , sun , sun , sun ,
She &apos;s got to be two : Nuovi investment for places of broken work .
Comment : America . It &apos;s time to be realists .
Al Gore : A Find , you go to the fast African , you go to fast , go from alone .
If you want to go away , you go together . &quot;
We have to go far , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED I did a fecklizy on the LHC .
And I promise to return you about how the machine works .
So here I am . And for those that the other time , there was no LHC is the biggest experiment that ever tries to -- 27 kilometers of circumference .
Her task is to recreate the conditions that were present less than a billion second from the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
That &apos;s just the same thing is simply environment .
This is the slip under Ginevenra .
We photograph these mini-Bang in the relevators .
This is what I work . This is the ATLATLAS -- it &apos;s 44 feet and it &apos;s a diameter diameter &apos;s diameter .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in buildings , so you can see the proportions .
Ten the 10-September 10 year we accent the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was cause of immense festegements in control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first particle phask that had all made all around of the LHC , walking in collision , with a part of the LHC , and by a part of the LHC , and it &apos;s spreading particles in the resert .
In other words , when we see that picture the image 10 , we realize that the machine worked , which is a great vicicycle .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to do more or this , when somebody went to Google and saw that the page was this .
That means we &apos;ve had a cultural impact beyond that scientific .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , we had to these files here -- these files .
These files bring 13,000 frightened when the machine works at the very large of power .
Now , the technicians between you look at the files and say , &quot; That &apos;s not true . They &apos;re too much thle . &quot;
And they can do it because when they &apos;re very cold to become the cosid-called superconductors .
So , unless 271 degrees , at a inferior temperature at the space between stars , these files can bring that run .
In one of the gunclean y-novemila in the LHC , there was a fect of factory .
So the files surroundly , and 13,000 , and 13,000 ampings of suddenly meet a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think these magnets more than 20 tons fishing more than 20 tons .
They &apos;re damages about 50 magnets .
We had to take them , what we did .
We rejusted them and reached .
Now they &apos;re going to come back to the sub-place .
By the end of the LHC , the LHC is , it &apos;s going to be new .
We &apos;ll accend it , and we expect to get the right data or the jugment , and continue our adventure to discover what are the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these crashes reaccount to the value of science and engineering in frontier .
I think the fact that &apos;s so hard , the fact of going beyond the limits , I think this value of things like LHC .
I would like to end with the words of a Ingan scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , imagine , the indeed , the inuseful experiments of his pupillo , his pupilety , he was Michael Faraday , said , &quot; No , &quot; is so dangerous for the progress of the human mind that science , that there are no mystandard , that we don &apos;t have to be mistate , and that are not to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to conquiet . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to rethink about when , from children , from children , playing with the morning .
While you &apos;re figure out how to reach them and take them and get them and moving them , learned actually to think and solve problems and solve problems and manipulating relationships .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , from the information that we &apos;ve been inspired by our interaction with physical objects , together my consult Patti , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to ask me , &quot; And if we &apos;re going to have the only treats of the mouse as a diseastrained , we could have a desktop , we could constitute on a desktop , we could relate to a desktop with a information with entral ,
and systemate our ploymous ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big computer as a biggest .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big computer as a biggest .
You can move them with the hand , they can see them , &quot; they can see that between them , feel and they have a radio and a radio wireless .
But most of them are physical objects , like the morning , you can just move them to just deal with them .
The Siftable is an example of a new ecosystems of tooling to manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physical , knowledge of the other , and as they become more physical , and as they become more physical , of others , as we move them , we can explore new and fun stils of interaction .
I &apos;m going to start with a simple example .
This Siftable is configurated to show the video : if you just incline it in a direction , the video will rotate , if I cline from the other side side side .
These are interactive are consciousness of others .
If you go , they &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re around .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they note it and they can agitate a little bit .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they note it and they can agitate a little bit .
They also have their movement and includes .
We then realize that one of the interesting interaction was the poter to use the interaction of the interaction was the power of data , &quot; a color like a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable , as a nice central , and I can use them to be able to go to the color in that central , where they &apos;re misxcentral , where they &apos;re misximately .
and I can use them to be able to be able to be in that central , where they &apos;re misximately medium .
If we &apos;re too much going to be able to put a little place .
They also are beautiful possibility of learning , like languages , mathematics and logic games where people can try to be trying to do fast things , and see the results of immediately .
Now I &apos;m going to --
This is a sequence of Fibonacks I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a game of words that is half between Scarabean and Boggle .
Pratically , at every turn on a switches , in a case on every Siftable , to every turn to be a letter to a letter to a run at every Sifttable , and while he &apos;s trying to behave words on a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds remissing , and you have a new sletters and new possibilities to try and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the kids came to the Media Lab , I did that they experience them and I &apos;ve been gone .
They were very lived .
And one of the interesting things of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
You just say , &quot; Compons of the words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s what other people come to .
This is our younger Extester , there &apos;s the right .
It actually wanted to implemed them .
They were just morning for him .
Now , this is an application of an interactive cardboard .
We wanted to build a tool for learning of languages , and he was Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , suncable .
It can put new characters in the scene , suncable .
So , he &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : Sun is sunsurprising .
David Merrill : Now he took a tractor in the scene .
Video : The arange tractor .
By work ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes !
So , school the Siftable and put them closer can be interacting in the characters --
Video : Bau !
And by inventing their story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a story with opened final , and he can decide him as it &apos;s going to be .
DM : It &apos;s a story with opened final , and he can decide him as it &apos;s going to be .
Viny : Good , cat .
DM : The last example I have the time to show you is a tool , realized of recently , to sample and to exectent and exected music .
It &apos;s a tool , recently realized recently , to sampling and exegue music .
The Siftable is sound , base and battery .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also put these sounds in a sequence to compose these sounds in a sequence to your plate plinch .
And to modifying it , by touch a &quot; sequence . &quot;
These are effects that you can control from the vive , like the reversing and the filter .
The drive of a particular sound and then clins to be walked .
And then there are the general effects as time and volume , which is applied to the whole sequence .
Let &apos;s look at how it works .
Video : We &apos;re going to start putting a base in two Siftable , &quot; sequence , we extend it , we extend it , we extend it , we add the base .
Now , I put a base line .
Video : DM : Now , I &apos;m going to do .
Video : And I &apos;m going to put the battery , so I can control the effect of the battery .
Video : DM : I can fast further the whole sequence , by one hand on the other .
Video : And I &apos;m going to add the bottom to give more expression .
Video : DM : I can reombing the sequence &quot; bind &quot; flight . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to plan it first , but I can suddenly , to make it longer or more cording .
And now , finally , I can I smoke the whole sequence , by the left Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new man machine and more like our brain and more like our brain and the body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the result of this path , and also some possibilities that we &apos;re trying to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that it &apos;s coming to this new generation of designs to interact with digital media media , that will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time to talk to you all .
I &apos;m a writer .
By books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the fass of my life .
And I don &apos;t expect that it can change .
But , said , something about this particular happened in my life and in my life and in my career , who brought me to realibrate the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called &quot; Manda , Prega , Prua , Ama , Prega , for some reason I had to go in the world and become a great feeling , for some reason , I &apos;ve got a big feeling , sensational bestself-interational .
And the result is that everywhere &apos;s going to be now , people are being convicted .
Do that -- convicted , convicted , convicted !
They &apos;re going to be concerned and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t feel more about ?
You don &apos;t fear to continue to writing all of life without the whole life without the landscape that can care anybody to be able to be ? &quot;
What can you care to somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s rassuring , you know .
But I could go to the worst , part of that I remind more than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a written .
I would meet the same reaction by the same inframe .
And people would say , &quot; Don &apos;t you can &apos;t get to succeed ?
Don &apos;t you fear that the humiliation of the rejection is killing you ?
You couldn &apos;t you be doing this all life-up life-up life-up , you &apos;ve never come out and die on a cumulo of dreams of infrankly , with the full of fulfood ? &quot;
Something , you know .
The answer -- the short answer all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I fear of all those things .
I &apos;ve always been crazy .
And I have a lot of other things that people could not have to involve .
As the floor and other things are spaventy-up .
But , as much as I think , and I would say what I thought and asked me , and I would ask me , is why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logical that anybody should have been waiting to be a job that you &apos;ve been born to do .
But what is so particular in the creative enterprising us to make us nervous health about health , in a way that other careers do not ?
And as my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don &apos;t remember of once in its 40 years of activity in the activity was asked if you fear to be engineer ?
It was never -- that block of John engineer , how it does it go ?
Not worked , what was it ?
Onestly , chemical engineers as group have not , in the centuries , the reputation of being cated manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized maniped , chemicals , as a group , the reputation of being cewed .
We have enough , we have enough this reputation , and not only writers but creative of every gender , we have this reputation of being enormous instable .
And it &apos;s not going to look at the trists contego of the magnific death of the magnifies , they died young people died young and often for hand .
And the ones that aren &apos;t suicidated look to be really disfaced by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before I die , in the last interview , he said , &quot; You know , my book killed me a little more . &quot; A extraordinary affermation about work .
But we don &apos;t bad at the balance of this because we &apos;ve heard these things that we &apos;ve heard these things that we &apos;ve been interior and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering the arts , at the end , at the end .
And the question I want to ask all over here today is : Did you agree with this idea ?
You &apos;re going to be this thing -- because it &apos;s also , you look at it , it &apos;s not good for anything to me , not good for anything .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous , and I don &apos;t want to see it perpetuated in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to be able to live .
And I know that , in my case -- in my case -- in my situation -- would be very dangerous to be supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be in which I &apos;m in the career .
And that really -- I look , I &apos;m quite a young people , I have about 40 years .
I have about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything I &apos;m going to write in the world , then it will be judged by the world that I came out of my late book .
I &apos;m going to be hard , because we &apos;re all more or less friends here -- is likely that my greatest success to my hand .
Oh , Gesus , which thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that that &apos;s a person to start boundation and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would stop doing this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it seems , after a lot of reflection , that the way to do to continue to write is to create a psychological construct , okay ?
I have to find a conversation distance between me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxiety of what reaction is going to get . And as I was trying to do . And as I was trying to do this , trying to find out through time , trying to find other societies to see if they could have the ideas and more healthy to see if they could have the ideas and more healthy to see if they could have the ideas and more healthy to be .
how to help people to manage the creative emotional inerents of creativity .
And that research has brought me to the Great and ancient Rome .
Segue , because I &apos;m a circle and then go back .
In ancient Grex and ancient Rome -- people wouldn &apos;t think creativity to believe that creativity is from men , OK ?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit of divine and that was to be in a few surgery , and sell men someone distant and health .
The Greek called these &quot; Divity &quot; &quot; demons &quot; demons &quot; . &quot;
Soke , wonderful , it believed to have a demon wisdom .
The Romans were the same idea , but they called the kind of spirit without a genius .
Which is great , because Romans didn &apos;t really think a genius was a very smart .
And they would realize that a genius was this kind of divine that was created literally in the walls of a artist , a little bit like Dobby , and that came out to assisted the work of the artist and model &apos;s work of the artist and model of that job .
Here &apos;s the construction -- here is , that the distance of which I talk -- that psychological costruth that protected you from the results of your work .
And everybody knew that was so that it was , right ?
So the anti-people who were protected by certain things , like , the too much narcism , right ?
If your work was exceptional , you couldn &apos;t take all the whole market , everybody knew that was helped by this genius ,
If your false work , it wasn &apos;t all the false , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be an incapable .
And so people have been fulled creativity in the West for a long time .
Then the Renaissance came and everything , and nactic this great idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe , and the mysteries and mysteries and mysteries and no longer to the divinity .
This was the principle of humanity , and people started to think that creativity is completely from the hydroward .
And for the first time in history , he started to referring this or that artist as a rather than a person with genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big herror .
I think that we can allow somebody , a simple person to believe that as a source , the essence and the source of all mysteries , creative and the kind of creative , unknowledge and ethernal responsibility to give the psyches that you have to give the psychquems .
It &apos;s like to ask somebody to walk the sun .
Deform and completely distores the ego and create all these ingestimates expectable .
And I think it was this pression to having the artists in the past 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think it &apos;s , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do that different ?
Maybe back to a relationship between humans and creative mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t sing 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience would have no scientific substantially in the notion of the notion , you know , if you &apos;re going to be sparking the people , and they follow people to do .
I &apos;m not going to convince you all about this .
But the question I would like to ask is -- why not ?
Why not think that this way ?
Because it &apos;s more sense of all the other thing I &apos;ve ever heard to explain the exasperating exasperating of the creative process of creative process .
A process that , as anyone I &apos;ve ever tried to do something -- so , basically , all here -- it &apos;s not rational behavior .
And in fact , it can sometimes look completely paranormal .
I did this recently meeting with the extraordinary poetry Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years old , but it was a poetry to life and said that during his childhood in the field , and he heard , in the field of if a poetry to the field , when a poetry came to the landscape .
And he said , it was like a spot ,
And she was coming up to her landscape .
He felt it got to come , because he was tremendous .
She knew to have one thing to do at that point and it was to do at that point and it was to run as a match . &quot;
And so it was going to the home and he was washing by this poetry , and it wouldn &apos;t have to take a piece of paper and a faster , as he was going to take it and climbing it on the page .
Other times he couldn &apos;t be fast , so corrected and running and running out and the poetry was going to get to the home and the poetry was going to be able to roll through the loss , and she would continue to roll through the landscape , as he said , &quot; another poet . &quot;
Then there were times -- this piece I &apos;m not going to the size of the moments that the statement was almost losing the time , right ?
So , he was running home and he was looking for the paper and the poetry the past through , and he would be a wonderful walk , and he said , that he was like he walked up , and he was like to hand the offer .
He wasured the poetry from the tail and put her in his body and he put her on the page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be presented on the perfect page and intact , but to the contrast , from the last word to the first .
So when I thought -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly the same thing to my creative process .
Not all of my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conducture .
I &apos;m a moving , and my way of working is ; I &apos;m waking up to the same horarian every day and work and spend on and work and go on and work and go over .
But even I , in my test daggin , I &apos;ve striped against that thing , sometimes .
And I imagine a lot of you did .
You know , even if the work and ideas came to me from a certain source , I could not be able to know that .
And what is this ?
And how can we relate it to do not do to do that , but , rather , rather , what do you do ?
And as much as the best contemporary example I I have is the musician I have is musician , which I have interviewed in a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life was the incarnation of the artist &apos;s invemporary , cluster , trying to control , dress , dress , totally interized impulses .
But then he was driving , he was hot , and one day as he was driving on a &quot; highway in Los Angeles , he changed everything .
He was going to fast and everything , and all of a switches , and it &apos;s all the wonderful wells , and the vast as it does the inspiration , elusive , and the wants , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the desiderve , but not knows how to take it .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a math , it has a crazy record .
So , he began to be able to grow up this kind of old anxylost in him like , &quot; I &apos;m going to remain , and I &apos;ll remained by this persements .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to the panic , he stopped .
And I &apos;m going to do the whole mental process and made something completely new .
And I &apos;m going to look at the sky and said , &quot; Scause , don &apos;t see what I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Do you can write a song now ?
If you really want to exist , you go back to a more than you get care of a care of you .
Altriments , you go to important something else today .
You &apos;re going to be able to be able to be disturbing . &quot;
And his process worked changed after this .
Not the work , the work was still obscure as well .
But the process , and the heavy anxiety that was reped when he took the genius , the genius that was going to remove it to the back of where he was going to remove it back to where it was coming back , and then realized that didn &apos;t have to be an interior .
but I &apos;m going to be this peculiar , wonderful pieculiar with a conversation between Tom and this external thing and externails .
So how much I felt that story started to change a little bit the way I was working and saved me once .
This idea , he save me when I was writing , &quot; Mangy , &quot; and falls in one of those of disaster of the desperation where we all work on something and we &apos;re working on something and we &apos;re going to be a disaster , which is going to be a disaster , which is going to be the worst book or ever written .
Not just bad , the worst book , right .
And I started thinking about throw this project .
But then I reminded me of Tom who was talked to the air and I tried to the air and tried to the air and tried to the air and I tried to the air and I tried to the air and I tried to the air and I tried to the air and I tried to the air and I tried to the air and I tried to the air and tried to the air and I tried to the air and I tried to the air and tried to the air and I tried to the air and tried to the air and I tried to the air .
So I went up my face in the manoscrits and I bought my comments to a corner of the room .
And I said to the voices , &quot; Sends , what , you both know that if this book won &apos;t be brilliant , it won &apos;t it &apos;s going to be won &apos;t it ?
Because as I see , I &apos;m putting everything I have , I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want to be better , you have to show you and do your part .
Okay . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , I don &apos;t do .
I &apos;m going to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I would like to make my hand that was recorded that I today , I &apos;m presented to do my part , &quot; because , it &apos;s so , OK -- it &apos;s doing in the deserts of Africa , people would raded for the wonderful moon , dance and hours to the alba .
And they were always wonderful , because the dancers were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every once , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists had actually become transanated .
And I know you &apos;ve got to talk , because I know you &apos;ve all seen it , at a point , a performance like this .
It was like the time he stopped , and the dancing banned walked through a kind of laptop and she wasn &apos;t doing anything different from the solutions , but everything was all .
And suddenly , as a human .
But it turns out from the divinity and down to the divinity .
And when this happened to , at time , people knew what was , people knew what was , they called him .
They had the hands and started to sing , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , God , Allah , God , God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
And he was the historical -- when the More invasured Mers invaded the Spain , they took this habitude with them and the pronounced the south changed by &quot; Allah , &quot; Ole , &quot; Ole , &quot; Okay , &quot; Oh , &quot; Oh , &quot; Oh , &quot; Oh , &quot; Oh , &quot; Oh , &quot; Oh , you can still hear in the flamens .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , books , burst , broken , broken , here , a God of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes the day after , for the dances , when you wake up and discovered that they &apos;re 11 morning and discovered that are the 11 of Martedesday and the woods it wasn &apos;t .
It &apos;s simply a death with a lot of bad to ginocky , and maybe not going to be able to ask that altitude .
And mayor nobody &apos;s name God as again as it &apos;s a gotten , and what does the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most sweatest recognciliations to do in a creative life .
But maybe not so anger to be so anger if you can &apos;t believe , anzyutto , that the most extraordinary things that are the most extraordinary things are coming from you .
But I just think that you &apos;re going to have data in the soon from an unimaginable unimagery of this squid part of your life you have to go to something else when you &apos;ve got to go to something else when you &apos;ve got to go to something else when you &apos;ve got .
And , you know , if we think it all changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s certainly like the book in the book that I &apos;m going to do this , the book that I &apos;m going to do , the dangerous , I spaventually followed by my grain , and I &apos;m going to be successful .
And what I have to keep saying to me when I &apos;m electrzed by this is , not to be afraid .
Don &apos;t beavy you . It just your work .
It &apos;s about the way to present you for your part , whatever it can be .
If your work is balance , bought .
If the wish , absurd genius assigned decides to leave some kind of wonderful , for one moment through your efforts , then , &quot; Oh , &quot; Oh , &quot; Oh , &quot; Oh , &quot; Oh , &quot; Oh , &quot; Oh , &quot; Oh ,
Altracks , you do the same dance .
And &quot; Ole it ! &quot; She &apos;s got you . &quot;
I think we have to teach it .
&quot; You know , &quot; at yourself , even for you had human and test love and test loves that you &apos;re going to present you continually .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
And as you know , I &apos;ve already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can mean and the discovery of new set of genes .
Now we &apos;re beginning a new path : we started to digitalize biology and now to start from that digital code we &apos;re going to a new phase of biology , designing and synthesizing life .
We &apos;ve always been trying to ask big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists , I think they &apos;ve tried to understand various loves .
We tried to several approaches , reducing it to the minimum .
We &apos;re digitizing for about 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was going to go from the analogical world of the digital world of the computer world &apos;s digital world .
Now we can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome of those that can authority to replicate in the laboratory .
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome to create a little bit more smaller .
We &apos;re able to eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 of the 500 that are here .
But when we look at a metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our own .
Creemes , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at a time , it &apos;s very improbable that this can bring to a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to design was synthesize this chromosome in a way we could modify the components to ask some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of the &quot; Can we synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Can chemistry to produce these big molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create before ?
And in case , we can make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is simply a chemical piece of inert material .
The speed that we are able to digitalize life is growing to be exponential rhythm .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , rather , but it &apos;s improving .
And our recent recent recent retailed to a bunch curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process has required many passionate passion , starting with a bioethical reatens before we started the first experiment .
But we discovered that DNA is very difficult .
There are deces of thousands of cars in the world that produce small segments of DNA , of the long width of 30 to 50 letters and it &apos;s a longer process : the more than the segment is , the more errors there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments and running the errors .
And this was our first attempt , to start from digital information of the genome of Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , actually the correction of the errors and got a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material chemical material , and we put it in the bacteria , the bacteria , the bacteria code , and in the viral particles .
The viral particles are then reped by cells , they went back and they &apos;ve been back and they destroyed the E. There is .
I &apos;ve talked about recently with members of the oil industry and they have to do this model .
They recipes more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where software can actually build its hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the biggest things .
We wanted to build the whole battery chromosome .
They &apos;re over 580 sletters of genetic code .
So we thought we &apos;d build it in the cassette of virus , so we could change the casses to understand what the components are of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accurateness was a error for every 10 mile .
We &apos;ve discovered , we would have a 30 errors . If we used that original sequence we would never be able to do that work .
One part of the process is to design segments about 50 letters that they overlap with all other sletters of 50 letters to build underneath sounds that work together .
We &apos;re going to be unique elements here .
You &apos;ve probably read that we &apos;re going to stop the crazy .
Think of it . We have a genetic code based on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters code together about 20 adminminds , and there &apos;s a specific order to letters for every ammine .
So we can use genetic code to write words , frassume .
What we did at the beginning was to do it .
Some of them were burst that wasn &apos;t poetry .
We designed these segments to simply them to join them .
There are enzymes that they reped them up and put them up .
And we started to assembling parts , starting with five to seven mile , seven mile them , unendlection them , and they &apos;re 24 mile letters under letters .
We have produced these segments in abundance so we could sequenced them to sequenced that we &apos;re trying to create a very robbust .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems to be a basketburning play-basket-.
When we get these very long segments , more than 100 middle , more than 100 midddle in the E.
It comes to the limit of modern tools of molecular biology .
So we looked at other mechanisms .
We knew about a little mechanism called a homologist , which in biology is to repair the DNA can can be able to repair the segments .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism called Deinocror Deinocratic , it can absorb three million rad of radiation .
You can see in the superior as his chromosome as his chromosome as the crromosome .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s reassembled exactly as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can do completely .
They can live under empty .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life exists in space , and you move to find new environments .
Actually , NASA showed that this happens .
This is a picture of the molecule we &apos;ve built using these processes , simply using the free design of the segments to put the segments to put .
The lievening them assembly .
This image wasn &apos;t taken with a electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a very big molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that cover a period of six seconds .
This is the advertising we did a little time ago .
They &apos;re over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the biggest molecule of a definite structure ever created by man .
It has a weight molecular spring 300 million .
If we stop it with a career 10 without spaces , it would take 142 pages just to transcriting this genetic code .
Now , how do we do it ? How do we do that ?
Obviously , you have a virus is a game from a little boy .
It &apos;s a little more complicated when you use battered .
It &apos;s more simpler even when it &apos;s about the euuugs like our : you can just extract it to extract the nucleo and put another , which is basically the process of clonely clonely the clonely process .
In the bacteria chromosome chromosome is integrated integrated integrated that we can do a cell , but we just showed that we can do a burst from one another and activate it .
We had a chromosome chromosome from a microbial species .
The two are different than men from topes .
We &apos;ve added some gene in a way we could decide what to choose to this chromosome .
And then he skies with the enzymes in a way to kill all protein .
And when we put it in the cell was study -- and you &apos;ll open our graph was -- and the new crromosome was going to the cell .
And we were actually thought we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we have tried anyway to spin more there .
This is one of the greatest evolution .
We found that many species have added a second or a third or a third or third chrromosome somewhere , adding in a second thousands of new , and to the species .
So who thinks about evolution as a gene at a time that you modified has no grained much of biology .
There are enzymes called me &quot; restricting DNA . &quot;
The chromosome that was in the cell of it wasn &apos;t one .
The cell phone that &apos;s the cell phone that we have a sert .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other chromosome as a extraneous material , and we found it with only the cell and the new crromosome .
It became blue because of the genes we &apos;ve put .
And in a short of time , all the characteristics of a species have gone up to a new species , based on a new species , based on the new software we in the cell .
All the proteins are changed , membranes are changed , and when we read the genetic code , exactly what we &apos;ve transfer .
Now , this could look like genetic altering , but altering the software , we can change things in a way .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that here is not talking about three million years old and a half million years of evolution , and I &apos;ve already said , maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s enough when we think about our needs when we think about our needs .
We &apos;re going to spend six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Just to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one in 1946 , there will be four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find fresh fresh water and clean water , medicinals and gas for six and a half billion people .
It &apos;s going to be even more hard to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion barrel .
That means millions of barrels a day .
When we &apos;re trying to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replace them , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to realize the whole emission of CO2 from these materials that ends up in the atmosphere .
And the day , because of the discoveries that all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that they are the design components for the future .
The electronic industry is only a dozen about components , and think about how many different things came out .
Our limits here are principlally from biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have some techniques , thank you very quickly to create what we call the combination genomics , can create what we call combinatory genomic genomic genomic ,
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a a day .
Think about these 20 million different genes or to experience the processes to experience the processes to produce either or drugs , new vaccines , we can change , and we can change , and to create more molecular biology , and to create more molecular biology that in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s simply a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemical , or chemical , or carburn , production , or a carburn vaccines .
This is an instantly of some software programmed about being able to sit and design species to be able to sit and design species to the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know necessarily how they &apos;re going to be .
We know what they &apos;re exactly like the genetic code .
We &apos;re now focused on the carbon carbon .
You also see that you extract ethanol from the grain was a grain experiment .
We have carburants of second and third generation that will be used to sugar to carburants in the higher or different types of butanol .
But the only way that biology can have a great impact without a big impact without more than food and limited the cost of food and limiting the CO2 , and we &apos;re working to design that we &apos;re working to design cells that we &apos;re working to design that they can reach this , and we think we could think we have the first carbons of the carburants of how much much of the carbons of how much four-generation in about 18 months .
The sunlight bulbulbined with CO2 is a metodoor -- but in our discoveries all over the world , we found different methods .
This is a organism we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , at about 2500 feet of deep at the time temperature of the water temperature .
It &apos;s going to be using the CO2 using hydrogen as as a source of energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can incanalate CO2 , which can easily be transported through tubes , convert that CO2 in carburst , to drive this process .
So we think we could be able to repend that we could increase to increase what the bottom question , &quot; What is life . &quot; We , &quot; &quot; We , &quot; &quot; We have the goal further to replaces the whole oil industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do this TED , where can you do that ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working on to use the same methods to create vaccines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with influence , we &apos;re always always behind a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s about you find the right vaccine vaccine .
I think that this can change building vaccines in anticipate vaccines in anticipate .
That &apos;s how the future could start to be changing , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating the evolution with synthetic bacteria , archail , and finally cells .
We &apos;re so much like the improve people .
Our purpose is to do so to live long enough to try to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the most faster possible , some fundamental work , of the new technology that we took to a Microsoft in the following a year ago . This is Seadragon . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s a environment where you can interact is at local level that remote with a huge amount of data .
Here we &apos;re seeing a lot of digital photograph of digital photograph , with a kind of ownership , and so for a quick bread , and we have the images as we want .
And not matter how big the amount of information we see , how big we see , how big these collection , or images .
Most of digital photographs , but this is a scan of example , a scanning of the Congress , and it focus in the gama gapiels of 300 megapiels .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that I &apos;m just the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of plxels on your screen in any moment . It &apos;s also a very full architecture .
This is a book , example of the data , not of images .
This is Dickens of Dickens . Every colonnaked is a capital .
To show you that it &apos;s about text and not images , we can do something like this , to see really that &apos;s a real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a book ,
I don &apos;t recommend it .
This is a more realistic example . This is a number of the Guardian .
Every big image is the beginning of a seeding .
And it really gives you the pleasure of the real experience of a magazine or a newspaper of a magazine or a newspaper , which is for nature a multiplot .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the Guardian .
We created a high-solutions fasull of the higher solutions -- much higher than you use in a published normal contain .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see it here .
Or others , or even specific specific .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that this means to be able to the pop-up and other cheries like that , they should not be more to be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this isn &apos;t I want to lose time , if we don &apos;t have a contribution to give this field of the field .
These are all the streets in the United States , you know , there &apos;s geospational imagination .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually actually from the Web ; you can see it .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon , and the other is a very interesting searchy , in Noah Snavely , a student of Noah Snavely , a student of the U.K. , with the help of Steve Seads and of Research Seliski , and Research Seliski . It &apos;s very hard .
And it &apos;s from the Web , Seadragon .
You can see that when we do this kind of screen , where we can spend a picture to the other and have this kind of experience to the other , and have this kind of experience to multiple .
But the space of the images here has actually a meaningful meaningful .
The computer algorithms of the computer visualization have recorded these images together , so that they correspond to the real places that the real column , where the Rockcies on the Rockcies of canadesize . They were scacked . Then you see the elements of a slides of a slides slides , and these things have been all the space levels of the space .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a few more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original Soah-set data -- and this is from a previous prototynth prototynth , we &apos;ve done for the first time , we &apos;ve done the last summer , we &apos;ve done in the last summer , technology Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily the key . And it &apos;s not necessarily the key behind this technology ,
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a rebuildings of Nothththtrial Nothththtrial . Bauckr , you get Nothpus and Dopus and you get images of types in magic and so on . Ogns and so on . Every one of these arancies represents a picture that &apos;s discovered an image .
So I &apos;m all images takr taking out from Flickr , and they were all connected to this way .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this way we simply .
You know , I would never have thought I &apos;d end up to Microsoft .
It &apos;s very , very , very , very , very , very , very ,
I think you can see that this is a lot of different types of different kinds of different kinds of photoes to those professional cellphone to those professials that are significant , put together in this environment .
And if I can , try and I try and try and look for those more strange .
Many are block , etc .
Somewhere you &apos;re a series of photographs -- here .
This is a Nothtrial Dame recordly .
We can go from the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with the social environment . This is now taking data from the ential memory of how the Earth , from the whole point of vision -- and all those data together .
All those pictures become connected , greater than the submitted .
You have a land model of the whole ground that emerging .
Think about this as a Stephen Lawler &apos;s work on the virtual Earth &apos;s work .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as complexity as people use it , and the advantages for those who are using it .
Their pictures are marcrow by other people .
If someone comes to the idea of contrast all these sets saying the name , my photograph of Nothtrial to Nothtries to be to be in the space , and I can use it as a point of all of the data , and I can use the way to be able to be in that metaphopefully , and have a picture of anybody else , and have a social experience of anybody , and have a social experience of anyone , and have cross-copy-moil .
Of course , a consequence of all of this are extremely elaborate , extremely elaborate , and you collect not only from airs and from satellite images and satellite images and satellite memory .
Thank you very much .
CA : I realized what your software is going to be doing is that , at a certain point , in the next few years , all the photographs , all the photographs that are going to be almost in the world will be ready connected ?
BA : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is actually actually actually , it &apos;s discovered .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want to do , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it at the content of the images .
What becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of seems that many of these images can be seen .
As when you &apos;re doing a research of images on the Web page , it &apos;s a photograph and the web page on the images of the picture .
Now , what if that picture is that picture is connected to all your picture ?
So , the amount of simantlies and the amount of wisdom that comes to really be enormous . It &apos;s a classical effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible . Computers .
BA : Thank you very much .
One of the main pleases when you travel and one of the ethnographic research is the power of the people who have not forget the antic traditions , between the wind , the past in the wind , the steel , the driver is the power of the rain , he &apos;s waiting plants .
Bastes me to think that the Jaguar &apos;s still beyond the Lattea , or that the Milky of Inuit &apos;s still still more meaningful than in Himalaya , the buddy of Dharm , to remember the importance of anthropy , and that the idea that the world that we live in the importance central of anthropy , and that the idea that the world we live in which we live in no way , but it &apos;s just a model , it &apos;s just a model , but it &apos;s a model of fact , it &apos;s a model of the fact , it &apos;s just a model of the model of the same ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stirm has done , well or bad , many generations ago .
And of course , we all share the essential beautiful .
We all all do . We all do .
We are subjects in the beginning of initiation .
We have to death the inexorability of death , so we don &apos;t surprising and balley --
We all have a art .
What it &apos;s the pattern is particular rhythm of song , the dance of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that they are the Placks of Borneo , or the followed of Haiti , or the Haiti , or the Kaid-Kaids &apos;s desert , or a Haharan to Kenya , or a handle in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my journey of journey in the desert a month ago , or a hallevator of yak in the vallees of Everest , the world &apos;s mother .
All of these populations teach us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking about , other ways of thinking about , other ways of thinking of thinking , other ways of thinking , and the way of thinking , and the other ways of thinking , and we &apos;re going to be able ways of thinking , and we &apos;re going to be able to be in the world .
And , if you reflection a moment , it &apos;s a concept that it can give you hope .
So , together , the cultures of the world &apos;s myriadies of the world create a spiritual life and cultural life that is important for the planet and it &apos;s important for the well-being of the planet as biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural natela cultural nosphere and you can define the ethnosphere , the ethers , dreams , dreams , dreams , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions brought into the height of the awareness of the awareness .
The ethnosphere is the fantastic patrimony .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be in as a species .
And because the biosphere was very quietly consumed to ethnosphere and so much quickly .
Nobody , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species is about the extinction of all species is on the extinction , or -- in the most apocalyzed hypothesis in the most optimistakes in the hypothesis , and you don &apos;t even have to the hypothesis in the most optimistic diversity .
The driver of that is , of course , the loss of language .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only composed by a vocabulary or a series of grammaticals .
A language is the bake of human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle with which the animals of every culture is going to the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a bind , a thought , an actual expensive ecosystems .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re sitting in Monterey , at least half not sushed in the ears of the children .
They don &apos;t come to the kids , which is not going to be teached , unless than not wonderful , which are already death .
What is more sad of the sad of being had to be walked , of being the last to talk to a language , not to transmit the wisdom of the wisdom or to anticipate the wisdom of the kids ?
This is a fate is the state of somebody &apos;s state somewhere in the world every two weeks : every two weeks , a crazy , and he brings up the tomb of an ancient language .
And I know somebody &apos;s going to say , &quot; Is this ?
The world would not be a better place if we &apos;re talking to everybody &apos;s the same language ? &quot; We &apos;re all talking to yoruba . We talk all talk to cancer .
Let &apos;s talk about it .
You &apos;ll discover a tract thing , you &apos;ll discover what it means not to talk your language .
I &apos;d like to do a journey through a journey through ethnosphere --
a little journey in ethnosphere to give you a absolutely what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , &quot; different ways of existing , &quot; I really mean , &quot; I really mean different ways of exists .
Let &apos;s take for example this Barasana Barasana , in Amazon , the population , the population of anaconia , which creates to come from the river of the latte of the latte of saces .
It &apos;s a population that &apos;s not able to distinguished the blue color , because the blue color is the blue color , where it depends the population , and it depends the population .
They have a strange language and a marriage , called &quot; &quot; exogamic , language , &quot; : You have to go to a person who talk about a different language .
This is a drawn mythological past , yet the particularity is that in these extbag families , in which you &apos;re talking about six or seven languages , no longer languages .
They &apos;re clear to listening and then they start to talk .
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I &apos;ve lived , the Waoran of Ecuador Ecuador , an incredible population , an incredible population , an incredible population in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionararies have tried a construction that was a commercial error .
They &apos;ve been to go to the photography that they were retraditioned in a pose pose that people had never been in the same people of the bi-dimensional forest .
They &apos;ve been taken the ground photos , they turned them to the shape and , they found nothing , they have concled it to the dig , and they kill the didell , and they kill the five missionaries .
But Waorans don &apos;t just kill the stranike .
They were killed with them .
Fi54 percent of the mortality was caused by them .
We &apos;ve been up at eight generations and we found two of natural death , and when we &apos;ve been insisted to know , they &apos;ve got to know , they &apos;ve got a lot of them , and then they kill it . And then they kill it the same . Then they had a way , and then they kill the same .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine from 40 and recognize the species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was a very interesting job when my Harvard of Harvard professor Harvard to Haiti to go to Haiti to intrue in the bottom of the power of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutside , and Tonton Macoutside , and Tonton the ground .
To make sense of a miraculous , I should have to understand the Vodoun culture and the Voodoo culture is not nor magic .
It &apos;s a pretty quickly complex metaphysics of the world .
Many interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesime , Islam , Budddgment , etc .
A continent is always gone out of the sub-Saharan Africa has no religious features . And instead , and Voodoo is not the distilled of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of naked in the tragic aspores of slavish .
What makes the voodoo is the intense report of life and death .
So , the you have to be born .
The spirits can be invocated by the Great Aquires , they respond to the dance of the dance of the vive soul in such the anima very short that we &apos;re going to be the god .
So , the voodoodoodoodds , you white you go to the God &apos;s talking about God .
We &apos;re going to say in temple and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re posset , is the spirit you , how do you do the bad of the bad ?
So you &apos;ve been assist these incredible events : followed voodoo in state of transize that touch impowered a demonstration rather strong the body when it &apos;s catched in a state of extreme .
I &apos;ve been all the populations that I lived the most extraordinary Kogi in Sierra Nevada Marta , in Colombia .
And it turns out that we were living on the carebiothers who were on the carairs of Colombia , the population , the population was going to be on the massive vulcanic watching planning carbon planning carbon .
In a landscape continent , this population never been conquered by the spagners .
And I &apos;m government today I &apos;m government by a cler , but their formation is very extraordinary .
The young people followed away from the families to three or four , and they live in a world that &apos;s made of a good broken and shaded in a world of the glacier for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years of exactly to reproduce the nine months of extbroky that transpended into the user of the Great Mather .
So , for all this time , they are acculated to the values of their societies , values that they predict their prayers , and only their prayers are the balance balance .
And the term of this incredible initiation , they &apos;re improviding out and for the first time , at 18 years , they see a healthy stuff . And in that actim of the first bag , when the sun sun buts the values of beautiful landscape , everything that they learned in the whole bag . The precisely is conmitted in the whole bag . The precise a step behinier and says , &quot;
&quot; As ? Proprion , how I said .
It &apos;s studies . Now it &apos;s going to protect it . &quot;
They &apos;re called the greats and say that we , brothers , we &apos;re the destruction of the world .
This is extremely important .
When we think about indeal populations and the environment of Rhseau and the old story of the voices of the voice , which is a razy concept in its simplicity or perhaps we say that these people are close to the Earth of us .
The population are not not not sentimental people who are not indeboled by the nostalgets .
There is no space for these things in the Asmat , or in the clear in the winds of Tibet , but because of time and the time and the rhythical , and the rhythical , and they created a mystic intuition , but on a full burning bs : the concept that the Earth can only live in human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
It means that a Montana of the Ande who grows in the mountain is a spirit of Apu that will be a deep human being deped , and it will have a deep human being deped with a different mountain or that place , and it will have a little bit of a Montana that grow up to a Montana who grow up to a mountain a Montana of rocket , you know , a bunch of a Montana &apos;s clean masses .
That &apos;s the beautiful deal or a mineral cave or a mineral cave .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Britannica Columbia creating forests to be cut .
And that made me a different human being different from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the forests are the dimpowered Hukuk and the history of paradise and the history of the world , and the chance that are living in the Hamatsa began .
If you start to consider that these cultures can actually start to understand some of them , you can start understanding some of them , we can start to understand some of them .
I took this picture to open them to open the noroccurs in the noroccurs .
Maybe some of you have heard about the Eahuge , the most powerful suspsychoactive repertoium .
What makes the eye , it &apos;s not the potential pharmacological potential of substance , but his processing . It &apos;s composed by two elements .
From a hand , this lignosa liver of health carboline , harmine and harmine , harming harming and harming harmful .
Taking the only plants , you have a smoke that alters a little bit of consciousness , but it &apos;s mixed with the leaves of a coffee of the family of coffee .
This plants that are a triptamines , very similar to serotonin , methoxyltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltrylical powered .
If you ever see the Yanomami , the suses that they do from a different species of species , which is methoxydimethoxyltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltrylady .
Tiring that polish for the nose is a little bit like being disappeared by a fucies of health diptie and land on a wind of electricity . Risn &apos;t a distortion of reality .
I was often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who took the psychedelic was , with his discovery of the hallucinogens in the 1930s in Mexico .
And I think , I &apos;m not able to classified these triptames like hallucinogens because if you &apos;re doing not going to be able . You can &apos;t tell anybody to be drive . The trip can &apos;t be absolutely because they &apos;re money in a enzyme that &apos;s based in the intestine , deed mine , determ hythels .
It &apos;s possible to address only if you could make a lot of other chemical chemical substances that money are MAO .
Now , it &apos;s the beautiful : Even carboline that are in this lian inibitors of MAO , the same kind of needs to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able , but if you combine in this way , creating a biochemical version that &apos;s like this , creating a biochemical version that &apos;s perior of the parts ?
We use the great eufemism of the evidence and error , that can reveal infruit .
But if we ask the Indians , they &apos;ll say , &quot; The plants talk about . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribe , Cofan , Cofan , has 17 varieties of Ehuuggled in the forest , and that our eyes would requires in the same species .
If we ask him how they stabilisonomy their task , &quot; I thought I can &apos;t do you know , &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take 17 varieties in a notice of moon and name will cut with a different song .
With this is not a Harvard in Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting to count the priests .
Now , &#91; apples , the problem is that even the ones of us who have to the history of us who have to the history of the history of the history of our real world , and in our real world &apos;s history , and pass beyond .
In fact , the 1st century , between 300 years , it wouldn &apos;t be remined for his wonderful , or the technological innovations , but rather as we have been in and we have embractively or accepted actively or accepted to the planet . Now the problem is not going .
All cultures through the centuries were involved in a dance for new possibilities of life .
And the problem isn &apos;t technology .
The Indians don &apos;t have to be Sioux when they have been horrified by the arc and foot as as Americans don &apos;t have to be Americans when they got to get horse and hot .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that they mind the integrity of ethnosphere . It &apos;s the power .
The wonderful dall of domination .
And if you look at the world , you discover that these are not destined cultures are not destined to disappears .
They &apos;re living creatures and dynamics out of the hynames that go beyond their ability of adaptation .
And it &apos;s a disbosing inside the paths of Penan --
a population of Sarawak , in Sarawak , a population that has lived in the forest to a generation forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to the needs of the river , where you can see the river , where you can see the river of the river that seems to be out of the Borneo . The Migigger Cintry , where the Green horizon , where the Gapanese hzonte horizonic horizonest , where you have the horizon-horizon-horizon-holds .
By the slums stives with the forest wood .
Or in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that have come with the discovery of gold .
If we move on Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , where I &apos;m doing a lot of search , you see the ward of political domination .
As you know the genocide , the physics of a population , is condamaged at the universal level , but the ethninight of a population , not only condanced , but it &apos;s also not only convicted , but celebrated in the environment , because it &apos;s a part of the development .
And you can &apos;t understand the Tibet , as you don &apos;t start from the beginning .
I run 6,000 miles from Chengdoctor in the Western China , through the Western Tibet , coming to Lhasa with a young colleague , but only came to Lhasa , I &apos;ve got to understand the statistics of we &apos;re going to talk about .
6,000 sacred sacred sacred in pollus and centers .
1.2 million people killed from the military Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascrited to Panchen Lama .
Which means that it &apos;s been killed to the invasion of Chinese invasion .
Her , unclean up with Sua Santity during the diaspora that has brought the population in Nepal .
Her mother was imprisoned and his cholpan was rich .
It &apos;s been brought to hidden at the age of two naked , he could not have lived under his gleady because he couldn &apos;t have lived without .
The sister , who did the same , was put in reeducation .
One day , he &apos;s got a craffigh craffigh craffigh and , for this transgression , was put in the wood washed for seven years .
The Tibet pain can be insporky , but the spirit reductable is from tener .
At the end , it &apos;s all reduces a choice .
We want to live in the world world &apos;s world &apos;s world or we want to collect the policycroomatic world ,
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before we die said that his biggest feet was that in our own lights to love the world , we &apos;re going to see the whole whole whole gama of human imagination , but a day we &apos;ll see the whole whole crazy , but a day we &apos;re going to see us from a day we &apos;re going to be able .
And it &apos;s humiliating that our species is there for 600,000 years .
The Neolitics Revolution that has given us the agriculture , which has made us to the cult of the see , and replacing the poem of the shaman , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world industrialized world has been 300 years old .
That sharks history not suggests me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to do with the millennia to come .
When these things of the world &apos;s cultures is asked what it means to say to be human , they respond with 10,000 voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers we all rediscover the chance of being what we are : a species , and we have to be what we are , and all the gardens can floor . And there are great moments . And there are great moments of very good moments .
I took this picture on the north of Baffin the island of Baffin , when I went to the watch of whales with Inuit , and this man , and this man , Olaya , and this man , and this man , and this man , he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The canadvice canoes has not always laugh with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to stabilie our own premational , we &apos;ve been purposed to colonies .
The grandfather was going to go .
The family , tempted for his life , he brought him out of all the arms , and all of his attractioned .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t feel the cold , they &apos;re going to be in the cold .
The sleep of sleep in the origins were made of the skin , and the heads of carebs .
The grandfather wider this man wouldn &apos;t stay the arctic note or the blizard night , and the blew .
It &apos;s unglacy , it &apos;s hot the skin bag and defecated in their hand . When I did them work , they &apos;re frozen , they worked them , they work with a light .
It &apos;s spring salive on the dot of this caves and when he became solid , he killed a dog .
He schooled the dog and created a sharp with the tortors of the hacics casses , he broke a sleep , and it &apos;s gone on the banchisa , clean clean clean crown-hand .
We want to talk about cavarsels with nothing ? Rism . And this , in different ways , in different ways , &#91; Applauses &#93; is the simbulled population and all the world &apos;s initiated population and all the world &apos;s population .
In 1999 , the canadvice of the California Inuit the total control of a largest area of California and Texas med .
It &apos;s their new pathy . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a territory of independent . They all contribution all the mineraries .
One snation-state of example of how a national state can recognize with his population .
And , finally , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious at least , I think it was in these remote zones of the planet , make remote zones .
For somebody &apos;s home .
They know , they realize setions of human imagination that will come up to the drug of the other times . And for us all of these children , as dreams of our children , become part of the geography .
For finally , we have National Geographic , we &apos;re convinced that politicians will never come to nothing .
We believe that polemy --
&#91; As &#93; not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and we believe that stories can change the world , and perhaps we &apos;re the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month our site , 35 million visit .
156 countries transmitted our television .
Our requires are slabels from millions of people .
Our work is to travel in the etnosphere to bring our public in the audience of the cultural wonderful , as they saw and hopes , hopefully , to be able to be in the central world : the marketing of anthropology : the marketing of life in a different pluralistic world and to find a lifestyle world and we have to find a lifestyle world and multicultural world and multural pluralist and myists and multiculticultural world ,
where the wisdom of all the populations can contribute to our well-being willing .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope to reach anything else you &apos;ve heard and I &apos;ll try to evidence some connection , in case not notion .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the officer . &quot;
The dogm of officer what ?
The dogma offices of all Western societies . The dogma offices : &quot; If we want to men the well-being of our citizens &quot; The way to do it is to men the individual freedom . &quot;
The reason is , from a side , in fact that freedom is in itself a value , is precious , it &apos;s essential , it &apos;s essential , essential , is essential , the essential , is essential , in fact that freedom is in itself a value , in fact that freedom is in itself a value , is essential , the essential , is essential , in fact that freedom is in itself a value ,
On the other is that if we &apos;re free , each of us can act to do everything that that maximizes our well-being , without any any one that we decided to name .
The way to masses freedom is to massy the choice .
The more choices are more free , and greater is their liberety , the greater is their well-being ,
This , I think , it &apos;s so deep radicated in society that no one would be dreams to put it in a doubt .
And it &apos;s also deep radical in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m going to allow a simple note on the conduction .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conducts , without the content 10 varieties of oil and 12 acets of oil and 12 acets that you can buy to make a huge number of conduction in the rescillenses that no one of the 75 , already pronce that nobody &apos;s already to your degree .
That &apos;s what the supermarketing .
Then you go to the electronic stereo to buy a stereo : cases , CD lets , plastra , plastra , amplifier .
And in this single store of electronic pursue , there &apos;s a big number of components .
We can make six and a half million different combinations of combinations that there are only one store .
You have to admit that there &apos;s a lot of choice .
Other fields : the world of communications .
Once I was a child , you could get all all the telephone services , they could get all the phone services , they were provide mama Bell .
It was born the phone , they didn &apos;t buy it .
One of that , by the way , by the way , was that the telephone would never romed .
These times have gone .
Now we have a varieties almost illimited phones , especially between cellular .
Here &apos;s the future .
My favorite is that in the middle , MP3 , cuts of nose , and the bakery for the cruster .
If you don &apos;t have it again , you &apos;ve got to have a house , you &apos;re not looking at it will be in the soon .
And what happens is that the end is that people get into the needs and does this question . And you know what the answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the acquired of the aquarters , the same explosion of choices .
Assistence : no longer in the United States that you go from the doctor and doctor doctor and doctor you have to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do it , or B , &quot; has these benefits , &quot; B has these benefits . &quot;
You say , &quot; Doctor , what should I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A has these benefits and these goes , and the risks , and these benefits . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebat , &quot; Dot if she was me , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; I &apos;m not her . &quot;
We call it &quot; autonomy of the malseems of the malseems that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But in fact , it &apos;s not that a fish and the responsibility of taking decisions from somebody who knows something , which is the doctor , someone else that doesn &apos;t know -- and if you &apos;re not in the condition the patient to make decisions .
There &apos;s a huge marketing products , direct to people like me and you , that if you think about it , that if you think about it doesn &apos;t have any sense , we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why do we published them ?
The answer is that they want to ask them , we call the doctor to ask them to change it .
Something so fundamental as our identity is a question of choice , as you see in this jump , &quot; We don &apos;t want to force the kids . &quot; We don &apos;t want to force their sex . &quot; We &apos;re going to be invent . &quot; We &apos;re going to invent .
And we can reinvent how many times we can reinvent .
The means that every morning , to the risk , you have to decide that kind of person wants to be .
I &apos;m putting at the family and marriage , a time perspective , square common , almost for anyone , was that you would have the most soon as possible , and he started to make the most possible .
The only choice was with who , not when , and not even what to do after .
Ogyday , it &apos;s really to play .
I teach to a very smart students , and I do the 20 percent of work in less than a time .
And not because they &apos;re not smart , they &apos;re not because they &apos;re deavailable .
but why I &apos;m impensieritation , I mean , &quot; I should be going to go , &quot; I should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; Do I should go to me more later ? I have to think about the kids or career ? &quot;
They &apos;re interrogorant .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this implement doesn &apos;t completing the compassionate that , and not get a beautiful vote to my exactly .
And they really have to do it . They &apos;re important questions .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , like Carl Soinef was , because technology allowed us to work every day , every day , from Hotel Randolph .
In the parentesnesis , and I &apos;m not going to say anyone , where , WiFi works .
I don &apos;t tell you why I want to use it .
What does it mean , this incredible freedom of choice we have about the work ? It &apos;s that we have to continually decide , and we have to work or not .
We can go to our child , we can play with the cell phone , the Blackberry , Blackberry in the other , and the niebook , typically , on ginocknaked .
And even if they &apos;re all spent , every minute that we see our son , we also see our son , we also ask , we also asking , &quot; Do I say , &quot; I have to say , &quot; I have to say , &quot; I have to say , &quot; I have to say , &quot; I have to say , &quot; I have a little bit of our son , we also see our son , we also see our son , we &apos;re also spending
&quot; I have I answer to this email ? I have to care this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is no , this makes the experience of your child &apos;s experience of your son &apos;s very different than it would be in other conditions .
So , anywhere we look at , small and big , things , and big materials and life , life is a living thing , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : Over , there were some possibilities , but it wasn &apos;t a choice of choice .
The world today &apos;s a dilemma : The dilemma is , &quot; Is it &apos;s a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Scially , you know ,
The positive laws we all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about negative ones .
This choice is two effects of two negative effects on people .
The first one , paradoxally , is that it produces to paralysis that liberation .
And so many options that choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I offer you an example , you give you an example : a study conduct on the plans of volunteer .
A colleague has had access to the Vanguard , the giant societies of sourcing , with about a million climents in 2,000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of adhesion , the percentage of adhesion .
With 50 sources , there &apos;s 10 percent of the adhesions of them , when they &apos;re only available to when they &apos;re only five . Why ?
Because with 50 sources that choose , it &apos;s hardly hard to decide , and the choice is remained to the indomorders .
And at domories , and again tomorrow , domorders , domoranes and of course , domorders ,
You know , that doesn &apos;t mean , these workers will eat workers , because they don &apos;t have enough money , they &apos;re going to be , because they don &apos;t have enough money , it also , to say that the decision is so obstandard of the dumbers of the work .
Not to participating , they &apos;re allowing five dollars for a year from the work , that would be willing to be told .
So , the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think that makes the world as well .
And for finally , for the etchup , echoup , your feelape or maion ? &quot;
Would you like to make the right decision , if it &apos;s for ethernity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and neppursue the wrong condition .
So , this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can avoid the paralysis , and we finally , we finally have less satisfied by the result of how we would be in the choose .
And that for different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of conditions between which you choose , if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , is easy to imagine that you could do a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the alternative of the choice , and the record to the choice , and the repied record to the choice , and the diminished sodgment , and the records the the the decision , and the soddddle remained by the decision ,
even when it was a good decision .
More choices are more easy to displaced anything that &apos;s insodently insoddle that is insodddle .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call cost .
Dan Gilbert , it &apos;s very well like the value that we have to depend on what we &apos;re going to depend with .
In the rest , when there are many options , it &apos;s easy to represent the feels of alternative characteristic and be less satifying of the option that is choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m going to be in New York .
But that &apos;s what you would probably think .
There &apos;s this pia copy of Hamptons .
A place of light .
It &apos;s beavy basic . It &apos;s all about them .
Nothing . But what he thought is , &quot; Well , what he thought is , &quot; Well , malediition , is Agust . &quot;
&quot; All my neighbors in Manhattan are out . &quot;
&quot; I could talk about home . &quot;
And it goes two weeks asy from the idea that he &apos;s losing -- every day -- the chance of parking where it wants .
The cost-opportunity is decrease for what we have , even when the choice was eccellent .
And the most of the options we have to think , the more the feature of the features that we &apos;re going to return up as a cos-opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a junk tells us a lot of things .
It &apos;s about the time , and maybe of living slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you choose , you choose not to do other .
The things we don &apos;t choose are all plactive that they can make less attractive what we do .
Thirst point : spiral growth of expectations .
I tried it on my skin bought a new couple of jeans .
I brought to jeans .
Once the jeans were a kind of bought them and bought them and wears and wearing them , were only after they brought them a life and washing a lot of times , they started to go well .
So I went to buy a couple again when the old ones were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cutting . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Do you want to say , &quot; Wave them , eashphit , relaxy , relaxy ? &quot;
Do you want to do it , or with the nera ? &quot; Stonewashed &quot; or &quot; acious &quot; or &quot; acize ? &quot;
&quot; Does them stream ? &quot;
&quot; Sow the basic or stretched ? Bla bla bla -- &quot; Continured to elency .
I was saying , and after a little bit , and after a little bit , I was able to say , &quot; I want the guy , &quot; I had no idea what was , so for a time I had all the malef , then I had all the dieties , then used to the best , you &apos;re used by the best , with the best lays I &apos;ve ever had .
It was the best . I had the whole choice I had the best .
But I was worse .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand that .
The reason I was worse , is that with all that choice my expectations were high , jeans had to be perfect .
I was very much about it . I didn &apos;t expected . I wait was not exceptioning . But when there was only a kind of , but when I saw , at least a guy had to be perfect .
What I had bued was good , but not perfect .
And after I was talking about that choose what I was trying to insodently insodented in the expectations .
The addition of options in life doesn &apos;t make the expectations that these have respect to the eccellence of the options that are .
And this will produce less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing if I realize it .
Because if they knew it , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth looks more like this .
&quot; It was better when it was worst , &quot; The reason why he was better when it was worst , it was better when it was worst , it was that when he was worse , you could still meet the places of the players .
Ogn the world we live in the world we live -- opulations , citizens with the perfection of perfection -- the maximum we can hope is that the things are to the height of the heith heith .
You never surprised , because your expectations , your expectations , they &apos;re injected .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Basse exectations &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , &quot; You want to . &quot;
I mean , little moment , I &apos;m really saying , I &apos;m actually moving and my wife is really stupend .
I couldn &apos;t have to do better , I didn &apos;t have to be able .
But , it &apos;s not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of comprehened a couple of jeans is that when you &apos;re not spend you &apos;re not satisfied , and you say , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot; The answer is clear .
The world is the responsible . What could I do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a insodenter , and you ask you who is the responsible , it &apos;s as clear that the responsible you .
You &apos;d have to do better .
With hundreds of varieties available , there &apos;s no scuses for the insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even though the result is valid , they &apos;re insodented and give the basic to them .
In the last depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a full meaningful factor -- not the only important , but -- of this wave of depression is that people have experiences of the experiences because the standard is too much high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that the colpan is them .
So the final result is that we &apos;re better , but we &apos;re worst .
Let me reminds you .
This is the officer , what we all take for good , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely false . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than there , but from this wasn &apos;t going to be a lot better than a little bit .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m quite sure we &apos;ve been surgery for a level where the choices are better .
Now , from the political point -- I &apos;ve almost finished -- from the political point , the nocle is the following .
What allows in the industrial societies is the material wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know , where the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too much much .
So the faces that I &apos;m talking about is a malbe exclusive of modern , the Western societies .
And what does deprove and angry is this : Steve Levitt to you about how much expensive , and scomodd seats , and scomfortable slums are unuseful . It &apos;s a waste of money .
I mean these choices , complicated and dispendependent , it &apos;s not that they are just useful .
I &apos;m going to be deletered .
We &apos;re going to do worse .
If a little bit of what in our societies allows were revered in those where people have too few possibilities , it would not be only their life to be better , but also .
This is what economists call a improvement improvement .
A redistribution of the income , not only to everybody -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in excess that goes us .
To close : &quot; With , you can become everything you want &quot; --
You , people , you think , you think , &quot; What does that believe that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious you can &apos;t make anything nothing in a glass of glass . &quot;
&quot; An imagination , a limited vision of the world -- &quot;
and I &apos;ve been interpret in this , at the beginning .
But then , think , as I realized , I realized that that fish the long knows .
Because the fact of the fact of the fact is that if you &apos;re manages , so that everything is possible , &quot; you can &apos;t get the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you reach the broke so that everything you can decline as much as you can decrease .
You know , you know , and you reduce the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost of course , perhaps even a fish even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of a symbolic symbolic and , I &apos;m afraid , I &apos;m afraid , I think , for the roven .
Thank you very much .
