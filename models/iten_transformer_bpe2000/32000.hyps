Last year I showed these slidemonstration to demonstrate that the climbing glacial glacial , which for almost three million years had the 48 United States continental continental , and it &apos;s recorded 40 percent .
But there is this underestimating gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice of the ice .
The arctic heat is , in a certain sense , the heart heart of the global system .
You expanding inside and the summer of summer .
The next slide slide is going to be a rapid carried on the last 25 years .
The ice loss are drawn in red .
And you see , they expand the blue .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter , which is the summer of summer .
You can see that the perenn code , five years , it &apos;s like the blood , which is like the blood , which is like the blood , which is like the blood .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been so .
This is a problem because the interests the floor of the glacier around the ocean arctic amount of the arctic papers that , and they &apos;re moving , they &apos;re moving into metane from micrombs .
Rist to the totality of the atmospheric atmospheric , that amount could radd , that amount could radar , super-hythrow up , super-hythrow up , you know , super-hythellow , and then it &apos;s not .
In some laghi little deep in Alaska , the metane is already rebolding from the water .
The Katey Walter of the University of Alaska was receded with a team , a team lago , a team lago , and I &apos;m going to winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : She &apos;s good . The question is if we &apos;re going to be .
A reason is that this termal termal scale the Greenland from north .
This is a figures in the glacial ryal .
The brought had never reached livels .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the South Dilllush .
If you want to know how to know the level of the sea slippink on the shelter , here is where it comes where it is to the sea .
These corrents are increasing rapidly .
At the other side of the planet : Antarctica of ice the planet .
The month scientists have diclare clear that the ice of ice is in negative , and that the Antarctica , which is the Antarctica , which is particularly rapid subtle , is particularly rapid in the shape .
Equizeival five feet of the watching watching , like in Greenland .
Sull Himalaya , the third biggest block , you see new laghot laghi , that a few years ago , and they were glaced .
40 percent of the world population is going to be half of water from that leaves .
Sulle Ande : this ice is the source of the water power of this city .
The laptop is increased .
But when you declines , the same accounts of water .
In California , the snow on the Sierra Nevada is declined 40 percent .
The hyrics are in crisis .
The predictions , as you read , they &apos;re smooth .
The growing growing of the world is a remarkable increasing an increases .
environmental disaster are increasing a rhythm out of normal and without previous .
Four times more numerous than the last 30 years of the previous 75 .
This is an unsustainable to the whole unsustainable .
If you look at it in the historic context , if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 25 tons of CO2 , every day , 25 million tons in the oceans .
Look at the East Pacific area , from American area , from American , and on the West , and on the bottom of Indian subcontinent , where there is a radical impoverments in the ocean .
Most of global warming , together to deforestation , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and the paper is even worst .
The United States are one of the two more emissions , together to China .
And he was proposed to build a lot of other central central .
But we &apos;re going to be a change .
These are the announced in the last few years and some of the alternative alternative .
At every way , there &apos;s a political side our country .
The carbon industries and oil are spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon , which is a hosymen .
That imagine I remember something --
Natal Cang , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion lost pitches of carbon .
You may have seen it on the news .
This is the second biggest flow of scories in America .
It &apos;s happened around Natal .
The publishing of one of the carbon industries was this .
Video : the carbon , the carbon is a kind of food and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it makes our economy .
Fross the carbon is more and more and more and more and more and it .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and work maintains stipended stipended .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest society on , the mountains is Massey Coal . This is the aministrator .
Don Blankenship : Don Blankenship -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelososis , Harry Reid -- don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clotetion .
This is one of the same one part .
Video : Ator : At COALergy , we see the climate change as a serious serious serious as a serious serious series .
So , why we have a big amount of money in a big amount of money in a bad ad ad ad ad ad public and confused the truth .
In fact , the carbon isn &apos;t spork .
We think it &apos;s clean , it &apos;s also a good profumo .
So , not preocateventually preocatevening .
Let me go to us .
Video : Ator : Carbone -- you &apos;ve heard a very much .
So let me take a tyrrate in a clean to address .
Straditional machines are a little bit , but this is the sound of the technology of the paper .
The carbon of carbon is between the main causes of global warming , but the night technology of clean clean , but the night technology that you see change everything .
Date a look at the clean : this is the path of the clean .
Al Gore : Inally , the positive native alternative alternative and the national security .
Video : My America is in crisis ; the economy , the national security climate crisis .
The fild phils that all : our dependence from fossil combustible fossil paper and oil .
Now , there &apos;s a new audace , solution for it .
Repower America : 100 percent of fair , 10 years .
A floor to repect America to make more safety , and help to help the global warming .
Finally , a solution that &apos;s solution to solve our problems .
Repower America . You cover more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It &apos;s about energy .
One of the fastest ways to get to dependence from the combustable to kill our planet .
She knows : The future is here . I feel , a new energy network .
She talks to two : Noves investment for places of jobs .
Something : Repower America . It &apos;s time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old old baframe says , &quot; If you want to go fast , you go .
If you want to go away , you go together . &quot;
We need to go away , we need to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED I made an introduction on the LHC .
And I promise to return you about how the machine works .
So , here I fix . And for the other time , the LHC is the biggest scientifiever experiment , scientifiever ever attempted -- 27 kilometers of circumference .
His task to remaining the conditions that were less than a billion second on the beginning of the universe -- at 600 million times a second time .
And that &apos;s all of that is just environment .
This is the Ginevening the S.
We picture these mini-Bang Bang inside the resid-Bang inside the resive .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLATLATLAS -- it &apos;s a 44 feet .
This is a spectacular image of ATLATLAS in buildings so you can see the proportions .
Ten secember last year we have access the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was cause of the huge festegments in control .
It &apos;s a first picture of the particles that had done all around the LHC , and it was going to collision , with a collision , with a part of the LHC , and spread in the seven-out .
In other words , when we see that image the 10 secember , we realized that the machine worked , which is a great vitter .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to make more or this , when somebody went on Google and saw that the beginning was this .
That means we had a cultural impact to that scientific .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , and it had to these files here -- these dories .
These films bring 13,000 loves when the machine works at the very powerful of power .
Now , the technicians in you will look at the files and say , &quot; That &apos;s not true . &quot;
And they can do that because when they &apos;re very cold . They &apos;re very cold .
So , at less 271 degrees , to a inferior temperature to that deleted space between stars , these phils can bring that run .
In one of the yunture of the younger in the LHC , there was a fabrical fect .
So , the films slightly , and 13,000 advanced , and 13,000 ampount of suddenly meet .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think that these magnets fishing more than 20 tons , and that are moved of about 30 feet .
They &apos;re damaged about 50 magnets .
We had to take them , what we did .
We reprialed them and travels .
Now they &apos;re coming back all the substand and they &apos;re going to get back to their submit .
the end of the marzo LHC is will be new integrate .
We &apos;ll be going to happen , and we expect data on jugment or to be able to find out what the morning is the morning , and we &apos;ll continue to find out what they &apos;re the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these accidents readed the dibate on the value of science and engineering engineering . It &apos;s easy to confuture .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so difficult , it &apos;s the fact of going to be , I think that is the value of things like LHC .
I &apos;d like to end with the words of a Inglese scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , imagine , in the difesa , in the bad experiments of his pupiler , his pupiler was Michael Faraday , he said , &quot; Nothing is so dangerous for the progress of the human mind that the ideas of science that ideas of science that the ideas of science that our tributs , and our triethroom . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start asking the wind to think when , from children , from children , played cyyourself .
While you can understand them and deal with them , you can take them and move them , you learned , and you learn , and you learn to think and solve problems and manipulating relationships .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , from information , from the use of our interaction with physical objects , together my consult . And my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to ask me , &quot; And if we use a computer , I started to ask me , &quot; And if we use a computer , we could have the move on a desktop , we could have a desktop , we could have a desktop with the information .
and systemate our placement ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer , a great computer interactive as a biscoom .
In a few words , a Siftable computer , a great computer interactive as a biscoom .
You can move them with the hand , they can see &quot; you can see &quot; you &quot; between them , you feel their movement and they have a radio .
But most of physical things , like morning , as the morning , you can move just fully deal with them .
The Siftable is an example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as a lot of more physical , knowledge of their movement , and as they become more physical , and they &apos;re getting more physical , of the other people , how we can explore new and fun style and fun interaction .
I &apos;m going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configurated to show : if you just incline in a direction , the video , the video , it will rotate on the other side .
These interactive revert of other other people .
If you go and I , you know , they &apos;re interested in .
If they &apos;re circums , they see it and they can act a little bit .
If they &apos;re circums , they see it and they can act a little bit .
They are also living their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power to use communicate gestures , &quot; a color as if it was a liquid color as if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable , as a center of versor , I can use them to be use to the color in the central color in the central , where you missing .
and I can use them to pay them to the color in the central , where they missing .
And if we &apos;re too , we can put a little place .
They also are beautiful possibility of learning , like languages , the mathematics and logical jewels where people can try things to try and see the results of it .
Now , I &apos;m --
This is a Fibonacks of Fibonacks that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a game of words that is in the half Scarabeer and Boggle .
Pratically , to every turn , you get a letter to , in case on any Siftable , Pratically , to every turn , you get a letter to case on any Siftable , and while cers of compositionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new section of letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the children came up to the Media Lab , I did so I did it so I did them , and I turned a video .
They are very , very , very , very , very ,
And one of the interesting things of this application is that you don &apos;t have to give people many instructions .
You just have to say , &quot; Compons of words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s some other people who try it .
This is the younger , there &apos;s the young .
It really really wanted to implempile .
They were only morning .
Now , this is an interactive application of a interactive cardboard .
We wanted to build a tool for languages , Lui is Felix .
It can put the new characters in the scene , soliftable .
It can put the new characters in the scene , soliftable .
So , he &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : The sun is surprising .
David Merrill : Now he brought a tractor in the scene .
Video : The arange treator .
Bel work ! Yeah ! Yeah !
So schooling the Siftable and put them near can interact the characters --
Video : Bau !
To invent their story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a fundamental story , and it can decide him as it turns out .
DM : It &apos;s a fundamental story , and it can decide him as it turns out .
Volas : Get away .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , realized recently , to walk and exef music .
it &apos;s a tool , realized recently , to walk and exeguys .
The Siftable here are aggate sounds , base and battery .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also put on these sounds in a sequence to compose on your placement .
And modificate it just doing a sequence . &quot;
These are effects that you can control from the vive , like the reversal and philter .
And then it into a particular sound and then clines to figure out .
And then there are the general effects as time and volume , which is the full of the whole sequence .
Let &apos;s look at how it works .
DM : We &apos;re going to start putting a base in two Siftable . &quot; sequence , we &apos;re doing it in a series , we &apos;re going to extend , we can add it .
Now , I put a basic line .
DM : Now I add add of percussions --
DM : And now I &apos;ll put the filter to the battery , so I can control the effect from the face .
DM : DM : I can speed the whole sequence by inclining the whole sequence on the other .
DM : And now I &apos;ll add the load film to the lower lower to give more expression .
DM : DM : I can reach the sequence . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to plan it first , but I can try , and I can try it , and it &apos;s more correct or more correct or more correct .
And now , finally , I can smoke the whole sequence by inking on the left Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is build new man machine and more like , it &apos;s more like , it &apos;s going to work in how our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this pattern , and also some possibilities that we &apos;re trying to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to transmit is that it &apos;s coming up with this new generation of design objects to interact with digital media , that will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the hour to talk to you all .
I &apos;m a writer .
Books is my profession , but it &apos;s more of this , of course .
It &apos;s also the love and the fashion of my life .
And I don &apos;t expect that to change .
But , said this , something particular has happened in my life and my career , and in my career , which bringing me to realibrate the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is I recently written this book , this biography called &quot; Manway , Prua , &quot; Ama , &quot; which , very different from my previously books , for some reason that it was a big feeling , and it was a big feeling , uninterational bestseller .
And the result is that everywhere in now , people treating me as if I was convicted .
Daveally -- convicted , convicted !
They &apos;re all worried about me and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t you can &apos;t be fear that you can &apos;t do you can &apos;t do that ?
You have no fear to continue to write all the life without power that &apos;s lifetime to create a book that can care that makes someone important ? &quot;
What can you care to be ? &quot;
It &apos;s rassuring , you know .
But it could go worse , part of that I remember more than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a critor .
I would meet the same reaction as a fear .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you can &apos;t get to succeeded ?
You don &apos;t have fear that the humiliation of killed you ?
You have no fear of doing this all life without any life without any lifetime without you die and die on a cumule of every infrants with the mouth of lder , and you know , the floor to floor ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
Yes , I fear of all those things .
I &apos;ve always been afraid .
And I have a lot of other things that people could not inside .
Like the floor and other things .
But , as much about what I thought , and I was thinking and I was asked , I would ask me is why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logical that anyone who have been waiting for being spavented by a work that you feel like to do .
But what is so particular in the creative creative to make us nervous health about the mental health .
Like my father , for example , he was a chemist and I don &apos;t remember once in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if you fear to be able to be able to be able to be able to be ?
There was never -- that &apos;s that &apos;s the engineer John , how do it ?
It didn &apos;t work that , you know ?
Onestly , chemicals as a group have no , in the centuries , in the centuries , the reputation of being high high manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized management as a group .
We have enough , we have enough this reputation , and not only writers but creative of each gender , we have this reputation of being enormous instables mentally .
And it &apos;s not going to look at the trists of the magnifies of the magnific dead , only in the 21st century , they died young people died younger and often for them .
And also , the ones that don &apos;t have suicidated to be really displays by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before , in the last interview , in the last interview said , &quot; Every my book has killed me a little more . &quot; A extraordinary des about their life .
But we don &apos;t bad when we heard these things so long that we &apos;ve been hearing these things that we &apos;ve completely interiorized and accepted the notied that creativity and suffering the ceasing and suffering is somehow that art , and the art , it will always conduce the class .
And the question I want to take all over here today is : are you agree with this idea ?
And that &apos;s good -- because it also looks at a centimeter of distance to me , not that &apos;s good for nothing to suppose .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous and I don &apos;t want to see the perpetuate in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better encourage our creative creative to live .
And I know that , in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start figlowing figer to that feel of suppose , to be very danger in which I &apos;m in my career .
That &apos;s what you know -- I &apos;m a young people , I have about 40 years .
I have still about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that whatever write is going to be right from now , and then it &apos;s going to be judged out of my last book .
I &apos;m going to be slippulling , because we &apos;re all more friends here -- is likely to my biggest success to my horse .
Oh , Gesus , who thought .
You know this is the kind of thinking that it brings a person to start bers in the morning and I don &apos;t want to start broads and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would stop going to keep doing this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it seems to me , after many reflection , that way to work to continue is to create a psychological construct , OK ?
I have to find a security distance between me , which I &apos;m writing , and I &apos;m writing my natural high , and I was looking for the year . And as I was looking for the year scored , and I was looking for the year , trying to do it , trying to see if they could have some better ideas and more and more and more unlike it , and more unlike it could have better ideas and more and more unlike it .
about how help people make creative risks emotional inerds risks emotional who are emotional who are creativity .
And that research has brought me to the ancient Grex and ancient Rome .
I &apos;m drawing me because it goes back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t look like to believe that creativity to be from men , OK ?
And it was thought that creativity is this spirit of the beautiful vine , and he came to a few slights and unknown , for distant distant and unknown .
The greatest called these spirits of the berits of creativity &quot; demons . &quot;
Socrate , wish , believed to have a demon that was wisdom .
Romans were the same idea , but they called the same idea , but they called the spirit of a genius .
which is great , because Romans didn &apos;t really think that a genius was someone in the genius was someone particularly smart .
And they thought a genius was this divine that was created as a literally living literally in the walls of a study , a little bit like Dobby , and that was like Dobby , and it came out to hidden the work of that work .
Here &apos;s the distance of that -- here is the distance of which is the distance of which is the psychological construct that you get you from the results of your work .
And they all knew that was so that it worked , right ?
So , the antic artists were protected by certain things , like the narcism , right ?
If your work was exceptional work , you couldn &apos;t take all the market , everybody knew that you were helped by this kind of incorporation .
If your fallies , it wasn &apos;t all colpainting , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be an unable .
And so people han concept for the West for a long time .
And then the Renasment came and everything changed , and nacross this big idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe , and not leaving space to the mixing and no more space to leave space to the creatures that wrote from divinity .
This was the principle of rational humanity and people began to think that creativity was completely the creativity completely .
And for the first time in history , he began to reference to this or that is like a rather than a person with genius .
And I have to say , I think it was a big error .
I think that allow somebody , a simple person to believe that it &apos;s like a reciplier , the essence and the source of all mysteries , creative , unknowledge and the heck of humans .
It &apos;s like to ask someone to inrow the sun .
Deape and completely creates all of these expectations on performance .
And I think it was this pression to destroy the artists in the past 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it &apos;s , the question becomes , and now ?
can we do that very different ?
I may come back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery .
Or maybe not .
We can &apos;t have a 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience that would solve the scientific public , and you know , you know , you do that , you do , you do that , you know , if you &apos;re going to smoke or their projects .
I would not convince you all on this thing .
But the question I &apos;d like to ask is -- why not ?
Why don &apos;t you think that way ?
Because it has more sense of all other thing that ever heard to explain the exasperating of the exasperating of creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever told to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- so , you don &apos;t understand rationally .
And in fact , it can be completely paranormal .
I did this meet recently , with the extraordinary poeter Ruth Stone , which has been a few years , but it was a few people who was a few people who had a few people in the time and said that during his childhood in the Virginia , and he felt , in the field was coming from the landscape .
He said he was like a slipink slippay-up .
And she came up to her landscape .
And he was going to be , because he was tremendous land under his feet .
She knew to have one thing to do to that point and it was , words , &quot; running like a matters . &quot;
And so it was running to home and he was wasn &apos;t , and it would not have to have to get a piece of paper and a fairly fast from , as it , as he would collect it and deal with it on the page .
Sometimes he couldn &apos;t be fast be enough , so correct and correct correct and correct roll out of the home and the poetry and then she would continued to roll through the landscape , and she &apos;s going to rolate through the landscape , and he would continued to roll through the landscape , and he would continued to roll through the landscape , so that he could not be able to be able to be able to be able to come to the home and and and then it &apos;s going to roll through
And then there were many times -- this piece of the next thing I &apos;ll never forget that -- there were any moments when they were allowing it , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was trying to get a little bit and the poem through , and he was willing a writing in the time , and he was like you walked up , and he said , that he was like you walked up with the other hand and the office .
He had the poem from the tail and put it into his body and put it into the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page and intact , but the contrary , on the last word on the first .
So when I felt it -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly the same creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conducture !
I &apos;m a move , and my way to work is ; I &apos;m wake up to the same horario every day and work and go and go and go and go out .
But I even had a little bit of the testardaggin , I &apos;ve been test against that thing , sometimes .
And I imagine that many of you , you know , you know ,
You know , even though the work and ideas came to me , you know , I could not be slippaid .
And what is this ?
And how can we relate it to do it in a way to lose the head , but , rather , that do you can relate healthy healthy ?
And as much of the best contemporary example I have is the musician musician , which I have interviewed interviewed in a few years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life was the incarnation of the artist comes across , trying to control , trying to control , toms , totally interested in interested in the entire species of interested in interested in .
But then he was driving , and he was driving on a huge pitches in Los Angeles , changed everything .
He was going to fast and all of a slipath that little bloon , it comes into its head like inspiration , and it &apos;s wonderful , and the lesser , and the pursuit , and the waiting , and the desiderve , but not knows how to take it .
It has no piece of card , it has no matters , it has no cool .
So it starts to feel this species of old old old old , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;ll remarry obsessed by this personal song .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to the panic , he stopped .
And he gave the whole mental process and made something completely new .
And I &apos;m going to look at the sky and said , &quot; Scause , not see that I &apos;m dying ? &quot;
&quot; You know , you know , &quot; Do you can write a song ?
If you really want to exist , you go back to a more player when I can take care of you .
You &apos;re going to care someone else today .
You know , Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his process worked changed after this .
Not the work , the work was still like always .
But the process , and the heavy , the heavy thing was regided when he was prised when he was prised anything else that problems and libered it and liberry it and libergets out where it was coming from , and realized that he had no interiorized and forged .
but he was wonderful , wonderful , wonderful , wonderful , and this external thing that &apos;s external and external thing that was not Tom .
So , how much I felt that story began to change a way I was working on and save me once .
This idea , he save me when I was writing &quot; Manway , Prua , Ama , and fall into one of those cave where we &apos;re working on something and we &apos;re all working on something and we &apos;re working on something and you start thinking that &apos;s going to be a disaster , which is going to be the worst book or ever written .
Not just bad , just the worst book .
And I started thinking about themselves to throw this project .
But then I remember Tom who talked to the air and I tried to try .
So I went up my face in the manoscrits and I would say my comments to a corner of the room .
And I said , &quot; You know , &quot; Healthough , what we &apos;re not going to be brilliant won &apos;t be bright , you &apos;re not going to be bright ?
Because as I see you can see that I have , I don &apos;t have more than that I have ,
So if you want to be better , you have to give you you and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , you don &apos;t do anything .
I &apos;m going to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to do for that was recorded that I today to do my part . &quot; Because it &apos;s so , &quot; OK -- it &apos;s so , OK -- it &apos;s so , OK --
And they were always magnific , because the ballos were fantastic professionals and they were fantastic .
But every time , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists become actually transformer .
And I know what I talk about , because I know you &apos;ve all been viewed , at a point , a performance that .
It was like the time , and the dancer walked up , and the balery walked through a kind of lost , and it was doing nothing at the same time , as the 1,000 notes before , but everything .
And suddenly , I don &apos;t just as a human .
But it happened from the diddriver and under the divinity .
And when this was happening , to the time , people knew what he was , they called it with her name .
They were congunning the hands and began to dogogographs , &quot; Allah , God , God , &quot; God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curious storic -- when the More invaded -- when the Mom invaded Spain , they took this habits and basic changed in the centuries of &quot; Allah , Allah , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; in the flow .
In Spain , when an artist did something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , books , bonebring , and burn , &quot; bincomprehensible , there -- a God scorm of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes the day after , for the dancerin the dancing itself , when you wake up and down that are the 11 morning and down there is the 11 morning and the scorames of God , there &apos;s no more .
It &apos;s just a bad bad with a lot of bad to ginocy , and maybe never to be able to be able to be able to get to the treatment .
And maybe no one of God , and what &apos;s going to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most sweetest reconciliations to make a creative life .
But maybe not to be so angosciant if you can &apos;t believe , if you can &apos;t believe , ancient extraordinary exects of your being come from you .
But it just makes you just get data data in the floor of this source of this source you have to be a full of your life that you have to go to someone else when you &apos;ve finished .
And , you know , if we think about this everything change .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s certainly like I thought for several months during the work of the book that I &apos;m going to take the perangerous , spavently , spavently , spavently , spavently , so it &apos;s been followed by my great success .
And what I have to keep saying when I feel electrized by this is , not afraid .
Don &apos;t walk . It just your work .
Continuates for your part , any one of the way to be .
If your work is ball work , ball .
If you get the divine , asking you decide to leave some kind of wonderful wonderful , for only moment through your books , then you know , &quot; Ole ! &quot;
You &apos;re going to do that you get the same dance .
And &quot; Ole it ! &quot; to you . &quot;
I think , you have to go and I think it &apos;s got to teach it .
&quot; You know , &quot; to you , just for having had love and test love and test and test later , you &apos;re going to give you continually .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
You know , I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects on the human genome , on what it can mean and discovery and discovery of new genes .
Now we &apos;re beginning a new perasive : we began to digitalize biology and now deal with that digital code . We &apos;re going into a new biology , designing and synthesizing and synthesizing life .
We always tried to bring big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists I think they &apos;ve been trying to figure out out of levels .
We tried different approaches , reducing it to minimes .
We &apos;re digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treating to go from the analogical world of the digital world of the digital world .
Now , we can regenerate life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome of those that can authorem into the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome for creating one more small .
We &apos;re able to eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 of genes that are here .
But when we &apos;re a look at its metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively respect to our .
Creden me , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it &apos;s very unliving cell that this can bring to a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to synthesize this cromosome in a way that we could modify components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
So we started the adventure of the &quot; we can synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Can the chemistry to produce these big molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create before ?
And , in case , we can make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is simply a chemical piece of inert material .
The speed that we &apos;re able to degree with life is growing up to exponential .
Our capacity to write the genetic code , instead , rather slowly , but it &apos;s better .
And our recent recent more recent outcomes to a bunch curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process has requires , beginning with a bioethical review before we began to start the first experiments .
But we discovered that DNA is very difficult .
There are deces of thousands of machines in the world producing little DNA , of the longer of 30 to 50 letters and it &apos;s a process of degenerative process : the most mistakes .
So we had to develop a new metod to assembly these fragments and correct correct .
And this was our first attempty , to start from the digital information of the genome of Phi &apos;s genome of Phi &apos;s genome .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills .
We designed the fragments , actually , the correction of the mistakes and a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material chemical material and we &apos;ve inserted it in the bacteria , the bacteria began to read this genetic code and producurn the viral particles .
The viral particles have been repected from cells , and they &apos;ve been destroyed the E. There . There .
I talked about recently with the piece of oil industry and they &apos;ve been saying that they have certainly understood this model .
They review more than you .
We think this is a situation where the software can actually build his hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in larger .
We wanted to build the whole battery of the bacteria .
They &apos;re more than 580 sletters .
So we thought we &apos;ve been built in the size of the viruses , so that we can change the casses of the viruses , to understand what the components are components of a living cell .
Deature is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accurity was a mile for every 10 mile .
We found out , we &apos;ve discovered it , 30 errors . If we had used that original sequence we would never be able to do that work .
One part of the process is designing , you know , 50 letters that you overcome with all the other segate sounds of 50 letters to build smaller subjection .
We can see unique elements here .
You probably have read that we &apos;re going to put a floor .
Think about it : we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , Gs and T.
Three of those letters together code together about 20 letters , and there &apos;s a specific order of letters for every aminoacid .
So we can use genetic code for words , frasurements .
What we did the beginning was self-so .
Some of the fact that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
We designed these signents to simply together with enjoymes .
There are fenzymes that they repect them .
And we started to assembly , we beginning with the segments , and they &apos;re saying five to seven letters , and they &apos;re 24 ments , and they &apos;re 24 ments .
We have produced these dance segments in abundance so we can sequency them to sequency that we &apos;re trying to create a very robbust -- as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems the tabellone playoff .
When we get to these very long segments , more than 100 mile , more than 100 middle , they &apos;re not going to be more directly in E.
It comes to the limit of modern molecular biology .
So we &apos;ve looked at other mechanisms .
We knew a little bit of a homology called a romination , which in biology is going to repect DNA to degree the DNA to degree to unize the segments .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus . It can make three million rad rad .
You can see in the upper reverse as his chromosome as his chromosome .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s reassembly like it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can &apos;t do completely .
They can live under vacuum .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life in space , and you &apos;re going to be able to find new environment of water .
Actually , NASA showed that this happens .
This is an image of the molecule we built these processes , just using the processes , with design appropriate segment to put .
The free evitself , the automatically .
This image was not taken with a electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a very big molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are photographed that they cover a six seconds .
This is the publishing we did a little time ago .
They &apos;re more than 580,000 genetic code .
It &apos;s the biggest molecule of a definitely created by man .
It &apos;s a molecular molecular weight for 300 million .
If we prove it with a 10 spaces , they would like 142 pages , they would just like 142 pages to transs this genetic code .
Now , how do we do that work ?
Of course , through a virus is a little bit from kids .
It &apos;s a little more complicated when they use bacteria .
It &apos;s simplest when it comes of the eucariots as our : you can just extract the nucleo and you can just extract the nucleo and you can put another , which is practically the process of cloning .
In the archaea , the chromosome is integrated integrated by the cell , but we &apos;ve recently showed that we &apos;re able to do a complete trape of a cell on one other and activate it .
We had a microbial chromosome from a microbial species .
The two are different ones of how men from topes .
We added some gene in more way that we can decide what chromosome for this cromosome .
And then the science of the floor in a way to kill all proteins .
And when we put it into the cell was study -- and you &apos;ll appreciate our graph -- and you &apos;ll appreciate our graph was going into the cell .
And we were basically thought we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried anyway .
This is one of the major evolution .
We found that many species have added a second or a third or a third chromosome somewhere , adding into a second thousands of new , and in the second thousand and and new species .
So who thinks about evolution as a gene at time that you modified has no realized much of biology .
There are fenties of the restriction enzymes that are dealing the DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell of it .
The cell phone that we have a chromosome that we have insert .
It &apos;s expressed , and it recognized the other croms like extraneous material , and we found it with just the cell and the new cromosome .
it &apos;s became blue because of the genes we &apos;ve inserious .
And in a short of time , all the feature of a species have gone lost , and it turned around a new species , based on the new software we insert in the cell .
All the proteins have changed , and when we &apos;re reading the genetic code , and when we &apos;re saying that you &apos;ve transfer to what we &apos;ve transfer you .
Now , this could look like genetic alchemy , but by altering DNA , we can change things in a pretty fairly substantial things .
Now , I &apos;ve got explained that here is not talking about that here , but progress to go from three million years of evolution , and I &apos;ve already said that maybe we &apos;re going to create new version of the Cambrian explosion .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty obvious when we think about our needs .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion people to nine billion people to nine billion in the next 40 years .
Gust to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one in 1946 ; there will be four .
We &apos;re going to have problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medicinal and gas for six billion people .
It &apos;s going to be more giving it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion means , more than 30 billion barrasses .
That means millions of barrasses a day .
When we &apos;re trying to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replaced them , it will be a huge challenge .
We have more we have to realize the entire emission of CO2 from these materials that ends up in the atmosphere .
At the day of the scientific discoveries all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I love to think that are the design components for the future .
The electronics industry only has a dozen tiny about components , and think about how many different things are coming out .
Our limits here are principlally from biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , thank you very much of synthesization , in degree of creating what we call genomics genomics .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can produce a million croms a million croms a day .
Think of processing these 20 million different genes or try to make a typical processes to produce the processes to produce or drugs , new vaccines , we can change , thank you to change , and create more biology , and create more biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemistry , chemistry or carburing , chemistry or carburn , production vaccines .
This is an instantaneous statement of some software program on to be able to sit and design species on the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know , we don &apos;t necessarily know how they &apos;re going to be .
We know exactly what they &apos;re going to be their genetic code .
Now we &apos;re focusing on the carbons of quarter generation .
You &apos;ve also seen eetanol from grain was a grain experiment .
We have carbons of second and third generation that will use enough to use the higher of the higher value as either as the eight-different types of butanol .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without more human impact , and we can be adducted the cost of food and limited the availability to be transforming CO2 in the first , where we &apos;re working for designing that can reach this scale , and we think we can work on design this scale , and we can think of it , and we can think of it , and we can think of that scales in about 18 months .
The sunlight combined with CO2 is a metodown--- but in our discoveries in the world , we found different metodds .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , at about 2500 feet of depth of the water temperature .
It &apos;s methane from CO2 using molecular hydrogen as as a source of energy .
We &apos;re trying to figure out if we can put CO2 , that can easily be transported through the tubes , converting that CO2 in carburn , to drive this process .
So we can short think that we can be able to increase what the question is what &apos;s life is . &quot; We have life . &quot; We have the foot , we have the modest goal to replace the whole obies of papers .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can you do it from ?
It would be a main fun of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working on to use the same methods to create vaccines .
You saw this year with influence , we &apos;re always always going back a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s the right vaccine right .
I think that it can change constructing vaccines in anticipate .
Here is how the future could start to be changing , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria , archail , and the eucariote .
We &apos;re so much like that we &apos;re so much from the impressing people .
Our purpose is to do enough to try to try to try to try to try . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the most of the new technology that we brought to Microsoft in the new technology that we brought to a year ago . This is Seadragon . This is Seadragon . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s a environment where you can interact with local level that remote remote with a huge amount of visual data .
Here we &apos;re seeing a lot of justs of digital photographs with a kind of costant expensive , and continuous zing , and I continuous slide , and I continued to the images of how we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big big big data , or the images .
Most of the digital photographs , but this is a scanning scanning from Bibliotem of Congress , and it comes into the gama of 300 megapiel .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that you can limits the presents of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen in any time . It &apos;s also a very flexelecture .
This is a whole book , you don &apos;t images .
This is the Casolate of Dickens . Every colonn . Every colonn represents a capital .
To show you that &apos;s about the text and not images , we can do something like that is a real thing , to see that &apos;s really a real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a book to read a book .
Don &apos;t recommend .
This is a more realistic . It &apos;s a lot of the Gardian .
Every big image is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure of the loving version of a newspaper version of a newspaper , which is for nature a lot , which is for nature a lot of medium .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the Guardian .
We created a higher fasulating higher -- much higher than that you use in a normal publishing -- and we &apos;ve been inserted you .
If you want to see the feature of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or specific techniques .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that this means to be able to the population and other challenge , and other chases , they should not be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this not I want to lose time , if not to say that we have contributed to date in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. . on a geospatial picture of NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually the view of the Web ; you can see it .
This is a project called Photosynth , which combines two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting research to the very interesting computer . In fact , a very interesting computer , a student in Washington , with the help of Steve Seady of the U.S. of U.S. of UW and Rick Seliski Microsoft Research . It &apos;s a good collaboration .
And it &apos;s from the fire on the web , Seadragon .
You can see that when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from one picture to another and have this kind of experience to the other and have this kind of experience to multiple solution .
But the space collocation of the images here has actually a meaning .
The signature of the computer visualization have recorded these images together , so that corresponds to the real place where the imaging imaging the real neighbor Grasks on the Mountain Grasks the Rockiss on the Mountains Roccial Mountains -- they &apos;re scacross . There are all the college of a slides of a slipements of slides , and these things have been all the space level .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some much more space .
I want to go to one of the original data of Noah-data -- and this is from a previous previous Photosynth prototynth , we &apos;ve done for the first time , we &apos;ve done the first time scores , we &apos;ve done in the first time , the key Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily the key behind the webody that we &apos;ve put in in the Web .
We had to worries about legal and so on .
This is a rebuild-on Nothers , Dame Ph.C. . Bast Do . Bast Do , &quot; Din Flickr and you get images of types and you get images of types and so on . Every one of these arances , you represents a picture that you &apos;ve discovered an image that you &apos;ve discovered a picture that model .
So I &apos;m all images from Flickr and they were all connected to space in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this very simplicissue .
You know , I would never have thought to end up on Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifying to get this kind of access here .
I think you can see that &apos;s a lot of different types of different types of focus . from those of the cell phone to those professional cellphone to those professional cell , in this environment .
And if I can try to try to get those more strange .
A lot of people are block .
From some part here is a series of photographs -- here .
This is a Noththers of Dame Cameter .
We can go from the poster to the view of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is taking data from yet , right from the entire collective of how the land , from the point of view -- and connected all that data together .
All those pictures become connected , greater than the one of the parts .
You have a land model of the entire land that emerge .
Think about this as a focus as a Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It &apos;s something that is growing in complexity as people use it , and the advantages that are used to use .
Their pictures are marathed by other people .
If you get to somebody &apos;s the idea of contrassignment , my picture of the Nothers , my picture of Nothers , you get rich of all the data , and I can use as a point of that data , and I can use the point of pattern , using the universe , using the universe , using the universe , using the universe , using the universe , and to have a social experience of cross-cycle , and to have a social experience .
Of course , a consequence of all that are virtual models of all the world &apos;s interest , which is the same elaborate , you college not only from airs and satellite and images and slim , but from the collective memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What your software will contains us to do is that somewhere in the next years , all the photographs shared by anyone in the world will be going to be going to be ready connected together ?
BA : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is going to practice .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , between .
And he &apos;s doing it in the content of the images .
And it becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of sea that many of these images are going to be .
As when you do a research of images on the web , you get a sentence and the web on the web page has a lot of information about the picture .
Now , what if that picture is connected to all your picture ?
So , the amount of simancient interconnection and the amount of wealth that &apos;s really huge . It &apos;s a huge effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible . Computents .
BA : I thank you very much .
One of the main pleases , when you travels and one of the ethnographic research is the power to live between who has not forget the traditions , between the wind who has not forget the past in the wind floats , the wind of the floor .
Basti think that Jaguar , are still beyond the Via Lattea , or that the Vy Lattea , or that are still more meaning , or Himala , the budddhes of Dharm , to remember the floats of Dharm , to remember the central importance of the central anthroughout of the central central , but it &apos;s just a model of reality , but it &apos;s just a model of reality , but it &apos;s just a model ,
the consequence of a particular adaptation that our stirs has done , well or bad , well or mal , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share the essential .
Everybody . We all procreating .
We are subjects of the beginning .
We need to deal with the inexorability of death , so it doesn &apos;t surprising us if we &apos;re dallowing and ballie --
We all have an art .
What hit is the particular is the rhythm of cancer , the rhythm of dance .
Not matter that are the Penan forests of Borneo , or the followers of Haiti , or the followers of Haiti , or the Kaisut , or the Kenya , or a cameleras , or a fiellier in Sahara .
He was my journey of journey in the desert a month ago , or a hallevator of yak in the values of Qomolanger , the world &apos;s mother .
All these people teach us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of move in the world .
And , if you reflection a moment , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
Instead of the world , as a lot of the world create a spiritual nature and cultural life that it has the planet , and it &apos;s important for the planet as as a biosphere as a biosphere as a biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural nature as a nosphere , and you can define the ethnosphere , the ethnosphere , dreams , mites , myths , myths , inspirations , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , and intuitions , intuitions ,
Ethnosphere is the fantastic patrimonio .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we can be in how it is that we can be in how it is .
And because the biosphere was gravelly consumed as it as it has been so much more quickly successful .
Nobody biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species was on the extinction of the extinction just because it &apos;s false , or in the most of the most of biological diversity -- and not in the field of biological diversity -- and you don &apos;t have any close of the hypothesis -- that of the world of the obvial diversity .
The whole of this is , of course , is , the lost lost .
When you were there are 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only a vocabulary or a series of grammaticals .
A language is the broke of human spirit .
It &apos;s the medium with which the animal of every culture is coming into material world .
Every language is a forest , a bind of mind , a thought , a spiritual extensive .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re here sitting in Monterey , at least half doesn &apos;t get suscened in the ear of children .
They don &apos;t get to teach children , which means , unless you wasn &apos;t to walk something , which is already not wonders .
What is more sad of the being flowed from silence , to be the last to talk to a language , of the last to talk about a language , not to transmit wisdom of the wisdom of the driver ?
This horrunning is the state of somewhere in the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks .
And I know somebody will say , &quot; Isn &apos;t that ?
The world would not be a better place if we all parlass the same language ? &quot; We all talk yoruba . We all talk yoruba .
Let &apos;s talk about .
You &apos;ll see a tract thing to say , &quot; Don &apos;t talk about their language .
I &apos;d like to do you have a journey through ethnosphere --
a little journey in the ethnosphere to give you a massive of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , &quot; different ways of exists to exist .
We take for example , this Barasana , in Amazon , in Amazon , the population of anaconda , which creates the myth of practice in the latte of the latte of the latte of the best sacrates .
It &apos;s a population that &apos;s not able to distinguish color blue color blue color because the blue color is identified in the forest , which depends the population .
They have a language and a matrimonial rules , deterrimonial exactly , &quot; Linguistic experience , &quot; you have to move one person talks about language .
And so that &apos;s radical past , in the mythological past is that in these families that are talking about six or seven languages to be six or seven languages , no linguishes a language .
They &apos;re limited to listen and then begin to talk .
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived , the Waorans of Ecuador Ecuador , an incredible people , an incredible people that had the first contatts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five means have attempt a comfortable contact that was made .
They &apos;ve done by the photographs that they had no traditional poses that they would reended up , forest that this population of pluvial forest had never seen anything in bi-dimensional forest .
They collected the picture from the land , they turned them to the research of a shape or a figure , they realized that they were treating diol , and they kill the five missionaries .
But Waorans not only killed the straniests .
They &apos;re killing between them .
54 percent mortality was caused by them .
We &apos;ve been sitting at eight generations and we found two natural cases , and when we &apos;ve been insisted to know , they &apos;ve got to know , they &apos;ve been invecting so that they were invecting that they kill it . And then they kill it up .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal from 40 step and recognize the species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned a very interesting task when my Harvard professor asked me if I wanted to go to Harvard to Harvalier and Tonton Macross the basis of the power of Duvalialier and Tonton Macross , and imposed me for the fast bombie .
To give a sense to the miraculous , I would have to understand the Vodoun culture and that Vodoun is not magic .
It &apos;s pretty much a measume of a measume of the world .
Very interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Budddddgm , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no religious fefeelings . And he switched and Voodoo is not the distilled of the narrow of nets in the slavery of the slavery of slavion .
What makes the interesting is the intense is the intense is the intense of life and death .
So , the vive are going to be .
The spirits can be invoded by Great Aqua , they respond to the rhythm of dance and replace temporary to the anima tal way that for a little bit of the bad .
So , the voodoohisti love say , &quot; You &apos;re going to wonder God .
We fell in the temple and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment that you &apos;re playing , is the spirit that you , how can you do you do the bad you ?
So , you &apos;re going to have these incredible events : followed voodoo in state of trance that touches touches infurious demonstration rather than the body &apos;s mind on the body &apos;s mind when it &apos;s catalyed in a state of excitation .
I was all the people with which I lived the most extraordinary the most extraordinary people are the Kogi of Santa Marta , in Colombia .
Discending ancient civilization that once they were on the carairplanning caraise on the carairplane , the population is going to run on the massicing massicle that you get out on the carbicicicycle planet .
In a continent , a lost continent , this population never been conquered by the spagners .
And so , I &apos;m governed to the cler , but their formation is very extraordinary .
The young people folloaced from the families to three or four years , and they live secreed in a world fact of good hombs in a world of the bag in the bag of the glaciers for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years of the nine years of gestation that transmit into the U.S. , and they &apos;re metaphor , now are metaphor , I &apos;m metaphor in the U.D. .
So , that &apos;s the time , they are acculated to values of their society , values that predicting their prayers and only their prayers to keep the cosmic balance -- or for the balance balance .
At the term of this incredible initiation , they &apos;re improvide out and for the first time in life , at 18 years , they see an alba . And in that actim of the first best , when the sun bor broads of the best , when the sungle .
&quot; I &apos;m going to say , I said .
It &apos;s studies . Now it &apos;s now to protect it . &quot;
They &apos;re called the major frail saying that us , brothers , we &apos;re the holds of the world .
This is extremely important .
When we think about Indigence populations and environment , we invodds and the old history of the noble vage , which is a razy concept in his simplicity or maybe we invoded to Thoreau and say that these people are close to the Earth of us .
Indigenes are not not not sentimental sentimental nor indebolitites .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the Abat or in the car of the Abat or in the winds of the Tibet , but thank you to get a mystical mystical intuition of the Earth , and they created a mystical intuition , but the concept that the Earth can only live because it is infected from consciousness .
What does that mean ?
It means that a mountain of the Ande who grows that the mountain is a mountain . Apu that will be a deeply different . And it &apos;s going to be a different human beings and will have a different ratic relationship with the mountain or that light mountain a Montana that you grow up , a mountain in a mountain of the mountain .
which is the dimpointing or a mineral cow is irrelevant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Columbia creating Britannic creating that forests serve to be cut .
And that made me a different human being different human from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the forests of Hukuk and the history of the paradisite and the song of the paradise and the cannibs that live in the Hamatar beginning .
If you start to look at these cultures can actually actually create different reality , you can start understanding some of them , you can start understanding some of them .
I took this picture to open up in the Western Amazon .
Mayahuge of you have heard about the Eahuge psychoactive suspsychoacy of the repertory repertoire .
What makes the eyahuge , is not the potential pharmacological potential of substance , but its elaboration . It &apos;s composed by two elements .
From a side , this lian leagged lian huge ments , and harments and harments , harments and harments , and suggested , suggestion , and suggestion .
Taking the only plant plant plant , you have a blueaser that alters a little bit of consciousness , but it &apos;s mixed with the leaves of a coffee family of the coffee of the coffee of the coffee of the coffee .
This is the triptamines , very similar to serotonin , methoxyland-five , methoxyltryptamine-five , methoxine .
If you &apos;ll see the Yanomami type on for the suspity that they do from a different species , which is methoxyltryltryltryltryltryltryptams .
Tirling that pollus on the nose is a little bit like being disappear by a file fucies of the board and land on a sea gars of electricity .
I was slippsychard Evan Shultes , the man who took the Shultes , the man who wrote the hallucinogened was the check of the floor , with his discovery of the hallucinogens in the &apos; 30 in Mexico .
I think of the text , you can &apos;t classified these triptames like hallucinogens because if you &apos;re doing , you can &apos;t tell anyone of being .
It &apos;s possible absolute only if you make it abunger with other chemicals that money money .
Now , the beautiful huge : the carbon history is in this lian inhibitors of MAO , the same kind of the same needs to be able to be the triptames . The surprines : in 80,000 species of plants , how they do these are a lot of the baby , but that if you combined in this way , creating a version that is superiod that it &apos;s superiod that it &apos;s superiod of the parts ?
We use the great euphemism of the prova and the error , which can reveals .
But if we ask the Indians , they &apos;ll say , &quot; On the plants they &apos;re talking . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribes , Cofan , has 17 variety variety , which is network , and that the eyes would come in the forest , and that our eyes would come into the same species .
If we ask him how they &apos;re going to say , &quot; I thought I realized , &quot; I thought I realized that I could not do you know ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you get 17 varieties in a notice of the fens and each other .
With this doesn &apos;t lauret in Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting to contact the prise .
Now , &#91; applauss &#93; the problem is that also the ones of us who have to have the heart of the people are pitting . But somehow reduces are pointed .
In fact , the 21st century , between 300 years , it will not remember the writing of its wars or technological innovations , but rather as the way we stopped and we abbractively activally or accepted passively , or accepted the planet . Now the problem is not change .
Everybody cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibilities .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians have no stopped to be Sioux when they put up up in the arch and flow-up as they have no stopped to be Americans when they put up up the horse and calculated .
It &apos;s not the change or the technology that threatened the ethnosphere . It &apos;s power .
The floor of domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you &apos;ll discover that these are not destined to disappear .
They &apos;re living creatures and dynamics out of identifiable forces that go beyond their capacity of adaptation .
It &apos;s what it &apos;s been willing to the patries of Penan --
a population of Sarawak , in the South Asian , a population , a population that lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced the figures of the figures of the figures of the figures , where you can see the figures that seems to bring away from the source that seem to the Mdierdynese , where the Japanese nor illums , where the Japanese nor horizonate the horizoney .
It fills to fill the wood wood .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that have come with the discovery of gold .
If we move on Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the right right pattern of political domination .
You know the genocide , the physics of a population , is convicted in the universal level , but the ethnium of life , not only destruction of a population , not only is condanced , but it &apos;s celebrated in the way of development .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of the Tibet until you get out of the beginning .
I run 6,000 miles from China , in the Western China in Western China , coming to Lhasa , with a young colleagues , but just came to Lhasa , but just came to Lhasa I realized what &apos;s behind the statistics that we &apos;re talking about .
6,000 workers and centers in policies and centers .
1.2 million people killed from the military during the Cultural revolution .
The father of this guy was ascrited to Panchen Lama .
which means that it &apos;s been killed to the time of Chinese invasion .
His uncle with Santity during the deal with Santity during the diaspora population in Nepal .
His mother was imprisoned and his colpath was reciated .
It was brought to hidden at the age of two years , hidden under his gonna because it wouldn &apos;t have lived in him .
The sister , who made the same , it was put it in the field of reeducation .
One day , he has inavverted a day , a day , and for this transgression , and for this transgression , was put forced on the ward work for seven years .
Tibet of the Tibet can be insationally , but the spirit of the population is from tener .
And the end , it &apos;s all reduces .
We want to live in the world world of the world of the world , or we want to take the policromatical world of diversity ?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he said that his biggest fear was that in our own love to this love of the world , we &apos;re not just going to see the whole amorous ama of human imagination , but a day of human imagination , but one day we &apos;re going to see it from a deal with a sleepy depensive sleeping , but one day we &apos;re going to see that there &apos;s other possibilities .
And it &apos;s humiliating that our species is existed for 60,000 years .
The Neolitics Rvolution , which given us the agriculture , which has done us to do us to the cult of the see , and by suspeculiar with the next few of the melting , and we &apos;re talking about 10,000 years ago .
The industrialized world industrialized in the room .
That sharks , I don &apos;t suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we &apos;re going to go to .
When these myriades of the world is asked what it is to say to be human , they respond to be human , they respond to 10,000 voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all remains we &apos;re going to be what we are : a consciousness , that has to make it in a way that we &apos;re all the people and all the garden . And there are great moments .
I took this picture on the north of Baffin , when I went to the hunt of the bales with Inuit , and this man , and this man , and this man , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya history of her grandfather .
The canopy government has not always been gentile with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to stabilie our teenage , we &apos;ve reached them in colonies .
The grandfather refused to go .
The family , theming for his life , he brought it away , and all the arms , and all its attracted .
You have to know that Inuit doesn &apos;t feel the cold , they don &apos;t feel the cold ,
The head of the slites were made of the basic skin fishing skin .
The non-man of this man had not made from the arctimic night or the blizard night , or the blizard that was suffippputs .
It &apos;s broader , you &apos;ve got up , you &apos;ve calculated the bag of foca and defecated in their hand . When I did the frow , it &apos;s working on the side .
She sprayed salive on the points of this cacca hunt , and when it came out , he was killed a dog .
She schools the dog and created a bridge , with the tory actical cassa , he has gone another dog and it &apos;s disappeated on the banchisa , and it &apos;s disappear on the banchisa .
We want to talk about hell with nothing ?
In the 1999 , the canadvation of the California , the total control of a total territory of California and Texmen together .
It &apos;s their new patric . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a independent territory . They all controlate all the mineraries .
One splendid example of how a national state can reconcile with his population .
And , finish , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious at least to who was in these slightly slippulling zones of the planet , make it remote .
For somebody &apos;s home .
They know , they &apos;re seeing sections of human imagination that will be rislimbing to the drive of the children , as dreams of our children , as the dreams of our children , as the swim of hope .
Finally , we National Geographic . We are convints that politicians will never arrive to anything .
We think polemy that polemies --
&#91; Applauses &#93; are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month our site rich site rich stories of visit .
156 countries the pattern transmitting our television .
Our reviews are slow by millions of people .
Our work is to travel to bring our public public in places of wonderful cultural places from what they saw and hopefully , hopefully , hopefully , hopefully , hopefully , the world of the central world , and we need to find a lifestyle lives in a pluralist and multicultural world , and we need to find a lifestyle and multicultural reveal life .
where the wisdom of all people can contribute to our collective well-being .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope requires you &apos;ve heard and I &apos;m going to try to evidence some colleagues , in case not .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the official dogma . &quot;
The official dogma dogma dogma ?
The official dogma dogma of all the Western society . The official dogma official : &quot; If we want to move the benefits of our citizens &quot; The way to do that is to male the individual freedom . &quot;
The reason is , from one side , in the fact that freedom is in the same value , it &apos;s precious , it &apos;s precious , for humans .
At the other is that if we &apos;re free , each of us can act to do all that maximizing all the maximizing , no one that we &apos;re not decided to name .
The way to male the freedom is to move choice .
More choices people have , more free , and greater is their liberty , greater is their liberty , greater is their well-being .
I think , it &apos;s so deeply radical in the society that nobody &apos;s dream of putting it in the society that no one .
And it &apos;s also deeply radical in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I lose a simple note on the conditions .
In my supermarket , there are 175 condition , without contact , without the 10 variety of oil , and 12 acets , the balses that you can buy for you to buy a huge number of condition in the rescious circumments that nobody already already , which no one of the 175 pronce of your deading .
Here is the supermarket .
And then you go to the electronic store to buy a stereo : case , CD , the CD , plastra , plastra , plastra .
And in this single negotium negotiate , there &apos;s a big number of audio .
We can make six and a half million different combinations of combinations that there are in a negotiate .
You need to admit that there &apos;s a lot of choice .
Other fields : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the desire services , you could get all the desired , the basic that they were strong mama Bell .
And he was born the phone , you didn &apos;t buy it .
One of that one of that , in the other , it was that the phone would never realize .
These times went .
Now we have a variety almost limited phones , especially between cellular cellular phones .
Here &apos;s the future .
My favorite is the middle , MP3 , cut it &apos;s cut , and bakery for me , and bakery for me .
If you don &apos;t have seen in the house , you &apos;re certainly certain you &apos;re going to soon .
And what &apos;s going to the end is that people get into the store and does this question . And you know what the answer is ? The answer is &quot; No .
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell that doesn &apos;t do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the acquired , you get the same explosion of choices .
Asanitary health : no longer in the United States that you go from the doctor and doctor , you have to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , can we do it , or B , &quot; A , &quot; You can do that , &quot; B has these benefits . &quot;
You say , &quot; Dr. &quot; What would I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A has these gone and risks , and the risks , and the risks . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebats , &quot; Dr. &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result of the malseems of malseeing , &quot; expression that makes it look like a nice thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not that one marriage and responsibility to make decisions from someone who knows something , which is the doctor , someone else that doesn &apos;t know -- and so it &apos;s not in condition to make a real decisions .
There &apos;s a huge marketing products , direct people like me and you , who if you think about us , and if you think about it doesn &apos;t understand them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why do they published ?
The answer is that they want to ask to toms .
Something so fundamental identity is our identity is a choice of choice , how you see in this jet . &quot; We don &apos;t want to force children . They &apos;ll chear their seven at the time . &quot; We don &apos;t want to be an identity : we need to invent .
And we can reinvent how many times we can get us .
which means that every morning , to the risk , you need to decide that kind of person you want to be .
And the family and the family and the main , a time prospective , a time prospective , slim , and it was that you could have the most soon as possible , and it beginning to get the most possible .
The only choice was with who , not when , not even , and not even what to do after .
Egyday , it &apos;s really to play .
I teach 20 percent of smart students , and I do their 20 percent work in less than a time .
And not because they &apos;re not unless brilliant , because they &apos;re not unless diligent .
because I &apos;m impensieritites , I &apos;m going to ask , &quot; I should I go to ? &quot;
&quot; Do I have to think about the later ? &quot; I have to think before children or the career or the career ? &quot;
They &apos;re rogoraners .
And they &apos;re trying to answer these questions , even though this implement doesn &apos;t completed the compitself and not get a nice vote to my extent .
And they have to do that . They really need to do it .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , like Carl Sean , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from Hotel Randolph .
I &apos;m parented , there &apos;s a angle , and I &apos;m not going to no one , where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t say , because I want to use it .
What does , this incredible freedom of choice we have to continuously on the work ? It &apos;s that we have continuously continuously in any moment , if we need to work or not .
We can go to the calculate , with the cell phone in a touch , the Blackberry in the other , and the niebook , typically , on the ginocia .
And even though they &apos;re all spended , every minute that we see our son , we &apos;re also saying , &quot; I said , &quot; I said , &quot; I should I answer to this called ? &quot;
&quot; I have I have to answer this ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , &quot; that makes the experience of your child very different from the partables .
So , as any part of the look , we look at , small , things and life , materials and life , life is a choices , life is a choices .
Once the world was this : Over , there were some possibilities , but not all a choice .
The world today looks like this : The dilemma is , &quot; Is it a positive thing ? &quot;
The answer is Scially , you know .
We all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about negative ones .
And this is all about two effects on people .
The first one , paradooxizing , is that produces instead of liberation .
And so many of the pattern that choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I offer you a significant example : a study conduct of volunteer .
A colleague has had access to the data of Vanhead , the gigantisource society , with about a million climents in 2000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of adesion comes down , two percent .
With 50 sources , there &apos;s 10 percent of the adesions that are available to when I &apos;m available to the store when I are available . Why ?
Because with 50 sources that choose , it &apos;s a hard to decide , and it &apos;s choose to decide , and choose is remanded to the indomories .
And by tomorrow , tomorrow , tomorrow , domorders , domorders , and of course , domorgs , domorders , and of course , domorders , domorders , domorance , domoranies , domoranges , domorants , tomorrow , tomorrow , tomorrow , domances
You know , that doesn &apos;t just mean that these works from old , because they &apos;re not going to be song because they don &apos;t have enough money , it also , it means that decision is so obstic that decision is so obstic that they also lose the food of work .
Not teaching , they &apos;re losing , they &apos;re not going to be told to be .
So the paralysis a consequence of the huge .
And I think that makes the world like that .
&quot; And finally , for ethnity : ketchup , you know , feeling or mayonese ? &quot;
You would like to take the right decision , if it &apos;s for ethernity , if it &apos;s for ethnic , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and neputting the wrong , and nepppputting .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even though we can avoid paralysis , and we &apos;re less satisfied by the way of how we would be with less options that choose .
And that &apos;s a different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of the condition that you choose , if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us . And what happens is that the alternative iminated choice is that the higher choice , and the repiece of the springs , and the repire depth of the decision ,
even when it was a good decision .
More choices are , more easy displeasy than the choice that it &apos;s insodisasting the choice of choice .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has closed very well practices like the value that we &apos;re depending on what we &apos;re going to depend on .
In the rest , when there are so many options , it &apos;s easy representation the attractive features of alternative alternative and be less satisfied as much as it choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I scuses with all the ones that I &apos;m not in New York .
But that &apos;s what you would think you would think .
There &apos;s this pie of Hamptons .
A place of lussignature .
It &apos;s floating . Ottyma . It &apos;s all for them .
Nothing . But what he thinks it is , &quot; Well , maledition , is Agust . &quot;
&quot; All my neighbors to Manhattan are away . &quot;
&quot; I could talk about home . &quot;
And he spots two weeks that he &apos;s losing the idea that &apos;s losing -- every day -- the chance of waiting where it wants .
The cost-opportunity is declining for what we have , even when it choice was , even when it choice was eccellent .
And the more of the options that we have to consider , the more equivalent feature will return out out as a cost-opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This jet says a lot of things .
We talk about the living time , and maybe it &apos;s living slowly .
But the most important point is that whatever you choose , you choose not to do other .
The things that we don &apos;t choose so many attractive that they can make less attractive that we do .
Tirst point : the growing spiral growing .
I tried it on my skin , and I tried a new jeans .
I &apos;m going to almost jeans .
Once the jeans were one guy , compraves and dress and dress , they were comfortable , only after they were spring them a life and washing a lot of times , beginning to go well .
So I went to buy a couple new when the old ones were going , and I said , &quot; I need a couple jeans , and I said , &quot; I need a couple jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Who wants to me , &quot; Do you want to fit , relaxed ? &quot;
Who wants to do you want to do it or bottons ? &quot; Stonewashed &quot; ?
&quot; Who wants to be stream ? &quot;
&quot; Sight the pattern , or street ? &quot;
I was able to say , &quot; I was able to say , &quot; I was able to say , &quot; I want the only guy that was the only guy , &quot; he had no idea what it was , so for a hour . And then I had all the diseem , and then use the best , and then use the best pair , with the best pair , with the best pair , with the best jeans that I &apos;ve ever had .
I was the very big . I had the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand that .
The reason I was worse for worse is that with all the expectations were high , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was the beginning I had minime . I didn &apos;t expected anything when there was only a guy , but when there was only a kind of 100 different , accidents , at least a guy had to be perfect .
What I had buy was good , but not perfect .
And after I had talked to the choose that I was trying to insodged in the expectations .
The addition of the people don &apos;t do that they &apos;re going to increase expectations that have respect to the eck of the options of the options of the options of the options that are .
And that will producing less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the marketing world .
Because if they knew it , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth of it looks more like this .
&quot; You were better when you were worse , &quot; The reason why he was better when you were worse when you were worse , it was that when you were worse , it was still going to meet surprised to meet surprised .
Egyday , in the world where we live -- opulents , industrialized citizens with the perfection of perfection -- the maximum that we can hope is that the things are at the height .
You &apos;ve never been fairly surprises because your expectations , you &apos;ve got gone .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Basse expectations . &quot;
I mean -- little autobiographic moment -- that I &apos;m really moving and my wife is really stupend .
I couldn &apos;t have done , I couldn &apos;t have to be able .
But it &apos;s not always a bad thing .
Finally , a consequence of jeans slide when you have only that jeans , you know , you &apos;re just when you &apos;re not severe satisfacts , and say , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot; , the answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What could I do you do ?
When you have hundred jeans , and you buy a disasting insodenting , and you ask you ask , and you ask , it &apos;s just as close that responsible to you .
You &apos;d could have better .
With hundreds of disponds , there are no out of the insuccess .
So when people are decisions , even though the outcome is valid , they feel unsatisfacts and they give the hard .
In the last years , depression is exploss in the industrialized world .
I think that a meaning factor -- not the only one , but that &apos;s important -- of this depression is that people have experiences of depression is that people are experiences .
And when they need to explain this situation think that the colorful is they think it &apos;s them .
So the final result is that we &apos;re better , but we &apos;re worse , but we feel worse .
Let me tell you about it .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than it , but it doesn &apos;t slip out of that it &apos;s better than a lot of choice .
There is a critical value , magic . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure that we &apos;ve been supered by a piece the level where the choices choices .
Now , from the political point of view -- I &apos;ve almost finished -- from political point , the nocle is the following .
What it allows in the industrial society is the material of material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know the problem is that they don &apos;t have any choice .
The problem is they have too much .
So the facility I &apos;m talking about is a modern malesclusive of modern , the Western society .
And what it does have to deprove is this : Steve Levitt talked about how you were talking about how that expensive and comfortable seats for whatever . It &apos;s a spread of money .
I mean , these choices , complicated and dispendependiture , it &apos;s not that they &apos;re just unuseful .
They &apos;re adducting .
They &apos;re going to stay worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows a lot of choice was reversed in those where people have too few possibilities , not would be only their life . But also , it would not be better . But our life .
This is what economists call .
A redistribution of the reduction is good at all -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in excess that comes back us .
To conclude , &quot; you can become everything you want to become everything you want to be --
You , people , you &apos;ll think , &quot; What does that believe that weight ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t make anything in a glass . &quot;
&quot; An ination , a limited vision of the world -- &quot;
and I interpret it so , at the beginning .
But then , I realized that that weight the long .
Because the fact of the fact , it &apos;s if you eat the broke , so that &quot; everything is possible . &quot; You can &apos;t get the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you take the ming days in a way that everything you can decline the sodisphation .
And you &apos;re going to get the paralysis .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too much , maybe even the weight , perhaps for us .
But the absence of a few symbolic symbolic , and , I &apos;m the rine-happiness .
Thank you very much .
