Last year I showed these slides to show that the arctic glacial glacial , which for almost three million years had the size of 48 United States continental continental , 48 percent .
However , this underedwood , because it doesn &apos;t show the spextending of the ice .
The arctic heat is , in a sense , the pulsant heart of global climate system .
It expands inverter and it retreatment .
The next slide slide is going to be a faster reid on the last 25 years .
The ice perennian denners are signed .
As you see , they expand down to the blue .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter , which is retreated summer .
You can see the ice cosmic ice , for five years or more , it &apos;s like the blood , which is like blood , which is like the blood , which is like the blood .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been like that .
This is a problem because the climbing interests in the arctic floor to the arctic scale , where there are enormous amount of carbon that , melded , and they turn , they turn into metane from the microbans .
I &apos;m pull-climbing , that quanting the atmospheric inquantity could radical , super-doubling point , washing , wasn &apos;t return .
In some some laghi short laghot , the methane is already by the water .
The Katey Walter University of Alaska of Souka was at the University of the Univerter , winter last last .
Video : Wow ! Let &apos;s go . She &apos;s good . The question is if we &apos;re going to be .
A reason that this is that this termal termal waste from the north .
This is a glacial rumer .
The carported didn &apos;t have reached levels .
This is the Kangerlush , in the south of Greenland .
If you want to know how the sea level for the shape of the ice on the terrain of the way , here is where it reaches the sea .
These corrings are increasing rapidly .
On the other hand of the planet : Antarctest block of ice planet .
The month , scientists have been declared that the ice balance is in negative , and that the Antartica Antartica , which is a little bit of the Sylands , which is particularly rapid in the shape .
It &apos;s just like the watching feet of watching , like Greenland .
Sull Himalayas , the third biggest block of ice , you see new laghot years ago , that a few years ago was glacier .
40 percent of the world population is half of the world &apos;s population is half of the world &apos;s reserable .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the water of this city .
The carried is increased .
But when it declining , it &apos;s the same happening to the water .
In California , the snow , the Nevada is declined 40 percent .
The house backers are in crisis .
The predictions , as you read , are graves .
The growth care in the world is a remarkable increasing inside .
The environmental disaster are increasing a rhythm out of the normal and without precedenting .
Four times more numerous in the last 30 years , I &apos;ve been looking at 75 .
This is an unsustainable thing .
If you look at it in the historic context , if you can see the consequences .
For the last five years , we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 25 million tons of CO2 every day .
Look at the East Pacific area , the East Pacific , and on both Americas , and on both parts of the subcontinent , where there &apos;s a radical impoverments of oxygen in the oceans .
Most of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossil fuel .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worst .
The United States are one of the two countries with most emissions , together China .
And he was proposing to build a lot of central central .
But we &apos;re asking a change of direction .
These are the projects in the last few years and some of the alternative alternative alternative .
And , there &apos;s a political broken in our country .
The carbon industries and oil are spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon clean , which is a hosystore .
That picture me up , I remember something --
Natal , Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion floor .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the second biggest scores in America .
It happened around Natal .
The publishing natalization of one carbon industries was this .
Video : My carbon is a kind of alley and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it makes our economy .
It &apos;s more and more and more clean is more and more clean .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and the workers are management .
Al Gore : So , most of the carbon of the West Virginia .
The largest society in the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Don Blankenship : Don Blankenship : Al Gore , Nancy Pelososis , Harry Reid -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking .
Al Gore : So the Protection for Clima Protection has launched two campaign .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : At COALergy , we see the climate changes like a sery tiny tiny .
So , because our priority is investing a big amount of money in a public effort to make public effort and confused the carbon .
In fact , the carbon is not sports .
We think it &apos;s clean . It has a good profumo .
So , not preocateful for climate change .
Let me do .
Video : Ator : Carbone clean .
So let &apos;s go around a struggle to a head-watch for how carbon .
Stradvice ! The car is a little noise , but that &apos;s the sound of the fuel technology .
The carbon consumption is between the main causal causal , but the remarkable technology , but the remarkable technology of clean , which you see changes everything .
Take a look , this is the clean of the carbon clean .
Al Gore : Finally , the positive alternative alternative issues .
Video : My America is in crisis ; the economy , climate , national security , climate crisis .
The files that it all : our dependence from fossils , like the fossils , like the carbon and oil .
Now , but there &apos;s a new , audacy solution for it .
Repower : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to put America at work , make more secure , make more security , and help to stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that &apos;s just a solution that &apos;s solution .
Repower . Scopractice .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : That &apos;s about reducing energy .
One of the faster ways to get to dependence from the combustible that kills our planet .
Computer : The future is here . I mean , it &apos;s just a new network .
She showed two : Novi investments for places of burning ban work .
Reiving : She &apos;s time to be realists .
Al Gore : A afraid African proverbirth , it says , &quot; If you want to go to it .
If you want to go away , you go together . &quot;
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED I made an introduction on the LHC .
And I promise to return you about how the machine works .
So here I am there . And for what the other time , there were no , LHC is is the largest scientifiever ever trip to -- 27 kilometers of circumference .
His task is to reremaining the conditions that were present less than a billion second from the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
All this is just environment .
This is the Ginevencing under Ginevencing .
We picture these mini-Bang Bang inside in the relevators .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLATLATLAS -- it &apos;s 44 feet .
This is an ATLATLATLAS in buildings .
Ten September 10 year , we access the car year , we access the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was caught by the way ,
It &apos;s a picture of the first particles that had done all around LHC , walking in collision , with a collision , with a part of the LHC , and it &apos;s spread in the record .
In other words , when we see that picture , the picture , we realized that the machine worked , which is a great vitting .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to do more or this , when somebody went to Google and saw that began was this .
That means that we had a cultural impact to the scientific .
About a week later , there was a problem with the car , it had to these files here -- these days dored .
These files are taking 13,000 ampers when the maximum works at the very powerful .
Now , the technical technical . They &apos;re going to be watching the files and they will say , &quot; That &apos;s too much subtle . &quot;
And they can do it because when they &apos;re very cold became the superconductor .
So , at less 271 degrees , at a inferior temperature to that the space between stars , these files can bring that run .
In one of the juntures of the novemile novemior in the LHC , there was a false fabrication .
So the files wonderful files , and 13,000 ampers of suddenly met , and 13,000 ampers .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think these magnets are more than 20 tons , and that &apos;s moving over about 30 foot .
They &apos;re damaged about 50 magnegated .
We had to take them , what we did .
We returned them and reports .
Now they &apos;re going to be back to their underground .
Big the end of the LHC is going to be new integrate .
We will happen that , and we expect it to get right or swimming and continue our adventure to discover what the universe are .
Now , of course , in a way , these crashes reaccess to the value of science and engineering . It &apos;s easy to confuture .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that to go beyond limits , I think is the value of things like LHC .
I &apos;d like to end with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , I imagine , in the inuseless experiments of his pupillo , his pupillo was Michael Faraday , said , &quot; Nothing is so dangerous for the progress of the human mind that the ideas of needs , which we don &apos;t know that ideas of science , which are not going to be mistable to nature , and that are not conquickly conquered us , and that we don &apos;t tyourself .
Thank you .
I want to start asking , by by a children , like , from children , playing caves ,
While you know how to get them and make them , take them and get them , take them and moving them , learned actually and solve problems capable and solve problems capable and manipulating relations .
The space is deeply connected is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , from information , as an inspired by our interaction with physical objects , together my consultor Jeevan Kalanithi , I started wonder , I started to asking me , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of the mouse as a dynamely cursor as a digital waste that moves on a desktop , we could rare on a desktop , we could rare the hands ,
and systemate our placement ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a computer interactive computer as a beautiful scoom .
In a few words , a Siftable is a computer interactive computer as a beautiful scoom .
You can move them with hand , they can see between them , &quot; you can see between them , feel their movement and they have a screen and a screen .
But above , they &apos;re physical objects , like the morning , you can just move them .
Siftable is an example of a new ecosystem of tools for a manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physical , consciousness of the movement , of the other , and as we become more physical , of the other other , how we move them , of the other , how we move new and fun , the other new and interaction style .
I &apos;m going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is to show video : if you just just a video : if you just incline in a direction , the video , it will rotate like this , if you cline on the other hand back .
These interactive are conscious amount of others .
If I do it , you know , they &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re going to do .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they notice it and they can act a little bit .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they notice it and they can act a little bit .
They also switched their movement and inclination .
And then we realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power to use common gestures , &quot; a color like a liquid . &quot;
In this case , we have three Siftable , as a century of the versor I can use them to versate them to the color in that central , where you mix .
and I can use them to pversing color in that central , where you meet .
And if we &apos;re too , we can put a little bit at a place .
They also have a huge chance of learning , like mathematics , mathematics and games where people can try to try things fast , and see the results of them , and see the results of the immediately .
Now I &apos;m --
This is a Fibonacci sequence that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a game of words that is half between Scarabeo and Boggle .
Pratically , every turn around every turn , you know , you know , you know , Pratically , to every Turn , Pratically , to every Turn , and you know , as a letter to every Siftable , and cers of them on a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds , they remissing , and you have a new sset of letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
And here &apos;s the kids came up to the Media Lab , I did so they tried them and I turned a video .
They are very lived .
And one of the interesting things about this application is that you don &apos;t have to give people many instructions .
You just say , &quot; Compons of words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s some other people who come to it .
This is our younger toester , there &apos;s on the right .
It actually wanted to implane it .
They were just in the morning .
Now , this is an interactive application .
We wanted to build a tool for learning languages . He &apos;s Felix .
You can put new personally new characters in the scene , they &apos;re sunning Siftable them .
You can put new personally new characters in the scene , they &apos;re sunning Siftable them .
So , he &apos;s going to get out of the sun .
Video : Sun is spring .
David Merrill : Now he took a treatment in the scene .
Video : The arange treator .
Bel work ! Yeah !
So schools , and put them close to can be interacting the personally --
Video : Bau !
To inventing their history .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide him as you &apos;re going to be .
DM : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide him as you &apos;re going to be .
Volice : It &apos;s just like it .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , that &apos;s a tool , that &apos;s realized , to sample and to exectable and exectent music .
it &apos;s a tool , realized by recently , to sample and exeguy .
Siftable here are are going to be based as loaded , and the bacteria .
Every one of these has four different variations , and you can get to use .
You can also put sound in a sequence to compose these sound in a sequence ,
And modifying it and just a sequence .
These are actually you can control from the view , like the reverse and the filter .
It &apos;s taking it to a particular sound and then inclines to be full .
And then there are the general effects as time and volume , and they are applying on sequence .
Let &apos;s look at how it works .
Video : We &apos;re going to start putting a base in two Siftable , &quot; we can systems , we &apos;re going to extend , we extend , we add base .
Now I put a basic line .
Video : Now add of percussions --
Video : And I &apos;m going to put the film to the bacteria , so I can control the effect of the bacteria .
Video : DM : I can fast fast fast the entire sequence by a hand on the other side .
Video : And I &apos;m going to add the lower filter to the lower expression .
Video : DM : I can reombing the sequence .
So I don &apos;t have to plan it first , but I can sudden , I can make it longer longer or more cording .
And now , finally , I can spent the entire sequence by inclining to left the Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new man &apos;s interface machine and more like more like our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this patent , and also some chance that we &apos;re trying to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to transmate is that it &apos;s coming to this new generation of projects to interact with digital media , that will bring information in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the hour of speaking with all of you .
I &apos;m a writer .
I write books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also the love and the fass of my life .
And I don &apos;t look like that it can change .
But , said , something particular happened to my life and my career , and in my career , who took me me to realibrate the entire relationship with this work .
The particular thing is I recently wrote this book , this book , this biography called Mangy , Prua , Prua , Ama , &quot; which , I mean , I was a very much reason that I was going to use in the world and become a big , sensational , bestseller .
And the result is that everywhere goes now , people treat me as if I were condanned .
David -- condanned , condanned .
They &apos;re going to me , everybody worried and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t feafraid you not can do better ?
You don &apos;t fear to continue to write all all life without any more living in a book that can make a book that can care that makes somebody to make a book that can care ? &quot;
what can it important to somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s rassuring , you know .
But it could go worse , part of that I remember more than 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was a adolescent -- I was a writer .
I would meet the same reaction based by the fear .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you can &apos;t get succeed ?
You don &apos;t you fear that the humiliation of the refused you ?
You don &apos;t fear that you do this for all life without any living without any infrankly , and die on a smooth of dreams infrants with the mouth of the infrants of love to love care ? &quot;
Those of them , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
Yeah , I fear about all those things .
I always had afraid .
And I also have afraid of many other things that people wouldn &apos;t be to be involved .
As the algae and other things .
But , as much as I think , and I would be wondered , and I would be asking me , why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logical that everyone has to be waiting to be achieve by a job that you hear to do .
But what &apos;s so particular in the creative imprising creative to make us nervous about health mental health .
As my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don &apos;t remember one time in his 40 years of activity that he was asked if you could be engineer ?
Never was -- that block of the John engineer , how it goes ?
It wasn &apos;t that , you know ?
Holocadepress , chemicals as a group have no , in the centuries , the reputation of being alcoly manized manized manized manized manivers .
We have enough , we have enough this reputation , and not just writers , but creative of every kind of gender , we have this reputation of being enormous instabsolutation .
And it &apos;s not going to look at the conteous trists of the magnifices of the magnificent minds that only in the 21st century , they died young people , they died young , they died young people .
And the ones that have not suicidated seems to be really disfaced by their done .
Norman Mailer , before I die , in the last interview said , &quot; Every book killed me a little bit more than &quot; a little more extraordinary affermation about your life .
But we don &apos;t bat it when we heard this because we &apos;ve heard these things so long that somehow we have completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering and the art , it &apos;s going to be in some way you record and the art , it will always be at the corost .
And the question I want to ask all over here today is : Are you agree with this idea ?
I &apos;m going to do this -- because it &apos;s also like , it looks like a , it &apos;s not good for anything that &apos;s going to be good for nothing this supposition .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous and I don &apos;t want to see it perpetuate in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our big creative minds to live .
And I know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to that I was going to get to that feel host of suppositions , above the circumstances I &apos;m in my career .
So , I &apos;m looking at , I &apos;m quite a young , I &apos;ve been about 40 years .
I have about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything write about this is going to be right now , as the work that was going to be done by the way , I was successful .
I &apos;m going to be holding , because we &apos;re all about the biggest friends are on my biggest success to my house .
Oh , Gesus , who think .
You know this is the kind of thinking that that brings a person to start bink in the morning and I don &apos;t want to do that .
I would stop continuing to do this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it seems to me , after a lot of reflective , that the way to continue to write is to create a psychological construct , okay ?
I have to find a few way I &apos;m going to find a distance between me , and my natural anxy on what reaction is about what the reaction is going to get a scorse . And as I was looking for all year , trying to find out the year , trying to find out , if you could have better ideas to see if they could have better ideas and more more healthy ideas to see if they could have better ideas and more healthy ideas .
how to help people to reach the inerents who are emotional risks of creativity .
And that research has taken me to the ancient Greeting and ancient Rome .
I &apos;m going to be a little bit of the way back .
In the ancient Greetes and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity to be from men , OK ?
It thought creativity was this spirit of the beautiful divity , and sell men someone distant and unknown for reasons , and unknown for reasons , distant reasons and unknown for reasons .
The Greeks called these &quot; Dian &quot; &quot; demons &quot; &quot; demons &quot; . &quot;
Socrate , wonderful , believed to have a demon the handle wisdom .
Romans were the same idea , but they called the spirit species of spirit without a genius .
which is great , because the Romans didn &apos;t really think that a genius was somebody was a particularly intelligent .
And they believed that a genius was this kind of entity divine that was created in the walls of a study of an artist , a little bit like Dobby , and that came out of assisted the homething of the artist and model the result of the artist and model the result of that work .
Here &apos;s easy -- that &apos;s the distance of which I talk -- that psychological construct that you protect from the results of your work .
And they all knew that it was , right ?
So the antic artists were protected by certain things , like , for example , the too much narcism , right ?
If your work was exceptional job was , you couldn &apos;t take it all , they all knew that you could help it by this genioral genioral .
If your work , it wasn &apos;t all all the hot , it wasn &apos;t all holds , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a inable .
And so people han concept creativity in the West for a long time .
And then the Renasent came to it and everything changed , and nacize this great idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe , and no longer to leave the mystery and to leave to the mitive creatures .
This was the rational principle and people started to think that creativity was completely the creativity to be completely by the idivide .
And for the first time in history , he started to refer to this or the first time , as an artist as a rather than a person with genius .
And I have to say it was a big herror .
I think it &apos;s like a recipitch person to believe that as a recipient as a source , the essence and the sisters of all mysternest , creative , unknown and ethethn , undred and ethern a large philosysical philosys-like phily .
It &apos;s like to ask somebody to enjoy the sun .
Deal-shape and it full creates all these expectations on performance .
And I think it was this pression to destroyed artists in the past 500 years .
And , if that &apos;s true , and I think it &apos;s , and I think it &apos;s , and now ?
Can we do that different ?
Maybe go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and creative mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t slope 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And probably , there &apos;s probably people among the audience would be a very much of scientific notion , you know , you know , you &apos;re doing the people by sfocused on their projects .
I &apos;ll just not convince you all on this thing .
But the question I &apos;d like to ask is -- why not ?
Why not to think that way ?
Because it has more sense than anything that ever ever ever ever explaining to explain the exasperant impredicbility of creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever tried to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- I know , you don &apos;t behave rationally .
And in fact , it can be completely paranormal .
I did this meet recently with the extraordinary poetc , Ruth Stone , who has now 90 , but it was a poetic for all life and said that during his childhood in Virginia , worked out in the fields , and he felt it , in the fields , and he felt it , in the fields .
He said , I was like a fragorous train .
And she was coming up to her landscape .
He heard him to be , because he was tremendous land under his feet .
She knew he had one thing to do at that point and it was , words , &quot; running like a matters . &quot;
And so , he was walking up home and he was walking up from this poetry , and it wouldn &apos;t have to get a piece of paper and a faster , while the transplacement .
Those times , he couldn &apos;t be faster , so running and correced and correced and running out and the poetry and then the perdeal was going through and she would continued to roll through the landscape , looking for , as he said , &quot; one other poet . &quot;
Then there were those times -- this piece I &apos;ll never forget to the -- there were almost any time when they were almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and it was looking for the card and the poetry her , and he would go through , and he would be a climb as if he was going , and he was like you home with the other hand and and the step .
He washed the poetry and put it in his body and put it in his body and transcritation on the page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be presented page and intatta , but the last word on the top of the word .
So when I felt it -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly the same thing .
I don &apos;t all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conducture .
I &apos;m a moving , and my way to work is ; I &apos;m woking up with every day and work and go to work and go on and work and go on and go on and go on on us .
But even I , in my test daggin , I &apos;ve been striped against that thing , sometimes .
And I &apos;m also imagine a lot of you have done .
You know , even if the work and ideas were given me from a certain fundamentally I could not honestly know .
And what is this ?
And how can we relate it to it so that we don &apos;t do the head , but rather , what , it &apos;s going to do it ?
For as much as I think , the best example of the Tom Waits Tom Waits , which I interviewed in a newspaper ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the most of life was the incarnation of the artist mented artist , trying to control , and trying to control these species of creative impulses .
But then I got it , he climbed , and one day as he was driving on a &quot; highway in Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
She was going fast and everything in a sent sudden this little slide , which comes to his head as isspiration , and the various , and the various , and the vailing , and the wants , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the desidern , and the desidery , but it doesn &apos;t know how to take it .
It doesn &apos;t have a piece of card , it doesn &apos;t have a cut .
So he starts to feel this species of old anxygy to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;ll remarrow up by this personal song .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to go to the panic , he stopped .
I &apos;m going to do the whole mental process and did something completely new .
And I just watched the sky and said , &quot; Scush , I &apos;m not seeing that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Do you know a song now ?
If you really want to exist , you know , you get a more of a time when I can take care of you .
Although , you go to important something else today .
You know , Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his process worked changed after this .
Not the work , the work was still hoscure as always .
But the process , and the anxy that was attornized when I got the genius , the genius , the genius that &apos;s out of him , and they libered it , and they would remust that they did not have to be an interiorized and remust that it was realized and gone .
But I was going to be this sheep , wonderful , wonderful , a conversation between Tom and this external thing that was not Tom .
So , how much I was working on and I was going to change a little way I was working and I was already .
This idea , he saved when I was writing , &quot; Mang , Prua , Ama , and falls in one of those dispersonally caught that we &apos;re all working on something and we don &apos;t start thinking that &apos;s going to be a disaster , that &apos;s going to be the worst book , which is going to be the worst book .
Not just bad , right , right , right ,
And I started thinking about to throw this project .
But then I reminded Tom who talked to the air and I tried to the air and I tried to the air and I tried to the air and I tried to the air and I tried to the air and I tried to get on Tom who talked to the air and I tried to the air and I tributed to the air and I tributed to the Tom om , who was talking about the air and I tried to the Tom of Tom , who was talking about the air and I tributched to the air and I tried to get about the air and
So I went up my face in the hoscrits and I made my comments to a corner of the room .
And I said , &quot; You know , &quot; Shoh , what is , both of course , we know that if this won &apos;t be bright right ?
Because as I &apos;m seeing that I have , I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want to be better , you have to introduce you and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , I don &apos;t do anything .
I &apos;m going to writing the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to favor that was recorded that I today today I was presented to do my part . &quot; And it &apos;s so , OK -- it &apos;s in the deserts of Africa , North Africa , the people were dancing for the slope , sacred dance and hours .
And they were always magnificent , because the balerins were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every time , it was rarely , something happened , and one of these artists had been transcending .
And I know what I talk , because I know you &apos;ve all seen it , at some point , a performance .
It was like the time you stopped , and the dancing dancing through a kind of door and it wasn &apos;t doing anything different from the usual , like 1,000 nights before , but it all was going .
And suddenly , it doesn &apos;t just like a human .
But it turns out from the ded-inside and sluminated in the fire of divinity .
And when this happened , to the time , people knew what was , they were what was , they called it with her name .
They were conguns and start sing , &quot; Allah , God , Allah , God , Allah , God ,
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curious storic -- when the More invaded the Spanish , I was asked this habitude with them and pronounded changed in the centuries of &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; you can still hear in the corries .
In Spain , when an artist did something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , and , and Alah , just , sure , and I was a good thing , and I was a God scorum .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes the day , for the dancing dancing at the same , when you wake and discovering that are the 11 in the morning of Martedesday and I scorm of God is no longer .
It &apos;s just a death with a big bal of the ginock , and perhaps it will never be able to get to the altitude .
And maybe no one God &apos;s still while he &apos;s going to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most painful recognciliations to make a creative life .
But maybe not to be so angosciant if you can &apos;t believe , anzyutto , that the most extraordinary expects of your own , are the most extraordinary extraordinary extraordinary extraordinary extraordinary , you know , that the most extraordinary extraordinary , and it &apos;s a lot of your own .
But I just think that I &apos;m just going to get you from a unimagerable source of this squisite of your life that you have to have to go to something else when you &apos;ve finished .
And , you know , if we think it changes it .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s certainly like the I thought for several months in the book that I &apos;m going to be huge , and perileasy , I was very successful , spdirectly , I was following my grdirectly success .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel electric from this is , not going to be afraid .
Don &apos;t beat you . It &apos;s just your work .
It &apos;s going to introduce you for your part , whatever it can be .
If your work is balance , balance .
If the wind , absurd , assigned to you decide to leave some kind of wonderful wonder , for one moment through your efforts , then , &quot; then ! &quot;
Altriments , you &apos;re the same dance .
And &quot; Oh , &quot; You ! &quot;
I think , you have to go out and I think it &apos;s got to teach it .
&quot; You ! &quot; She ! &quot; She had to be a human and test of test love and test that you &apos;re going to make you continuously .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Okay .
As I talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what it can mean and discovery and discovery of new genes of genes .
Now we &apos;re beginning a new patent : We started to digitize biology and now starting from that digital code we &apos;re going to a new phase of biology , designing and synthesizing and synthesizing life .
We always tried to ask big questions .
&quot; What &apos;s life ? &quot; is something that many biologists I think they &apos;re trying to understand various levels .
We tried different approaches , reducing it to minimum .
We &apos;re digitizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome , it was to go from the analog of the computer world &apos;s digital world of the computer .
Now , let &apos;s ask us : can we regenerate life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome of those that can authority in the laboratory .
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome to create a more smaller .
We are able to eliminate a hundred genes about 500 that are here .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our .
Credes , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at a time , it &apos;s very improbable that this can get to a living cell .
So we decided that the only way that we ren was to synthesize this chromosome in a way that we could modify the components to bring to some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of the &quot; Can we synthesis to be ? &quot;
Can the chemistry to produce these big molecules that we never done to create before now ?
And in case , can we make a coma chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemical material chemical material .
The speed that we are able to digitize life is growing to exponential .
Our capacity of writing the genetic code , rather slowly , but it &apos;s improving .
And our most recent retaking the carried on a exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process has requested a lot of steel pass , starting with a biothical review before experiments .
But we found that DNA is very difficult .
There are hundred hundred of machines in the world that are producing small segments of 30 to 50 letters and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the more than the segment is , more errors there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments and correcting the errors .
And this was our first attempt , to start by the digital information of Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , actually , the correction of the errors and got a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material chemical material and we put it in the bacteria , the bacteria , the bacteria began to read this genetic code and producing particles .
The viral particles have been repurposed by the cells , are come back and they destroyed E.
I talked about recently with members of the oil industry and say that they have certainly understood this model .
They remains more than you .
We think this is a situation where software can actually build the software is in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the biggest things .
We wanted to build the entire bacteria .
They are over 580 mile of genetic code .
So we thought we &apos;d build it in the size of virus , so that we can change the casses to understand what the components are components of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accurateful standard was a mile for every 10 mile base .
We found , we would have discovered it , 30 errors . If we did that original sequency , we would never be able to do that work .
One part of the process is to design segments that are over-letters that they overrapping with all the other sletters of 50 letters to build subtype works together .
We can reach unique elements here .
You probably read that we &apos;re going to put on the class .
So , think that &apos;s like this : We have a genetic code based on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters code together about 20 hammaloid , and there &apos;s a specific order to letters for every amminoid .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frastion , thoughts .
What we did at the beginning was self-allowed .
Some of them were not poetry .
We designed these segments to just get them with enzures .
There are enzymes that and put them up and put them up .
And we started assemble , they began to make parts , starting with segments , at 10,000 letters , and it &apos;s 24 mile letters at them , 2mile letters .
We have produced these segments in abundance so that we can sequency them that we &apos;re trying to create a very robust .
We &apos;re trying to automate the process .
So , this seems to be a basket .
When we get to these very long segments , more than 100 middle base , it will not grow more directly in E.
It comes to the limit of modern molecular biology .
So we consider other mechanisms .
We knew a mechanism called a homology , which is a homology , which is useful to repair DNA able to get segments .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinocratis , it can make three million rad rad .
You can see in the focus like the chromosome of the chromosome .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s been returned out exactly as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can &apos;t be completely .
They can live under a vacuum .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life exists in space , and you &apos;re going to find new environments .
Actually , NASA showed that this happens .
This is an image of the molecule that we built these processes , just using the free segments to design .
The lieven-assembly .
This image was not taken with a electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a very big molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that cover a second .
This is the publishing that we did a little time ago .
They are over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the biggest molecule of a definitely ever created by man .
It has a 300 million .
If we prove it with a 10 without spaces , it would be 142 pages , it would just to transmit this genetic code .
Now , how do we work it ?
Of course , through a virus is a little girls .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s simpler even when it comes to the eues like our : you can just extract the nucleo and insert another , which is practically the nucleo process .
In the bacteria , the chromosome is integrated integrated inside the cell , but we &apos;ve just showed that we can do a complete transplant by a cell a cell , a complete cell a cell a cell to another and activating it .
We got a chromosome chromosome from a microbial species .
The two are different as the men from the topes .
We &apos;ve added some genes in more way that we could decide what to pick for this chromosome .
And then he skied with the full enzymes .
And when we put it in the cell was study -- and you &apos;ll be a look like , and you &apos;re going to be a sophisticatoes -- the new croms , the new croms .
And we were actually thought that we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we have been trying to be more in there .
This is one of the major evolution .
We found that many species have added a second or a second or a third chromosome somewhere , adding in a second thousands of new high hundred new hits .
So who thinks evolution as a gene at a time that has no realized most of the biology .
There are enzymes called me &quot; that addrestrial to digerve the DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell .
The cell phones that we have a hundred of it .
It &apos;s expressed , and it recognizes the other chromosome as an extraneous material , and we found it with just the cell and the new chromosome .
it became blue because of the genes we have inserted .
And in a short time , all the feature of a species have gone lost of a species have gone , and it turned out of the new software we in the cells .
All proteins are changed , membranes have changed , and when we read the genetic code equivalent to what we &apos;ve transfer to you .
Now , this may seem genetics , but altering the DNA software , we can change things in a way way we can change things in a way .
Now , I &apos;ve been explained that here is not talking about this genesy -- but progress to go from three million years and a half million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s enough when we think about our necessity .
We &apos;re going to go to six billion people at the nine and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Just to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one in 1946 ; in 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re now having problems now to find food , fresh fresh fresh and web , medicinal and web for six billion people .
It &apos;s even more hard to do that nine billion .
We use over five billion carbon , more than 30 billion barrassment .
That means a millions of barrassing a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replaces , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to realize all the CO2 emission from these materials that ends up in the atmosphere .
At the day , because of the scientific discoveries all around the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that they are the design components for the future .
The electronics can only have a dozen about a dozen about the components , and think about how many different things are coming .
Our limits here are major data is the biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , because of these synthetization , able to create what we call a combinatory .
We are able to build a big robots that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think of these 20 million genes or try to do different genes or try to do that processes to produce the processes to produce optimize processes , we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology , and create more biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemistry or carbon , chemistry or carbon , production , production of vaccinines .
This is an instantly instantly of some software programmed on that we &apos;re working on to be able to sit and design species into the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how they &apos;re going to be .
We know exactly what they are their genetic code .
Now we &apos;re focused on the carbons of quarter generation .
You &apos;ve seen that extractly from the grain was a bad experiment .
We have carbons of second and third generation that will be out of sugar to the carbon of the higher value as open or different kinds of butants .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without more more than food , and limited the cost of food and limiting the cost of food and limited the CO2 in matter , which we &apos;re working to design that we can design that they can reach this scope , and we think we could get the first carbon , and we could think we could have the first carbons of carbons of how much fourth generation in about 18 months .
The sunlight combined with CO2 is a methodownhill -- but in our discoveries all around the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , at about 2500 feet of deep the temperature of the water temperature of the water .
CO2 using hydrogen by CO2 using hydrogen as a source of energy .
We &apos;re trying to figure out if we can ining CO2 , which can easily be transported through tubes , converting that CO2 in carbon , to drive this process .
So we short think that we could be able to increase what the base question , what &apos;s base question , &quot; What is life is , &quot; We , &quot; We have the goal , we have the goal to replaces to replaces the entire oil industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do that TED , where can you do it ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working to use the same methods to create vaccines .
You saw this year with the influence , we &apos;re always back a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s going to find the right wind .
I think what changes can change by building vaccines in anticype .
That &apos;s how the future could start seeing , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating the evolution with synthetic bacteria , and finally incells .
We are at so much of the improve people .
Our purpose is to live enough to try to try and do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;ll show you , the most quickly possible , some fundamental work , the new technology that we took to Microsoft in a following almost . This is Seadragon . This is Seadragon . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s an environment where you can interact with local level that remote with a huge amount of data .
Here we &apos;re seeing a lot of digital gabyte , with a kind of constant zoom , and so so , for a bread running , and it &apos;s a panoramic speed , images images , as we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big the amount of data or images .
Most of digital photographs , but this is for example , is a scanning of the Bilioteca standard of Congress , and it turns into the gama of 300 megapiel .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that the only thing that the present tations of a system like this is the number of plxels on your screen in any time . It &apos;s also a very flexible .
This is a whole book , you don &apos;t images .
This is Dickens . Dickens . Every colonn represents a capital .
To show you that it &apos;s about textbooks and not images , we can do something like this , to see that &apos;s really about a real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a little artificial book .
I don &apos;t get it to it .
This is a more realistic example . This is a number of The Guardian .
Every big picture is the beginning of a seection .
And it really gives you the pleasure and beautiful experience of a read or a daily reverse of a newspaper , which is to nature a lot of medium .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the Guardian .
We created a high-resoluonal fasulate resoluonal -- much higher than what you use in a published -- and we put extra extra extra extra content .
If you want to see the feature of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even techniques , techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that that means to be able to the pop-up and other syntheast similar , they wouldn &apos;t be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don &apos;t want to lose time , if we don &apos;t want to say that we have contributed to this field .
These are all the streets in the United States , and it &apos;s geospatial images of NASA .
So , we &apos;re going to go to something else .
This is now from the Web , you can go to it .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual searching in the computer very interesting computer . It &apos;s a very interesting computer searching of Noah Seth-University of the UW of Steve Sethz of Microsoft Research Sethloptim and Research Szeliski .
And it &apos;s from the Web , dress of Seadragon .
You can see when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from an image to the other and have this kind of experience to the other and have this kind of experience .
But the space location of the images here has actually a significant .
The computer algorithms of the computer have recorded these images together , so that they corresponding to the real place to the real place to the real place where the imaginion -- all the close to the Roccial Montagne Roccial Montagne Roccial Montagne Roccial -- they were taking . So , here you see the elements of a slide-free .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more space .
I want to go to one of the original set of Noahs -- and this is from a previous Photosynth prototype of Photosynth that we did work for the first time , the summer Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily the key behind this technology , the technology , Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily about the environments that we put in the site .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of Nothtrial . Dothers Flickr . Bauckr , you know , you can go to Flickr Din Flickr and you get images of types and so on . Overge , and you go . Or one of these arancion a picture that &apos;s discovered a picture that you turn out to this model .
So , I &apos;m all images that are taken from Flickr and they &apos;ve been all linked to this way .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this simplication .
You know , I would never have thought I &apos;d be able to work for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifying to get this kind of accountable to get this kind of account here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of fotams . And from those of the professional cellphones to the professional phones to the professional .
And if I can , I try and look for the more strange .
Most are block , etc .
Some of the photographs here , there &apos;s a series -- etc .
This is a Nothtrial recorded correctly .
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is taking data from beautiful -- from the entire collective memory of how the Earth , and connected point of visual , and connected all those data together .
All those pictures become linked , the higher of the sum of the sum .
You have a floor model of the entire thing that emerge .
Think of this as the Stephen Lawler &apos;s work on the virtual Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as a lot of people use , and the people use , and the advantages to use .
Their pictures are baded by other people .
If someone comes to the idea of contracting all these sets saying the name , my picture of the Nothers , my picture of Nothers of Nothtributing to all that data , and I can use as a point of inground , and I can use the pictures of everyone else , and have a picture of the other , and have a social experience of crossmodity and cross-cophy .
Of course , a consequence of all this virtual models extremely elaborate consequence of every part of the Earth , and satellite images and satellite and satellite and similar images , but the collective memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized what your software will constitute to us to do is that , in the next few years , all the photographs shared by everyone in the world will be practically connect together ?
BA : Yeah . What &apos;s basically about it is to find .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , you want , among images .
And it &apos;s doing it at the content of the pictures .
What becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of seeing information that many of these images are possible .
As when you do a research of images on the Web , you know , it &apos;s a sentence and the Web page has a lot of information about the pictures of the picture .
Now , what happens if that picture , you connects all your pictures ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of wealth that &apos;s going to be huge is really huge . It &apos;s a classical effect .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible . Compliments .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the main pleases when you travel and one of the ethographic research is the power of the people who didn &apos;t forget the power between the wind , between the wind , the touched in the wind , the touch of the foot , the life-like floating .
Basts thinking that the Jaguar Jaguar traveling , and the Vy Lattea , or that the Milky Aggathering , or that in Himalayas , the good ddisturbs , the good dhuge of Dharma , to remember the importance of the central anthropology , and that the idea that the world that we live in a sense of the world that we live in a sense of reality , but it &apos;s just a model , but it &apos;s just a reality , is , but it &apos;s just a reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stirs did , well , or a lot of generations ago .
And of course , we all share the essential .
All we all do procreating .
We are subjects in the beginning .
We have to death the inexorability of death , so it doesn &apos;t surprising us if we cut and balleames --
We have a art .
What hits is the particular rhythm , the landscape of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that are the Penan forests of the Borneo , or the follow-Voodoo , or the Kaisut , or the Kaisut of the Kaisut , the Curandero , the Curandero , or a cameler in Sahara .
He was my journey of journey in the desert a month ago , or a hallevator of yak in the valley of the Everest , the Everest , the world &apos;s mother .
All these populations teach us that there are some other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , and move in the world .
And , if you reflect a minute , it &apos;s a concept that it can give you hope .
So , along , cultures of the world creating a spiritual life , and it &apos;s cultural life that has the planet and it &apos;s important for the planet and is important for the planet as a biosphere .
And you can think about this guy namely cultural like an ethnosphere , and you can define the etnosphere , dreams , dreams , myths , inspirations , inspirations , inspirations , the ported of the human imagination from the human imagination , from the human imagination .
Ethnosphere is the fantastic patrimony of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be as inquisitive .
And because the biosphere was graveled as as well as it was as much as well as rapidly as it was as quickly as quickly as quickly as quickly as faster .
Noone biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species was on the horrates of extinction because it &apos;s faly , or -- in the most apocalyalymesis -- in the most of the biological diversity -- and you don &apos;t even have to the most typical hypothesis , the most typical diversity .
The whole thing is , of course , is , of course , the language .
When you were born there 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only composed by a vocabulary or a series of grammad rules .
A language is the spraced human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle with which the animal of every culture is going to be in material .
Every language is a forest of mind , a bink , a thought , an ecosystem , a spiritual chance .
And of those 6,000 languages , while we &apos;re sitting in Monterey , at least the half is not sushing in the ears of children .
They don &apos;t come out of the kids , which means , unless they wasn &apos;t wonderful things , they &apos;re already dead .
What is there sad is more sad than being turned out of silence , the last to talk a language , that &apos;s the last to speak a language , that doesn &apos;t have a way to transmate the wisdom of the kids ?
This is a fan state of somewhere in the world every two weeks . So , every two weeks . And every two weeks , a drilabels and it &apos;s taking the last fultimate language .
And I know somebody who will say , &quot; That &apos;s not that better ?
The world would not be a better place if we talk about the same language ? &quot; We all talk about yoruba , then we all talk yoruba .
Let &apos;s talk .
You &apos;ll discover a sudden thing to say , not to talk about your language .
Now , I &apos;d like to do a journey through ethnosphere --
a little journey in ethnosphere to give you a masage of what we &apos;re losing .
Most of us forgotten that when I say , &quot; I really mean , &quot; I mean , I mean , &quot; I really mean , I mean , &quot; I think , &quot; I mean , &quot; I think , &quot; a lot of different ways of ways of exists .
Let &apos;s take for example , this Barasana &apos;s babs , in Amazon , the population , the population of anaconda , which makes the sacred to try to be sacred by sacred sacred .
It &apos;s a population that &apos;s not able to distinguish the blue color because the blue color is the blue color because the blue color , which depends the population .
They have a strange language and a marriage , and a marriage , called language , &quot; I must must move a person that talking a person talking a different language .
All this roots of mythological past , but the particularity is that in these extent of the extent of the extent of the summon that six or seven languages anybody who &apos;s none language .
They limited to hear and then they start speaking .
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I &apos;ve lived , the Waoran of Ecuador , an incredible people that have the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionaries have been taking a facal that was made .
They did come out of the photographs that they were reporting them in poses that they would realize that this pluvial population forest never saw anything .
They collected the pictures of the ground , they turned it to a shape and a figure , and they didn &apos;t find anything , they have conclosed the diabol , and they kill the five with the slope .
But the Waorans don &apos;t just kill the straniests .
They kill them .
Five percent of mortality was caused by them .
We sat eight generations and we found two cases of natural death and found two cases of death , they admit that one of them was so , that one of them was so , and then they kill the same . And then they had a way , and then they killed the same .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal that &apos;s 40 steps and recognizing the species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was a very interesting job when my Harvard professor of Harvard , he asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to intrue in Haiti , and Tonton the base of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutoutside , and Tonton Macoutside , and Tonton the grombie I used to use to do the zombie .
To give a sense of miraculous , I would have to understand the Vodoun culture and that Voodoo is not magic .
It &apos;s a pretty short of a metaphysics of the world .
Very interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Budddddged , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no religious feelings . And instead , and Voodoo is not religious features that the distilled of the nail diaspora of naked in the slavor of the slavery diaspora .
What makes voot is the intense report between life and death .
So , the pattern are coming .
The spirits can be invoded by the Great Aqua , they respond to the dance of dance and replacuism temporary to the animate of the alive .
So , the voodoists love to say , white God , who you go to wait to God .
We dance in the temple and become God . &quot;
And from the moment that you &apos;re walking , is the spirit that you , how can you do the bad you ?
So , you assistes to these incredible events : followed the voodoo in state of trance that touches infuel infuel .
In all the people with which I lived the most extraordinary are the Kogi of Sierra Nevada Devada Devada in the Santa Marta , in the Sierra Nanta Marta , in Colombia .
Discencing of ancient civilization , which they were on the carairs of Colombia , the population of the Colombia , the population was going to be on the caraibaise gs .
In a short continent , this population continent , this population has never been conquered by the spagners .
And so , I &apos;m governments today , they &apos;re governments are actually extraordinary .
The young people are taking from the families to three or four , and they live secret in a hombers of the huge of the foot in the basic glasses in the lower of the glaciers for 18 .
Two periods of nine years from the way to reproduce the nine months of gestation that transcorrupt in the mother , now are metaphorically in the Great Mther .
So , for all this time , they are acculate to the values of their society , values that are predicting their prayers and only their prayers are managing -- or to say the cosmic balance .
At the term of this incredible initiation , they &apos;re improving taking out and for the first time , at 18 years , they see a full of the first time , they see a full of the first bad , when the sun burning sun , when the sun sunlight , all that they learned in theory is conferred to all its . And the pregns it , and says , &quot; The priest is going to a step back and says , &quot;
&quot; As I said , &quot; I said , &quot;
It &apos;s studies . Now it &apos;s going to protect it . &quot;
They &apos;re called the birthers and say that we , brothers , and we are the destruction of the world .
This intuition is extremely important .
When we think about Indigenes and environment we invochieve Rseau and the old story of various various various , which is a rocky concept in his simplicity or maybe we invodd Theau and we say that these people are close to the Earth of us .
The advice populations are not not not sentimental sentimental .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the disease in the diarium , and in the winds of the TIbet , but thank you to the time and the rituals , they created a mystic of the Earth is not on the concept of the world , but on a subtle basic intuition .
What does it mean ?
It &apos;s like a kid of Ande who grows up to be a kid spirit Apu that &apos;s going to be a spirit of a Prit that will be a deeply different human being depped to be a deeply different , and it will have a little bit different , and it will have a mountain a Montana that grow is a mountain is a mountain rock of rocken to be scale .
Which is the decade of a spirit or a mineral cow , it &apos;s irrievant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Britannica credating that forests serve to be cut .
That made me a different human being different human being different from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that forests are the providing Huk , and the drillled Huk and the Sorrivers that live in the northern of the world , the Hamatsa beginning .
If you start looking at that these cultures can actually actually make different realities , you can start to understand some of them discoveries . So let &apos;s take this plants .
I took this picture to open them in the nororders Amazon .
Mayahuge of you have heard about the Eahuge , the most powerful substance of the repertoy of the repertoy of the repertoire .
What makes the eyahuge , is not the potential pharmacological pharmacological pharmacological pharmacological . It &apos;s composed by two elements .
From a hand , this lian leaging of a carboline , harmful carbon , harmine and harmers , slightly , harmful hallucinogene .
Trunning the only plant smoke , you have a bluaser that alters a little bit of consciousness , but it &apos;s mixed with the leaves of a coffee family of coffee .
This plant contains powerful , very similar to serotonine , methodyltryl-five , methoxyltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltrains .
If you &apos;ll see Yanomami rare on for the nose ssustaining to the nose sset of species , which is in methods methoxyltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltrained .
Tirking that wrights on for the nose is a little bit like being disappeared by a barothering of the baroes and land on a mess of electricity . Rem . It doesn &apos;t believe a distortion of reality .
I was often by my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who wrote was psychedelic , with his discovery of fungi , with his discovery of the hallucinogens in the &apos; 30 in Mexico .
Second my thesis can &apos;t classify these triptams like hallucinogens because if you &apos;re done , you can &apos;t tell anybody to be hallucinated . And the triptamp can &apos;t be absolutely because they &apos;re actually not absolutely because they are the money , it &apos;s naturally , because they are naturally in the intestine , dead rouse .
It &apos;s possible to the horbly if you make a lot of other chemicals that denaturing MAO .
Now , the beautiful : the carbon that is in this lian are inhibitors of MAs , the same kind of necessary to be able to potentiate triptams . The source question : in a 80,000 species of plants , how these are not like this , as you make these are not like , but if you combined , they don &apos;t have , but if you combined in a way , create a biochemical version that &apos;s experior of the parts ?
We use the big eufemism of the prova and the error , which can revealing infruit .
But if we ask the Indians , they &apos;ll say , &quot; People talk about it . &quot;
What does it mean ?
This tribes , Cofan , has 17 variety variety of the Eastern , which distinguish are in the forest , and that our eyes would be in the same species .
If we ask him how they stabilish their tassumpy , they &apos;re not going to be able to be , and I didn &apos;t you know ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take 17 variety in a night of bag and each one will care with a different slums .
With this is not Harvard in Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting to contact the pristine .
Now , &#91; applauss &#93; the problem is that also have the people who have to have the heart people are the writing people , but in some way to the margins of the history of the history of our real world , and it &apos;s passes beyond .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it weren &apos;t reverse to its warm or technological innovations , but rather as we were in and absolutely absolutely actively or accepted passively or accepted passively or accepted passively , and the planet . Now the problem is not changing .
All cultures through centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibilities .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux have no stopped to be Sioux when they put up up and foot as they have been , as Americans have no stopped to be Americans when they put out of the horse and hot .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that are threatening the ethnosphere . It &apos;s power .
The flight of domination .
And if you look at the world , you &apos;ll find that these are not destiny cultures are not destiny cultures .
They are creatures and dynamics out of the existence that are beyond their ability of an existence that are beyond capacity .
Sy that it &apos;s disbosing in the patria of Penan --
a nomad namad namad , in the Sarawak , a people who lived free in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to a generation ago , and now reducing the fillong-like reducing , where you can see the river Borneo to the Borneo to the Minerian inerian Isweeting , where the Japanish to the Japanese , where the naves of the Japanalyzon , where the naves ,
I &apos;m going to fill the stives with the wood ind .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that have come with the gold .
If we move on Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the wall waste waste .
As you know the genocide , the extinction of a population , is condanned to universal level , but the ethnic , the distraction of the style of a population , not only condanted , but celebrate in the development , because it &apos;s part of the development strategy .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of Tibet until you go from the beginning .
I &apos;ve spent 6,000 miles from Chenger in the Western China , through the Western Tibet , coming in Lhasa , with a young colleague , but only came to Lhasa , I realized what &apos;s behind the statistics we hearing about .
6,000 sacred monuments ins in poles and centers .
1.2 million people killed from the military during the Cultural Revolution .
The dad of this guy was ascrited to Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed to the Chinese invasion .
His unclean with Santity in Santity during the diaspora that has taken the people in Nepal .
His mother was imprisoned and his cold was to be rich .
It was taken to hidden at the age of two nases , the age of two nurses his grandmother , because it wouldn &apos;t have living without him .
The sister , who did the same , was put in a reeducation camp .
And one day , he inavverted a daughter Mao and , for this transgression , it was put in the walls workers for seven years .
Tibet can be insation-insopporable , but the spirit redeship of the population is from tener .
At it , it &apos;s all reduces .
We want to live in the monoy world of the monotony or we want to collect the polycle world of diversity ?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead , before we die said that his biggest fear was that , in our large vision of the world , we &apos;re not just going to see the whole whole range of human imagination is a day , we &apos;re going to be thinking about a day , but a day , we &apos;ll wake up from a sleep , but a day we &apos;re wake up from a sleep , and we &apos;ll see it .
And it &apos;s umiliating that our species is , for 60,000 years .
The Neolitics Revolution , which given us the agriculture , which has done us to the cult of the see , and by the Sheean poetry with the next few of the cler , creating the hierarchy of specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world industrialized .
That shark shark history , I &apos;m not suggests that we have to have to go to all the challenges that we &apos;re going to have to go .
When these cultures of the world myriadidies , what to be to be to say , they say with 10,000 different voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we &apos;re all going to be what we are , a consciousness , which has to be what we are , a consciousness , that has to be able species , and there are great times . And there are great times . And there are great times .
I took this picture on the north of Baffin , when I went to the Baffin , when I went to hunting with Inuit , and this man , and this man , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya ,
The canoes Government was always kind of tile with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to stabilier our own colonies .
The grandfather was going to go .
She took her life , teminting for his life , brought all the arms , and all his attractive tols .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t feel the cold , they suspect .
The slices of the slites were made of fish .
The grandfather did not put out of this man did not put out of the arctic notice or the blizard that suffered .
It &apos;s wired out , you &apos;ve been hot , you &apos;ve been hot the skin and defecated in their hand . When I did her foot , they worked on a light .
She sprured out on the short of this cluster , and when it became solid , he killed a dog .
She had schools and created a bridge , with the actual cassa , and it &apos;s slitta , and it &apos;s sled on the banchisa , and it &apos;s slide on the banchisa , and it &apos;s slope on the room , and it &apos;s slope .
We want to talk about high clear with nothing ? Rish : And that , in different ways , and in different ways , and that &apos;s the symbols of the population of the world &apos;s population and all the address of the world .
In 1999 , the Canan government has been reduced to the Inuit , the total control of the California and Texmen together .
It &apos;s their new pathy . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a dependent territory . They all contricts .
One slendiging example of how a nation-state can recognize with his population .
And , finally , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious at least to who of us was in these remote zones of the planet , make it remote that they &apos;re not not in remote .
And it &apos;s for somebody &apos;s home .
They are setions of human imagination , that are allow the stuff . And for us , and all these kids , as the dreams of these kids , as dreams of these kids , become part of the geography of the hope .
Finally , we National Geographic , we &apos;re convints that political political will never get to anything .
We think polemy that polemy --
&#91; As &#93; not persuasive , they &apos;re not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and perhaps we &apos;re the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month , our site ,
156 countries transmitted our televisive .
Our revists are slets .
Our work is to travel in the etnosphere to bring our public to wonder cultural places that are going to go out of how they saw and hope , hopes , hope , hopology , hope , will share the central world , and we have to find a pluralistic life in a diversity , and we have to find a lifestyle and mouth style world and multicultural world and multural revealing and multicultural lifestyle and mine style ,
where the wisdom of all the people can contribute to our collective well-being .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope that I hope to ren some of the things that I &apos;m going to try to evidence some connection .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the official dogma official . &quot;
The dogma officer of what ?
The dogma offices of all Western industrial society . The Dogma official dogma offices : &quot; If we want to massault the well-being of the individual liberation . &quot;
The reason is , from a side , in fact that freedom is in the value , is useful , useful , useful , for human beings .
On the other is that if we &apos;re free , each of us can act to do everything that massive to do everything that massive ve our well-being , no one that decided to name .
The way to massaze is to massaulty is to massault the choice .
The more choices are more free , and the greatest is their liberation , the greatest , the greatest is their well-being .
This , I think , is so deeply radicated in society that nobody would be able to put it in the back .
And it &apos;s also deeply radicated in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I allowed a simple note on condents .
In my supermarket , there are 175 condents , without contact , without contact , and 12 acetes of oil , and 12 acetes that you can buy to buy a huge number of consumption in the rescillies that nobody &apos;s already 75 pronts is to your deading .
That &apos;s what the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic store to buy a stereo : case , CD , radio , radio , radio , radio , radio , radio , amplifier .
And in this single negotiation , there &apos;s a big number of components .
We can make six and a half million different combinations using the components that there are only in a negotiating negotiating the components that there are only a negotiating store .
You have to admit that there &apos;s a lot of choice .
Ather &apos;s the basic communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all the services , they could get all the serve class , at the basic mothers .
He was born the phone , they didn &apos;t buy it .
And a consequence of that , the phone was that the phone would never realize .
These time , they went .
Now we have a variety almost illimited phones , especially , especially between the cellular .
Here &apos;s the cell phones of the future .
My favorite is in middle , MP3 , cut , cut up , and it &apos;s ballowing for the crops .
If you don &apos;t have seen it in the house , you &apos;re not seen certain you know , you &apos;re just going to get it .
And what happens at the end is that people are in the shopping and asking this question . And you know what the answer is ? The answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the aquarters of the aquarters , and green expected choices .
Asanitary health care : not going on in the United States that you go from the doctor and doctor what you have to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do it , or B , &quot; Well , you know , &quot; B has these benefits and these goods . So what you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Dr. I should I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; It has these benefits and these , and the risks , and the risks . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebats , &quot; Dr. &quot;
And the doctor , I &apos;m not her . &quot;
And the result that we call it &quot; the disease &quot; autonomy of the disease , and it seems to be a beautiful thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not a fishing the weight and the responsibility to make decisions of somebody who knows something , and so it &apos;s not known -- and so it &apos;s not about -- and so it &apos;s not in condition to make the patient decisions .
There &apos;s a huge marketing products , direct to people like me and you , if you think about it and you , if you think it doesn &apos;t have any sense , because we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why do it ?
The answer is that they want to be that we call the doctor to ask to change it .
Something so fundamental as our identity is horever is is a choice , as you see in this gets in the gather . &quot; We don &apos;t want to provide kids . They &apos;re going to be a full right now , &quot; to be an identity . We don &apos;t have to be inventing .
And we can reinvent how many times we get us .
That means that every morning , to the risvails , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I spoke up the family and marriage , a time perspective , sunlight , severe , sunlight for anyone , it was that you moved the most soon , and it started to make the most soon as possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not even what to do after .
Egyday , it &apos;s really to play .
I teach to very intelligent students , and I do do it with their 20 percent in less than a time .
And not because they &apos;re less brilliant , not because they &apos;re less diliving .
but why are I impensieritation , I mean , I would you go to me or not ? I should be going to do it now ? &quot;
&quot; I should be going to have to think before kids or career ? I think before kids or career ? &quot;
They are interrupating logorananants .
And they &apos;re trying to answer these questions , even if this implement not to the compassionate compassionate and don &apos;t get a beautiful vote to my exame .
And they have to do it . I &apos;m really important questions .
Now , the work : We &apos;re lucky , like Carl underground , because technology allows us to work every day , every day , from every day , from Hotel Randolph .
I &apos;m going to go to , there &apos;s a angler , and I won &apos;t say anybody , where , WiFi works .
I don &apos;t have to use it .
What does , this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work ? It &apos;s that we have to continuously deciding , and it &apos;s going to be able to work or not .
We can go to the hot hot , with the cell phone in a touch , Blackberry , Blackberry in the other , and the niebook , on the ginocia .
And even though they &apos;re all spended , every minute that we see our son , we also see the son , we also asking , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; I have to answered to this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have I answered to this email ? I have to email this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , that makes the experience of your child &apos;s experience of your son &apos;s own childhood that would be in other conditions .
So , what we &apos;re looking at , small things , small things and large , and life is a living , life is a choices of choices .
Once the world was this : Over , there were some possibilities , but it wasn &apos;t all that was a choice .
The world today looks like this : The dilemma is , &quot; Is a good thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Shot .
So , positive lensing lots of negative ones .
All this choice is about two effects that are two negative effects on people .
The first one , paradoxymous , is that produced , instead of liberation .
And many of the options that choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I offer an example , significant , an example : a study conducted study .
A colleagues had access to the Vanheat , the gigantic funding , with about a million funding , with about a million climents in 2,000 companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of adesion , the percentage of adhesion .
With 50 funds of offering , there &apos;s 10 percent in less adesions of adesions , why ?
Because with 50 funds between which choose , it &apos;s diotherwise to decide , and the choice is remanded to the indomanances .
And domorange , and again tomorrow , domances , domanish , and of course domanances , of course , domances , and of course tomorrow , domorders , domorant , domanisonto domaniss , and of course domananising , domanisoning , domanissue , domorderly domaniss , domanis
You know that it doesn &apos;t just mean that these workers are going to be easy for dogs because they will not have enough money , it also means that decision is so hostica that the decision is so hostica that they also loss the complext dator .
They &apos;re not in the way , they &apos;re going to be out to five dollars a year from the work , which would be willing to versarsarsary them .
So , the paralysis a consequence of having too much .
And I think that &apos;s going to make the world .
&quot; And finally , for the eternity : ketchup , you know , feel like , or maybe it ? &quot;
You would like to make the right decision , if it &apos;s for eeternity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and nepure the wrong conditioning .
So , this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can avoid paralysis , and we &apos;re less satisfying on the result of how we would be with less options that choose .
And that &apos;s a different reasons .
One of these is that with many condents that you choose , and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could do a different choice that would be better . And what happened is that the alternatives that alternative imagined us that alternative imagined us , and the replacement replaction deplacation of the choice , and the replant replacation of the decision , and the replaced by the decision , and the decision ,
even when it was a good decision .
The choices are , the more easy to displacing anywhere who detail is insodently the choice .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has cleared very pressive to the value that we do the depends on what we do is that we confrontier .
And in the rest , when there are many options , it &apos;s easy to representing the equal feature that you can be less satisfying and less satisfying less of the option that is choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m just like that I &apos;m not in New York .
But that &apos;s what you would probably think .
There &apos;s this copy to Hamptons .
A place of luxury .
It &apos;s unflexide . Otytim . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not nothing . But what he thought is , &quot; Well , malediition , it &apos;s Agost . &quot;
&quot; All my neighbors are away . &quot;
&quot; I could talk about home . &quot;
And it spots two weeks that &apos;s losing on the idea that &apos;s losing -- every day -- the chance of talking where it wants .
The cost-opportunity is declining for what we have , even when the choice was eccellent .
And the more of the options that we have to consider , the more the feature that attractive feature is going to go back to the contains as cos-opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This jet is a lot of things .
It &apos;s about the time , and perhaps about living slowly .
But the most important point is that whatever you chose , you know , you &apos;re not going to do other .
The things we don &apos;t choose have a lot of attractional attractive that can make less attractive equal to be what we do .
Third point : spiral growing up .
I tried it on my skin , I was buying a new jeans .
I remember almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were one kind of a kind of besides , they were switched , they were scomfortable , they were scomfortable , just after they took a lot of times , they were starting to go well .
So I went to buy a couple of it , when the old old ones were going , and I said , &quot; I need a couple jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Who wants to me to say , &quot; Do you have a fit , relaxy ? &quot;
Who wants to do it or bottons ? &quot; Stonewashed ? &quot;
&quot; Who wants to stream ? &quot;
&quot; Sow the basic closes or street ? &quot;
I was ballowing , and after a while I was able to say , &quot; I want the guy that was the guy , &quot; I want to do the guy , &quot; I had no idea what it was , so for a hour , I had been walking , and then I was going to be out of the walking , I play with the best ,
It was the huge . I had all that choice I had the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice is that with all my expectations were altired , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was tiny minime . I wouldn &apos;t expect anything when there was just a kind of thing when there was just a kind of thing , but when I saw 100 different , step , at least a kind of must be perfect .
What I was buying was good , but not perfect .
After I talked about that choose to what I was trying to do I was trying to do in the expectations .
The addition of options in the life of people don &apos;t make the expectations that these have respect to the eccellence of the options that are .
And that will product less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the marketing world if I realized .
Because if they know , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more like this .
&quot; It was better when you were worse when you were worse , &quot; The reason that you were better when you were worse , when you were worse , you know , you could meet the piece of the piaceering surprising .
Everyday , in the world that we live -- opulm-industrialized citizens with the perfection of perfection -- the most things are in the height of the expectations .
You never surprised because your expectations , my expectations , you &apos;re injusted .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Basse expectations , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , &quot;
I mean , little autobiographic moment -- which I &apos;m actually moving and my wife is really study .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t have to be able .
But it &apos;s not always good .
Finally , a consequence of jeans scomfortable when there &apos;s only that you &apos;re just when you &apos;re not saying , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot; And the answer is clear .
The world is the responsible . What would I do you do you do it ?
When there are hundreds of types , and you buy a insodently , and you ask , and you ask , you ask , it &apos;s as clean , it &apos;s as cleaning you .
You &apos;d could do better .
With hundreds of variety , there are no scushing .
So when people are decisions , even though the result is valid , you feel feel unfully , they feel like it .
For the last depression is explooss in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor , not the only one , but important -- of this depression is that people have experiences of depression is that people have experiences of the standard because standard are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that the holds are them .
So the final result is that we &apos;re better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the officer , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely false . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than it is better than it &apos;s not a lot of it , but it wouldn &apos;t be better than a little bit .
There &apos;s a critical value ,
But I &apos;m pretty sure we &apos;ve been overeignore the level that choices better our life .
Now , from the political point -- I &apos;ve almost finished -- from the political point of view , the nocle is .
What it allows all this choice in the industrial society is the material wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know about it , where the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too much poca .
So the factory that I &apos;m talking about is a malbe exclusive of modern , the Western society .
And what it does to do is to be involved with this : Steve Levitt , he talked yesterday as well and saddress for library , whether it &apos;s useless . It &apos;s a money .
I mean these choices , complicated and dispendent , it &apos;s not that they are just useless .
I &apos;m going to be a deletery .
They &apos;re doing it worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows a lot of choice was reversing in those where people have too few possibilities , it wouldn &apos;t be better , they would be better , not just their life to improve but our own .
This is what economists call a paretian improvement .
A lot of income redistribution is good at all -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in excess that goes back us .
To conclude , you can become everything you want to be what you want to be --
You , people of course , think , &quot; What does that weight ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious you can &apos;t make anything in a glass . &quot;
&quot; A castrated , a limited view of the world -- &quot;
and I interpret it , and I interpret it .
But then , I thought , I realized that that fish the weight .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you eat in frant , so that , &quot; everything you can &apos;t get freedom . &quot;
If you can get the mouth in a way that all you can declined the satisfaction .
You &apos;re going to get the paralysis , and you reduck the well-being .
All they need a sphere .
This is almost too strictly too strictly , perhaps even for the fish , and it &apos;s certainly for us .
But the hasn &apos;t some symbolic symbolic and , I &apos;m afraid for the roughly .
Thank you very much .
