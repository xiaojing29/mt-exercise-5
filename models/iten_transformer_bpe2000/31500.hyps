Last year I showed these slidemonstrate to show that the cotta calculations that the arctic glacial glasses , which almost three million years had the U.S. continental continental , and it &apos;s restripped 40 percent .
But this is a lot of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice of ice .
The artic calculation is , in a sense , the pulser &apos;s cleaning the global climate .
You expands in the winter and the summer .
The next slide is going to be a record of carled on the last 25 years .
The ice lennia is red in red .
As you see , you know , they expand up to the blue .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter , which is the summer of summer .
You can see that the ice cosidly , of five years or , it &apos;s like the blood , which is like the blood , which is the blood of the body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been so .
This is a problem because the interested in the ground of the glacier around the ocean arctic amount of the arctic quantities that , and they are transformed in the middle of the microbes .
It &apos;s a totality of the atmospheric atmospheric inch , that amount could rading , super-hythellow , supered this point of not return .
In some laghi short laghi in Alaska , the methane is already reholding from the water .
The Katey Walter of the University of Alaska , and I was a team that watch a team layer .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You &apos;re good . The question is if we &apos;re going to be .
One reason is that this termal exchange the Greenland from the north .
This is a glacial figures .
The laptop had never reached livels like .
This is the Kangerlush &apos;s Kangerlush in the South of Greenland .
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea level of the ice of the ice of the ice , here is where it reaches the sea sea .
These corrents are increasing quickly .
An the other hand of the planet : Antararctica of the planet .
The month scientists have diclosed that the ice of the ice is in negative , and that the Antarctica , and that the Antarctica , which path on some subtle islands , which is particularly rapid in the shelter .
Equival Sive six feet of the watching across , like Greenland .
Sull Himalaya , the third largest block , you see new laghi , that a few years ago , that a few years ago ,
40 percent of the world &apos;s population is half of the water power of the world &apos;s power from the short of the shape .
Sulle Ande : this ice ice is the source of the water power of this city .
The loud is increased .
But when you diminishes , the same happens to water .
In California , the Nevada is declined 40 percent .
The hyrics are in criged .
The predictions , as you read , are graves .
The growth care in the world leads to a remarkable increase .
The environmental disaster is increasing a rhythm outside and without precedented .
Four times more numerous in the last 30 years of the previous 75 .
This is an unsustainable thing .
If you look in the historical context if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of tons in the oceans every day .
And look at the time the area of the Pacific area , by Americals , and the American both parts of the Indian subcontinent , where there &apos;s a radical impact of the oxygen in the oceans .
Most of the global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent of it is the silly use of fossil fuel .
The oil is a problem , and the paper is even worse .
The United States are one of the two of the countries with the China .
And he was proposition to build a lot of other central central .
But we &apos;re seeing a change of direction .
These are the annulled in the last few years and some of the alternative alternative .
At every way , there &apos;s a political model in our country .
The pallows industries and oil are spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon , which is a symbone .
That image I remember something --
Natal Isslums , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion loss of paper .
You may have seen it on the news .
This is the second largest scories in America .
It happened around the Natal .
The publishment of one of the carbon industries .
Video : the carbon is a kind of leaning and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it &apos;s going to grow our economy .
My the carbon is more and more cleaning .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and work master and work master .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The largest society on the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Diset : Don Blankenship : I &apos;m going to be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosis , Harry Reid -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clim &apos;s launched two campaign .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Ator : At COALergy , we see the climate change as a serious serious as a serious serious as a serious tiny minutes .
So , that priority is to invest a great amount of money in a public effort to make public and confused the truth .
In fact , the carbon isn &apos;t hundred .
We think it &apos;s clean -- it also has a good profumum .
So , not preoctor of climate change .
Let me do .
Video : Ator : Carbone -- you &apos;ve heard a lot of you &apos;ve heard a lot of them .
So let &apos;s take a glasses in a struggle to address for how the clean .
Straditional machines are a little bit , but this is the sound of the cleaning technology of cleaning .
The coal coal consumption is between the climbs of the global warming , but the remarkable technology that you see changes everything .
You look at a look at the hate hate technology of the cleaning clean .
Al Gore : Inally , the positive alternative alternative and the economic security &apos;s security .
Video : My America is in cribes ; the national security , the national security crisis .
The filter that all the way , our dependence from fossil fuel , like the sils and the oil carbon and oil .
Now , there &apos;s a new audace solution for it .
Really America : 100 percent of the power of 10 years .
A plan to put America to work , make us safety , and help to help the global warming .
Finally , a solution that &apos;s solution to solve our problems .
Repower power . You &apos;re going to be more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It &apos;s about reducing energy to America .
One of the fastest ways to get to dependence from the combustible that killed our planet .
Comparish : The future is here . I feel , just a new energy network .
She knows two : Noves investments for places of work in retributed .
I feel : I feel like , it &apos;s a realistic .
Al Gore : A old proverbirth , they say , &quot; If you want to go fast , you go from the sung .
If you want to go back , you go together . &quot;
We need to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED I did a full LHC .
And I promise to return you about how the machine works .
So here I fix . And for those that the other time , there were no , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever ever attempty .
His joined to required the conditions that were present less than a billion-second of the universe -- at 600 million times a second .
All this is simply environment .
This is the machine underlying .
We picture these mini-Big Bang inside in the relevators .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- it &apos;s 44 feet .
This is a spectacular image of ATLAS in build-so you can see the proportions .
10 secember of the last time . We have access the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was cause of immense facts in the control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first particles that had the LHC , and it was going to collision , and it &apos;s a collision , with a part of the LHC , and it &apos;s spread in the resion .
In other words , when we see that image the 10 sector , we realized that the machine worked , which is a big vitter .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to make us exultate that , when somebody went to Google and he saw that the beginning was this .
That means we had a cultural impact on the scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , and it had to these files here -- these dored dored .
These files are bringing 13,000 ampits when the machine works at the most power of power .
Now , the technical technical of you are going to look at the files and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . &quot;
And they can do that because when they &apos;re very cold on the degree cosmile of superconductines .
So at least 271 degrees , at a inferior of the space between the stars , these files can bring that run .
In one of the younger of the novemisle in LHC , there was a fabrication .
So the films writing , and the 13,000 ampitches , and 13,000 ampitches , they met a whole electric resistence .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressioning if you think that these magnets fishing more 20 tons , and that are moved of about 30 feet .
They are damaged about 50 magneties .
We had to take them , what we did .
We &apos;ve been returned and traveled .
Now they &apos;re going back to all the subject .
By the end of the LHC is , you &apos;re going to be new integrate .
We &apos;ll happen it , and we expect data to get the right or to be able to be the jugment or to find what they are the morning is that they are the morning .
Now , of course , in a certain queties , these accidents readed the dibate of science and engineering in frontier . It &apos;s easy to be .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , it &apos;s the fact that we go beyond the boundation of things like LHC .
I &apos;d like to end with the words of an Inglese scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , I imagine , in the difesa , in the difesa , the bledge of his house ppill was Michael Faraday , he said , &quot; No is so dangerous for the progress of the human mind that the ideas of science that ideas of science is that the ideas of the human tric trials that are not conquered to us .
Thank you .
I want to start wondering when , from children , as children , playing caved cyaved car .
As you reach them and graphs and graphs , take them and get them , learning , and they learned , and they learned , and they &apos;re able to think and solve problems .
The reasoning reasoning is deeply connected to be a lot of the world around us .
So , from the information of our interaction with the usual objects , together my consult , together at my counter-Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to ask me , &quot; And if we use a computer , I started to ask me , &quot; And if we use a computer , you know , I started to have the only wider of the mouse , we could defly physically die on a desktop ,
and systemate our ployment ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big computer interactive computer like a biscoop .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big computer interactive computer like a biscoop .
You can move them with the hand , they can see , &quot; you can see , &quot; you know , &quot; you can feel their movement and a radio .
But most of them , they &apos;re physical , as the morning , you can move simply .
Siftable is an example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physical , knowledge of the other , and as they get more physical , and they become more physical , of the other people , how we can explore new things , we can explore new things , we can explore new the different stils of interaction .
I &apos;m going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configure to show , if you just incline in a direction , the video that it will rotate this , if you closed the other hand back .
These are interactive of other people .
If I go up , you know , they &apos;re interested in .
If they come circums , they can take a little bit .
If they come circums , they can take a little bit .
They &apos;re going to have their movement and inclination .
We realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power to use common data , for example , &quot; to &quot; a versity , &quot; a color like a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable , as a center of the vernice and I can use them to train color in the central color in the central , where they missing .
and I can use them to be able to be the color in the central , where they missing .
And we can be too , we can put a little place .
They also have a beautiful possibilities of learning , like languages , mathematics and logic games where people can try the results to try and see the results of the results .
I &apos;m now --
This is a Fibonacci that I do with a equations of equations .
Here we have a word of word that is in the middle and Boggle .
Procely , at every turn on the Sift-stand-up , Pratically , at every Siftable , to every turn on every Siftable on , and while cers of composed to words , and cers , and cers controlling words , and while he was controlling it .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new letters of letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
And here &apos;s the children came up to the Media Lab , I did that they try and turned a video .
They are very placioughly .
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of education .
You just have to say , &quot; Compons of words , and they know exactly what to do to do .
Here &apos;s some other people who try it .
This is our younger young , there &apos;s on the right .
It actually wanted to implane them .
They were only morning .
Now , this is an application of an interactive cardboard .
We wanted to build a tool for learning languages . He &apos;s Felix .
It can put up new characters in the scene , solving the Siftable .
It can put up new characters in the scene , solving the Siftable .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : The sun is surprised .
David Merrill : Now he brought a tractor in the scene .
Video : The arange treator .
Books ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes !
So , I school the Siftable and put them close to the characters --
Video : Bau !
and inventing their story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a story with open-open-up , and it can decide him as you get .
DM : It &apos;s a story with open-open-up , and it can decide him as you get .
Volice : Get .
DM : The last example that I have the time to show you is a tool , to try to figure and exected music .
it &apos;s a tool , realized by recently , to sampling and exeded music .
Siftable is going to sound like the basic , base and the bacteria .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose what we use .
You can also put these sounds in a sequence to compose sequence to your placement .
And you just just touch it by touching a &quot; sound &quot; and a sequence . &quot;
These are actually you can control from the alive , like the reverse and the filter .
The acks on a particular sound and then clines to get it .
And then there are the general effects as time and volume , which are going to be applied to the whole sequence .
Let &apos;s look at how .
Video : We &apos;re going to start putting a base in two Siftable . &quot; sequence , we &apos;re doing it in a series , we extend it to be able .
Now I put a basis line .
Video : Now I add some percussions --
Video : And now I &apos;m going to put the bacteria , so I can control the bacteria , so I can control the effect of the battery .
DM : DM : I can see the whole sequence of the whole sequence by one side or the other .
Video : And now I &apos;m going to add the filter to the lower expression .
Video : DM : I can remember the sequence . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to plan it before , but I can suddenly , make it longer or more cording .
And now , finally , I can be smoking the whole sequence by the Siftable the volume of the Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is build new man machine and more and more like , what our brain is going to work and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this pattern , and also some possibilities that we try to take out of the lab .
The concept that I want to transmit is that it &apos;s coming up with this new generation of designed designed to interact with digital media , that will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the hour of you .
I &apos;m a writer .
I think books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the fascrows of my life .
And I don &apos;t look like that it can change .
But , I said , something about this , something that happened in my life and my career , and in my career , which bring me to realibrate the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called Manway , &quot; which , or which , different from my precedented books , for some reason that books , for some reason that the world and besseller , for some reason , for some reason .
And the result is that everywhere &apos;s going to be , people treating me as if I were condanced .
Davy that -- condanced , condamage .
They &apos;re all worried and everybody &apos;s worried and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t fear to do you know , &quot; You don &apos;t you know ?
You don &apos;t fear to keep all life , you know , you can &apos;t be able to create a book that can important ? &quot;
What can you care to somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s rassure , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a cent .
I would meet the same reaction by the same reaction .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you know , &quot; I don &apos;t get successful ?
You don &apos;t fear that the refulation of the refying refits ?
You don &apos;t feel that to do this for all life without any life that nothing came out and die on a snice of every infrants with the mouth of every infrants with the bouth of love to love care of full ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I fear about all those things .
I had always been afraid .
And I have a lot of other things that people could not involved .
As the algae and other things .
But , as much about it , as it turns out what I thought and asked me is because ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logical that everybody has to expect by a work that you feel like to do .
But what &apos;s about this particular in the creative creative to make us nervous about the health mental health mental health mental health ?
As my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don &apos;t remember of once it in his 40 years of activity that he was asked if you fear to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be ?
There was never -- that block of the John engineer , how it goes ?
It didn &apos;t work that , you know ?
Onestly , chemical engineers as a group have not , in the centuries , in the centuries , they glasses , depressive manized manized manized manized manized .
We have enough , we have enough this reputation , and not only writers , but creative of every gender , we have this reputation of being enormously instable mentally .
And it &apos;s not going to look at the trists of the dead dead of the dead of the magnific dead , they died young people died young people , they died young people .
And the ones that don &apos;t have suicidated to be really disappears to be really disappears .
Norman Mailer , before he died in the last interview , in the last interview , he said , &quot; Oh , my book has killed a little bit more . &quot; A extraordinary affirmation about their life .
But we don &apos;t bad at the son , when we feel these things so long that somehow we &apos;ve been interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and the suffering and the art , it will always conduce the art , it will always conduce the end .
And the question I want to take all over here today is : are you agree with this idea ?
And that &apos;s good -- because also look at it , because even looks at all the time , it &apos;s not good for anything that &apos;s good for anything .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous and I don &apos;t want to see it perpetuate it in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to be encouraging our big creative .
And I know that , in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start figting to that feel figured out the circle of supposed , and I &apos;m in my career .
Oval -- I look , I &apos;m pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I have about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything write about what I &apos;m going to write it up from the world as the work that he came up with the world that I &apos;m going to be successful that I &apos;m going to be a very likely .
I &apos;m going to be hundred , because we &apos;re all the friends here -- it &apos;s probably my greater is to my hundred .
Oh , Gesus , which think .
You know this is the kind of thinking that &apos;s the kind of thinking that brings a person begins to bend up in the morning , and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would keep doing this work that we do this work that we do .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it seems to me , after a lot of reflecting , that the way to write is to create a psychological costruck , OK ?
I &apos;m going to find a distance of security between me , and I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxy about what reaction is going to get it . And as I was looking for the last year , and I was looking for the last year , trying to find other societies to see if they could have some of the best ideas to see if they could have some better ideas and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more sane .
about how to help people to make the creative inerent the emotional inrisks of creativity .
And that research has brought me to the Grex and ancient Rome .
I &apos;m guitems because he gets in the circle and then back .
In the ancient Greheis and the Rome -- people didn &apos;t look at the creativity from men , OK ?
And they thought the creativity was this beautiful dience and that came up and people came up and men someone who was a few distant and unknown , for reasons and unknown , and unknown .
The Greeks called these the Greeks of the creativity of the creativity .
Socrate , wish , it was created to have a demand that was a degree of wisdom .
The Romans were the same idea , but they called the kind of spirit without a genius .
which is great , because Romans didn &apos;t really think a genius was a particularly smart .
And they would have this kind of genius was this kind of divine that was created literally in the walls of a study of an artist , a little bit like Dobby , and that was like Dobby , and that came up to hidden the work of the artist and model that work in the work of that work .
Here &apos;s what &apos;s worth of -- that is the distance of which I talk -- that psychological costruth that you have to be in your work .
And they all knew that it was so that it was , right ?
So the anticislety were protected by certain things , like the too much narcism , no ?
If your work was exceptional , you could not take the all the market , everybody knew that you had been helped by this genioral genicorporal .
If your work , you know , it wasn &apos;t all the full , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be an incapable .
And so people han concept in the West creativity in the West for a long time .
And then the Rinasent came and everything changed , and all changed , and we put this great idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe and no longer and no longer space to the creatures and no longer space to the creatures that write details that write detail .
This was the principle of the rational humanity and people began to think that creativity was completely from the idividge .
And for the first time in the history , you started to refer this or the artist as a rather than a person with genius .
And I have to say , I think it was a big herror .
I think that allowing someone , a simple person to believe that a recipent like a recipent , the essence and the kind of all the digiternal , creative , unknowledge is a lot of holding to the psych that human holds .
It &apos;s like to ask someone to inrow the sun .
Deape and it completely drawings and creates all these expectations on performance .
And I think it was this pression to destroy the artists in the past 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it &apos;s , and now it &apos;s it , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
You know , you know , you know , a more oldest than the relationship between human relationship between the relationship between human relationship between the relationship between human relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between the relationship between human relationshi
Or perhaps not .
Maybe we can &apos;t sing 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience that solled to literally , you know , you know , you know , you do that , you do that , you do that , you do that , you know , they &apos;re going to happen or they follow the projects of their projects .
And I &apos;m probably not going to talk to you all about this .
But the question I would like to ask is -- why not ?
Why don &apos;t you think that way ?
Because it &apos;s more sense of everything that I &apos;ve ever heard to explain the explanting exhaspering the exhaspering of creative process .
One process that , as anyone who ever ever tried to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- you know , you don &apos;t know rationally .
And in fact , it can sometimes seem completely paranormal .
I did this meet recently with the extraordinary poeties Ruth Stone , who now 90 years old , but it was a poetic for all life and said that during his childhood in Virginia , working out in the Virgyinia , and feel it , and feel it , in the wells , and he was , in the landscape , and he fellow it , in the landscape , and he was going to be a poem .
He said that it was like a train of air .
And he came up to her landscape from the landscape .
And he was going to be , because he was tremendous to his feet .
She knew to have one thing to do with that point and it was , words , &quot; running like a math . &quot;
And so it was going to home and they were walking up from this poem , and it wouldn &apos;t have to take a piece of card and a faster , and a faster , and it &apos;s faster , and running it on the page .
Sometimes he couldn &apos;t be faster , so correct and correct realized , and the running and the poem home and the poem , and she loss the lost , and he would keep rolling through the landscape , and he would keep rolling through the landscape , as he was going to rolling through the landle , and he would keep rolling up the home and the poem , and he could not be faster to be faster , and he would continued to roll the lost
Then there were some times -- this piece I &apos;m going to go -- there were the moments that they were almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and it was looking for the card and the poem through , and he was going through , and he was a writing , and he said , and then he said , that it was like you walking up , and he was going to go and the reach .
He wouldn &apos;t cut the poem from the tail and he repage it in his body and he turned on the page .
And in these cases , the poem is the perfect page and intatta , but at the contrary , from the last word at the first .
So when I felt it -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly the same thing .
I &apos;m not a creative process -- I &apos;m not a conducture .
I &apos;m a moving , and my way to work is ; it &apos;s my way to work is , and you know , and work and work and go and work and go and go and go and go and go out .
But I even , in my daggines , I &apos;ve been striscilent against that thing , sometimes .
And I imagine that a lot of you .
You know , even if the work and ideas came up with a certain source , I could not be honestly known .
And what is this ?
And how can we relate it to do it in a way we don &apos;t make the head , but rather , rather , that make us healthy ?
And as much as I think , the best example of the contemporary that I have is the musicia Tom Waits , which I have been several years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life was the nation of the artist &apos;s artist , and we were the nation of the artist , and we were trying to control , to draw these species of totally interested in the entire totally interested .
But then he got up , and he was driving , and one day as he was driving on a Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
He was going to fast and all of a sent tract , this little sent tract on the wind of melody , which comes into its head like inspiration , and the pursuit , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the desidency , and the desidency , but not knowing how to take it .
It doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a record .
So , it starts to feel this species of old old old old old , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to reach , and I &apos;m going to reach .
I &apos;m not good , and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to the panic , he stopped .
And it was a whole process and he did something completely new .
And he just watching the sky and said , &quot; Scause , I &apos;m not seeing that ? &quot;
&quot; You know , I can you write a song now ?
If you really want to exist , you know , you get to a care of you .
You go to important something else today .
You know , Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his process worked changed after this .
Not the work , the work was still hoscure as always .
But the process , and the anxy that was left to the genius , the genius that was left out of him , the genius that was caused nothing else and liberated to the back back from the back , and they came from , realized that didn &apos;t have to be an interiorized and realized that it didn &apos;t have to be an interiorized and mented it .
but I was going to be this peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this external thing that was not Tom .
So how I felt that story , I was working on changing a little bit of the way I was working and saved once .
This idea , this idea , he saved when I was writing , &quot; Manway , and fall in one of those cave of the dispertion that we &apos;re all working on something and we &apos;re all working on something and we &apos;re not going to be disaster , that what &apos;s going to be the worst book or never written .
Not just book , just the worst book .
And I started thinking about themselves to throw this project .
But then I remember about the air and I tried to the air and I tried to get us .
So I went up my face in the manoscrits and I would say , my comments to a corner of the room .
And I said , &quot; You know , &quot; Seople , you &apos;re both , you know that if this isn &apos;t going to be brilliant , not be bright ?
Because as I &apos;m going to put everything I &apos;m going to put everything I have , not more than that .
So if you want to be better , you have to show you and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know , you know what , I don &apos;t do anything .
I &apos;m going to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to do for my hours , I &apos;m presented to do my part , because it &apos;s so , OK -- at the end of the North Africa &apos;s deserts of North Africa , the North &apos;s wounds of the watch of the wondering of the clear of the sacross to the hours and hours to the alba .
And they were always magnific , because the balleres were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every one of the one of these artists , and one of these artists had been actually transfitting .
And I know what I talk about , because I know you &apos;ve all been on a certain point , a performance that &apos;s a performance .
It was like the time , and it was walking up , and the ballerin the landments , and it wasn &apos;t doing anything different from the sun , like 1,000 nies before , as the 1,000 nies before , you all .
And suddenly , I don &apos;t just like a human .
But it happened from the deduck and under the divince of divinity .
And when this happened , the times , the people knew what was , they called it with her name .
They were landering the hands and started to dogogs , &quot; Allah , God , Allah , God , God , &quot; God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curiosa hurious horic -- when the Ments invasize of the Spain , they took this habitude with them and pronounced in the centuries of &quot; Allah , &quot; at &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; as you can feel in the flamenk .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , workers , broken , you know , good , you know , a God score -- a God score .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes the day after , the ballery at the same time , when you wake up and down that are the 11 in Martedesday and the score of God , and I score it is not .
It &apos;s simply a mortal with a lot of bad ginocky , and perhaps it will never be able to get to the cleaning .
And perhaps no one of God while I play , and what &apos;s so it has to do with his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most sweetest reconciliations to make a creative life .
But perhaps not to be so angled to be so angled , if you can &apos;t believe , ancutt , which extraordinary expects of your own .
But it just maintained you data in the data that you have data in a source of this source of your life that you have to go to something else when you &apos;ve got to go to something else when you &apos;ve got .
And , you know , if we think that everything changes .
And so I started thinking , and it &apos;s certainly like it , I thought about it for different months in the work that I &apos;m going to take a book that I &apos;m going to take the house , the dangerous , spavening , so that I was followed , so that I was going to be followed .
And what I have to keep me to tell me when I feel electrized by this is , not going to be fear .
You don &apos;t get to the one . It &apos;s just your work .
And that &apos;s going to be a lot of the way , whatever you can .
If your work is ball work is ball , bought .
If the divine , absorbed genius decide to leave some kind of wonderful , for a moment through your effort , then you know , &quot; Ole ! &quot;
You &apos;re going to do the same dance .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot; deep the same . &quot;
I think we have to teach it .
&quot; You know , &quot; des the same , even for the human had , and test love and test taps to be a whole thing .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
You know , I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can meaning and the discovery of new gene set of genes .
Now we &apos;re beginning a new path . We started digitalize biology and now to go from that digital code we &apos;re going to digital code , designing and synthesizing .
We always tried to bring big questions .
&quot; What &apos;s life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists , I think they &apos;ve been trying to figure out of livels .
We tried different approaches , reducting to minimes .
We &apos;re digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was to be treated to go from the analogical world &apos;s digital world &apos;s digital .
Now , we can regenerate life from this digital universe , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome that they can self-replaces in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome for creating a little bit more smaller .
We are able to eliminate a hundred genes of the about 500 that are here .
But when we look at its metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our .
I think I &apos;m going to think that is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this can bring to a living cell .
So we decided that the only way that the only way to synthesize this chromosome of these things of things .
And so we started the adventure of the adventure of the &quot; Pan : What do we synthesize ? &quot;
Can chemistry to make these big molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create before ?
And in case , we can make a romosome crowd chromosome ?
A chromosome is simply a chemical material .
The speed that we are able to digitalize life is growing up to exponential .
Our capacity to write the genetic code , rather program rather than it , but it &apos;s improving .
And our most recent retaken the latest on a exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process process has been required , beginning with a biothic review before we began to begin with a first experiments .
But we found that DNA is very difficult .
There are thousands of thousands of machines in the world that make little DNA , of 30 to 50 letters of 30 to 50 letters and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the most errors are along .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments and correcting the errors .
And this was our first attempty , to start to talk about the digital information of the Phi &apos;s genome of the Phi &apos;s genome of the 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills .
We designed the fragments , actually the recorrection of the errors and get a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material chemical material and we &apos;ve been inserted in the bacteria , the bacteria began to read this genetic code and producing the viral particles .
The viral particles are then , you &apos;re left from cells , and they &apos;ve destroyed the Evi .
I &apos;ve been talking about with members of the oil industry that they have certainly understood this model .
They remains more than you .
We think this is a situation that software is a situation that software can actually build the biological hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the largest things .
We wanted to build the whole battery of the bacteria .
They are more than 580 mile of genetic code .
So we thought we could build it in the size of the viruses , so we could change the casses of the viruses that are the components of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard accurateties was a mile of every 10 mile base .
We found out , we resequency , 30 errors . If we had been used that original sequence we would never be able to do that work .
One part of the process is to design size signs along 50 letters that they &apos;re going to be a little bit of 50 letters to build smaller subments of the smaller segment that work together .
We &apos;ll see the only one here .
You probably have read that we look at the flip of the grains .
So , think that &apos;s a genetic code based on four letters : A , Gs and T.
Three of those letters together , they code about 20 amminacids , and there &apos;s a specific reduction of letters for every amminacid .
So we can use genetic code to write word , frassilly , sentences .
What we did in the beginning was self-up .
Some of the people were deluses that wasn &apos;t poem .
We designed these segments to be able to just join with enzyes .
There are enzymes that they reputting them and put them up .
And we started to assemble parts , beginning with the segments of five to seven mile , and they only only put them in a sit , and they would be 2,000 letters to get to 7,000 letters to get to 7,000 letters .
We have these days , we have these segments in abundance so we can sequency them to create a very robust , and we &apos;re trying to create a very robust -- you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems to be a basket playments .
When we get to these very long segments , more than 100 middle , they &apos;re not going to be directly in E.
You get to the limit of modern biology , molecular biology .
So we &apos;ve been considered other mechanisms .
We knew of a mechanism called homology , that in biology , which in biology is going to reply the DNA to be able to take the segments .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism called Deinococcus radiodurans , it can make three million radiation .
You can see in the slums as his chromosome as his chromosome is destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s reassembled as before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms , you can completely .
They can live under empty .
They &apos;re absolutely sure that life in space , and you &apos;re going to find new environments of water .
Actually , NASA showed that this happens .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built these processes , simply using the lievening of the segments to put .
The lievening them automatically .
This image was not taken with a electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a task so big that we can see it with a microscope .
These are photographs that cover a second of about six seconds .
This is the audience that we did a little bit of time .
They are more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the biggest molecule of a definitely , it &apos;s never created by man .
It &apos;s a fishing molecular sprint .
If we prove it with a career 10 without spaces , they would like 142 pages to transmitting this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ?
Obviously , you know , you &apos;re a virus is a little kids .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when they use battered .
It &apos;s simplest when it &apos;s cells like this : You can just extreme the nucleus and inserate it , you can just extract the nucleo and put another , which is basically the process of cloning .
In the bacteria , the archaea is integrated inside the cell , but we &apos;ve recently showed that we &apos;re able to do a complete traph of a cell that we &apos;re able to do a complete traph of a cell that one other and activate it .
We had a partment chromosome of microbial species .
The two are different as the men from the topes .
We &apos;ve added some gene in a way that we could decide what choose for this chromosome .
The stand-up with the encies that it &apos;s a way to kill all proteins .
And when we put it in the cells was study -- and you &apos;ll oppreciate our graph -- and you &apos;ll open our graph was going to cell in the cell .
And we were beginning to be beyond , but we had to try to spush us more there .
This is one of the major mechanisms .
We found that many species have added a second or a third or third chromosome somewhere , adding in a second thousands of new , and that species .
So who thinks at evolution as one gene at the time that modifies didn &apos;t understand a lot of biology .
They are a scientist of the restriction enzymes that addition digerism that they digered DNA .
The chromosome that it was in the cell .
The cellula--chromosome that we have insert .
You &apos;ve been expressed , and he recognized the other croma as an extraneous material , and we got it , and we got it up with only cell the cell and the new cell .
it became blue because of the genes that we &apos;ve been inserted .
And in a short of time , all the characteristics of a species have gone up in a new species , and it turned around a new software that we &apos;ve been inserted in the cells .
All proteins are changed , the membranes are changed , and when we read the genetic code that is exactly what we &apos;ve transfer you .
Now , this could look like genetic altering , but altering the software DNA we can change things in a manipulation .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that here is not talking about the genesis that there is three million years old and a half years of evolution , and I &apos;ve already said that we &apos;re going to create a new version of the Camboat that .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s quite obvious when we think about our need .
We &apos;re going to spend six billions and a half billions of people in the next 40 years .
Right to give you an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each other existing in 1946 , there will be four .
We &apos;re going to be trouble to find food , fresh water and clean , medicinal medicinal and a half billions of people .
It &apos;s going to be more duck for nine billions .
We use more than five billions of carbon , more than 30 billions of oil .
That means millions of barrassment .
When we try to find biological processes , or whatever process to replaced them , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to have the whole emission of the CO2 emission of these materials that ends up in the atmosphere .
Al day , because of the scientific discovery all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the designed for the future .
The electronic industry is only a dozen about a dozen of about components , and think about how many different things are come .
Our limitations are principlally from biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , because of these synthesids of synthesization , in fact , we can create what we call the combinatory genomics .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can make a big robot that can make a million of chromosomes a day .
Think of these 20 million genes or to try and get to optimize the processes to make the processure to make a tiny or drugs , new vaccines , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology , and we can change more biology that in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemistry or carbon , chemistry or carbon , it production , and it production .
This is a few software program of some software program that we &apos;re working on to be able to sit and designing species to computers .
Well , we don &apos;t know , we don &apos;t know how they are .
We know exactly what they are genetic code .
Now we &apos;re focus on the carbon of the fourth generation .
You &apos;ve seen that you extract from the grain of the grain was a bad experiment .
We have carbons of second and third generation that are going to use enough to be taken to sugar on the higher or different kinds of butankage .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without more to increase the food and limitarian availability to be transforming CO2 , the first one , that we &apos;re working to design cells that they can reach this scale , and we think we can reach this scale , and we think we could reach this scale , and we think we could have the first carbon of the food generation of how much much of the food generation in about 18 months .
The sunlight combined with CO2 is a methodom -- but in our discoveries all over the world , we found different metodds .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It &apos;s going to be deep on the deep ocean , at the time of deeply at the time of the water .
It &apos;s going to put from CO2 using hydrogen as a source of energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can put the CO2 , which can easily be transported through your , converting that CO2 in carburst that CO2 in carburst , to drive this process .
So we think we could be able to increase to increase what the question of the base question , what &apos;s life is Noil , which is Noil , we have the goal modest , we have the goal modest industry to replacing the whole oil industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can you do it ?
It would be a main of the energy .
And also , we &apos;re working to use the same methods to create a vaccines .
You saw this year with influence , we &apos;re always back to a year and with a dollar when it &apos;s about find the right vaccine .
I think that it can change that we can change building vaccines in anticipulation .
That &apos;s how the future could start to be changing , the tree of evolution , accelerating the evolution of synthetic bacteria , archatheists , and the eucariot .
We &apos;re so much on the improve people .
Our purpose is to live very long enough to try to make it . Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the most of the fundamental work , some fundamental work , of the new technology that we &apos;ve taken to a nearly a year ago . This is Seadragon . This is Seadragon .
This is a environment that you can interact is at local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data .
So , we &apos;re seeing a lot of digital pictures of digital pictures with a kind of expensive zoo-amic pictures , dispone-, and I keep the images of how we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big big the data or the images .
Most of digital photographs , but this is for example , is a remarkable scan from the Biliotected by the Biliotected of the 300 megapiel .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that &apos;s the one thing that &apos;s the pixels of a system like this is the number of pull on your screen . It &apos;s also a very flexel .
This is a whole book , you know , not about data .
This is Deckens of Decens . Every column is a capital .
And to show you that it &apos;s about the text and not images , we can do something like this , to see that &apos;s really a real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little bit artificial to read a book to read a book .
You don &apos;t recommend it .
This is a more realistic example . This is a number of the Guardian .
Every big image is the beginning of a setion .
And it really gives you the pleasure of the landscape of a read or a journey of a journey or a daily journey , which is for nature a lot of medium .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the Guardian .
We made a high-resolures -- much higher than that you use in a publishment of the publishment -- and we &apos;ve been in a published -- and we &apos;ve been inserted with extra content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limitations of space on the screen .
We hope that this means to the pop-up and other non-up porcheries , and other syndrink , they wouldn &apos;t be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to sure that we have contributed to this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. . And these are all the way in the NASA .
So , we go to something else .
This is actually actually from the view of the web ; you can go to see it .
This is a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
A is Seadragging and the other is a very interesting computer research that Noah Seadragging , a student of the University of Washington , with the aid of Steve Seitz of the UW and Rick Seitz of Microsoft Research . It &apos;s a good collaboration . It &apos;s a good collaboration .
And it &apos;s from the web , the Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from a picture to the other and have this kind of experience to multiple solution .
But the space of images here has actually a meaning .
The sigorithms of the computer visualization of computers have recorded these imaging together , so that they correspond to the real places that -- all the close to the record Montes on the Montne Rockcious Rockcious Montne Rockcious Rockcious , and so that you see the elements of a slightly slightly piece of a slight-shels .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data set -- and this is a previous prototype of Photosynth prototype of Photosynth that we &apos;ve done to do the first time , the last time , the last time , the Sap , we &apos;re really necessarily watching what I think is really necessarily watching the environments that we &apos;ve got in in the website .
We had to worries about legal and so on .
This is a rebuild-up Cathreats of Nothers . Death . Bauckr . Bauckr , and you get images of the filicky , and you get images of the fields , and so on . Egnal one of these things represents a picture that &apos;s discovered a picture that &apos;s discovered .
So I &apos;m all images that I was all the way to Flickr and they were all connected to this way .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this very simplication .
You know , I would never have thought to end up in Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifying to this kind of account here .
I think you can see that &apos;s a lot of different types of focus , from those of the cellularial cell phone to the SLR , a number of non-meaning , emitting together in this environment .
And if I can try and try and look for those more strange .
Most are block , etc .
Somewhere a series of photographs -- there .
This is a Nothers of Nothers , this is a correctly .
We can go from the poster to the view of the physical physical .
The essential point is that we can do things with the social environment . This is taking data on a collective inter-hypoths , from the vision point of view -- and all those data together .
All those pictures become linked , the greater of the parts .
You have a ground model of the entire enterprince .
Think about this as a Stephen Lawler &apos;s work on the virtual Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as a lot of people use it , and the people use it .
Their pictures are marked with metad-insereous metad-insereous .
If you get to contrast all these things that we have all these names , and my photographs of Nothers , my picture of Nothers of all the data , and I can use as a point point of all the data , and I can use as a point of ingraveling , in that universe , using the universe , using the universe , using the universe , and having a social experience of the critical chooss-modity .
Of course , a consequence of all that are the virtual model of every interesting part of the Earth , and they collected not only from airplanes and pictures and satellitarians and images , but from the collective memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand that ? What your software is going to be going to be a certain point , in the next few years , all the photographs share of everybody in the world are going to be readed to be ready ?
BA : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is basically , it &apos;s going to find .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , you want , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the images .
What it becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of the sea of simple information that many of these images are going to be .
As when you do a research of images on the web , you get a sentence and the web on the web page of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the picture .
Now , what happens if that pictures all your pictures ?
So the amount of the simanti-interconnection and the amount of wealth that &apos;s really huge . It &apos;s a really huge effect .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really amazing . Compliments .
BA : You &apos;re very much .
One of the main pleasant pleasant , and one of the pursuit of the research power of the people who didn &apos;t forget the traditions , between who didn &apos;t forget the traditions , and the traditions in the wind , the patch in the wind , the gustands in foot , and the plants .
Basti thinking that Jaguar Jaguar traveling still the the Lattea , or that the Matuites are still meaning , or that in Himala , the budddged , or that in Himala , to remember the central important of the anthropology of the anthropology , and that the idea that the world we live in which we live not exist , but it &apos;s only a reality , it &apos;s just a model , but it &apos;s just a reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stirles did , good or a bad , a lot of generations ago .
And , of course , we all share the essential .
All we all project . We all procreating .
We are subjects in the beginning .
We have to death the inexorability of death , so it doesn &apos;t surprises if we go and ballie --
We all have a art .
What hit is the particular rate is the particular rate of cancer , the dance of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that they are the Penan forests of the Borneo , or the followed Haiti , or the Haiti , or the Sahara Kaisut , the Curander &apos;s &apos;s witching , or a cameleras in the Sahara .
He was my journey in the desert of a month ago , or a yak of yak in the valley of the Everest , on the Everest , the Mamolomola , the mother of the world .
All these people teach us that there are other ways of thinking , there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking ,
And , if you reflected a second , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
Inflag , the cultures of the world create a spiritual nature of the spiritual life and cultural life that the planet , and it &apos;s important for the planet as a biological story as a biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural girl as a nosphere and you can call the ethnosphere , the total subject of all the concepts , dreams , inspirations , inspirations , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , and intuitions , and you can see the alba .
The ethnosphere is the cool patric of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we can be in and what we can be in how species .
And because the biosphere was gravelly consumed as it was so much more quickly , and it was too much more quickly .
Nobody , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all the species is on the eyellow of the extinction of the extinct , or in the most apocalittic diversity -- and you don &apos;t have to have to be very much near to the optimistic diversity -- and you don &apos;t even have to have to be very much of the issue cultural diversity .
The whole thing is , of course , the loss loss .
When you &apos;re born , 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not only a vocabolary from a vocabolary or a series of rules .
One language is the bunch of human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle of every culture of every culture is the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a piece of the mind , a spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re here in Monterey , at least the half of the middle of the children .
They don &apos;t come to the children , which means , not to walk , unless you won &apos;t wonderful something , which are already .
What is more sad of the being the most sad of the wish , of being the last to talk to a language , of the lingua , of the wisdom or to anticipate the wisdom of the children ?
This is a handle of somewhere in the world , every two weeks .
And I know that someone will say , &quot; It &apos;s not that ?
The world would not be a better place if we all parlash the same language ? &quot; We all talk to all the same way . We &apos;re all talking .
We talk about .
You &apos;ll try to be a tract thing to say , not to talk about your language .
I &apos;d like to do you a journey through the ethnosphere --
a little journey in the ethnosphere for you a little journey of what we &apos;re losing .
Most of us forget that when I say , &quot; I really mean , &quot; I really mean , &quot; I really mean , I mean , &quot; I really mean , &quot; I really mean , &quot; I really mean , &quot; I really mean , &quot; I really sleep .
We take for example this Barasana bizonia , in Amazon , the population of anaconda , which creds to the middle of the latte of the latte of the latte of the latte of the latte of the sacred sacred .
It &apos;s a population that &apos;s not able to distinguishing the blue color because the blue color is identified in the forest , that it &apos;s driven in the forest .
They have a language and a major a major remarkable regulation , detail linguistic regulation , &quot; you have to must a person who park a different language .
And all of this has been radical in the mythological past , but particularly , in these families that are talking about six or seven or seven linguishes no lingua language .
They limited to listen and then they start speaking .
We take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived , the Waorani of Ecuador of Ecuador , an incredible people , an incredible people that had the first counts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five means , they &apos;ve been trying to make a herror .
They did they get out of the photographs that remote them in a pose that they had been loved , forested that this population of pluvial forest had never seen anything .
They collected the pictures of the earth , and they turn it to the pursuit of a shape or , they have concled that they were the dig , and they killed the disease , and they killed the disease .
But the Waorans don &apos;t just killed the straniests .
They kill in between them .
54 percent of mortality was caused by them .
We &apos;ve been up at eight generations and we found two death of death and when we &apos;ve been insisted to know , they have been admitted to be , they &apos;ve been ducking it , and then they killed it . And then they killed the same .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine by 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned a really interesting tassigned when my Harvard professor was assigning to Haiti , I was going to be in Haiti to be in the secret of Dualivalian and Tonton Macououbles , and imposed to do the bome of the use to the zome of the arvalier to do the zome of the band .
To take a sense of the Vodoun , I would have to understand Vodoun and that Vodoun is not magic .
It &apos;s a pretty good for metaphysics of the world .
Many interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Budddd-Ebraism , etc .
One continent is always , I &apos;m left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has no religious feelings . And he switched and the Voodoo is not other than the distilled of the narrow of nated religious nails on the tragic religious tragic .
What makes the interesting is the intense is the intense report between life and death .
So , the view are going to be born .
The spirits can be invoyed by Great Acqua , they respond to the dance of the dance and they &apos;re replaced the anima suit of the vive in the soul of the path .
So , the voodoodoodoodoownload , you go to walk up to God .
We go in the temple and become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re playing , is the spirit that drive you ?
So you &apos;re going to these incredible events : you followed in the trance of the trance of the trance touch that touched impoints of the power of mind on the body when it &apos;s catalyzed in a state of extreme , in a state of extreme .
I was all the people with which I lived the most extraordinary people are the Kogi of Sierra Nevada Marta , in Sierra Nevada Devada , in Colombia .
Discent of the ancient civilization that once they were on the carairs of the Colombia in the conquist , the population of the car , the population of the candle that you get on the carbic plantment planture .
In a continent of blood , this population never been conquered by the spagnols .
I &apos;m going to be governments from a cler , but their formation is really extraordinary .
The young people are taken away from the families to three or four years , and they live in a hundred of the bag and bombs in a world of the ice for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years of the nine months of the nine months of the gestation of the gestation of the mother , now are metaphor , now are metaphor , and they &apos;re metaphor in the Great Mther .
So , this is all the time , they are acculated to the values of their society , values that they &apos;re going to be acculate and only their prayers the balance balance -- or for the balance of the balance of the ecological balance .
Al termine that initiation , they &apos;re taking up up and for the first time , at 18 years , they see a age of 18 years , they see a high . And in that actimidle of the first blows , when the sunlight bulks the sunk of the first bulks of the basic , all of what they learned in theoret-a-house , and he says , &quot; The pret a step back and says , &quot; The pret a step back and says , &quot; The land-plender ,
&quot; Give ? Proprize as I said .
It &apos;s study . Now it &apos;s now . Now it &apos;s going to protect it . &quot;
It &apos;s called the major frrothers say that we , fratch the brothers , we are the basic of the world .
This intuition of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the Indigene populations and the environment , Rseau and the old history of the old wild of the nurses of the non-magical , and that these people are closes to the Earth of us .
The Indigenes are not not not sentimental .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the paludium , or in the cleaning gelids of Tibet , but thank because of the time and the rhyths , they created a mystic of the Earth is not about the concept of the world , but on a concept that the Earth can only because it &apos;s infected by the consciousness is that the Earth is that the consciousness is that it &apos;s infected by the consciousness of the human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
It means that a little boy of Ande , who grows that the mountain is a paster-a spirit spirit of a bull-to-to-foundly , and it will have a different relationship with the mountain or that place that grows with a mountain Montana that grows in a mountain , a mountain a mountain ,
That &apos;s the dimpointed or a mineral cow or a mineral cow .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Columbia creating that the forests served to be cut .
And that made me a different human being a different human from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the Hukuk dimpoor and the history of the paradise and the cannibes that live in the world , the spirits that live in the world &apos;s beginning to extreme the Hamatsa beginning to extreme Hamatsa &apos;s beginning .
If you start to consider that these cultures can actually create different reality , you can start to understand some of their sensational discovery .
I took this picture to open them in the norocky norrow up .
Mayahukkidney about the Eahubask , the most powerful sushing of the repertoire .
What makes the eyahuge , it &apos;s not the drug potential drumacological potential of substance , but his processing . It &apos;s composed to two elements .
From a side , this lian leagged lian huge of carbon , harmments and harmments , slightly harmful , sleeping hallucinogens .
Taking the only plant one is a bluastral burst a little bit of a conscience , but it &apos;s mixed with the leaves of a cabinet of the family of coffee family .
This is a plant of triptamines , very similar to serotonin , dimethoxyle-five , methoxyltryptamine-five , methoxyltryptamines .
If you ever see the Yanomami to the Yanomami , the susance of the substance that they do by a different species of species , which is a methoxyltryltryptams .
Tiring that poller on for the nose is a little bit like being disappeal by a barol of the eyes of the eyes of electricity . &#91; Really won &apos;t believe a distortion of reality . Don &apos;t believe a distortion of reality .
I was often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who wrote the psychedelic , with his discovery of the fungi in the 1930 in Mexico .
I think , I &apos;m not going to classifully these triptames like hallucinogens , because if you &apos;re not telling any one of being kinated .
It &apos;s possible absolutely alone if they make a lot of other chemical chemical substances that money .
Now , the beautiful : the carbines that are in this lian inhibitors are in MAO , the same kind of necessary , the same kind of necessary question : in a 80,000 , in a 80,000 species of plants , like these are the two dia-dies of dies of dies , but that if you do this , create a version that &apos;s a very much way , create a trillion that &apos;s high perior the six ?
We use the great eufemism of the prova and the error , which can reveal ins .
But if we ask the Indians , they &apos;ll tell us , &quot; Or plants are talking about . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of the Euash , which they &apos;re network in the forest , and that the eyes would be in the same species .
If we ask them how they &apos;re going to say , &quot; I thought I would think they &apos;re going to tell us , I would think they understand plants , you know , &quot; No . &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you get 17 variety in a night of moon , and everybody &apos;s going to song with a different tone .
With this is not laurea Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting to count that count printing the prints .
Now , &#91; &#91; applauses &#93; the problem is that even the people who have to have the house heart of the history of the history of the history of the history of the real history of our real world , and the pass .
In fact , the 19th century , 300 years , it wouldn &apos;t remember the wars or the remember of technological innovations , but rather as the one that we stops and we abuntil actively or masses of diversity and cultural determs of the planet . Now the problem is not change .
All cultures through the centuries were involved in a dancy for new possibilities .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux didn &apos;t stand to be Sioux when they put it up up and they did as they have been in the horses of the horses and they didn &apos;t stop Americans and horal .
It &apos;s not the change or the technology that threatening the ethnosphere . It &apos;s the power .
The flight of domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you &apos;ll find that these are not destinate cultures .
They are living creatures and dynamics out of the identifiable forces that go over their ability forces that go over their ability .
And what it &apos;s going to be disbosing in the patries of the Penan --
a Plady of Sarawak , in the Asian Asian , a population that lived in the forest to a generation forest to a generation ago , and now reduck on the next title of the next remarkable results of the figures , where you can see the river of the physical figures that seems to be so much of the Japanese . And the Japanese names , where the Japanese noundary nor the horizonic , where the Japanese names names .
You can take the stives with the wood wood .
Or in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that have come with the gold of the gold .
If we move on the Tibet of the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the fluck of political domination .
You know , as a genocide , the physical extinction of a population , but the etheless of a universal level , but the ethreats of a population , not only is not only condanced , but it &apos;s celebrate in the environments , because it &apos;s part of the development .
And you can &apos;t understand the Tibet of Tibet until you go from the beginning .
I ran the 6,000 miles from China in the Western China in the Western China , and coming to Lhasa with a young , but only came to Lhasa , but just came to Lhasa , I realized what &apos;s behind the statics we &apos;re hearing .
6,000 feels in the poller and centers .
1.2 million people from the military of people from the military Revolution .
The father of this guy was absolutely critish at the Panchen Lama .
which means that it &apos;s been killed to the time of the Chinese invasion .
His uncle with Santity in Santity during the diaspora that has brought the people in Nepal .
His mother was imprisoned and his church was recicilent .
It was taken to hidden the age of two years , hidden under his ground because he wouldn &apos;t have lived in his own .
The sister , which did the same , it was put in the reeducation camp .
One day , he has been howed a Mao waiting , and for this transgression , and it was put in the forced to the force work for seven years .
Tibet pain , the Tibet , but the redeship of the population is from tener .
And then it turns out it up to a choice .
We want to live in the world world &apos;s world , or we want to take the policromatic world or we want to take the policycle of diversity ?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he said that his biggest fear was that , in our going to this love of the world , we &apos;re not just seen the whole amount of human imagination , we &apos;re going to see the whole amount of human imagination , but a day , a day , we &apos;ll see us from a sleep , but a day , a day , we &apos;ll wake up to that there were other possibilities .
And it &apos;s uilating that our species is in for 600,000 years .
The Neolitics revolution , which given us the agriculture , which made us to us to the seed of the seed , and by sushing the next few of the slim , and by the next to the clero , and we &apos;re talking about 10,000 years ago .
The industrialized world has about 300 years old .
That slights , I don &apos;t suggested that we have the answers to all the challenges that we &apos;re going to be in the millennia to come .
When these miriades of the world is asked what it is to say , what it is to be human , they respond with 10,000 voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all rescrats the possibility of being what we are , a consciousness , that it has to be a kind of consciousness , that it has to flown . And there are great moments .
I took this picture on the north of Baffin , when I went to the hundred of the hundred of bales with Inuit , and this man , and this man , and this man , and the man , and he told the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The canadcanoes is not always gentile with the Inuit and in the 1950s to stabilie our suprematia lot of slums , we &apos;ve been involved in colonies .
The non-man of this man was going to go .
The family , themselves , and it took it away all the arms , and all the arms of the arms .
You have to know that the Inuit are not the cold , they &apos;re going to be .
The slitte paces were made of the basic skin , the basic package .
The non-man of this man didn &apos;t have to be intimiddddle or the lizers or the lizers ,
It &apos;s gathered out , you &apos;ve got the broken in the foca and defecated in their hand . When I made it up , they were congled , and they &apos;re working on a moa lama .
He sprayed on the house of this cluster , and when he came up , he killed a dog .
Sschohhided the dog and created a bridge , and he made a slitta , he gets a slate , he &apos;s short , and it &apos;s disappeared on the banchisa , and it &apos;s shelter .
We want to talk about to the wild with nothing ?
In the 1999 , the canadvance of the canadvance of the California control the total control of a California and Texas I together .
It &apos;s their new patric . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a independent territory . They all the remains mineraries .
One splendidding example of like a national state could reconcile with his population .
And , finally , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious at least to the one of us was in these remote zones of the planet , make it remote .
For somebody &apos;s home .
They represent sections of the human imagination that are risking the alone of the the dyslets . And for all these kids , like dreams of these kids , like dreams of hope .
For finally , we National Geographic is we are convinced that political will never get anything .
We think the polemy --
&#91; Applauses are not persuasive , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and perhaps we &apos;re the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month to tell the world . Or month our size 35 million visit .
156 countries our television is transmitted .
Our reviews are slands out of millions of people .
Our work is to travel in the ethnosphere to bring our audience in the etheling cultural place from how they saw and hopes as they saw and hopes , they &apos;re hoping , and hopology of anthropology of anthropology , and we have to find a fun in the diversity , and we have to find a lifestyle of life in a pluralistic world and multicultural revealing the public reveal of life in a places ,
that wisdom of all the people can contribute to our collective well-being .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope required to be any other people who have heard and I &apos;m going to try to evidence some colleague .
I &apos;d like to start with what I call &quot; the official dogm . &quot;
The dogm is the official thing ?
The dogm of all the Western society industrial society . The dogm is the dogm of our citizens , &quot; If we want to move the benefits of our citizens . &quot;
The reason is , from a side , in the fact that freedom is in the same value , it &apos;s precious , useful , essential , the essential , the essential , the essential , the essential thing .
An the other is that if we &apos;re free , each of us can act to do everything that massive to do everything that massive our benefits , no one that decided to our well-being , without any one that decided to names .
The way to male the freedom is to move choice .
More choices people have , more to be free , and the greatest is their liberty , the greater is their well-being .
I think that &apos;s so deeply radicated in the society that nobody would dream of put it in the doubt .
And it &apos;s also deeply radicated in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m going to allow a simple note on the conditions .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without the oil of oil , and 12 acets of oil , 12 acets of the balses that you can buy for a huge number of conditions in the research recircumstance that nobody of the 175 proners that nobody &apos;s already of your deading .
Here &apos;s what the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic store to buy a stereo : case , you know , CD , radio , radio , floating .
And in this single negotide , there &apos;s a big number of audio .
We can make six and a half million different combinations of combinations using the components that there are in a negotial .
You need to admit that there &apos;s a lot of choice .
Other fields : the communications of communications .
Once I was a child , you could all the desire the services of the desire , and they could be able , by the shelter that they were fornited by mom .
You were born the phone , they didn &apos;t buy it .
One of that one of that , the phone , was that the phone didn &apos;t have .
These times , these days are gone .
We have a variety of phones , almost limited phones , especially between cellularium .
Here &apos;s the cellphone of the future .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , tapels of the nose , and it force for the critical kild me .
If you don &apos;t have seen in the house , you &apos;re not seen certainly certainly certainly .
And what &apos;s going on is that people come into the news and does this question . And you know what &apos;s the answer is ? The answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cellphone that doesn &apos;t do too many things .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the busters , you know , the same plaster explosion of choices .
Assistence : not happens in the United States of the United States from the doctor and the doctor drive to you have .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; Okay , we could do it , or or you have these benefits , &quot; B has these benefits . &quot;
You say , &quot; Doctor , what would I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; You have these benefits and risks , and the risks , and the risks . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you removed , &quot; Doctor she was , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result we call it the autonomy of the malseems , &quot; expression that it makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But it &apos;s actually not that one , you know , the height and the responsibility of taking decisions from someone who knows something , which is the doctor , someone else you don &apos;t know -- and so it &apos;s not in condition to make the patient decisions .
There &apos;s a huge marketing products , directly to people like me and you , that if you think about it doesn &apos;t have any sense , that if you think there &apos;s no sense , that we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why do they published them ?
The answer is that they want to be that dominate called the doctor to change it .
Something so fundamental identity is our hyentity is a question of choice , as you see in this jet . &quot; We don &apos;t want to force children . We don &apos;t want to force the children . We don &apos;t want to be a full right now .
And we can reinvent us how many times we can get us .
which means that every morning , to the risk , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I pull the family and the mathemselves , a time next pective , square communal , almost anyone , and it was that you could have the most soon as possible , and you started to make the most possible .
The only choice was with who , not even when , and not even what to do after .
Ogyday , it &apos;s really to play .
I teach in a very smart students , and I do do the 20 percent of work on a time .
And not because they &apos;re not not smart , because they &apos;re not not not because they &apos;re less diligent .
but because I &apos;m impensieritital , I mean , &quot; I would like , &quot; Do I &apos;m going to do that now ? &quot;
&quot; Do I must go more later ? I have to think before children or career or career ? &quot;
They are logoranananants .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this implement not to the middle that I don &apos;t get a beautiful vote to my exercise .
And they have to do it . They have to do it . They have to do it .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , as Carl underneath , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from Hotel Randolph .
Tra parentesesize , there &apos;s a angler , and I don &apos;t tell anyone who , where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t say , because I want to use it .
What does , this mean , this incredible freedom of choice that we have to do that ? It &apos;s that we have to continually in every moment , if we have to work or not .
We can go to our son , and we can play the cell phone in a tank , the Blackberry in the other , and the night , and the night , typically , on the ginocky .
And if they &apos;re all spents , every minute that we see our son , we &apos;re also wondering , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; I say , &quot; I have to answer this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? I have to cut this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is not , &quot; no , &quot; it makes the experience of your son , very different than the partnership of your son &apos;s going to be in other conditions .
So , whatever we look at , little and big , things are little and big , and life is a lifetime , life is a choice ish issue .
And once the world was this : Oval , there were some possibilities , but not all of the choice .
The world today looks like this : The dilemma is , &quot; It &apos;s a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Scilady .
So , positive side , so I &apos;m going to talk about negative .
All this choice is two effects , two effects , you know , in fact ,
The first one , paradoxally , is that it produces liberation instead of liberation .
And so many of the options that choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I offer you an exhibition : a study conduct the flung of volunteer .
A colleague has been access to the data of Vanheads , the giant society of the sources of the fold of a million climents in 2,000 companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of adesion is two percent .
With 50 fundamental offerts , there &apos;s 10 percent of adesions that available to when they have been available to five . Why ?
Because with 50 sources that choose , it &apos;s disease , it &apos;s disease , and the choose is is remanded to the indomoral .
And by domorders , and again , domorders , domorders , and of course , domorders , of course , domorders , and of course , domorders , domorders , and of course , domorders , domorangent , and of course , domorangent , and of course , domored , domorous domories , domorders , and of course
You know , you know , not only that these workers are going to be eating for cans because they don &apos;t have enough money , you know , they &apos;re also going to say that decision is so obstic that they lose the complementary of the dator of work .
They &apos;re not participating , they &apos;re losing up to five dollars from the work , which would be willing to be going to be versary .
So the paralysis a consequence of the howner .
And I think that makes the world like this .
&quot; And finally , for the eternity : ketchup , you know , feel like ? &quot;
You would like ethernity , if it &apos;s for ethernity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and neputting the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can avoid the paralysis and we &apos;re fewer satisfying on the result of how we would be with less satisfying .
And that &apos;s a different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of them , and that you choose choose , if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have a different choose that you would have been better . And what happened is that alternative imagined us to bring the choose choose to the choose choose of the choose choose by the decision , and the recorded by the decision , and the satisfied by the decision ,
even when it was a good decision .
More choices are , more easy to displaced anything that is insodently insodenting of choice .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call cost-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert is really clear very well as the value that we do the things that we are depends on what we are .
In the rest , when there are so options , it &apos;s easy to represent the characteristics of alternative alternative , and be less satisfying of the option that is choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m scusually with all the New York .
But that &apos;s what you probably would think .
There &apos;s this copy copy in the Hamptons .
A place of lussize .
It &apos;s all about it . Otype . It &apos;s all for them .
It doesn &apos;t do anything . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , maledition , is August . &quot;
&quot; All my neighbors in Manhattan are away . &quot;
&quot; I could talk about home . &quot;
And he spent two weeks that &apos;s losing the idea that &apos;s losing -- every day -- the possibility of the way it wants .
The cost-opportunity is declining the sodddle is that we have , even when choice was eccellent .
And the most of the options that we have to consider , the more activity the actual characteristics will return to the cos-opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This jet is saying a lot of things .
We talk about the moment , and perhaps the living .
But the most important point is that anything you choose , you choose not to do other .
The things we don &apos;t choose have so many attractive that they can make less attractive what we do .
Tirl point : the growing of expectations .
I tried it on my skin bought a new jeans .
I remember almost always jeans .
And then the jeans were one like , you buy them and bought on the dress , they were type , only after they took a life and they were washed , only after they took a lot of times , they began to go well .
So I went to buy a couple of them , and I said , &quot; I need a couple jeans , and I said , &quot; I need a couple jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Look slim , &quot; Hey slim , relaxy and fit ? &quot;
You want them to do anything or with the bottons ? &quot; Stonewashed &quot; or &quot; acidwashed &quot; ?
&quot; Li want ? &quot;
&quot; Sow the basic or stretches ? Bumble bla -- &quot; Continured to elency .
I was balordit , and after a little bit , I was able to say , &quot; I want the guy that was the only guy , &quot; he didn &apos;t know what it was , so I tried all of the diseem , and then came out of the sticks , and then came out of the best , and then I would have ever .
It was the very choice . I had got the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand it .
The reason I was worse as much as the whole choice , and the jeths were altissim , the jeans had to be perfect .
I had been waiting minime . I didn &apos;t expectic anything when it was only a kind of a kind of 100 different , lacks , at least a kind of hundred , at least a kind of hundred , at least a kind of hundred , at least a kind of hundred different , labor a s
What I had buy was good , but not perfect .
After I paraged to the choose with what I was trying to realize .
The adaddition of the people don &apos;t have to increase the expectations that these have respect to the expectations that are .
And this will be producing less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing if it makes it .
Because if they knew it , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth looks more like this .
&quot; You were better when you were worse , &quot; The reason you were worse when you were worse when you were worse when you were worse , it was even worse as much as you could meet surprised .
Ogyday , in the world that we live -- opulents , industrialized citizens with the perfeeling of perfection -- the most that we can hope is that things are the things to be on the heith of expectations .
You never surprised places because your expectations , the expectations , you &apos;ve been ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Basis waiting &quot; Yes , you want . &quot;
I mean -- little moment , the self-hand-house -- which I &apos;m really moving .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t have to be able .
But to acknowledge is not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of jeans smoking a couple of jeans is that when there &apos;s only that when you &apos;re not satisfied , and say , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is response ? &quot; The answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What could I do you ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a non-satisfacing , and you ask you who is the responsible , it &apos;s as clear that responsible to you .
You could have been doing better .
With hundreds of dispone-clustered , there are not the cluster .
So when people take decisions , even though the result is willing , they feel unfully and give the chair .
In the last years , the depression is exploitation in the industrialized world .
I think a full meaningful -- not the only one , but that &apos;s important -- of this depression of depression is that people have experiences of the people &apos;s experiences because standards are too .
And when they have to explain this situation think that the colorful is them .
So the end result is that in general , we &apos;re better better , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit of choose is better than it , but it didn &apos;t get it , but it didn &apos;t take that but it &apos;s not going to be better than a little bit .
There &apos;s a critical value , I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s .
But I &apos;m pretty sure we have a piece of the piece that choose better our life .
Now , from the political point of view -- I almost finished -- from the political point of view , the nocle is the following .
What allows all this choice in the industrial society is the material wealth .
There are a lot of places in the world , and you know , the problem is not they have too much choice .
The problem is they have too much pocket .
So the faces that I &apos;m talking about is a modern malesclusive of modern , recidital society .
And what it does is to do is , the Levitt is : Steve Levitt talked about how those costs and slaughter seats , and they &apos;re going to be useful . It &apos;s a spread of money .
I mean that these choose , complicated and dispendependent , it &apos;s not that they &apos;re just useful .
They are adducting .
They do stand worse .
If a little bit of what our society allows , it &apos;s been revered in those where people have too much much , in the where people have too much better , not just their life , but also .
This is what economists call a paretian paretian .
A redistribution of the region of all -- not only the poor people -- not only as poor people -- because of this choose .
And so , to end , you can become everything you want to be what you want --
You , people of culture , you think , &quot; What does that create that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t make anything in a glass of glass . &quot;
&quot; An imagination , a limited vision of the world --
And I &apos;m going to be interpret in the beginning .
But then , I realized that that fish the long .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you mans in the books , so that you can &apos;t get the freedom . You get the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you reach the broks that everything is becoming possible to declined the satisfaction .
You know , you know , and you reduck the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too stricken , perhaps even for the fish , and of course for us .
But the absence of a symbolic symbolic , I &apos;m about the rinvolved ,
Thank you very much .
