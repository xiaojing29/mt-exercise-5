The year I shows , I shows these slies to show that the calculate glacial glacial size , that for the 48 million years had the U.S.
I &apos;m going to have this sune of the gravity of the problem because it &apos;s not showing the gone .
The calculate glacial is , in a sense , the cuer of global climate system .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
The next slide is going to be a ree-carrelated by the last 25 years .
The basic lost , I &apos;m saying in the red .
As you see , you know , you know , the blue .
That &apos;s the glacy in inverse , that &apos;s ritive .
You can see that the costtold , I hope , of five years or , or more , it &apos;s like the sang , which is the floor ,
In 25 years , it &apos;s saying , so .
This is a problem because the crazy , because the territ of the ocean artment where there are huge amount of carbon conged that , they &apos;re going to get , they &apos;re going to put , they &apos;re going to put in the metan hicrobi .
It &apos;s a clean of the inquences of the inquencing ction , that it could radical involved , the surface , the surface , the surface , not back .
In some laghi , in some laghes in Alaska half of the water .
The professor Katey Walter Walter Walter &apos;s the University of Alaska , a team , a team .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : I &apos;m good . The question is if we &apos;re going to be .
A reason is that this scale scale , the term term of the normal Groenland .
This is a glacial figures .
The brought had never add to the similar .
This is the Kangerlush , in the south of Groenland .
If you want to know how the level of the level to the mare to the map of the gacross the earth , here is where we can add the mare .
These corrents are aumenting reidly .
At the other part of the planet : The most large block , the most great block of the planet .
The month scientists have died scientists have died that the bang of the ice is in negative , and that Antartmtart , which Antartmyself , which is particularly required in the science , is particular ararly required in the science .
And there &apos;s six feet of the level of the level , like Groenland .
Sull Himalaya , the third block , you see new laghes , you see new laghes , who had a few years ago .
40 percent of the population of the population will remarkable water from the power of the water .
Sull Ands : this glacier is the floor of the water of this city .
The brought was aumented .
But when you diminuggling , the same access water .
In California , the nine on Sierra Nevada is diminuitself .
The bins are in cribes .
The previsions , as you have , I &apos;m gravi .
The growth city in the world &apos;s door in the world &apos;s door in the world .
The wasters are environmental writing to a writm out of normal , and without precedents .
four times more numerous number in the last 30 years , I &apos;ll read 75 .
This is a watch of all instainable .
If you look at the context stories if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we have add 70 million tons in CO2 25 hours -- 25 hours in the ocean every day .
Look at the U.A. Pacifast of the Pacifast , in the American , and on the American , and in the subcontinent , where there &apos;s a radical impact impact of the hosysit in the ocean .
Most cause of global scale , global climbs , together at the deal , is the deal of the beautiful combuible .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with the Cina .
And he was proponed to build a lot of other central central central .
But we &apos;re assisting a change .
These are the annative projects in the last years , and some of the alternative version .
every way , there &apos;s a politician in our country in our country .
The industries of the carbon and the oil has spread 250 million dollars in the last year for promote , which is a host , which is a hosymet .
That picture me remember something --
I know Natale , in the Tennessee , where I live , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion chores of carbon .
You &apos;ve seen it up the news .
This is the second floor in America .
It &apos;s happened to Natale .
The published public of the industries of the blood was this .
Video : She said , â™« Fross the bonag is a kind of like , and happy .
It &apos;s wonderful here in America , and it &apos;s growth our economy .
Fross the carbonaia is always more than it &apos;s always more .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and the work , the workers are going to be the stipend .
Al Gore : West is a lot of the carbon the West Virginia .
The most largest society , the montages is Massey Coal . This is his love .
Video : Won Blankenship : I &apos;m going to do -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosh , Harry Reid -- they &apos;re not going to talk about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clim of Clim &apos;s Clim &apos;s two campaign .
This is a part of the one .
Video : Attor : All COALergy see the change as a serious ments like our business .
So this priority is invest a big amount of money in a hority of money in a public sent , and confuses the purpose of the paper .
In fact , the carbon is not sport .
We think it &apos;s a good profound -- it &apos;s also a good profumo .
So not predictators of change change .
Let me do to do .
Video : Attor : You know , you know , you &apos;ve heard about it .
So , I do a game in a strong strong the watch of the basic bone .
It &apos;s extraordinary . The car is a bit rumorous , but this is the sound of the paper of the carbon .
The baby is between the climbs between the climbs of global climbs , but the notion of the carbon that you see it .
You have a hodierments of the carbon the carbon .
Al Gore : Infinally , the alternative positive to the economic issue and the one of the churenational sward .
Video : Minent America is in the cribes ; the economy , the sure , the climate climate climate .
The phils that the college of all , our dependence , as the basic bone , like the carbon and the oil and the oil .
Now , perhaps there is a new , audace solution for usually .
Repower America : 100 percent of pulites , in the deal .
A pian to put America in the work , it &apos;s more sure , and help us to help the global rescale .
Finally , a solution that solution to solve our problems .
It &apos;s more . Some . Some .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Yeah . It &apos;s a slip to America .
One of the most halls of the fast faster to the end of the dependence that killed our planet .
She said , the future is here . I &apos;m saying , a new energy , you &apos;ll see it it .
Sometimes two : Nooves investment for posts of work for posts .
My : Repower America . It &apos;s time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old old old the proverbio , you &apos;ll go to the site , you go to the site .
If you want to go back , you go back . &quot;
We have to go back , I &apos;m just going to go back .
Thank you very much .
The year I went to TED fech , a year on the LHC .
And I promise to get back to the high herself on how it works .
So , I realize . And for those time , there were no , LHC is the large experiment , the most experiment , 27 kilometers ever -- 27 kilometers of circle .
His compit is to reach the conditions that were less than a billion a million second from the universe , at 600 million times to the second .
All this is just environment .
This is the machine , the wind .
We have these mini-Big Bang Bang in the result .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called AS . It &apos;s got 44 feet and has a diameter .
This is a picture of AS in AS in buildings so you can see the proportions .
The 10 setches , we have access to the first time .
And this picture was taken by AS .
It was because of immentioned , it &apos;s himself in the room .
It &apos;s a picture of the first phasm of particles that had done all the right of the LHC , in the collision , with a part of the HC , and it &apos;s honing in the resonce of the rest .
In other words , when we see that the 10 settled , we &apos;re going to see that the machine works , the great vittoria .
I don &apos;t know if it was this exultar that was going to do this , when somebody on Google and vide that page was this .
And that means we had a cultural impact cultural impact cultural .
And I mean , a week after , there was a problem with the machine , it &apos;s just about these here -- these dorbers .
These brought 13,000 amping when the machine works in the massive .
Now , the technical technical , the phils and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . I &apos;m not true . &quot;
And they can do that because when they &apos;re very cold of become the cost-horders .
So , at least 271 degrees , at a temperature in the space between the room , these phils , these phils can bring that corrent corrent .
In one of the young novemial novemial magnovemial in the LHC , there was a fabication .
So the phils , they read , and the 13,000 , and the 13,000 amping a resistance resistence .
This was the result .
Now , this is still more impressioning if you think these magnetwork , and you know , that &apos;s more than 20 toners , and that &apos;s saying about 30 centiet .
They &apos;re danneged about 50 magnetwork .
We had to take them , what we did .
We have repristinted and bear .
Now , they &apos;re coming back to their sun .
By the end of the marzo , the LHC is going to be new integrate .
We &apos;re going to happen , and we &apos;re going to get the data to get the data to the right place , and continuing so our adventure for what the morning is the morning .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these reacts , these reacts are going to be the debate on the engineery of the engineering .
I think the fact that that &apos;s so hard , the fact that &apos;s fact that it &apos;s the limits , I think that &apos;s the LHC .
I want to say with the words of a scientist , Humphrey Davy , Humphrey Davy , which is , in the inuses of the inuses of the inuses of his brother , his blob , he said , &quot; Nithing is so perolder for the rest of the research of the resources of the resources of the rest of the resources of the research of the research , which is not just the squitch of our ches ,
Thank you .
I want to start thinking about rethink about when , children , from children , from the children , from the morning .
Whereas you can get them and reach them , and they &apos;re going to get them and move , you know , you know , and you &apos;re going to think and hold about space .
The reasoning space is deeply connected to the way we understand that we &apos;re going to be part of the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world &apos;s deeply connected to us .
So , from the information , from the usual usual , in our interaction with the physics , and my collaborator , my collaborator , I started asked me , I started asked me , I started asked me , &quot; And if we &apos;re a computer , in the wator of the watching , and we have a wator , we can get the watch , and we have to get a deskerve information , with the information , and we can be a herring information with the information ,
and we love to our piece ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , it was actually buildings , it &apos;s going to be able to be able .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a great computer .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a great computer .
You can move with the hand , they can be , &quot; You can be , &quot; between them , and they have a screen and a wireless .
But on the hatuts , the physics , as the morning , you can move simply .
Siftable , the example of a new ecosystem for a new ecosystem for hypolar .
And then they get more physics , they know , consciousness , the other , of the other , and they &apos;re move that , consciousness , conscious of the movement , how we can put them , we can exploring new and different interaction .
I &apos;m going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configurate to show the video : if you incline , the video gets is going to get the rotery , it will be a rote from the other side side side back .
These realize are conventions are consciousness of other .
If you &apos;re interested in them , they &apos;re interested in them .
If they &apos;re now , you know , you know , they &apos;re going to get a bit .
If they &apos;re now , you know , you know , they &apos;re going to get a bit .
They also saying their movement and inclination .
We have constructed that one of the interaction of the interaction was the power of the data , to the data , &quot; to example , &quot; to example , &quot; a color as if it was a living .
In this case , we have three Siftable , we have three Siften and I can use them to save the color in the central central , where you missing .
and I can use them to be able to be able to be able to the color in the central , where they &apos;re going to be .
If we &apos;re going to be too , we can repect a place .
I &apos;m also beautiful possibility of appearing , like the language , and yes where people can try to get the logic of the logic things that are going to see the things that are going to see the result of the immediately ,
Now , I &apos;m --
This is a sequence of Fibonacy that I do with a equations .
Here &apos;s a game of words that &apos;s going to put in Spabeo and Boble .
You know , you know , you know , you know , a literally , in every Siftable , in every Siften , every remarkable to the way , in the Siftable , and while I &apos;m going to get the words of a diary .
And then , after about 30 seconds , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new set and a new possibility of trying to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the children in the Media Lab , I did in the Lab , I did it , and I got a video .
They &apos;re like them very hundreds .
And one of the things of this kind of things that application is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of education .
You just say , &quot; You know , &quot; Mayers of words &quot; , and they &apos;re exactly what do .
Here &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do .
This is our best young young , there &apos;s right there , there &apos;s right there .
It was actually just a lot of them .
They were only morning , for him .
Now , this is an application of a bad of a interaction .
We wanted to build a strument for the approach of the Lui &apos;s &apos;s Felix .
It can inserious personages in the scens , ssolve the Siftable .
It can inserious personages in the scens , ssolve the Siftable .
Here &apos;s , it &apos;s doing the sole .
Video : The sole is source .
David Merrier : Now he brought a tractor in the scency .
Video : The tractor .
By work ! Yeah .
So schools , Siftable and put close to the best way to make the character .
Video : Bau .
And I inventing the story .
Video : I &apos;m going to be .
DM : It &apos;s a story with apert , and it can decided it as you know .
DM : It &apos;s a story with apert , and it can decided it as you know .
Video : Video , gets .
DM : The last example I have time to show you a strument , I &apos;ve got to field , to field and execise .
It &apos;s a recent , realized , to realize and exeguy to the music .
Siften here is the sound as base , the base and the battery .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can write what it is going to use .
You can inserious these sound in a sequence of the sequence of the hundred .
And modificate the simply just doing a sound , &quot; and a sequence . &quot;
These are effects that you can control from the vive , like the result and the phils .
You know , the attacks to a particular sound , and then inclines to the .
And then there are general effects as time and flows , that &apos;s applicate in the sequence .
Let &apos;s look at how it works .
Video : We &apos;re going to start a base in two Siftable , &quot; we &apos;re sequence , &quot; we &apos;re going to addition , we add , we add other things , we add other side .
Now , a line line of the basis .
Video : Now , I add the percussions --
Video : And now I &apos;ll put the best battery , so I can control the effect of the view .
Video : I can see the wild the interested in the sequence of the time from a late , or from the other .
Video : And I &apos;ll add the phils to the bottom to get more expression .
Video : I can remember the sequence of the sequence . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have planning the first , but I can improvide , it &apos;s going to be a long or more cord or the most coral thing .
And now , finally , I can squence the intera sequence , unclining to the left Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is buildings , it &apos;s going to be a lot of the floor , how we work our brain and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the result of this percoral , and also some possibility that we want to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmate is that it &apos;s going to be in this new generation of objects to interact with the media media , which will have information in our world that we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time to talk to all of you .
I &apos;m a written .
Shomorrow is my profession , but it &apos;s more than this , obviously .
It &apos;s also the love of my life .
And I don &apos;t expect that you can change .
But , said this , something particular , it &apos;s recently in my life and in my career , and in my careful , and I got to realize the whole thing .
The particular thing is I &apos;ve recently wrote this book , this biography called &quot; Manem , I said , &quot; which , I have a lot of the books , I &apos;m going to use my foods , for some reason in the world and become a great hinsatic , and become a great , and it &apos;s a great horse , and it &apos;s a great hister , and it &apos;s become a great books ,
And the result is that everyone now , the people who are going to be condannect .
I really mean , condanned , condanned !
They &apos;re going to get back to me and say , &quot; You don &apos;t know , &quot; You don &apos;t know what do you can &apos;t do you do better ?
You don &apos;t have to go to write for all life without the most powerful life without out a book that can be able to make a book that ? &quot;
What can you say to somebody ?
It &apos;s rassicult , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say , when I started to say , when I started to be a writing .
I was going to met the same reaction of the pursue .
And people said , &quot; You don &apos;t know , &quot; I don &apos;t have successful ?
You don &apos;t have to huge you get the key of the refive ?
You don &apos;t have to do this myself to do this move to the whole life without out there and death out of a cumule , with the house ball of the house to love to love cump cump ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the answer to all of these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
You know , I have a couple of all those things .
I &apos;ve always had a couple .
And I &apos;ve also have a lot of other things that people may not income .
As the alga and other things like the alga lot of things .
But , how about how much I thought I thought , and I thought , and I was the switched , is why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logical that anyone debate to be spent from a job that &apos;s snate to a job .
But what &apos;s about so particular in particular creative in creative creative , and it &apos;s about the health health th the other other career &apos;t they do ?
How my father , for example , he was a engineering and not remember a sunlight in his 40 years of activity in the time that was wondered to be engineeer to be engineer ?
There was never -- that block , that block on John , how ?
So , it was not so , you know ?
Only , the engineers like group as group , in the centuries , in the centuries , the reputation of being high horse .
And then the writers , we have this reputation , and not just scrors but creative of every gender , we have this reputation of being an instable instable instable .
And not rest to look at the trists , and the conteger of the magnifies , the creative major century , they &apos;re going to be young people and spspent to them .
And even those who don &apos;t have been suickly , they &apos;re not saying , they &apos;re saying .
Norman Mailer , before I die , before I die , in the last thing , I said , &quot; Oknow , my book has knew a little bit more &quot; &quot; a little bit of life .
But we don &apos;t get the jobs when we heard these things , so we &apos;ve heard these things , we &apos;ve got a whole thing that we have been interiorizing the nothing that creative creative and the software are in some way , and the flowed , in the end , and the record .
And the question I want to take all of today is : You &apos;re going to do with this idea ?
It &apos;s good at this thing -- because you look at the midle of a half me , it doesn &apos;t really know for this .
I think it &apos;s odiosa .
And I think it &apos;s periculous and I don &apos;t want to see the perpetuggling in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to incord our great ments creative creative .
And I &apos;m sure that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be hope to start to the journery , I &apos;m going to get the host of the host brows , on my hundreds of the carric .
Or -- I &apos;m looking at , I &apos;m really really a young young , I &apos;ve got about 40 years .
I still have about four decadecadecake in me .
And it &apos;s very exciting that anything I write about now , then it &apos;s going to be given from the world as the job that was going to be going to be a very success .
I &apos;m slaving , because we &apos;re all more or not here -- it &apos;s probably the large of the great success is to my hand .
Oh , Gesus , who think about it .
You know this is the gender of thinking that I &apos;m going to start to start to start to start to get gin the morning of the morning , I don &apos;t want to do it .
I &apos;d like to do this work that I want to do this work .
So , the question is , how do it ?
And so it seems , after a lot of reflections , that way to work to continue is to create a psychological costrickly protective , oken ?
I have to find a very sure of sure between me , and I write , and my natural , I &apos;m write , and my natural thing about what I was going to get to get the time to do that , I was going to get the time to look at the time , and I &apos;m trying to find other society and the best of the best of the world , and the best of the best and more and more and more and more and the best of the best ides and the best of the best of the best of the best of the best and the best of the best of the best
how to help people creative to make people creative to the inerents of creative creative creative .
And that research me to the ancient Great and Rome .
Seguitems because I gave it in the certainly and then back .
In the ancient Grex and Rome -- people didn &apos;t look at that creative creative that creative becomes drive to the men , OK ?
It was thinking that creative creative , this beautiful becomes divity and that he came from a few people from a few people from a few people from a few people from a few people from a few people who are really really distant and challenges .
We were called these these divines about the creative creative creative creative creative . &quot;
Socration , wonderful , creates it &apos;s created to have a demone that elargiven .
Roman was the same idea , but they called that kind of spirit without a genius .
That &apos;s holding , because the Roman was not really thinking that a genius was a kind of smart .
They have a genius that a genius of this entity , which creates has created in the murs of the study of a artist , a little bit like the brob of a artist , a little bit like the basic job , and that &apos;s going to get the work of the work of the work .
Here &apos;s ey--- here , that &apos;s the distance of what -- that is the distance of the psychological psychological .
And all had that was so that he worked , right ?
So the artists were protects from certain things , as a lot of things , as a lot of narcism , no , not ?
If your work was excetional job , not take and the market , all they had been helped by this genius .
If your job , you know , it was not all the basic high , right ?
All they knew that was the genius to be a capable .
And so people are finger creative creative creative in Occcident to a long time .
And then the Rind came and all changes , and it &apos;s all changes , and we put this big idea ; we put up to the universe of the universe and the mysters and without the mistake of the creatures that wrong from the divinity .
This was the main the human anesimum , and the people start thinking that creative creative , and the people start thinking that creative is called the ished .
And for the first time in story , you know , you know , you know , the artist of this one one of the one person with a genius .
And I have to say , I think was a grosye .
I think it &apos;s going to put someone , a simple person of creative to be like a repiece of the fourth , and the people all my mysters , creative , creative , creative , creative , creative , creative , you know , and you know , a lot of the hundred of the psyches that human beings .
It &apos;s like to ask somebody of you to income .
And it &apos;s completely the ego and creates all of these initions .
And I think it was this to destroy the artists in the past of 500 years .
And , if this is true , I think it &apos;s , and I think it &apos;s the question , and now ?
We can do it different ?
Maybe to go back to a lot more than the relationship between human relationship and creative .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t cell 500 years of thinking about 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s people are the audience that solutely suspects the needs of the nothing , you know , you know , you know , you know , they &apos;re going to get the next thing , or they &apos;re going to do .
I &apos;m not going to convinced you all about this thing .
But the question I would like to take is -- why don &apos;t I mean ?
Why don &apos;t I think that way ?
Because it &apos;s more more than every other thing that has ever heard to explain the exhert experts of creative process .
A process that , as anything that has ever ever ever ever ever ever ever done , it &apos;s all , here , you know , you know , you know , you don &apos;t have to be .
And in fact , you can look at the best time .
I did this meet with the recently poeter , I did this was in Ruth Stone , but he was now 90 years , but it was a few years , and he said that he was a few time in the campaign Virginia , working out in the wall , and he was going to watch the cethy , and he was going to expect the exactly wondering .
He said that he was like a train of air .
And that was coming back to the laws from the country .
It was going to feel , because he was going to be a little bit under his piece .
He had to have a solar thing to do that point , and he was , words , &quot; words , how a mathy . &quot;
And so it turns out the home and was sitting from this poetry , and it wouldn &apos;t take a piece of cars and a mathers in a fast faster , as the traper , they would get the page .
And sometimes I couldn &apos;t be fast faster , so correef and corrups , and the spread and the spread and the lost of the home and the lost , and it would continued to go through through the countries , and he said , &quot; Woman , and he said , &quot; Where , and he said , &quot; World , and it &apos;s going to go back to the other planet . &quot;
Then there were the times -- this piece of the time , I &apos;m going to be -- there were the moments that was going to almost perdent , right ?
So , he was cording to home and was trying to the paper and the poetry through , and he was going to get a mathor that was going to go , and then he said , that was like , and then he said , that was like that he was like the other hand and the across the other hand , the lacross the other hand the across the hand , he was like the other hand the lacy .
And he was the poetry of the cover and the brow up in his body and the spent was going to pay .
And in these cases , the poetry would be presented on the page and intately , but the last word on the last word .
So when I heard the thought -- it &apos;s a couple , it &apos;s exactly initive to my creative process .
I don &apos;t all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conducture .
I &apos;m a move , and my way to work is ; I &apos;m saying , and I &apos;m saying to the same and then you go back to the same .
But even in my hand , in my test , I &apos;ve got a strip , I met that , sometimes .
And I can imagine that many of you have the han fact .
You know , even though the work and the ideas I was date to a certain in the set of the fourth of the fact .
Is this is this thing ?
And how can we relationship us to do that it doesn &apos;t make us to do it , but the floor , what do you do you get ?
So , as I look at the best example , the best example of the Tom Waits , which I &apos;ve been different interview of the nal day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most most ordered the artist of the artist of the artist of the artist of the artist , to try to control , to try to control these species of creative creative interizes .
But then I said , I said , you know , and a day as he was dried on a Los Angeles , changed all the time to him .
He was going to go to the sent and all of the sent , this little bit of melodia , which is going to be in his head , elusive and the leting , elusive , and the leting , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the desident , and the desident .
It doesn &apos;t have a piece of cards , it doesn &apos;t have a bad regier .
So , he started to feel this species of old old , he &apos;s growth , &quot; the guy to perfect , and he remarried by this dog , and he remember .
I &apos;m not good enough and I don &apos;t know . &quot;
And instead of wondering , he stop .
I &apos;ll get the mental process , and it &apos;s something new .
And he just just just the cielo and said , &quot; Scuses , &quot; Scuses , I &apos;m not going to be drive ? &quot;
&quot; You know , you know , you know , you know ?
If you really want to be a more than you have a better moment when I can take me care .
And you &apos;re going to get something else today .
You went to disturbing Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his process , I work after this .
I don &apos;t work , the work was still hard as well as well .
But the process , and the weight , that the ansia was reef when the genius , the genius that was going to use that he had nothing else to the other problems and wonder , I &apos;m going to go back to the back , and they did that not be an interiorizing thing to be an interiorizing .
But he was a wonderful , wonderful saves a conversation of the Tom and this thing that was not Tom and this thing that was not Tom .
So as I feel that story to change a little bit the way I was working , and I &apos;ve already got a time .
This idea , I save me when I was writing , I was , Pra , &quot; and I said , &quot; I &apos;m going to have in a one of those climb , we all have when we &apos;re working on something that we &apos;re going to think that it &apos;s going to think that it &apos;s going to be a little bit , which is going to be the worst the right right right .
Not only , the book , the book .
And I started thinking about to think about this project .
But then I remember I went to the air and I tried to try .
So I went to my face in the host , and I read my host and I got my hand , my hand .
And I said to the high , &quot; Sends , what &apos;s going to be going to be not interested in my own , not interested in my own , no drive , no drive , no dright-ward , no longer , I &apos;m going to be in my watching , &quot; Senly , I &apos;m going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the book is not interinternal .
Because as I see , I put us all that I &apos;ve got , I don &apos;t have this .
So if you want you to know , you &apos;re going to be , you &apos;re going to do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do you , you know what I don &apos;t have full .
I &apos;ll start to write the same same because I &apos;m my work .
And I &apos;d like to favor that I was regiven to do my part , &quot; because I was , so , I &apos;m going to end , OK , OK , in the North people who were going to get the North people were going to get to the wondering , and the walls that was going to go to the along and the allowed to the hours .
And they were always magnific , because the balleres were professionists and they were fantastic .
But every long , again , something happened , it &apos;s going to be actually actually transfer , and one of these artists .
And I know you know what you know , because I know you have view all , in a point , a performance .
It was like the time , you know , and the ballery wind , and it was not doing a species , and it was not doing anything in the sunlight , like 1,000 night before , it &apos;s all all the time .
And in the improvide , not apparent as a human human .
But you access to the dinner and south in the fire of the divinity .
And when this happened , I went , the tempes , the people knew what was called the name .
They were the hands and , they were starting to song , &quot; Allah , Allah , God , God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curiosa storysical stories -- when Morn invasero the Spain , I was this abababababababababababababababababitute , Allah , Allah , &quot; Okay , &quot; the words , &quot; Oole , &quot; the words , &quot; which you can feel in the floor in the flowing or in the floor in the floor .
In Spain , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , the sun , I &apos;m saying , &quot; I saying , &quot; I reat the time , I remember , a scorm of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need .
But , the problem is the day , after the day , the same , when you sweek and wrong and wrong , I write that &apos;s 11 of the morning of the Martedge , there &apos;s no more .
It &apos;s just a death death with the ginoccury , and maybe never going to get more to hand to be never going to get to the altheist .
And maybe no one will be the name of the name of the wonderful , and what do with his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most poorous re-floor to do in a creative life .
But maybe not to be so angerous if you can &apos;t believe , if you can &apos;t believe , the most extraordinary , which is extraordinary to be from you &apos;re going to be from you .
But crete you just think you &apos;re just going to be in a imaginable ination of this squish , you know , you have to go to what you have to go to the other when you &apos;re going to go to the other when you &apos;ve got to go .
And you know , if we think about this way , this way , we know ,
And so I started thinking , and it &apos;s sure as I thought about how I &apos;ve thought for different months in the book that publishing , I &apos;m going to get , the performance I &apos;m going to be a lot of my great great successful , very , very , very successful ,
And that I have to continue to say when I feel electric , I don &apos;t have a couple .
You don &apos;t get the arts . It just your work .
It &apos;s going to represented to your part , whatever , any part of it , any position .
If your work is balling , you know .
If the divine , I &apos;m sure to you get a few days of a wonder , to a few kind of wonderful , for a moment , you know , then you know , &quot; Ol the right now . &quot;
Some , you know , you know , you know , your dance .
And &quot; Ole the same . &quot;
I think , and I think you have to teach it .
&quot; You know , you know , the same , only for the same , just for the human hours and test tals that you can represents .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : The thing .
You know , I &apos;ve been talked about some of these projects on the genome , what can means and the discovery of the genes .
Now we &apos;re starting a new percoral , we &apos;re began to digitalize biology and now to talk about that code from that code we &apos;re going to get in a new biology , design and synthesize , design and we &apos;re going to get life .
We always tries to bring great questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot;
We tried different approach , we have to get the minimes .
We &apos;re dealing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the genome of human genome , we were going to get the world of the world of the computer world .
Now , we can regenerate life , or create life , or create new life , or create this universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycopm , the Mycopm , which is the kind of smaller than the genome of the smaller of the laboratory .
And we tried to reduce the genome for creating a lot more smaller .
We &apos;re able to eliminate a hundred of the genes of about 500 that are here .
But when we have a hundred of his maps , it &apos;s relatively simple answer to our .
I remember , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it &apos;s very impossible that this can bring a cell .
So , we decided that the only to design for required to synthesize this craft in way to make components to bring the components to bring some of these questions .
And so we started the Possh of the Poss , we &apos;ve been able to synthesize a ? &quot;
And that chemical chemical to make these great molecule molecule that we never do before do before ?
And in case , in fact , we can do it a crazy cuma ?
A cump is just a piece of a chimic material .
The speed with we &apos;re able to digitalize life is growing up to the next exponential .
Our capacity of wrong the genetic code , instead , but it &apos;s the best , but it &apos;s the best , but it &apos;s getting better .
And our most recently records the brought to a craft .
We started more 15 years ago .
The process has required many pass , began with a revision revision before we start with a revision before the first experiments .
But we found that synthesize that we have been hard to be hard .
There are deces of thousands of best machine , the world that produces are all the world that produces of 30 to 50 letters and it &apos;s a degenerative process , the most rors is a long segment , more rors .
So we had to develop a new metoxes to assembling these framments and corread the herrors .
And this was our first tentative , to talk about the first tental information of the genome of Phi , 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus who kill killed .
We have designed the framments , effectively the reaction of the errors and a molecule of DNA about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of the chemical material , and we have inserious in the batteries , the batteries , they started to read this code code and producing this code code , and producing the particles .
The particles are viral , you know , you &apos;re going to get back and they &apos;re going back back and they destroy destroy the E.
I talked about recent with members of the industry of the oil industry of the oil industry .
They rex more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build his same way to be buildware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the most big things in big .
We wanted to build the craft of the battery of the battery .
They &apos;re more than 580 mmyself .
So we thought about build the size of virus , so that we could change the casses of viruses , so it could change what the components of a living casses a cell of a living .
The program is crazy , and if we start with digital information in a computer , they have to be very accurate .
When we sequency this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accuratean herror every 10 mile .
We found , resequency , 30 errors . If we had the first sequence that sequence doesn &apos;t be able to do that .
One part of the process is designing to the 50 letters that we have to get the next 50 letters of 50 letters of 50 letters and work with all the little bit of the smaller and work together .
We see elements here .
You &apos;ve probably got the lad that we &apos;re going to think we &apos;re going to get the challenges .
Think about this : We have a genetic genetics , we have a genetic code , and T.
Three those letters of the letters about 20 ammers , and there &apos;s a specific order to every ammmmine for every ammmmmmyself .
So we can use the genety to write words , framed , sounds .
What we &apos;ve done is to the beginning was authography .
Some were been been been been been been been a few expectry .
We have designed these segments for the simply simply to get it with the entire .
There are the entire things that they reparts and put them .
And we started to assembling , we started with segments from five to five to seven mile , until the unlead of 24 ments , smart lliterally , to get 72 mile lectable .
every step we &apos;ve product these segments in the watching , so we &apos;re going to make them to create a process that we &apos;re going to create a robustobustot -- how you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to authomatizing the process .
So , this seem to the tabellone of a bunch of the basket .
When you go to these segments very long , more than 100 mimile , more than 100 middle , not growth in Ecoli .
You get to the limite of the modern modern modern biology .
So we &apos;ve looked at other meccanism .
We were another mecchanism called the bination called bination , which biology is going to use the DNA degrees to repartners .
Here &apos;s a bunch .
This organism , called Deinoccurs , it can be aborbirth three rds of rad rad .
You can see in the resquare required as his chromosoma was going to be destroy .
In 12 , 24 hours is reassembled as before .
There &apos;s thousands of organisms that are able to do this .
These organisms can be completely completely .
They can live under the hundred .
They &apos;re absolutely sure that life in space , and you can find new environment of water .
ASA , NASA shows that this is .
This is a molecule that we have built these process , just using these process , just using the evidence with the design of the design of the segments from insert .
The lievidence , the floor .
This picture was not taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a lot of course we can see it with a microscope that we can see with a microscope .
These are picked that a period of about six seconds .
This is the publishment we &apos;ve done a long time ago .
They &apos;re more than 50,000 letters of code code .
It &apos;s the most great molecule of a degrees , created by the man .
It &apos;s a lot of a lot of a lot of a 300 million .
If we &apos;re going to get it with a career , you would like 142 page , they would like to get this code .
Now , how do we do it ?
Of course , a virus is a virus is a little girl .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when they use batteries .
It &apos;s a simple , when it &apos;s a cell of cells as a cell of our , and you can just just extract the nuclear , and you can inserious , which is pratically a bit of clonely remarkable process .
In the battery , the cell cell is invent integrated in the cells , but we &apos;ve recently showed that we &apos;re able to do a trapior a cell of a named by a cell of a cell of a cell of a cell of the other activity of the other activity of the other activity and activity .
We have a ballowed a microbial kind of microbial species .
two are different than two are different men .
We have added some gene in a way , we have to decide what to get to the craft to this craft .
The scientist , then with the scientist with the entire way to kill all the protein .
And when we put in the cells was studies , it &apos;s studies our graph , we &apos;re going to get the cell physical chromosoma .
And I was thinking we couldn &apos;t go over , but we &apos;ve tried to be , but we tried to get more luck in there .
This is one of the most mecchanisms of evolution .
We found that that ansix-species species have added a third or a third of a few part , addded in a second best of new one one one one one one one of the species of the species of this kind of species .
So who think about evolution as a gene at the time you have not understand graph .
There &apos;s the scientist called me , the entire entire entire that advertising the DNA .
The craft that was in the cells is in the cell .
The cellphone of cell , we have a lot of homosoma has .
It &apos;s expressed , and it &apos;s recognize the other car as material , and it &apos;s got , he masticed , and we &apos;re realized with just cells and the new cell .
It &apos;s become blue , because of the genes we have inseriously .
And in a short , all the time , all the carbon a species , and it &apos;s transformed in a new kind of a new kind of floor , based on the new software that we in the cells .
All the protein are changed , the members are changing , and when we laws the genety of what we have transfer .
Now , this may seemy seemy , but altering the genetics of genetics , we can change things in hyse .
Now , I &apos;ve got explained that here is not talking about gence -- but I &apos;ve said , in the fact that , in evolution , and I said that we &apos;re going to create a new version of the expected of the expected of the screen that will be a new special process .
Why do this ?
I think it &apos;s enough when we think about our need to think about our need .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion and a half people in the next 40 years .
Right for a example : I &apos;m born in 1946 .
Now , there are three people on the planet for the planet for the planet for the planet for 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re going to find out now now now , fresh , water , fresh and pulital , and the winal winals for six billion people .
It &apos;s going to be more drive to do it for nine .
We &apos;re going to site billion billion carbon , more than 30 billion blood .
It means millions of barili to the day .
When we try to find biological process , or any kind of biological process to repieces , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenges .
We have to have to consumer the emission of CO2 from these materials that finds in the atmosphere .
Al day today , thank you , thank you , in the scientific world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that they &apos;re designed to the future .
The industry is possible to be possible to just a dozen dozen , and think about the different things are coming out .
Our limites here are the biological data from the biological imation .
Now , we have the technique , thank you , thank you very much synthesize , we &apos;re able to create what we call genome .
We &apos;re able to build a lot of robot , that can product a million craft to the day .
Think about this 20 million different different different different different different different different different different ways , or to make the process to make a lot of the process , we can change , the new vaccines , we can change , you change , and we create a little biology , and we create a lot of biology , and create a lot of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can chemical to possibility of survival , production , production , production , production of vaccines , production of vaccines .
This is an anea of some software , we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how we need to be .
We know , we know , it &apos;s their genetic code .
Now we &apos;re focus with the carbons of generation .
You see you who extract that you extract from the grandmother was a mal experiment .
We have carbons of second and third generation that will be represents in the hundred of the high high high floor as the floor of bananle .
But the only way the only way the biology can have a big impact without the hard of food , and limiting the food of food , it would be transforming the cell of the CO2 , before we &apos;re working on the building , to design this screen , and we &apos;re going to get this scale , and we can get this scale , and we &apos;re just just just just just just just in about 18 months .
The solar solar solar with CO2 is a dog -- but in our downnlows in all the world , we found different metohes .
This is a organism we have described in 1996 .
You see in the deep deep , about 2500 feet of the hydropped to the time of the water .
They put from CO2 using the CO2 using a lot of energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can indog CO2 , which can be transported to be transported on your bi , convertising that CO2 in carbon , to drive this process .
So we think we can think we can be able to be able to aumenting what the question is , &quot; which is the question of &quot; that is the Not , we have the modest of the moon the floor , we have the modest industry .
You can &apos;t do it . If you can &apos;t do it at TED , where you can ?
It was going to be a main the energy of energy .
And we &apos;re working on the same way to use the same metods to create vaccines .
You see this year with influence , we &apos;re always going to get a year and with a dollar in when it &apos;s a year ,
I think what you can change change is buildings in the anticipable in anticipate .
Here &apos;s how the future could start to change , it &apos;s the tree , the tree , in evolution with the evolution with batteries , I could be a battery , and finally , I could actually get the synthree-euck .
We &apos;re so that we &apos;re going to get people .
Our boat is to make it . We &apos;re going to live enough to try to try to make it . Thank you very much .
I &apos;ll do all you &apos;ll see , the most idly possible , some of the new technology that we &apos;ve got to the Microsoft in the Microsoft in a year ago , a year ago , this is Seadon .
It &apos;s a environment that you can interact in the local level that remodel with a huge amount of data .
Here we &apos;re seeing a lot of myself , a lot of picture with a kind of several zoom , and continue , for a speak , and it &apos;s a saying , the images like we want .
And not import how big the amount of information that we see , how much these are great colleagues .
Most of the photograph , I &apos;m communicate , but this example is a scanning of the Congress , and reentrepreneurs in the Congress , and reentrepreneur in 300 gapiel .
It doesn &apos;t make a difference because the only thing that limits the presents of a system like this is the number of the pxel on your school . It &apos;s also an architecture . It &apos;s also an architecture .
This is a book , not images .
This is Casolate Casolate of Dickens . Every colonna represents a capitable capital .
So , to show you that it &apos;s just about head and not images , we can do a kind of thing , to see that it &apos;s really a real representation of the head , not a picture of the head , not a picture of a picture .
It could be a way a little bit artificial way to read a book .
You don &apos;t look at the beautiful .
This is a most realistic example . It &apos;s a number of a number of the Guardian .
Every big imagine is the beginning of a seat .
And it really , it really the pleasure and beautiful experience of a revision of a revist , or a lot of a lot of a lot of medicate a lot of a method of a measure of a measure of a method .
We have done something with the angle of this particular number in particular numbers of this particular number .
We have created a published public public solutions -- very much more than that uses usually , in a normal published the containserious extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra .
If you want to see the caristic caristic of this authomobile , you can see here .
Or other model , or even three-techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that means to put the end of the population and other downneries , not have to be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the obvious applications of the obvious applications of technology .
And I don &apos;t want to say , if you don &apos;t want to say that we have contributed by this camp .
These are all the room in the USA Sovrapposes to a picture of NASA .
So now we &apos;re now now now we &apos;re going to do anything .
This is actually actually , from the web ; you can go to the web .
It &apos;s a project called Photynth Photyth , which two different technologies .
A is Seady and the other is a research research in Noah Snavah Snavely , a student of the University of the U.S.
And it &apos;s from the web , I got from Seady .
You can see it when we do this kind of paper , where we can go from a picture of the other one and have this kind of experience , and have this kind of experience .
But the space of space here has actually a meaning , a meaning .
The horitms of the computer record of the computer have records these images , so that corresponds to the place that records in the hands of the records in the middle , all the brows , the neighborhood , the Montontants of the elements of the elements of the elements of the elements of the elements of the elements of the elements of the room .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you a few other environment .
And there &apos;s some more space .
I want to go to one of the original data , in Noahahahahaws , and this is a precedent prototype of Photyth , we &apos;ve got to work for the first time , we &apos;ve got to work for the first time , I &apos;m really really really really killed to the technology , in the technology , in the watching technology , we don &apos;t really need to be watching .
We had to worry about the lab and so on the laws .
This is a rebuildings of Noththers of Nothers from Flickr . Bast &apos;s digitch . In the Flickr , and you get you can imagine . And you can imagine , and you get . Olay . Olay one of these fields of these fields of these are going to discovery this model .
So I have all images from Flickr and they &apos;re all all colleagues in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to this way we can actually be able .
You know , I wouldn &apos;t think about Microsoft .
It &apos;s very grative , it &apos;s very grative .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of different kinds of different kinds of the cellulararly , a number of the SLR , a number of the SLR , a number of the environment .
And if you reesize , I &apos;m trying to try to look at those most strange .
Many are block , you know , it &apos;s a lot of the block .
Some of a few photograph here , a series of photograph -- it &apos;s a lot of photograph ,
This is a poster of Nothers Drame recorrectly .
We can go from the poster of this physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social social . This is actually actually actually , from the data from the hundred of how to appear the point , from the point of view -- and colleagues , and colleagues .
All those pictures become colleagues , most hours of the parts .
You have a model of the interested in the earth .
Think about this as a prolder of Stephen Lawler on the Earth .
It &apos;s something that growth in complexity , they &apos;re going to use it , and the vantages that people are usual to use use use .
Their picture are high with metaders from other people .
If someone is the idea of contrast all these saying , these saying , my named , my picture of Nothank three Dimproved , I can get cattle and all those data , and I can use it , and I can use how to get a point of the data , in that space , in that universe , in that universe , and you have a choses of the chroses of the choses of the hosses of the choses of the ches of the choses of the ches of the universe .
Of course , a connection of all of this virtual model , the obvious elaborate of every interesting part of the tern world , you don &apos;t even vistation and images and images and images and images , the hatellysmiles , but from the collective of the collective .
Mille thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What &apos;s going to be able ? What your software going to do is that , in a certain , all the next years , all the next years , all the world , all the world will be practs of the world will be prices together together ?
BM : Yes . That &apos;s doing it .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , you want , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the base of the images .
The thing is really interesting if you think about if you think about the rechef of the obvious information that many of these images .
As when you make a picture of images on the web , you know , it &apos;s a basic and the head on the picture of the picture .
Now , what if you have the picture of your picture ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of recheeness and the quantity of recheeens that &apos;s really huge .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible .
BM : You know , you know , very much .
One of the major of the major of the major of the research and the research is the power of the mainly living who don &apos;t have the vast of the traditions , the drawings , the soul of the plants , the touch of the plants , the drights of the floor .
Basters thinking that American Juar , Juar , the Via Lattea , or who are still still still in the ancial ancious , or who are still still convenious meaning , or in Himalaya , or remember of the most of Dharm , to remember , and the idea of the most important world that the idea that the idea that the idea that we are not in the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that the world &apos;s just just just just just , and that &apos;s not just a sense of the world ,
the conset of a particular set of scels that our stirirl has done , or a lot of generations , a lot of generations ago .
And of course , all we &apos;re going to share the essential .
We all all all nasks . We &apos;re all procreating .
We &apos;re saying , the beginning of the beginning .
We have to do it in the death inesority of death , so we don &apos;t have to be source and we &apos;re going to go and --
We have a lot of art .
What column is the ritm is the threm of the dog , the run of every culture .
Not me think they &apos;re the Thinforest of the Borneo , or the Woodoo of Haiti , or the Wooks , or the World World Wenya , or the Candero , the Candero of Ands , Candero &apos;s the Candero of the Sahara .
He was my company in the desert of the journers in the desert of the hyak of the hyak of the Everest , the Everest , the Everest , the Everest , the demonstrate in the world .
All these populations are teachers that there are other ways of the ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking ,
And if you reflected a bad , it &apos;s a kind of thing that can give you hope .
And the mirid of cultures of the creating world creating a hydral house , and cultural cultural that the planet and it &apos;s important to be the planet , as the young biological night .
And you can think about this high cultural as a nosphere , and you can see the nosphere , all the nospital , all , the whole thing , you know , all , the ideas , ideas , ideas , intuitive , intuitive bunch of the bad of the ballowed human ination .
The nosphere is the fantastic bunch of human human anity .
It &apos;s the symbaby of what we are and what we can be in the kind of inquickly .
And because the biosphere was really consumed to the nosphere is the success , and purther was very much more rapidly reidly .
Not a biologist , for example , it would die , it would be a little bit about the object of the object is , because it &apos;s floor , in the most apocalong , in the most apocalong , in the different biological across the different countries -- and you don &apos;t have to the most of the floor of the horest countries .
The authority of all is , obviously , the linguistic linguistic .
When you &apos;re noved 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just a vocket from a series of a gramazing rules .
A language is the sprake of the spirit .
It &apos;s the measure with the animal of every culture , it &apos;s the world .
Every language is a forest , a bind , a sound , a sunder , a sunder possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re seat Monterey , at the Monterey , it &apos;s not more sususes in the orechie of children .
They don &apos;t get the children , the children , the people who want to say , not the other people who don &apos;t have something , they &apos;re death .
What &apos;s more trists of the being in the silar , is the last one , of the slends , of the watching , not way to get the watching gegegeess or anticipate the promise of the figure of the fire ?
This is saying , it was a few weeks in a few weeks : every two weeks , a weeks a basic brow and the door and a baby labe of a labor language .
And I know that somebody you say , &quot; Is it &apos;s not better ?
The world would not be a best place if we &apos;re talking about the same language ? &quot; Benish , then we all talk about the yoruba .
We &apos;re going to do .
You &apos;ll be a tract thing about a tract thing to say , not to talk about their language .
I like to do a journey through the nosphere through the nosphere ,
a little bit of the nosphere for you a hundred of what we &apos;re losing .
Most of us dimental dimentation that when I say , &quot; different ways of exists .
We take for example this bimbmb , in Amazonia , in Amazonia , the population of the anacony , who creating the midddle of the latest west makes a hundred of the spend of the spends .
It &apos;s a population that &apos;s not able to distinguish the blue of the blue because the best cell because the forest , the forest , that &apos;s the population , where the population .
They have a strange language and a mathree-mathird , &quot; exactly , &quot; exactly , &quot; you have to get a person who parparpark a different person who park a different language .
All this has radical radical , in the pasitself , in the past of the country that are in these family , in the last family , or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven or s
They get limited to the hand then they start to talk .
We take one of the most interesting tribes with that I lived , the Waoran Ecuador of Ecuador , a population , a population that has had the first contatts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionary , they have been a connecting contact a fact .
They did come from the high halt , they get them in pose , and they were going to come out of the pluge , they were going to have never seen the forest of the forest , they never seen the nice of the six .
They have the terms of the terms , they &apos;re going to take a shape or a shape , and they &apos;re not going to find nothing , they have conclosed the dile , and they knew , and they knew , they &apos;re going to kill the slance .
But Woran don &apos;t kill the stranip .
They knew between them .
54 percent of the death was caused by their same .
We &apos;re rising at the generations and we found two cases of death , and when we insisted to know , they have been invected to know , they have been invected , and then they said , that it &apos;s death , and then they were able to the same .
The horbers were able to recognize the animal of 40 step , and remarkable to reach the species .
In the first years , I was asked to me , I was a really interesting really when my professor in Harvard of Harvard , if I wanted to go to Haiti , and I was saying in Haiti , and the power of Dualier , and I was a lot of Dualier and Tontontal and Tontontation of the Romomombies , and I was made of the bombs .
For a sense of myraculous , I should have to understand the Choun Vodoun and the Voodoo is not magnera .
It &apos;s a very good complex of a complex physics of the world .
I &apos;m interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the big big religions of the world , what you would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddddram , Ebraism ,
A continent is always left out , thinking that Africa is always going to be religious feels . And instead . And instead of these religious religious , it &apos;s not another distilled of these religious religious religious des .
What makes interesting interesting is the woodoo is the report of life and death .
So the vision they &apos;re going to get the spirits .
And the spirits can be invoccurred from Grande Aqua , they said to the back of the dance and stage , they &apos;re going to be in the same way to the anima short that we &apos;ll be the sheat .
So this voodooists , you know , &quot; You go to the who go to to talk about God .
And we go in the temple and we become a lot of God . &quot;
And the moment you &apos;re positself , is the spirit that you can you do that , how can you do you do that ?
So , you know , these incredibly incredible : followed the voodoo in a state of trance , the hundreds of the power of the power of the power of the body in a street , when it &apos;s flowed in a time , in a lot of extremendous extremendous in a time .
You all the population with the people who I lived the most extraordinary most extraordinary people in Santa Marta , in Colombia , in Colombia , in Colombia , in the Colombia .
You know , the ancivilization that has living on the planet &apos;s crazation of Colombia in acespecially expect , the population , the population of the crazy vulate that &apos;s going to get the crazy of the carbon the planture of the carbon the planet planture .
In a continent , in a sance , this population was never conquicted by the spagners .
And yet today &apos;s today , they &apos;re government by a close , but their formation is decided .
The young people who are brought to the family and three or four years , and they live in a good world , and they live in a good world , and bombs in a bombs in the bombs and the brows to 18 years .
Two periods of nine countries to reproduce the nine months of gestation that they turn into the wind of the My , now is metaphor , now are metaphor , the lots of Granks .
So , this time , they &apos;re acculate values of their society , values that their predict and just their precise , they &apos;re going to get the equipment -- or for the best equilished .
Al termine , in this incredible initiation , they &apos;re going to get out and the first time in their life , in their age age age age , you see a horem . And in that actim of the first bor , when the sold bor , the bor , the bor , all of the beautiful , all the beautiful , all of the favorite . The way of the prefer and says , the right . The best thing . The best best bor of the forth th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th and says ,
&quot; I said , &quot; I said , I said .
It &apos;s study . Now , it &apos;s study you to protect it . &quot;
They call them frackers and say that we say that we , the brothers , we are the best of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the populations and the environment , and we invochieve and the old story of the noble story of the noble story , which is a named concept in his simplicity or magic , and we say that these populations are more close to the Earth of us .
The population of the Indidiges are not indebolital from nostales .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the paluge of the Arab in in in the wall of the Tibet , but the time , they created a mistic mystics of the Earth , they created a mistic of the Earth , they created a lot of intuition , the most classic healthy , the floor of the most slies of the Earth is because it &apos;s living .
What does it mean ?
He mean , a guy of the Ands of the Ands who grow up with the montages that &apos;s a spirit of the Apu that will be a founded to be a foundly different . And it will be a foundly founded to the montor of the Montan &apos;s going to be a little girl that grow up in the Montana &apos;s a little bit of the Monce of rocer , and it &apos;s a scale of a bandle ,
That &apos;s the dimour is a ball of a heral mineral cat is irrifly .
What &apos;s interesting is interesting is the metaphor that &apos;s the report between the individual world .
I grew in the forest in the forest of Columbia , creating that the forest to be ced to be cut for being cut .
And he &apos;s got a human being being different from my friends Kwakiutl , who creating that the forest , the dimour dimour dimmmour of Hukukuk and the spirits of the writing , the horrights of the world , exploded me that the explored Hukukuk , the beritisism of Hukukukuk .
If you start looking at that these cultures can actually actually actually , it &apos;s different , you can start to understand some of them , you can start to understand some of them .
I went to this picture in Amazony in Amazony .
I &apos;m going to have heard about the eye of the eye , the most powerful psychoad of the repertent .
What makes a fascinating the ehuash is not the potential could make it the stage of the stage , but his elaboration .
She &apos;s a late , this lian old old boline that &apos;s a series of hubols , hols , literally hallucinogue .
Pring the sold brow a blud bubbluher that alterms a little bit of the car , but it &apos;s myself with the broken of the family of the books of the books .
This is a little bit of triptams , very similar to the serotonine , direcyltryptamines , mexylthoxylththoxylddribs .
If you ever see the Yanomami , you &apos;ll see the Yanomami , they do a different set of species , it &apos;s contissue , it &apos;s contained methoxyllymtamptmount .
Tirst that polar to the naso is a little bit like it &apos;s a little bit like a fire of paper , and you can get on a myself to a mine myself .
I had often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , man who wrote the was psychcheered , with his discovered , with his discovered , with his discovered in Mexico .
Second my countries can &apos;t classifly these triptames like hallucinogens because if you can &apos;t tell anyone of being being able to be absolutely .
It &apos;s possible to be able if you &apos;re just sasses with other stanchemical chemical chemical in the MAO .
Now , it &apos;s beautiful : the boline that are in this lian inibitors are inibitors of the Most of the same kind of namine , the question of the most of the most of 80,000 species , like these are going to be in a floor , like these populations , like these populations , as they &apos;re going to be able to make a very dead , but if you believe that &apos;s the slights of the demonstrate ?
We use the great euphemism of the herror , that can reveal and the error ,
But if we ask the Indians , we &apos;ll say , &quot; Worn &apos;t the piece of the Indians , &quot;
What does it mean ?
This tribes , Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahubbad , who are actually netically in the forest , and that you have to get back in the same species .
If we ask them how they say , their tassonomy will tell us , they &apos;re going to say , &quot; I was not going to do that ? &quot; I don &apos;t have to the right ? &quot; I have answer ? &quot;
The solution is : you get 17 variety in a night of a lots of a lone , and each one will be a different different song .
With this doesn &apos;t have lauredded Harvard , but it &apos;s very interesting that contact that contact .
Now , , I know , the problem is that the problem is that the people who have heart the population of us have been horeses , but in some way , in some way , in some way , you get the history of the real history , and the past of the real world , and the pass .
In fact , the century , between 300 years , between 300 years , not going to be remember , but the inovations , but the instead of technological innovations , we &apos;re going to stop , we put it , and we &apos;ve got activity to the forth of the different biological truth and cultural cultural and cultural planet .
All the cultures are coinvolved in a dance for a new possibility of life .
And the problem is not the technology .
Indians Sioux Sioux , they don &apos;t have to be Sioux when they put from the art and so as Americans have no men of American , when they have been part of Americans when they have been in the horse .
It &apos;s not the technology that mind is the integrity of the nosphere . It &apos;s the power .
The wall of the domination .
And if you say one looks like the world , you &apos;ll find that these are not cultures .
They &apos;re creatures and dines out of the existence from existence from the adaptor of adaptment .
And that &apos;s the wall of the wall in the patria .
a population of Sarawak , in the south of Sarawak , a population that has lights in a generation , and now reduced to a generation , and now the next reduced the ress of the resources , where you can see the horse of the best , where you can get the Morry Cinter Morry Cinter Meraaasioner Cinese Morry Carnames , where the World World World ,
You get the stive stive with the stive with the forest .
Or , in the Yanomami , in the Yanomami , are the disease of the same .
If we &apos;re saying about the mountain of the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the political wall of political domination .
As you &apos;ll know the genocide , the physics of a population , is condannect to the universal destruction , the destruction of life , not only is condannect , not only condannect , but addanced , but advertising in the developing world , because it &apos;s part of developing developing the developing of developing developing counts .
And you can &apos;t understand the sosoftware of the Tibet .
I lost the 6,000 miles from Chengineering in Chinese , in the Cina in the Cina , coming to Lhasa jobs , but only only the Lhasa young young , but only only the basic thing is behind the statistics of the statistics that we heard about .
6,000 monuments sacrates in pollen , and centers .
1.2 million people kills to kill the military Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascriting in Panchen Lama .
The thing that wants to say that was killed to the time of invasion .
I guess is figure with Sanity in Sanity in Sanity in the Nepal .
He was mother , and his father was imprisoned and his column was to be remachine .
It was brought to the hundred of two years , and it was sought his gonna because it wouldn &apos;t have to live in him .
The surprise , that has been been mitted in reeducation .
A day has been inaven a day , a day , a hundred of Mao , and for this transgression , was a bunch of the foreign seven years .
The Tibet of the Tibet can be insoppable , but the redenter of the population is from the tenpresent .
Sinally , it &apos;s all reduces a scelen .
We want to live in the world world &apos;s monotony of the monotony or want to happen the world of different different sity of different different sity ?
The great anologa great anologa great anologa , before we said that his large , in our big country was that in our love love to go to this vision of the world , we don &apos;t just see the whole gamma of the imagination of the human imagination , but a day , a day , a day , we &apos;re going to get a day , but we &apos;re going to get a day , but we &apos;re going to be able to hope .
And it &apos;s billion remember that our species is existence for 60,000 years .
The Rivolution Rivolution , which has given us the agriculture , which has done us to be able to combal culture , and sustaining the next poetry , they &apos;re going to take the next to the next to the next 10,000 years ago .
The modern modern world industrialized world .
That &apos;s history not suggests that you don &apos;t read to me to all the challenges that we should have to come in in the millenny to come .
When the myric of cultures of cultures , it &apos;s asked to be human , they want to be human , they &apos;re going to be human hundreds .
And it &apos;s in these answer that we all read the possibility of being what we &apos;re going to be what we &apos;re going to be , which we all have the people who all popules and all the people are all the people and all the people are great moments of the beyond moments of the beautiful moments .
I went to this picture on the north of the north of Baffin , when I went to the high of the balene with Inuit , and this man , and this man , he said , I said , &quot; I told me the wonderful story of his non-history .
The government government was not gentile with the Inuit , and in the 1950 to stay our premonths , we have them rinky , we have rined in colonies .
The nonone of this man is going to go to go .
The family , I &apos;m going to take his life , I &apos;ll bring all the arms , and you all the touch .
You know that Inuit doesn &apos;t know the cold , they don &apos;t know .
The brows of the origins were actually made of fish , in the basic paces .
The nonone of this man doesn &apos;t have a basic mythic , or the blizens , or the blizoes that he was going to flowed .
It &apos;s sweek , it &apos;s climbs , you know , it &apos;s craft in and defocus in their hand . When the focus . When you get a lama .
He was spriced on the wall of this cold of this college and when he came up , and when he came up , he knew a dog .
Ha school , the dog and created a banker , with the casses , he created a sliter , has improved another cane , and it &apos;s saying on the banches , column of the cassrock .
We want to talk about the havarsela ?
In the 1999 , 1999 , the government has redded by Inuit &apos;s the room of a territorary area of a territorary area of California and Texas the mas I got together .
It &apos;s their new patria . It &apos;s called Nunavoid .
It &apos;s a territorary territorary . Controlate all the resources .
One spowerful example of how a national national national national , it &apos;s going to reach with his population .
And , in finish , I think it &apos;s a obvious hydrink , I think that &apos;s been in these zone , makes not remote .
For somebody is home .
They represented the human imagination that they &apos;re rising at the time . And for all these children , the source of these children , as the source of our children , become part of the hope , they become part of the hope .
For finish , we &apos;re in National Geographic , we &apos;re not going to be able to null nor never .
We believe that the polements --
&#91; &#91; Asive , they don &apos;t have hopefully , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the best institution to tell stories of the world . Oray our sive remember 35 million living .
156 countries , they turn our television .
Our revists are leven millions of people .
Our work is to travel in the nosfer to bring our public in the audience of wonderful cultural , and they &apos;re going to get out of how they &apos;ve seen , and you know , they &apos;re going to get a focus in the focus in the different different ways , and we have to find a floor , and we have to find a lot of life , and we have to find a horge world and murgymyself and muraltical world , and the muralong of the world , and we have to find a central world of the world &apos;s muralloyming world in a
And that the gegezzero-sum people can contributing to our well-being collective .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things I write in this book that I hope to say that anything you &apos;ve heard and I &apos;ll come to evidence some colleagues , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact ,
I want to start with what I call &quot; the dogm . &quot;
The dogm is official of what ?
The dogm of all the society of all the society of the West World Cfficial climbs . &quot; If we want to myzy the wall of our citizens &quot; to do it is to be able to be horderly the individual liberation . &quot;
The reason is , from a late , in fact that the liberation is in the same one , is predict , it &apos;s full for human beings .
At the other one is in fact that if we &apos;re lights , each one of us can agate to do all that that &apos;s going to do all that that &apos;s not no one that decided in named named to our wall .
The way to myze the liberation is to myzing the choice .
You know , the people have , more lightly libest , and most liberty , most hours is their well-being .
This , ritain , it &apos;s so deep , it &apos;s so deeply radicted in society that nobody would be able to doubt it .
And it &apos;s also deep in our lives .
I &apos;ll show you some examples of what the progress has possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I hope a simple notes a simple notes for injuments .
In my supermarket , there are 175 condents , without context of the holion of the holion , and 12 acetes that you can buy to make a number of huge condents that you can make a number of condents in the reshost that any of 175 percent of your demonstration .
Here &apos;s the supermarket .
Then you go to the neighbors to buy a sterean : if you , you know , CD , radio , radio , floor , floor , floor ,
And in this single neighbors , there &apos;s a big number of components .
We can actually realize six million different combinations of different combinations that there are in a neighborhood .
You have to put out there is a lot of a scelen .
Some camps : the world of the communications .
Another , when I was a child , they could get all the serve phone , they could get all the bad of the bad , who were fornes from the Bell .
It was named the phone , not to buy the phone , it was not going to be .
A consequence of what , was the phone , was not going to be pushed .
These though throw .
We have a variety variety of phone , specially between cellularly .
Here &apos;s the cellulararly .
My preferred is what in the middle , MP3 , MP3 , and forts , forts to the cle cle of the cle cle .
If you don &apos;t even have seen in the negote , you &apos;re not seen in the house , you &apos;re going to take .
And what the end is that people in the nearly people in the nearly and does this question is the answer ?
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cellphone that doesn &apos;t do too much things .
So , in other expect of life that are very much more important than the purpose , you know , the same plosion .
Assistence : You know , it doesn &apos;t happen in the United States that you &apos;re going to get the doctor , what you do .
Instead , you know , you know , and the doctor , you know , &quot; Okay , we could do it , &quot; At has these walked and the answer . &quot;
You say , &quot; Dr. &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; An these weches and these risks , and the risks . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebrow , &quot; Dr. You know , what would you do ?
And the doctor : I &apos;m not lead . &quot;
The result we call it authonomy of disease , &quot; expression that it seem to be beautiful thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not that one spost-site and responsibility of decisions to do something , or that &apos;s the doctor , whether it &apos;s not about -- and it &apos;s not about -- and it &apos;s not direction is the patient of the often , and so it &apos;s not the patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing products of products , directly , and you know , you know , and you , that if you think that &apos;s not going to buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why are they published ?
The answer is that they want to be that we call the doctor for the craft to change us .
That &apos;s what the fundamental identity as it is our horest is a question of scol , as you see in this jobs . &quot; We don &apos;t want to go to the children . &quot; We don &apos;t want to go to the right now now . &quot;
And we can reinvented us to get us to the way .
The next thing that means that every morning , you &apos;ll have to be able to be .
I just just just just a bit of the family and the mathemselves , a community , a common , and it was that there was that there was that you can get the most possible pressive , and he started to get the most possible pressive .
The only sward was with who , not when , you don &apos;t even when , you don &apos;t even know what I do after .
Egiday , all is really from a lot of the time .
And I &apos;m smart very smart , and I think about 20 percent of work .
And not because they &apos;re not not left , because they don &apos;t even know , because they &apos;re not not not least ften .
because I &apos;m saying , I &apos;m saying , I &apos;m going to ask me , &quot; I would like to do it now ? &quot;
&quot; Do I would have to do I &apos;m going to think about the fire or the career ? &quot;
They &apos;re interrational .
And they &apos;re trying to answer these questions , even though this implant doesn &apos;t completely the company that segment and not get a beautiful voynone .
And they have to do this . I &apos;m questions .
Now , the job : we &apos;re lucky , as Carl spressed , because technology technology we lose every day , every day , every day , from every day , from every day , from the Hotel Randolph .
And I &apos;m talented , there &apos;s a angulous angulous angoline , where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t say that , because I want to use it .
What does , this incredible liberation of scoice that we have to do ?
We can go to see our box to play , with the boat , with the cell , the Blackberry , the Blackberry , and the notebook , on the gyming , on the gocket .
And even though I &apos;m all spends , every minute that we see our children , we &apos;re looking at the partners , we &apos;re looking at this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? I have to put this literally ? &quot;
And even when the answer is no , &quot; Well , this makes the experience of your house , a lot of different than what was was in other conditions .
So , as much of the things we look at all , little things , little objects and the life , the life is a question of scowever .
Once the world was this , there were some possibility , there were some possibility , but it was not a scowever .
The world today &apos;s going to be a thing about this : The dilemma is , or negative , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Shigh .
The lots of things we all know , I &apos;m going to talk about that negative .
All this scop two effects two effects of two effects negative effects .
The first , I &apos;m saying , is that produces produces , is that it &apos;s what liberation .
And many options in the frames that choose , it &apos;s very hard to do it .
I &apos;m offer a meaning example : one study conducted in the foundation .
A college has been access to the data of Vants , the judge of the source of the source of the source of cities in 2000 different company .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that for every 10 solutions that are offered in the most adesished in the crazy of the two percent .
With 50 deep offerts , there &apos;s 10 percent of adesions , when they &apos;re disponable to the site . Why ?
Because 50 deep the basic crazy , it &apos;s directly hard to decide , and the scoen is is remanded to the indomorate .
And in the domories , and again , the domories , domorous , and naturally , you never have been been hundred .
You know that it doesn &apos;t mean that these are going to be easy for canes because they &apos;re not going to be enough money , it &apos;s not enough money , it &apos;s really hosyic that decision is so hosic that it &apos;s really hosic of the work of the dator .
They don &apos;t talk about five , they &apos;re going to five dollars from the dator of the work , which would be watching .
So the paralysis a concern of the hundred .
And I think that &apos;s going to make the world .
&quot; Where for the nity : Wionce : Yet , feels , or mayonth ? &quot;
You would take the right right to take the right right right , if it &apos;s for the eeternity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the sound , and nepurpose the smart of the sound .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can even even if we can get the paralysis , we &apos;re not in the end , we &apos;re not going to be bad with less than we were with less oppositions to the way to be with less of the often .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many of these are condents to the basic bought , if you buy a , and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to make a different scop that &apos;s that it would be better . And that &apos;s that the alternative imagined us that &apos;s that the alternative , and the repiece of the scels , and the slowed of the scels , and the decision , and the decision , and the decision ,
when it was a very good decision .
You know , there &apos;s more than there , there &apos;s more easy than anyone called the option that &apos;s introfloor .
And the three , there &apos;s what economists call the economists called the opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has to really good very well well , as the value that we think about what we &apos;re going to confronties .
And I realized , when there &apos;s many options , it &apos;s easy to represents the purpose of the alternative scartment , and it &apos;s not going to be able to be able .
Here &apos;s a example . I wrong with all those who are not New York .
But it &apos;s what you probably think you are thinking .
There &apos;s this coppia Hamptons .
A place of luses .
It &apos;s wondering . Ottttim day . It &apos;s all for them .
You don &apos;t know . But that he thought is , &quot; Well , he said , &quot; Well , it &apos;s Agost . &quot;
&quot; All my close neighban . &quot;
&quot; I could see that right right right now . &quot;
And then the two weeks , the idea of the idea that it &apos;s led by the idea that &apos;s lost of the idea where it wants to talk about where it wants .
The costs opportunity to diminures the sodfation for that we have been when the choice was , when the choice was except .
And the most are the options that we have to look , more expected , the most expensive accomplishes as an opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
We talk about the moment , and maybe of the time , and maybe of the living .
But the most important point is that anyone thing is that you can &apos;t do the other thing .
The things that we don &apos;t have been activity that we can make less expect what we do .
Terzo : exploites growth of expectation .
I tried on my skin , I tried a new major jeans .
I know , almost always jeans .
And then the jeans were a kind of like a guy , and vest from the best , they were wondering , just after they had to get them a life and worked a lot of times , they were going to go .
So , I went to buy a couple of a couple when the old people who were come , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
The said , &quot; Who wants to me , he wants to me , fit , relaxed and fit ? &quot;
Who wants with the name or with the bottons ? &quot; Stonewashed &quot; or &quot; Monewashed ?
&quot; Who wants to the stream ? &quot;
&quot; Some people want to get the basic ? Bl bl -- &quot; Continually was going to elency .
I was balordit , and after a little bit , and after a little bit , I want the kind of , &quot; I want the only one one one of that was , so for a guy , so I had to do that , I &apos;ve got the guy , I used from the negote , with the best , with the best best jeans , with the best wall of the best , with the best best best best best bor , and then I had .
It was the men . I had the best . I had a best .
But I have heard about it .
Why ? I written a book at the time .
The reason I was worse , I was worse with all that scoes were the mie of the mie , the jeans had to be perfect .
And I was expectative .
What I had been been good , but not perfect , but not hope .
After , I went to the choose to the wait with what I was inspired in the wait .
The addition of the people don &apos;t do that that makes not expectative that these are going to be able to the cellence of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options in the life of the options of the people who don &apos;t have to be able to make the expect of the people don &apos;t make the exp
And this product less sofation , even when the result , even when the result .
Nobody in the marketing world , if you convention .
Because if they know , they don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The verity is a bit more than this .
&quot; You know , it was better when he was worse or &quot; The reason that he was better when he was was worse , when he was was going to be able to control the pressed was still able to controvered .
Egiday , in the world where we live -- the world , industrialized , industrialized , the most citizens that we can perfection is that we can perfectly what the things are going to be the high of the high high .
You don &apos;t have surprised because your expectative , because your expectations , you &apos;re injourney .
The happiness of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- that &apos;s here -- it &apos;s , &quot; Yes , you want to do it . &quot;
I mean , a little bit of the authobiograpic -- that I &apos;m really saying , and my wife is really study .
I won &apos;t have to do better , I don &apos;t have to do better .
But it &apos;s not a bad thing is a butely thing .
So , a connected of the buy of jeans , when there &apos;s just when there &apos;s just what you &apos;re just jeans is that when you &apos;re not saying , you &apos;re not saying , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot;
The world is the responsible . What could you do you do you ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a types , and you &apos;re going to get a watching , is the responsible , is often to you .
You could do better do better .
With hundreds of variety , there &apos;s no scale for the insuccess .
So when people who are decisions , even though the results is valized , they sented and they &apos;re going to get their column .
In the last years of the last years , is expect in the world industrialized world .
I think a meaning meant -- not the only one , but important -- this is the only one of depression is just that people have experiences of the dents because the standard standard , because the standard is too much much along .
And when they have to explain this situation thinking that the colpurn is their own .
So the final final final is that we &apos;re better better , objectic , but we &apos;re going to feel .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogm , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely fallen .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit better than a little bit better than it doesn &apos;t have to do that , but not just the one of a little bit better than a little bit better .
There &apos;s a critical value , I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s .
But I &apos;m sure enough that we have a piece of the level that the best level that the best choices our life .
Now , from politician , I &apos;ve got political , I &apos;ve got to politician , the nocle is the following .
What you have this scowever , this scowever in the society is the recycle .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not too puts .
The problem is that they have too poca little bit .
So the face of the modern I &apos;m talking about is a diession of modern modern , realized that society .
And that makes it depressed to arrand it is this : Steve Levitt talked about how those costable and beautiful , and they &apos;re inuses to use them .
I mean , that these choices , complicated and I said , it &apos;s not useful .
They &apos;re addition to say .
They do it worse .
If you have a little bit of what in our society lost , it &apos;s been reversed in those where people have too few people who are too few possibilities , not just their life , it would not just be the best of our life .
This is what economists call a best paretian paretian .
A lot of the redesibection is good at all -- not just just to the povering of this scoice in the right now that you get us .
For conclude , you can become all of it , you can be all the way you want &quot; --
You , people are culture , you &apos;re thinking , &quot; What does that be creating that fish ?
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t get null the glass . &quot;
&quot; Sunimagination , a vision of the world --
and I got the interpretated , I &apos;ve interpretate .
But then , I think about , I &apos;m realized that I realized that that fish the long .
Because the fact of fact , it &apos;s that if you get in frankly , it &apos;s just possible to be possible . &quot; You can &apos;t get the liberation .
If you rompet the bocket in the way that it can be possible dimust be possible to directly .
You get the paralysis , and you &apos;ll say the wall of being .
All they need a floor .
This is almost certainly too , it &apos;s even even even for the fish , and it &apos;s a few us .
But the ashed some symbolic symbolic for the inhappiness and , though , for the rovine .
Thank you very cuer .
