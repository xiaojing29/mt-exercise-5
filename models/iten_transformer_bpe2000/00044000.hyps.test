Pareas ago , here at TED , Petere Skillman Skillman introduced a challenge of design called the marshmallow .
And the idea is very simple .
The groups of four people have to build the highest torre you can read at the highest foot , using 20 spaghetti , a tape of tape , a half meter of tape and a marshmallow .
The marshmallow needs to be cross .
And , even though it looks very simple , in fact , it &apos;s pretty difficult to collaborate very quickly .
So I thought it was an interesting idea , and I encorporate it in a laboratory about design .
And it was a huge success .
And since then , I organized about 70 laborators of this guy around the world with students , designers and architects , even even even research and development development of Fortunes of Fortuns .
There &apos;s something in this exercise that revealing lessons about the nature of the collaboration , and I would like to share some of these lessons with you .
Normally , most of the people beginning with horienting to the task .
They &apos;re talking about , they imagine that it may be , they &apos;re going to be , they &apos;re going to be , and then organized the time , organizing .
They do the shorts and predicts are the spaghetti .
They run the majority of the time assembling spaghetti increassembling the spaghetti growth and , at the end , just when the marshmallow , and , right , just when the marshmallow , and clearly the marshmallow , and clearly the marshmallow back and Ta-da !
They run the work .
But what happens really , most of the time , is that the &quot; Ta-from &quot; is transformed in a &quot; Uh-Sh-oh , &quot; because the weight of the marshmallow and collapses the entire structure .
There &apos;s a certain number of people who has a lot more hu-oh moments , and among the worst of others there are the neolaudience .
They cheat , cheating , and they deserve , and they are absolutely traballing .
And there are naturally groups that have many more structures that have a lot more structures , and , between the best , there are the neighborhood of the childhood schools .
And it &apos;s incredible .
As Peter says , not only create the highest structures , but it &apos;s also the most interesting structures .
And your question is : How do it ? Why ? Why ? Why have particular ?
And Peter ama said , &quot; No one of the guys have time trying to become the director of the Spays . &quot;
They don &apos;t spend the power .
But there &apos;s another reason .
And the reason is that the students of economy are formed to find the best individual .
And then he exected it .
And after , what happens is that when they put the marshmallow in the top , they don &apos;t have more time , and what happens ?
The crisis .
Do you sounds familiar ?
And what children do different , is they begin from the marshmallow , and build prototypes , and they build prototypes , one after the other , they always have different possibilities to figure out there .
The designers recognize that this kind of collaboration is the essence of the process .
And with all version , children have an instaneous feedback about what works and what it doesn &apos;t work .
So the capacity to work on prototypes is essential , but we see how different groups work .
The average for most people are about 50 centrepreneurs , for the students of economy , about half the students of economy , a little bit better , but not much , better than many adults .
Who does all better than ?
Archites and engineers , thank you to the sky .
99 , it &apos;s the highest structure that I &apos;ve ever seen .
And why ? Because what ? Because they understand that the triangles and the geometriangles are the key to build stable structures .
Then we have the general directors , a little better than average .
But this is where it becomes interesting .
If you include an administrator , the group , the group can do much better .
It &apos;s amazing . You have a little bit around , you look at &quot; Vedring that the group will win &quot; You can understand it in anticype . And why ?
Because they have particular ability to agevolate the work elsewhere .
They make the process , they understand it .
And all of the groups that are going to be improved to work improve the result of the team .
And special dotes of agevolation , and their combination , and their combination to a secure success .
If you have 10 groups that are going to be good , you maybe you &apos;re going to get these structures that are going to get up .
And I tried an interesting experiment .
I thought , let &apos;s get the post for once .
I put on the plate 10,000 dollars of prize in software to the team .
What do you think it has happened to design ?
What was the result ?
That &apos;s what happened .
And one of the team has created a stable structure .
If one of them had just built a 2,5 structure structure , he would brought back home .
Isn &apos;t it interesting that a high-high impact ?
We &apos;ve tried to the exercise with the same students .
What do you think it happened ?
Now they figure out the value of a prototype .
The same team , the worst of the worst .
They created the highest structure in the minor time .
So , they &apos;re important lessons about nature and the success of the incentives and the successful Potrouble ?
The reason is this : help to create digital tools and help to help groups build , video games and visual effects .
And what a challenge is helping is helping to identify the hidden assumption .
Why , honestly , every project has his marshmallow , isn &apos;t it ?
The challenge provides a shared experience , a common language , a common position position to build a prototype .
And so , this is the value of experience , of this exercise .
And those of you who were interested , it can go to marshmallowchallenge.com.
It &apos;s a blog blog where you can give a look at the marshmallow .
There are instructions for steps .
There are crazy examples from all over the world about how people corrugs and the system .
There &apos;s also the record of the world .
And the most important lesson , I think , is that design is really a sport of contact .
He asks the employ of all the senses , and the use of the most finishes and the manuality and manuality and manuality to manuality the challenge that has in your hand .
And sometimes , a small prototype of this experience is all that it &apos;s necessary to transform a moment , &quot; in a moment . &quot;
And that can really make a difference .
Thank you very much .
Let &apos;s end up having a machine , big , beautiful , at TED style , it &apos;s a machine of time .
Everybody in this room have to get us .
You can go back , you can go back , you can &apos;t stop where you are .
And I would be curious to know what what you would choose , because I asked my friends in the last time , and everybody wants to go back .
I don &apos;t know .
I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m convinced that there is a kind of return to the nostalking about the nostalks about it .
I understand it .
But I don &apos;t do part of that group , I have to admit .
I don &apos;t want to go back , and not because I &apos;m adventurous , it &apos;s because the possibilities on this planet don &apos;t go back , they go forward .
So I want to go to the machine and I want to go forward .
This is the best period that we &apos;ve been on this planet in every field that we can measure : health , wealth , mobility , opportunity , hot , opportunities , hot of disease .
There &apos;s never been a period like this .
My neighborhood disease , first of 60 years .
My grandparent that number 70 .
My parents are to touch the 80 .
So it &apos;s better that there &apos;s a nine in the number of my death .
But it &apos;s not just about people like us , it &apos;s a much bigger than that .
A child born in New Delhi today can expectation as much as the richest man in the world of 100 years ago .
Think of it . It &apos;s an amazing fact .
How can it be true ?
Vaix . The smallpox has killed billions of people on this planet .
He changed the global demography as no war has ever done .
If he was born .
We stood it . Puff .
In the rich world , diseases that were a generation does not exist , there are no longer , in practical .
Difterite , red , red --
somebody knows what are ?
Vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , these are triumped of the scientific method .
And I think , the scientific method , to try things , see if they work , see if they work , it &apos;s when they don &apos;t work , it &apos;s one of the great results of humanity .
These were the good news .
Unfortunately , they were the good news because there are other problems , and they &apos;ve been quoted a lot of times , for example , one of them is that , nonetheless what we &apos;ve got got happened , a billion people go to bed on this planet , every day .
This number is growing , with incredible quickly , and it &apos;s true .
And not only , we used our creativity to fill the planet .
Now , power land , we &apos;ll be coltivable , forests , forests , oil gas , oil , gas , and they &apos;re disappearing , and they &apos;re disappearing , and they &apos;re not in our actions to pull us out of this guable , we &apos;re going to deal with it .
So the question is : can we do it ? I think that I am .
I think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food to feel billions of people without violence .
I think it &apos;s possible to get this world of energy without this destroy .
I really think about it , and no , it &apos;s not a full illusion .
But here &apos;s the thing that keeps me up the night -- one of the things that are willing me .
We &apos;ve never had so need a scientific progress as we need it now , and we &apos;ve never been in the positive position to the best of how we could today .
We &apos;re at an incredible events , really , really , in many of them .
But nonetheless , I think we should go back centuries , 300 years , before the Iluminism , to find a period in which we fight the progress , a period where we combats them more vigorously , and on the front of you .
People are trapping in what they believe , and they do it with a lot of force that we can &apos;t liberate them .
Now , the truth can get them .
You know , everybody has gotten to their opinion ; they &apos;ve also gotten to their opinion about progress , but you know what you haven &apos;t it ?
You don &apos;t have your facts . I &apos;m sorry , you can &apos;t .
I put a little bit to understand it .
One decade ago , I wrote a story of vaccines for &quot; The New Yorker , a short article .
And I was stupet that somebody opposed , which was contrary to what it is , after all , the most effective health public health of human history .
I didn &apos;t know what to do , so I &apos;ve done as usually , I wrote history , and I went on .
Not much later , I wrote a story about genetically food .
Same thing , only bigger .
People were crazy .
So I wrote a story about that , and I couldn &apos;t figure out why people considered the OGM as &quot; I show , &quot; because they thought I &apos;m going to show the molecules in a specific way , instead of the nature work of nature .
But , as I always do my job . I wrote the story , and I went forward .
I mean , I &apos;m a journalist , we writing , we &apos;re going to go , we &apos;re going to go there .
But these stories came up , and I couldn &apos;t understand why , but I did it .
And the problem was that those fanatics that were crazy were not fanatical at all .
They were consciousness , education , people for good .
They were exactly like people in this room .
And it was very disturbed .
but then I thought , we have to be honest ; we &apos;re at a point on this planet , where we have not the same report with progress that there was a time .
We talk about it in a way .
We talk in terms of ironic ironic using the virgolet virgolet : &quot; Progress . &quot; Well , there are reasons to do it , and I think we know what it is .
We lost trust in institutions , in authorities , and sometimes in science , and it &apos;s understandable that it happened .
It &apos;s just doing some names and people understand .
Challenging , Bhopal , Challenger , Vioxx , Vioxx , arms of mass destruction .
I mean , each one has his list .
We have questions and problems with people that we thought we had to be right .
So , you know .
Make , you pretend answers , pretend evidence .
Don &apos;t do anything for granted .
But this is the fundamental point : when the evidence are coming up , and we &apos;re not very good at it .
And I think that the reason is that we &apos;re in an epidemic of fear that I had never seen , and I hope that I had never seen .
About 12 years ago , a story , a horrible story , a horrible story , which was an orrible between a epidemic of autism and vaccines against it .
Very frightening .
Hundreds of studies were made to see if it was true .
And they had to do hundreds of studies ; it &apos;s an important question .
At the end of the data .
They came from the United States , from the United States , from the Sweden , from Canada , and everybody were equals , no relationship , no correlation , nothing .
It didn &apos;t make a difference . It didn &apos;t because we think of anecdotes , to what we see -- to what we think we see , to what we think about it , what we think about it .
We don &apos;t think about a pile documents from the government that show us numbers , and I understand it , and I think we understand it ,
But you know what ?
The results have been devastating --
devastating because this is a fact , the United States are one of the few countries in the world that the number of vaccines against the death .
It &apos;s horrible , and we should have ourselves .
It &apos;s terrible .
What has happened to us to do something like this ?
Now , I understand it . I really understand it .
Think about it , somebody here has the death ?
Someone of the audience has ever seen a death person ?
It doesn &apos;t happen .
In this country isn &apos;t going on , but it was 160,000 times in the world last year .
I &apos;m a little bit of deaths , 20 every hour .
But as Jenny McCarthy , and people like Jenny McCarthy , and people like Jenny McCarthy can go around and ignorance as Oprize as Oprise or Larry King Live .
And they can do it because they don &apos;t understand a difference between cusality and correlation .
They don &apos;t understand that these two things seems seeing , but they &apos;re not almost .
But that &apos;s something we need to learn , and we have to learn it fast .
This man was a heroe , Jonas Salk .
He liberated the humanity from one of his floors .
Not fear , no suffering --
The man in the middle of the center .
It &apos;s called Paul Offit .
He just created a vaccine against the rotavirush together .
He saved the life of 400 , 500 to 500 children every year in the developing world .
It &apos;s bad , right ?
It &apos;s good , if it wasn &apos;t that Paul goes around talking about vaccines , he says how precious they are , and people should simply stopping .
And it says in these terms .
So Paul is considered a terrorist .
When Paul speaking in a public udience can &apos;t textbooks .
They call it the home because to some people like to remember them who know where his children go to school .
Why ? Because Paul has created a vaccine .
I wouldn &apos;t need to tell , but the vaccines are fundamental .
If we stop them , the diseases come back , terrible diseases , and it &apos;s going on .
We have again in this country .
And it &apos;s going to be worse , and it &apos;s not a lot of children are going to die again , because it &apos;s just a question of numbers .
And they &apos;re not going to die .
What ? Right ? Let &apos;s also that . Why not ?
One of my ex college , he wrote a couple of weeks ago , and he told me that he told me a little excessive .
No one told me before .
She wouldn &apos;t have vaccinated his son .
Not death .
OK .
Why ? Because there &apos;s no polio . But you know what ?
You were not in the United States .
I don &apos;t know it -- I don &apos;t know -- maybe a guy &apos;s on an airplane in Lagos Angeles , and it &apos;s coming to Lagos Angeles now .
Maybe it &apos;s going to land in a couple of hours , it &apos;s going to be here in Long Beach , it &apos;s going to be here in Long Beach one of these fantastic cens from TED .
He doesn &apos;t know that we &apos;ve been infected by a paralyzed disease , and we don &apos;t know it because it &apos;s so it works the world .
This is the planet that we live . We don &apos;t end it .
We &apos;re going to look at a good time .
You all have taken vitamines ?
Echinacea , a little antiossidant to start the day .
I know you &apos;ve done it because the Americans do it every day .
They make that stuff , as they deal with alternative medicine , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often they &apos;re useful .
The data always demonstrate it .
They make the most scale . More than that they don &apos;t do , almost .
But it &apos;s good , you want to spend 28 billion dollars per urine , are with you .
Urin scture . Scure .
Why do we do it ? Why do we do it ? Why do we do it ?
I think of understanding , we have the great drugs .
Let &apos;s take the great government machine .
And we do good . Our healthcare system does .
It &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
It &apos;s absolutely , incredibly cold and death for those of us who can afford it .
So let &apos;s stick away , and what do we refugee ?
We &apos;re going to be the arms of the great placebo .
It &apos;s fantastic . We love the great placebo .
You know , it &apos;s a serious problem because this stuff is a crazy , and we spend billions of dollars .
I have a whole series of examples here .
Not one of these -- ginkgo -- a frode , echines -- a froxide , I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s but we spend billions of dollars , and it &apos;s a frow .
Do you know what ? When I say these things , people are against , and they say , &quot; But what you &apos;re interested in , and they say , &quot; But what you &apos;re interested in .
It &apos;s good for them . &quot;
Do you guess what ? Do you come back .
Because it &apos;s not interested in me if it &apos;s the Department for Salth and the Servi Uhands to say , &quot; Uhm , I &apos;m not going to listening the evidence of the mammography of the cancer that wants to cffer the patients of cancer that wants to treat the coffee patients with coffee .
When we stop the street that leads to replacing science and evidence with magic and tradition , we end in a place where we don &apos;t want to be .
We &apos;re like Thabo Mbeki in South Africa .
He killed 400 middle of its continuing to say that barbabietole , cut and the babietole and the babies had better drugs that we know they can slow the AIDS .
Hundreds of thousands of useful deaths in a country that has been clear more than each other from this disease .
Please , don &apos;t come to tell me that there are no consequences for these actions .
There are .
Now , the most stupidemic epidemic that we are in middle right now is the absurd among the genetically modifood and the biological food .
It &apos;s a diatriba . It &apos;s got to end .
It &apos;s a diatriba on the words , on the metaphors .
It &apos;s ideology , it &apos;s not science .
Every single thing that we eat , every chicks of rice , every leaf , every leaf of Bruxelles was modified by man .
You see , there were no sent sent in the garden of Eden Eden .
There were no melants .
There were no Natal trees . We &apos;ve created them .
We did it in the last 111,000 years .
Something has worked and something else .
And we eliminated what it didn &apos;t work .
Now we can do it in more precise .
And there are risks , of course , there are .
But we can put things like the vitamin At , and this would help millions of people , millions of people , reading their life .
And we don &apos;t want to do that ?
I &apos;ve got to tell you , I don &apos;t understand it .
We are contrary to the OGM .
Why is it ?
And the things that I feel always are too much chemicals , fish , hormons , monocolture , we don &apos;t want enormous camps with the same thing , it &apos;s wrong .
We don &apos;t want to companies to put the short of life .
We don &apos;t want the companies are unique propertiary properties .
Do you know what my answer ?
It &apos;s yes . You &apos;re right . We do something .
It &apos;s true , we have a huge problem , but it &apos;s not science .
It doesn &apos;t have anything to do with science .
It &apos;s law , morality , and lines on the short .
You know that science is not a corporation .
It &apos;s not a country .
It &apos;s not an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
It &apos;s a process , sometimes it &apos;s a process , sometimes not , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow the science to do his work only because we have fear is very development , and it &apos;s standing to millions of people .
You know , in the next 50 years we will be construct 70 percent of food in more than what we produce now , 70 percent .
These are the investments in the last 30 years .
Virgognicky .
They don &apos;t need it and we don &apos;t get it .
Why ? It &apos;s genetically modified .
We don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat schief as the maniocates .
Woman billion people eat .
It looks like a little bit .
But it &apos;s just hcalories . It &apos;s hot .
It has no nutrients , it doesn &apos;t have proteins , but the scientists are the way of it in this moment .
So many people could eat and run the risk of becoming the risk of becoming the risk of a blind .
They wouldn &apos;t die , and you know what ?
It would be very good .
Can I just ask me : Why are we against ?
I mean , I want to say , why are we obstacle this thing ?
Only , because we don &apos;t want to move the genes here ?
This is about chemicals . It &apos;s not about chemicals .
It &apos;s not our hossession for ormons , or our desire to the ormons , or our desire to have bigger food , better .
They don &apos;t have the Rice Krispies .
It &apos;s about saving the life of people , and it would be now began to figure out what it means .
Why are you -- if we don &apos;t understand it , and we continue to behave us how we figure out how we figure out what we &apos;re going to be colonialism .
There &apos;s no way to describe what &apos;s going on .
It &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s horrible , it &apos;s horrible , and we have to stop it .
So , after this fun conversation , could you ask me , &quot; You still want to go into this machine of the time and go to the future ? &quot;
Of course ! I want to do .
It &apos;s blocked on the present now , but we have an amazing opportunity .
We can put the time machine as we want .
We have the possibility to go where we want , and we &apos;re going to do it where we really want .
We have to do these conversations , and we have to think , but when we go into the time machine and we &apos;ll be happy to do it .
I know that we can and , as far as I think that the world needs to such me .
Thank you .
Thank you .
One day , the Los Angeles Times Steve Lopez Times Steve Lopez was walking for the streets of Los Angeles when I heard a music .
He was such a man , a man , an American man , an American-American , fascinating , with the marks , without a violin which he had only two cords .
I &apos;m telling a story that a lot of you know , because the Steve articles ney at Steve ney for a book , which , in the followed , who was in followed , with Robert Downey Jr who was interpret the part of Steve Lopez , and Jamie Fox in the Nathaniel Anyway , and Jamie Fox in the Anthony Ayers ,
Nathaniel left the Juilliard , had a terrible exhaurible exhaurible , and 30 years later he lived as a street for Skid Row in the center of Los Angeles .
So , all of you to read the book of Steve or Steve , or look at the movie to understand not just the beautiful regions that created between these two men , and you know , he created between these two men ,
My name is Jane McGonigal . I &apos;m a video games .
Realized games for 10 years and my goal for the next 10 years , and my goal for the next 10 years is to try to save the world of games .
To do this , I have a plan , and the convincing more people , compress all of you , to spend more beautiful games and interesting .
At the moment of three billion hours at the week playing online .
Some of you may think , &quot; It &apos;s a little bit of time to play . &quot;
maybe too time , considering how many urgent problems we have to solve in the real world .
In fact , according to my research , I pressed Istitute for Future , actually is true contrary .
Three billion hours at the week is not enough to solve problems to solve the most urgent problems in the world .
In fact , I believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet we have to increase that we have to increase that .
I calculated that the total we need 21 billion game every week .
It &apos;s probably an idea a active control of active control , so it &apos;s repeated , to force the concept .
If we want to solve the problems that hunger , poverty , poverty , global conflicts , global conflicts , the global conflict , I think we have to have the environment of play , for the next decade , for the next decade , for the next decade , for the next decade of the next decade ,
That &apos;s why . This image of this image , because I think it &apos;s so important for the survival of human specific species .
This is a picture of the photographer Phil Toldan , he wanted to caught the emotion of the game emotion .
So he made photographed players as they play .
And this is a classic game emotion of play .
If you &apos;re not players of the players of this picture .
You can probably notice the sense of urgence , a little bit of fear , but also a very profound attention , a very profound attention , a very profound attention to a really difficult problem .
If you are players , you &apos;ll see some details , you &apos;ll see some details around the eyes , and you &apos;re around the mouth are a segment of optimism .
And then you get it up to the surprise .
This is a step player at a step from something called a &quot; Victoria Epica . &quot;
Ah , it &apos;s a term that you &apos;ve already heard . OK .
So we have the players between us .
A major vine is an extraordinarily positive result that doesn &apos;t seem as you can &apos;t seeing it .
It &apos;s almost beyond the threshold of the imagination , and when you get there is a shock discovering what you &apos;re really capable . This is a time .
This player is a step from a time .
And this is the expression that we need to see on the face of millions of problems in the world as we roning the obstacles of the next hundred years .
Unfortunately this is the expression that we see in the life of all the days as we tend to deal with urgent problems .
This is the expression that I call , &quot; I &apos;m not Bra Realty . &quot; And I &apos;m going to do it . &quot; And you see it . &quot; Well . &quot;
I &apos;m with the expression , &quot; I &apos;m not Brin Nelty . &quot;
This is a graffected in my old Berkeley neighborhood , in California , where I did the PhD about why we are more good in the game in the real life .
And this is a lot of abitual players : we feel that we &apos;re not really good at the games .
And I don &apos;t mean , you just as well as the successful , even though the success is part of it : we get more results in online .
But I also mean , &quot; in the sense of motivated to do something important , inspired to collaborate and cooperate .
And when we are in a online world , I think many of us become the best versions of if you are the best versions that are able to help without predict , more capable of focus on a problem for all the time , to get up after a failure and to try and try new .
And in real life , when we deal with a failure , when we deal with an obstacle , often we don &apos;t feel like that : we feel anxious , we feel anxious , frustrated , frustrated or five .
We don &apos;t try this feelings as we play , just not exist in a game .
So this is what I wanted to study to university .
What is that in a game us to feel that we can &apos;t achieve any result ?
How can we transport those feelings from the games and apping them to the real world ?
So , I studied games like World of Warcraft , which is really the environment to solve problems in a collaborative way .
And I began to notice some things that make the epic victories so possible in online .
The first one is that , when you appears in one of these games , especially in World of Warcraft , there are many different characters that have different characters that you flow at the point to the world .
But no mission any mission : a perfect mission perfect mission of your current level in play . Right ?
So you can complete it .
They never give you a challenge impossible .
But it &apos;s the limits of your capacity . So you have to try it seriously .
But there &apos;s no disoccupation in World of Warcraft , you don &apos;t spend the pollus , there &apos;s always something specific and important to do .
And there &apos;s also a lot of collaborators .
Everything you go , hundreds of thousands of people , ready to join you to join a complete mission .
It &apos;s not so common in real life , this feeling that sensation that we have a lot of collaborators .
And there &apos;s also this narratic narrative , this narrative that inspire , about why we are there , and what we &apos;re doing .
And then we get this positive feedback .
You &apos;ve heard about increasing level and 1 force of force , and we &apos;ve got one in intelligence .
We don &apos;t get that kind of a constant feedback in real life .
When I leave this shouldn &apos;t have to have this guy in front of an audience , and in front of a public ideas .
I don &apos;t have that kind of feedback in real life .
Now , the problem of collaborative environments like World of Warcraft is that gives so much satisfaction to be a step from a time , which we decide that we decide to spend all the time , that we decided to spend all the time in these game .
It &apos;s just better than reality .
It &apos;s why , collectively , collectively all the World players in World of Warcraft &apos;s virtual problems of Azeroth .
This is not necessarily negative thing .
But let &apos;s put it in perspective : 5.93 million years ago was the period in which one of our ancestors went up in .
That was the first to walk up .
Okay , so when we talk about how long we &apos;re investing in play , the only eye , the only eye is about talking about it , it &apos;s about talking about human evolution , which is to talk about human evolution , which is an extraordinary thing , but also , useful , because we discovered that we &apos;ve discovered what we are capable of being , we &apos;re evolved to collaborate what we &apos;re realized as a human being , we &apos;re evolved to collaborate what we are capable .
This is true , I think .
So , you know this interesting statistic .
It was published recently from a researcher to Carnagie Mellon .
The young average today in a country with a country with a culture of players of players , will have spent 10,000 playing online , at the age of 21 .
10,000 hours is a very interesting number of reasons .
First of all , for children in the United States 10,000-80 hours is the exact number of hours .
So we have a whole parallel of parallel education in which young people learn how to be a good time in which young people learning everything else .
And some of you will probably read the new book of Malcolm Gladwell . &quot;
If you &apos;ve done it from his theory of success , the 100,000 hours for success .
It &apos;s founded on an optim research in the cognition camp , which if we decline 10,000 hours of study as a fruit of whatever at the age of 21 years , we will be gene in that camp .
We &apos;re going to be in that something as the best people in the world .
So , what we have now to be a whole generation of young young people who are genes of play .
So , the question is , &quot; Exactly , what become these players ? &quot;
because if we could figure out what it &apos;s about , we would have a amount of human resources .
This is the number of people in the world that go at least a day to play online .
These are our genes of play .
500 million people who are extraordinarily good --
And in the next decade , we &apos;ll have another billion of habitual players that are extraordinarily good at that something .
If you didn &apos;t know it , this is what you expect : the video games the video games are developing is developing energy and consumption that consumption energy , and it work with the web networks like the Internet , in particular networks , in India , China , Brazil , Cina Brazil , it can connect it .
It &apos;s a billion players in the next decade .
This will bring us to 1.5 billion players .
So I began to think , what these games are transforming us .
These are four aspects I &apos;ve seen . The first one is a great urgent urges .
Okay . Think of it as a self-motivation .
An optimism is the desire to act immediately to deal with an obstacle , together with the convinced convinced to have a reasonable hope of success .
The players are always created that a eptic vity is possible , and it &apos;s worth the time to try and try now .
The players are not with your hands in hands .
The players are the virtuous players are in a robug social .
There are a lot of research that shows how we are better with other people after played it with them , even though they &apos;ve been played .
And the reason is that it takes a lot of trust to play with somebody : we &apos;re going to spend their time with us , which are going to go with the same rules and the same objective rules , and they will stay up to the conclusion of play .
So , played together builds the leges of trust and cooperation .
And the result that we really have more social relationships .
Produttivity . I love it .
You know , there &apos;s a reason for which the World average of World Warcraft playing 22 hours a week job .
It &apos;s because we know , as we &apos;re playing , that we &apos;re really happy to work hard , rather than we &apos;re actually working hard , or losing time .
We know that we &apos;re optimized , as human being , to work with something that has significance .
And the players are willing to work expensive , if it &apos;s assigned him a tassigned it .
To finally , a significance .
The players are adorse players are associated with wonderful missions , about human scales .
For example , a small information to help create a context .
You know Wikipedia , the biggest wiki in the world .
The second wiki biggest in the world , with almost 80,000 articles is the World Warcraft .
They have more information about the World of Warcraft in the Internet , which almost anything else in the world .
They &apos;re building an area .
They &apos;re building a hundred of information about World of Warcraft .
Okay , these are the four superpowers .
The players are individuals of great individuals in the super-powers .
These are people who believe that they are individually capable to change the world .
The only problem is that they believe that they &apos;re capable of being able to change virtual worlds , but not that real .
This is the problem that I &apos;m trying to solve .
There &apos;s a economy called Edward Castronova .
His studies are brilliant . It &apos;s looking at the reason why people invest so much time , energy and denial , energy and money , in the world .
He said , &quot; We &apos;re seeing what we &apos;re seeing anything that a mass of mass towards the virtual worldwide and the environments . &quot;
And it &apos;s a cheap , so it &apos;s rational , and it says --
But he said , &quot;
They can have more solid social relationships in a game that not in real life .
They have a better feedback , and they feel more reward in a game that not in real life .
So , it &apos;s perfectly right now , it &apos;s perfectly reasonable for habitual players , to spend more time in the virtual world , I realize that this is reasonable , for now , but it &apos;s not , in any way , a ideal situation . We have to start making the real world more like a game .
This is inspiration from something that happened 2500 years ago .
These are high dades , made of bones of bones that we had joysticks and pulsanings , we had bought out of humanity . And these represent tools .
If you know the written of the ancient Greek , you know this story .
It &apos;s the story of who invented games and why .
Erodozote that games , particularly the games of dades , they were invented in the Lidia , during a card period of time .
It looks like so seven-evening , that the king of Lidia decided to do something unthinkable .
People suffering , the population was in reaching , it was an extreme situation , they needed an extreme situation .
So , second Erodot , they invented the games of dawn and emanared a valid law for all the rule .
One day , everybody would be eaten .
The next day , everybody would play .
And they were so deeply in the dawn games , from the moment to play is so involved in a state of productivity , and it immerge productivity , which ignored the fact of productivity , which ignored the fact that you have no eat .
And so one day they were played , and they were eating .
And second Erodoto , they spent so 18 years , survive to eating a day and playing the following a day and playing the following .
I think this is exactly the way we use games at the day .
We use games to run the games of the real world .
We use games to get away from anything that doesn &apos;t work in our real environment , from everything that doesn &apos;t work in our real environment , and you get what we need from the games .
But we don &apos;t necessarily have to stop here .
This is really interesting : according to Erodot , after 18 years , the 18 , the carron didn &apos;t tell , so the decided that they would play a daughter .
And they lived the entire regular to the entire regular , and the winner , and the winners of that participate at a time .
They run the Lidia , and they went to look for a new land where they could live , leaving the right number of people to survive , with the resources of people to survive , with the resources of bring their civilization from some other side , where he could have lost .
It &apos;s a little bit bizarre , right ?
But recently recently , studies about DNA revealed that the Etrush , who would then bring the same DNA Carroman , they share the same DNA of anti-people in Lidia .
So , recently , scientists have suggested that the narrate history is a real story .
And geologists have found evidence of a global cooling climbed that almost 20 years , and that could explain the charity .
So this amazing story could be true : it could actually have saved their culture playwed their culture player in the games for 18 years , and then being so inspired , and you know how to come in the game in the game of civilization .
OK , we can do it .
We call the World of Warcraft from 1994 .
It was the first game of strategy in real time of World series of World of Warcraft . This 16 years ago .
They played for 18 years , we &apos;ve been played in Warcraft for 16 years .
I say , we &apos;re ready for our ethical play .
They may be the population of a new world .
It &apos;s where I transagger the idea of 21 billion game at a week .
We know that the half of us agreed to spend a day at the time to play a day , until we solve the world problems .
Imagine what you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; How can we solve the problems of the world &apos;s problems in a game ? &quot; Well , this is what I &apos;ve dedicated my work in a game in the past years , I pressed the Future .
In our offices of Palo Alto , we have this stand our idea of how we should relate to the future .
We don &apos;t want to predict the future .
What we want to do is -- the future .
We want to imagine the scenarios from the best results , and then we want to make the possibility to make them concrete .
We want to imagine vin the epic epic to the people the tools to do it .
I &apos;m going to show you three games that I realized , and I &apos;m an attempt to give people the tools to create the tools to create epic victories in their future .
This is &quot; World Petrolum . &quot;
We did this game in 2007 .
It &apos;s a online game in which you &apos;re trying to survive a oil carence of oil .
It &apos;s not real , but we &apos;ve published sufficient material , but we published to believe that it is , and to make real life real life as if we &apos;re in the game . So when you &apos;re in the game , you beat the register , you know , when you get in the register of oil , it shows you that are exactly the cost of oil , the things that are not available , the distribution of food , the distribution of food ,
the impact on transportation , if schools are closed , and you have to think about how you would live , and you have to think about how you would live your life if all this was real . Dopodic , because we ask you have a blog about it , to publishing video --
We &apos;ve seen this game with 1,700 players in 2007 , and we looked at them from then for three years old , and what I can tell you is that it &apos;s an experience .
Nobody wants to change the way that they live only because it &apos;s a good thing for the world or because it &apos;s a good thing for the world or because it &apos;s a good thing for the world or because it &apos;s a good thing for the world or because it &apos;s a good thing for the world or because it &apos;s a good thing for the world or because it &apos;s a good thing for the world or because it &apos;s a good thing for the world or because it &apos;s a good thing for the world or because it &apos;s a good thing for the world or because it &apos;s a good thing for the world or because it &apos;s a good thing for the world or because it &apos;s a good thing good .
But if you dive them in an old adventure and you say , &quot; We have no longer oil .
This is an amazing story . It &apos;s an amazing adventure that you can participate !
It flows itself to see how you survive . &quot;
Most of our players , and then keep the habits that has learned in the game .
So , for the next next to save the world , we decided to save the world , we decided to save a bigger problem of oil .
We did a game called Superstruct , at the Istitute for the Future , and the premise was a supercomputation has calculated that humanity has only 23 years on this planet .
The supercomputer is called &quot; System of Allerta of the Global Estintion . &quot;
We asked people to achieve online almost like in a Jerry Bruckheimer movie .
You know , Jerry Bruckheimer &apos;s movie , a team team team from dream : there &apos;s the astronauty , the scientist , and they have something to do to save the world , but in our game , in our game , but in our game , instead of having just five people in the dream of the dream , and it &apos;s realized the future of the energy , the future of the energy , the energy of the future of health ,
8,000 people have played for eight weeks , they &apos;ve generated 500 incredibly creative solutions that you can find if you go online and look at Google . &quot;
And finally , the last game , the last game . This is a realized game . This is a realized game with the Istitute of the World Bank .
If you complete game the game you will be certified from the World Bank , as the Innovator Social , classrooms of 2010 .
Lavoring with college university for sub-Saharan Africa , we &apos;re invited to learn the social innovation techniques .
There &apos;s a story to comics , it increases like local knowledge , like the local knowledge , the collaboration , the sustainability and inventive .
And I want to invite all of you to share this game with the young people , in particular areas in the world , in particular areas in the developing areas in the development , which may be a benefits of the social impresses to start imagining their social impresses to save the world .
It &apos;s time to conclude .
I want to ask a question .
What do you think that &apos;s going to happen ?
We have all these incredible players , we have these games that are the pilots of plans what we could do , but no one of these have saved the real world .
Well , I hope that you agree with me that the players are a human resource that we can use to use to make the real work in the real work in the real world , that games are a powerful productivity , that we have these amazing superpowered productivity , that we have these amazing superpowered productivity , the capacity of being a social rocken .
I really hope that we can come up to play the games that have important to play games that have important , to survive on this planet for another century , and my hope is that you uniate to me in realize and participate games like this .
When I look forward at the next decade , of two things are certainly , that we can do any future , and we can play any future , and we can play any play .
So , I say , let &apos;s start the games that will change the world .
Thank you .
For some time , I &apos;m interested in placebo , it can look like a strange thing that a magician , unless you think of it from my point of view , which is &quot; something false is believed to the point to become something real real thing . &quot; In other words , the glds of sugar have a measurable measuring effect in some studies , the placebo because the person thinks , just because the person thinks ,
which is what &apos;s happening is to a drug or something like this --
The pain of pain , for example , if they believe they have a measurable effect in the body called placebo effect .
Something is true for the perception that if it has .
So , I want to show you a rudimental rudigs , very simple .
And I &apos;m going to show you how it works . This is a trick that &apos;s present in all the books for children from the years .
I &apos;ve learned it from only Cub Scout Magic in the years .
I &apos;m going to explain it .
And so I &apos;m going to explain why I &apos;ve explained it .
That &apos;s what happens .
The colnight that you can examinate ; my hand , you can examinate .
I &apos;m going to simply the knife in my pug , like this .
I &apos;m going to do it .
To be sure that nothing goes , or saving from my eye .
Now , I &apos;m struggle .
And so you can see that you ever can spend . Fince , until string down there or down from my ethic .
And the purpose of this is simple .
I &apos;m going to open my hand , and if everything has gone , my hand , my hand , my short magnetism , it &apos;s going to be the knife .
And in fact remains that I can schools , and the knife doesn &apos;t fall .
Not goes on or down to my way .
no trick .
Ta-da !
This is a trick that &apos;s often trick to children .
which are interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about this trick , even though it &apos;s very simple .
Many of you in this room will know this trick .
That &apos;s what happens is Tengo to my hand .
I say my wrist of my wrist .
to make sure that nothing room , or scene from my eye , this is a good way .
The reason I &apos;m holding the wrist is because it &apos;s the secret of illusion .
In the moment when my hand is moving away from you , this finger here , my finger , and it was going to be , in a position that wearing in a position that &apos;s going to be so Bed .
There &apos;s somebody who didn &apos;t have a childhood here .
It &apos;s so , right here .
And when I ran up the finger .
We can talk about why it is ingannious , because you don &apos;t notice that there are only three fingers down there because the mind , and the way that process the mind , you know , one , two , three of them .
But that &apos;s not the point .
And when I closing my finger , same thing , when I come back , this movement covers .
I put the hand . The knife is away .
It &apos;s a trick that you can do with your friends and neighbors . Thank you .
Now , what has to do with the placebo effect ?
I read a study , a year ago that spent me up the mind .
I &apos;m not a medical or a researcher , which was an amazing thing .
It seems that if you look at a placebo in the form of a placebo in the shape of a customer , just like an aspirine , it has a measurable effect .
But if you change the shape and the placebo , under the form of a smaller placebo , and the blue color shape , and you print you a letter is visual .
Even though one of the two has no drug -- they &apos;re pills of sugar .
But a white pilots is not effective as a blue pill .
What ? It really has really uncomfortable .
But anyway , it &apos;s not here .
The capsule are more effectively than every form .
A colored to understand colored , which is yellow from one side and red the other is better than one of a capsule .
The dosage has a role .
A couple of times a day , it &apos;s not so effective as three pills -- I don &apos;t remember the statistical statistics .
But the point is --
that these dosages have a role .
And the shape has a role .
And if you want to be the placebo definitive you have to use a needle .
Right ? A siringe with something -- a couple of nerts .
it in a patient --
This is a picture so strong in their mind , much stronger than that the white pills .
It &apos;s real , this graph . I &apos;m going to show you another time when we have slides .
The point is that the white pill is not effective as blue that blue is not effective as the blue that &apos;s not effective as a needle .
And no one of them has a pharmaceutical quality .
It &apos;s just your belief that makes them real in your cover and rafforce .
I wanted to see if I could take this idea and apply it to a magic trick .
And do something that is a trick and do something real .
And we know from the study that when you want a effect , you have to use the needle .
This is a pilon of seven chicken .
It &apos;s a little bit .
This is my card . This is not Carne special of Damian .
This is my skin . This is not a special Hollywoodian effect .
I &apos;m going to drop my skin , and to spend this needle .
If you tried nauses -- if you come up -- I did it for some friends in the albergo , the other night , and for some I didn &apos;t know , and for some I didn &apos;t know , and a woman is alberone .
So if you tried nauses , I suggested that you don &apos;t look at the next 30s -- actually , you know , I &apos;m going to do the first bad part here .
You can see , you can see , you can look at another part .
That &apos;s what happens , right here , the beginning of my card on on the hole of my arm , I only do a little hole .
Scusami . Do I am you ?
And now a little bit through my skin , and out of the other side , so .
Now , we &apos;re in the same position that we were with the knife .
More or not you count my fingers now , right ?
So I &apos;m going to show them . Here &apos;s one , two , four , yes . Yeah .
I know what people think .
They think , &quot; Surely wouldn &apos;t be very stupid to hole the skin only for different kinds of minutes . &quot;
So , let me leave you a bunch .
How do you look like ?
Yeah , I know what they will say , &quot; Okay , I don &apos;t see it good . &quot;
People in the room are coming .
Let me show it close .
This is really my skin . It &apos;s not a special effect of Hollywood .
This is my card , and I can turn it around .
Sorry , if you &apos;re going to be bad , you don &apos;t look at one other side .
People in the bottom or whether it &apos;s going to be , &quot; Well , it &apos;s clear that &apos;s going to try some effect , but if it was true .
You can see there &apos;s a hole here and a hole here , if it was true . &quot;
Well , I &apos;m going to use a little blood for you .
So here .
I would say the needle .
I would like my arm , and I would show you that there are no ferred .
But I think in this context and with the idea of taking something false and transform it into something true , I &apos;m going to leave it from the stage .
We &apos;ll see different times in the next few days . I hope you don &apos;t see the hour .
So , in my life , I met a lot of fish .
I only love two .
The first one of a passionate story .
It was a beautiful fish , it &apos;s one of the most sold sold on the menu .
What fish !
It was better , it was better , and it came from a doctor of environmental standards of environmental .
So , you feel like to the consciousness in sell .
I was involved in a relationship with this beauty for different months .
One day , the head of the company called me and asked me to talk to a dedicated event to the environmental sustainability .
&quot; Of course , I said , &quot;
This was a company that was a company that was going to figure out what was an inimaginable problem for our chef .
How do we continue to have the fish in our menu ?
Over the last 50 years we weighed in the sees in the same way that we &apos;ve gotten to the soil .
The destruction has been tremendous .
90 percent of the great fish , the ones that we like so much the tons , the halized , the house , the fish saves are reduced by number .
There &apos;s not almost anything .
So , we like it , it &apos;s going to be part of our future .
There &apos;s a lot of contrary arguments .
The head of fish fishes , for the least majority of them , and they &apos;re inefficient . You take the ton for example .
A big problem is that there &apos;s a big problem is there of 15 to one .
That means that it takes 15 libers of wild fish to get a libunkely .
It &apos;s not very sustainable .
And it &apos;s also not a great knowledge .
So here , finally , there was a company that was trying to do it in the right way .
I wanted to help them .
And the day before I event , I phone call to the public relationships .
Let &apos;s call it .
&quot; Don , I said , &quot; so much to understand , you &apos;re famous to do so far , you &apos;re famous to do so far , in open , which you don &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; All , &quot; he said , &quot; We are so far from the coast that our scarts are dilited , not focused . &quot;
And then he said , &quot; We &apos;re basically a world . &quot;
&quot; The conversion rate ? 2.5 to one said . &quot;
&quot; The best in the sector . &quot;
2.5 to one , fantastic .
&quot; 2.5 to something ? What do you eat the fish ? &quot;
&quot; Proteins sustainable , he said . &quot;
&quot; Great , I said , &quot; I said .
The night , I was in bed , I thought : but the hell is a sustainable protein ?
So the next day , a little bit before the event , called Don again .
I said , &quot; Won , &quot; Do , I have some example of the proteins ? &quot;
He said that he didn &apos;t know , and he would asked around .
Well , I talked to a little bit about the company and no one sat me a precise response .
So , I finally talked to the biologist .
We also call him Don .
With , I said , &quot; Do you have some example of the sustainable protein ? &quot;
Well , he said , &quot; Well , he mentioned some flows , and he said , &quot; Pezes . &quot;
I said , &quot; Peze ? &quot;
He said , &quot; Yes , I think , bones , bones , bones , bones , bones and processed . &quot;
And I said , &quot; What percentage of your managed managed ? &quot;
I thought , let &apos;s say , the two percent .
&quot; Well , it &apos;s about 30 percent said . &quot;
And I said , &quot; With , what is there is to be sustainable to the fish of the chickens ? &quot;
There was a long because there was a longer , and then he said , &quot; There are too much chickens in the world . &quot;
I share about this fish .
No , not because they are one of those virtuoses of the good food and traditional food .
Well , to say the truth .
No , in fact , I told me about this fish because , I &apos;m slowed after that conversation , the fish knew .
The second fish is a different love story .
It &apos;s a romantic story that we know the fish .
I &apos;ve been it for the first time in a restaurant in the south Spain .
One of my frightened journalist talked about this fish .
Pratically had done it .
He came to the table , he had a brilliant color white , almost scines .
The chef was too much .
Proatically , the double of how cooking it .
Incredibility .
Who is able to make a fish so good after the stream ?
I don &apos;t , but that guy did .
Let Miguel .
It &apos;s actually called Miguel .
No , he didn &apos;t have the fish , and it &apos;s not a chef .
For not , in the sense that we mean .
It &apos;s a biologist in Vet . The Palma , which is a head of fish in the Western angle of the Spain in the Spain of the Guadquive .
At the 1980s , she was managed by the argentine .
They were bovins on what first was essentially a Paludous area .
They were given the Earth , and they had a tricate series in the river .
Well , they couldn &apos;t do the thing from the economic point .
And from ecological point of view , it was a disaster .
He had killed something like 90 percent of the birds and , considering the place , it &apos;s a lot of birds .
So , in 1982 , a company with an environmental consciousness bought the ground .
What did ?
They come up with the floating flow .
Literally , invertisity .
Instead of conwant to the water away from the ground , they used the channels to instead it .
They give all the channels .
They have a wild of fish from 27 thousand acrole , moving gambers and blood in this process , and in this process , Miguel and this process , Miguel and this process , Miguel and this process .
It &apos;s incredible .
I mean , you &apos;ve never seen something like this .
Look at the horizon that seems to be away a million miles , and all that you see are the songs of the inondrifying channels .
I was in a little time ago with Miguel .
It &apos;s an amazing three Charles Darwin and a quarter Crocodile Dune .
Okay ? We were doing this in the middle , and I was told , he switched , I had the fango to the knee and Miguel , howned her lesson of biology .
First of white .
And then it explains the minerals needs of the fitoplanes , and then you see a kind of fish that reminds the giraffs of Tanzania .
It turns out that Miguel has spent much of his house to the National Park Mikumi in Africa .
I asked him how it became an expert of fish .
He said , &quot; Press ? I don &apos;t know anything about fish .
I &apos;m an expert in relations . &quot;
And then I &apos;m going to launched in the birds , algae and high plants .
Not phrase , all this was very fascinating , which is , one thing like biotic community revealed at the natural state .
It &apos;s interesting , but I was in love with love .
And my mind is continued to rethink that dollar fish that I had been eating the evening evening .
So I said , &quot; Miguel , what does your fish so good ? &quot;
He started the algae .
&quot; I know , the algae , the fitoplancton , relationships , yes , it &apos;s incredible .
But your fish what do ?
What &apos;s your rate of food conversion ?
Well , I tell me about how their own is a rich system that the fish is so rich that the fish eat fish exactly what they &apos;re eating in a self-environment .
The biomass of plants , the fitoplancton , the zooplancton , it &apos;s all of the fish .
The system is so in the health of the health .
There are no manages .
Do you &apos;ve ever heard about a hallevent that it doesn &apos;t eat his animals ?
More later , I was driving around the ground with Miguel , and I said , &quot; At a place like this , it looks like this , it looks so natural that you &apos;ve ever seen , as you have ever seen the successful ? &quot;
In that precisely moment , it was as if the regist of a movie changed the set of the set .
We would have the corner and see a scene between the most incredible thousands and thousands and thousands of phenicity and thousands of phenicity .
&quot; That &apos;s the success , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Look them , they &apos;re red . &quot;
They &apos;re banking . &quot;
Good ? I was completely confused .
I said , &quot; Miguel , but they &apos;re not dropping with your fish ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; Let &apos;s about 20 percent of the fish and the fish eggs of birds .
Last year on this property , there were 6000,000 birds .
It has become the biggest and one of the most important private health care for birds in all the Europe . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Miguel , but a population of birds is not the last thing that you would like in a fish hallevent ? &quot;
It costs the head , no .
He said , &quot; We &apos;re extensive way not intensive .
This is a netecological network .
Fenicopters eat the leg .
Greeat the fitoplancton .
So , it &apos;s a little bit better , it &apos;s the best phenicopters is the system . &quot;
Okay , so we read : A track that doesn &apos;t get to eat its animals and his success at the bottom of his predators .
A height of fish , but also a lot of birds .
Ah , proposed , those phenicopters shouldn &apos;t even be there .
They do the nest in a house city 150 miles where the soil conditions are better for the nest buildings .
Every morning , they fly for 150 miles , and they come to hallevening and every night , you do 150 miles for the ritorn .
They do it because they &apos;re able to follow the white line of the A92 .
The seriously .
I would imagine something like penguins , so I looked at Miguel .
And I said , &quot; Miguel , fly for 150 miles until , and then fly 150 miles of the night to go back ?
They do it for their small ? &quot;
She looked at me as if I had just cited a song Whitney Houston .
He said , &quot; No , they do it because food is better . &quot;
I &apos;m not talking to you the skin of my fish frightened , and I usually , and I usually don &apos;t like the skin of the fish .
I don &apos;t like it .
It &apos;s that knowledge , like asphalt .
Not the cooks .
And yet , when I did it in that south in the south Spain didn &apos;t know for anything about the fish .
She had a sweet and clean was like giving a death at the ocean .
And I said this in Miguel , and he annuied .
He said , &quot; The skin is like a spread .
It &apos;s the last defense before anything in the fish .
It &apos;s evolved to keep impurity . &quot;
And then he said , &quot; But our water doesn &apos;t have impurity . &quot;
Okay . It doesn &apos;t feed his fish .
It measurements that the success of the success of his predators .
And then I realize that when he says the halleving has no minimum impurity very , very , very , because the water is from the River Guadquive , which is a river that is a river that is a river that it &apos;s a river that brings out with them all the things that the fields tend to bring around chemicals of fish .
And when it goes down the system , and it exes the water is more clean than when it went .
The system is so in the health , which cries the water .
So , not only a hallevent that doesn &apos;t just feel like his animals , not just a hallevent of his predators , but a trouble that it &apos;s literally an empirification of water , and not just for those fish and not only for those fish for me and you .
Because when the water comes in the Atlantic .
It &apos;s a drop in the ocean , I know , but I know , you should do it , and so you should do it , because this amazing story of how romantic love is also .
You could say that it &apos;s a recipe for the future of the good food is that you talk about fish .
So , what we need is a radically new conception of the agriculture in which the food has really good .
But for many people , this is a little radical .
We &apos;re not realists , we know about food .
We are loved .
We love the little agriculturs .
I love small familiar factories .
We talk about local food .
We go biological .
And when you say that these are the things that will make sure the future of the good food somewhere , and he says , &quot; Hey somewhere , and he says , &quot; Hey , you also like , &quot; Hey , but how do you think you can feed the entire world ?
How do you think about the world ? &quot;
Can I be sinct ?
It &apos;s a question that I don &apos;t like it .
No , not because we &apos;re produced enough calories that we can feed the world .
A billion people suffering the hunger today .
A billion -- more than you &apos;ve ever been -- because of the enormous drugs in the distribution in the distribution .
You see , I don &apos;t like this question because he has determined the logic of our food system in the last 50 years .
Taking cereal herbivors to the moculture , chemicals , chemicals chemicals to the fish , and all this period the industry has simply asked , &quot; If we can figure out , &quot; If we can fix more economic , what &apos;s there of wrong ? &quot;
This was the motivation .
It was the justification .
It &apos;s been the plan of American agriculture .
We should call it for what it is , an industry in a liquidation an industry that is fast heroding the ecological capital that makes the ecological capital of production .
This is not an industry , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
Our maybe threatened because of the forests in decline , but for the resources in decline , not for the last mechanic invention , but for the fertile land , not for the pumps , but for the weights , not for motor , but for the weights and not weight , but for the fish .
Do you want to feed the world ?
Let &apos;s start wondering : How are we going to feed ourselves ?
Or better , how can we create the conditions that convenient to every local community to feeding themselves ?
To do that , we don &apos;t look at the future of the future agricultural industry .
It &apos;s an old old and stanks .
It &apos;s all about capital , chemical and machines and machines , and it never produced anything good to eat it .
Instead , we look at the ecological model .
That &apos;s what it &apos;s about two billion years of experience on work .
We look at Miguel in Miguel , like Miguel , and fattories that are not just closed in the same factories that are not just closed in the same factories that reconsumption that are extensive instead of consumption that are not only producers but experts that are also experts in relationships , because they are the ones that are also experts in the knowledge .
If I have to be really cool , they &apos;re better chef than I could ever be me .
You know , it &apos;s good , because if that &apos;s the future of the good food , it &apos;s going to be true .
Thank you .
I grew up with a diet of phantom .
High high school , I had a hour and forward every day .
And I was always immerged in a book , a book of phantom , who brought my mind in other works , and satisfaced , in narrative shape , that insatiable sense that I had .
And that curiosity was manifested in the fact that every time I wasn &apos;t at school in the woods , for samamamples , I had them to the microst the micross the microscope .
I was a real geek of science .
But it was always trying to figure out the world , understanding the limits of possible .
And my love for the phantom , actually seemed to answer the world around me , because what it was going on , in the late 1960s -- we were going to go to the moon , we &apos;d exploring the depths of the ocean , Jacques Cousteau was in our wonderful documentary , Jacques Cousteau would show us animals and a wonderful world .
So , all seeing my passion for phantom .
And I was a artist .
I knew to draw . I had paint .
And because there were no video games . There were no video games in the computer movies , nor all these pictures in the media , I had to create these pictures in my mind .
As children , when we read a book , we all had to , and we had to put something on the screen of our minds .
And so , my answer was painting , drawing creatures , move creatures , robots , robots , all this stuff .
At the mathematics I was became book at the textbook back .
That because creativity had to find a way .
And it &apos;s something interesting happened , the Jacques Cousteau , Jacques Cousteau , they were involved in the earth .
Maybe I would never go to an alien the alien world on a space world .
He seemed very unlikely .
But that was a world where I could go to really , right here on the Earth , the richer and exotic than I could ever imagine .
So , I decided I would become a size of 15 years .
And the only problem was I lived in a small country in a small country in a small country in the closest ocean .
But I &apos;m not left .
I asked my father until he found a school in Buffalo school in Buffalo , New York just the border where we lived .
And so I could take the certificate in a YMCA in the YMCA in the winter full Buffalo , New York .
And I wouldn &apos;t have seen the ocean , for two years , until we transfer in California .
Since then , in the last 40 years , I spent about 3,000 hours , and 500 hours of these submersible .
And I learned that the depth of the ocean , even the oceans , even the oceans , as a surprising life that really goes on to the side of our imagination .
The imagination of nature is without confined to our human imagination .
Again , I &apos;m intideed from what I see when I do the immersions .
And my love history with the ocean continues , more stronger than ever has ever been .
But when I picked up a career , from adult , I picked up making movies .
He seemed to be the best way to concile this situation of stories with the smania of creating images .
And , from a guy , I was constantly drawn and so on .
So it was the only way to put together images and stories .
All back .
And obviously the stories that I choose to tell were stories of phantom , &quot; Termintator , &quot; Aliens &quot; and &quot; The Abyss . &quot;
And with &quot; The Abyss , I put my love for the depth and the immersions with the realization of a movie .
So , I did the two passions .
As &quot; The Abyss &quot; The Abyss out of something interesting that it was solving a specific issue in that movie , which is creating the kind of water creature of liquid water creature with the computers .
And so it was born the first death surface and animate computers that had ever seen in a movie .
And even though the movie didn &apos;t do a lot of money , I would say it was paid , I &apos;ve been paid out , I was textraordinary , all the audience was hypnotized by this apparent .
You know , it &apos;s the law of Arthur Clarke for which every technology sufficiently has been instinguable to the magic .
They were seeing something magic .
And this was very exciting .
And I thought , &quot; Fantastic , this is something that needs to be adopted in the Chinematographic art . &quot;
So , with &quot; Terminator 2 , my next movie , we &apos;ve gone .
Lavoring with the Industrial Light and Magic , we created the kinds of metal metal liquid in that movie . And the success of how it would work .
And it worked . And we had a new magic .
And we got the same result with a audience .
But we made a little bit more with that film .
So , by a line between these two experience of experience , I came to the conclusion that this would be a new world , it was a new world , it was a new world , it was a new world of creativity .
So , I put a society with a society with Stan Winston , my friend Stan Wistan , which was the main tricker and designers of creatures in that period , and we called it Digital Domain .
And the principle of the society was to leave the past , the analogical processes of the prints and so on , and go directly to the digital production .
And so we did , and he gave us a competitive advantage for a while .
But we are stayed back to half the 1990s in the 1990s in the 1990s , which is what we had the society .
So , I wrote this text called &quot; Avatar &quot; Avatar &quot; with the intention of visual effects , generated to the computers , with emotions and realistic characters and realistic realistic , and all the characters generated to the computer .
And the whole thing has been sent to the mitting .
The kids of society have told me that we wouldn &apos;t be able to do it for a little bit .
So , I accantoned it , and I did this movie of a big ship .
At the study , I was just like a &quot; Romeo and Giuliet on a ship . &quot;
It would be a time of love , a passional movie .
Sectively , what I wanted to do was immerged to see the release of &quot; Titanic . &quot;
That &apos;s why I did that film .
And it &apos;s the truth . He didn &apos;t know it .
But I convinced them . I said , &quot; We &apos;re going to stay to the release .
We &apos;ll use it for the beginning of the movie .
It &apos;s going to be very important . It will be a gang of fantastic marketing . &quot;
And I convinced them to finance a expedition .
It looks like crazy . But this brings us back to the imagination that creates the reality .
Because we actually created a reality and six months later , I found on a submersible Russix to two and a half depth of the North Atlantic in the North Atlantic , not in a movie , not in a movie , but to really .
I was must be balordied .
And it took a lot of preparation , we had to build Chinese and lights and a lot of other things .
But I was fulled by the deep diving , it was like a space mission .
Where all was high technical and requires have huge planning .
You put you in this capsule , go down to this hostiles where there are no hoptiles where there are no hopefully saved , where you can &apos;t go back from one .
And I thought , &quot; Fantastic . It &apos;s like to live in a phantom movie .
It &apos;s really great . &quot;
And so , I was affected from death of the depth of the ocean .
Of course , the curiosity , the scientific component .
It was all .
It was curiosity . It was imagination .
And it was an experience that Hollywood didn &apos;t offer .
Of course , I could imagine what a creature and creature visual effect . But I couldn &apos;t imagine what I could see out of oblah .
In our next expeditions , I &apos;ve seen creatures , and , sometimes , things I had never seen before , things I had never seen before , things I had never seen before , things that had never been described by science at the time that we &apos;ve seen them and imagine .
So I was all about this , and I had to do more .
So I took a curious decision .
After the success of &quot; Titanic , &quot; I said , &quot; Okay , &quot; OK , I &apos;m part of my job of the Hollywood , and I do the explorer at the time for a while . &quot;
So we started planning these expeditions .
We found it to go to Bismark and exploring it with robotic vehicles .
We come back to the released Titanic .
We had small robots that we had a little robot .
And the idea was to go inside and do an inside of the ship , which was never done .
Nobody had ever watching inside the release . They didn &apos;t have the means to do it , we created the technology to do it .
So , here I am on the Titanic bridge , sat in a submersible , watching the ases that seemed just like this , where I knew that they had the violinists .
And I &apos;m driving a little robotized vehicle across the ship of the ship .
When I say it , I &apos;m driving it , but my mind is in the vehicle .
It seemed me to be physically present inside the Titanic .
And it was the most surreal experience is going to have ever lived , because before I had ever lived , because I &apos;d already first I knew what it would be behind , before the lights of the vehicle , because I had perspective the movie .
And the set was based on an exactly the ship of the ship .
So it was absolutely experience .
And it really made me realized that in the experience of the telepresence that you can experience these robots , the mind is injected in the vehicle , the mind is injected in this form of existence .
It was very profound .
And it may be a small assage of what could happen between some decade when we start to figure out to the cyborg for the explorations or other reasorations or other reasons that I can imagine , that I can imagine , as I can imagine , as many of the phantascience that they are .
So , we &apos;ve done these expeditions , and we actually started to appreciate what was there , like the opening of the ocean open of the ocean opens where there were these animals .
Actually , I &apos;m aliens right here on Earth .
They live in a chemosintese environment .
They don &apos;t survive in a system based based on light as we do .
So , you see animals that live neighborhood to 500 degrees centigrade .
It looks like even impossible .
At the same time , I was very interested in the space science , again , it &apos;s the flu of phantom .
And I ended up in the environment , really involved with NASA , sitting in NASA , sitting in NASA , to planning space , go to Russia , go to Russia , go to Russia , go to Russia , and all these things , to fly the international station with our cameras 3D .
It was fascinating .
But what I ended to do is to bring the space scientists with us in the major scientists .
And to bring them down because they could have access -- astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people interested in these environments , and allow them down and allow them to see , test and so on .
So , we were making the documentary , but we actually did we actually have the science , space science .
I was closed the broken between being failed , to do those things for really .
And you know , during this path of discovery , I learned a lot .
I learned a lot about science . But I also learned a lot about leadership .
Everybody thinks that a has to be a leader , the capital of the ship , or something like this .
I didn &apos;t know anything leadership before I do all those expeditions .
Why am I going to have to say , &quot; What am I doing out here ?
Why am I doing it ? What do I do ? &quot;
You don &apos;t get anything to do all these spectacles .
Now , we &apos;re going to be in parts . There &apos;s no famous .
People think about almost me that I went between &quot; Titanic &quot; and &quot; Avatar &quot; and &quot; Avatar &quot; and &quot; Avatar &quot; and &quot; Avatar on some beach .
I did all of these movies , all these documentary documentary .
No famous , no glory , no glory , nothing money . What am I doing ?
I &apos;m doing it for the task in it , for the challenge -- and the ocean is the biggest challenge that exists , for the task of the discovery , and the strange of people shaped a team of people shaped a team of a very compact .
Because we did all with 10-12 people , working together for years .
Sometimes in the sea for 2-three months of file .
And in that bond , you realize that the important thing is the important thing is the respect that they have for you , when you &apos;ve got a task that you can &apos;t explain anybody else .
When you come back to the ground , and he explains , &quot; We had to do this , and the fiber optical , and this , and that , and that , and that , all the technology , and the difficulty , the expects of human perfect when you work in the sea -- you can &apos;t explain it . That maybe what maybe only have the police or the soldiers that have some police or the soldiers that have something together .
Creating a bond , create a bond of respect .
When I came back to do my next movie , which is &quot; Avatar , &quot; Avatar , &quot; I tried to applicate the same principle of leadership and changes me .
It &apos;s really changed the dynamic .
And so here I was still once with a small group , in territory , in territory to do &quot; Avatar with new technologies that had no existed before .
Terribly emotional .
Tremendly engineering .
And we became a family , in four and a half years .
And it changed my way to make movies .
People commented to say that I took the organisms from the ocean and I put them on the planet .
For me , it was the essence of the way to do business , it was changed .
What can we stop ?
What are the lessons we learned ?
I think the first curiosity .
It &apos;s the most powerful thing we can .
The imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality .
And the respect of the group is more important than all of the world .
The people registers come from me , and they say , &quot; Let me have some advanced to do this . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Don &apos;t brietable .
Other people are going to do that for you , not do it by yourself .
And you will run . &quot;
At NASA says , &quot; The mistake is not contempled . &quot;
But the error has to be an option in the art and exploration , because it &apos;s how to do a jump in the vacuum .
And no important attempt that innovation was done without risk .
You have to have to run these risks .
This is the thinking that I want to leave you , which is that in whatever you do , the mistake is an option , but the fear isn &apos;t . Thank you .
If I wanted to tell you one big idea that the data would be a great idea of the data that we consume is bigger than his parts , and that , and that , instead of thinking about too much information , I &apos;d like to use information to make new trends so that we can use the information to make new trends , otherwise new trenvisible .
Here you see the statistics of organized mortality .
This tool that I use is a small experiment .
It &apos;s called Pivot , and with Pivot , I can choices a single cause of death , we say the accidents .
And we can see new relationships .
The reason is that in the central part , the central part of the people are more fragile .
We can do a step back and reorganize the data for death , we see that we can see circulatories and cancer are are the majories , but not for everybody .
If we go on and filtering for age , we &apos;re under the 40 , we see that the incidents are the death of which worried about .
Since closer , it works for men .
So , you &apos;ll figure out that you can visualize information and data in these way , it &apos;s a little bit like swimming in a set of information .
And if we can do it with data , why don &apos;t we do it with the content ?
For example , we have the cover of all Sports Ilustrated .
Everything .
You can come in your room and try and try and try and try and try .
With Pivot you can see a decade .
Or a specific year .
You can solar a number in particular .
For example , we take the athletes that look in this number , their sports .
I &apos;m a fan of Lance Armstrong , so I clicked here and I see all the numbers where Lance Armstrong .
Now , if I want to give us a look , I could think , &quot; Why don &apos;t I look at all the cycle ? &quot;
I do a step back and trade the visual .
And I see Greg Lemond .
So , you know , you know , when you navigate the information in this way closer or more away , and it &apos;s not just a research , it &apos;s not just a research , it &apos;s not the usual browser .
But do something slightly different .
It &apos;s a way of medium that we can use information .
We know this idea that can look like a little crazy .
We &apos;ve taken every single page of Wikipedia , and we reduce it to a short reasses a short reasses a little synosses .
I just show you the first 500 of the most visit on Wikipedia .
Even in this limited screen we can do very much .
You realize what tematic areas are the most visit on Wikipedia .
At this selection point the government of government .
And this option we see that the Wikipedia categories of Wikipedia categories of the Ann Time Magazine Time Magazine .
This is significant because it makes something that in Wikipedia pages .
And you can only see it a step back to see this .
If I take one of these reassuring , I can zoomar on category , &quot; Personaggi in the Ann Time Magazine .
and see them .
So , I see most of the government comes from government . Some from the world of science . It &apos;s a small number of business .
That &apos;s my head .
One is from the music .
And , pretty interesting , Bono has also won a TED prize .
So let &apos;s go to see all the winners of the TED prize .
For the first time , we &apos;re really network as if it was a network , it &apos;s not page , but to a high experior .
I want to show you another thing that may surprise you .
This is the site of the New York Times .
Pivot , this application -- we don &apos;t call the browser , because it &apos;s not a browser , but it &apos;s not a browser , we add this technology for any web page , like this .
I can make a step back , and I can come back to a specific section . This is important because the web pages I can see all my navigation in the Internet at the same identical way .
I can zooman about what I &apos;ve done in moments .
So , here you can see the state of the demo that I just presented .
I can actually see other things that I &apos;ve seen in day .
If I want to do a step back and see all I can do the pieces of my research or the historic of my research .
I was looking at the newspaper , I was looking at Bing engine , here for Live Labs Pivot .
And from here I can zooman on my Web and just throw up here .
One metaphor reused many times , and in every case the result is higher than the result is higher than parts ,
So , in the world , the data are seen as a kind of disease .
It &apos;s talking about information .
It &apos;s talking about annegar in data .
And if we put it all the subset that if we put the web under the Web that we were going to go from one thing to the other , would we get to spend a lot of other structures and then could see those structures that otherwise that otherwise would be hidden ?
And then instead of being instead of the data , we could really extract information .
Instead of all of information , we can pull out of knowledge .
And from the knowledge of knowledge .
And with this , thank you .
So , these everybody &apos;s talking about happiness .
I asked to count the number of books containing the word &quot; happiness &quot; in the title and published the last five years , have stopped to move after the last five years .
There &apos;s a huge wave of interest on happiness , between researchers .
There &apos;s a lot of coaching .
Everybody would like to make people happy .
But nonetheless this flows of work , there are a series of cognitive , &quot; that somehow to make it impossible elaborate ideas on the happiness .
My talk about today is going to be above these cognitive traph .
And it &apos;s about people who think about their happiness , and it looks like , and it &apos;s studies that study happiness , because we are confused as everybody else .
The first one of these traph is the reuttance to admit complexity .
It turns out that the word happiness is not a word like a word useful word as we call it too many camps .
I think it can restrain it to a particular meaning particular meaning , but in the massive line , we &apos;re going to have to adopt the most complicated view of the most complicated vision than what the &quot; wealth . &quot;
The second transplane is the confusion between experience and memory : in practice is to choose to choose between being happy and happy to be happy , or happy about their life .
And these are two extremely different concepts , both part of the concept of happiness .
And the third is the illusion of the focus is the unfortunate that we can &apos;t think about any circumstance that influence on the well-being unfortunate .
I mean , it &apos;s a real cognitive .
and there &apos;s no way to do the right thing .
I &apos;d like to start with an example of one person who , after a session of questions and answers , after my lesson , he told a story .
&#91; unclear &#93; Disse that while listening a symphony of music absolutely magnificent sound , you &apos;ve heard a terribly stride it .
And then he added , in a very emotional way , he had rovinated the entire experience .
But it wasn &apos;t true .
And what was running was the remember of the experience .
He had the experience .
And he had heard for 20 minutes of the wonderful music .
but it wasn &apos;t content for anything , because he remembered a certain remembered , and the remember was remember all .
What this episode tells us , in the bottom , is that we may think about ourselves and other people in terms of two , &quot;
There &apos;s a lot of experiences , and it lives in the present and knows the present , and it &apos;s capable of the present , and it &apos;s capable of the present .
It &apos;s about the &quot; that lives the experiences , &quot; and what the doctor is going to -- you know when the doctor asks , &quot; You know when the doctor ask , &quot; You know , when you touch here ? &quot;
And then there &apos;s the &quot; is that it remember , it &apos;s the &quot; is that it remember &quot; that reminds the history of the story of our life , and it &apos;s what the doctor is that the doctor is that the doctor is that the doctor is that the doctor is that the doctor is that the doctor is that the doctor is that the doctor is that the doctor is that the doctor doctor is that it &apos;s &quot; which the doctor is that the doct
or &quot; How did your journey in Albania ? &quot; or something like it .
Those are two different entities , the themselves that lives an experience and what if you remember , and confuse between the two is part of the confusion of happiness .
The evening is that remind , it &apos;s a storytelling .
And this process starts with a fundamental answer of our reminds -- it starts immediately .
We don &apos;t tell stories just when we decide to tell them .
Our memory tells us storytells us stories , which is a story of our experiences is a story .
Let me start with an example .
This is an old study .
which report the experiences of two patients during a patients .
I &apos;m not going to myself in detailed . It &apos;s not even sweet a day , but it was painful in the 1990s .
He asked the patients to bring their pain every 60 seconds .
And here are the results for two patients .
The ones are their results .
If you &apos;re asking , &quot; Who of the two of the most ? &quot;
It &apos;s a very simple question .
Clearly , the Patient B has suffered more .
His colonscopies over and for every minutes of pain from the patient to the patient B has suffered at least as much .
But now , there &apos;s another question , &quot; How much these patients think they have suffered ? &quot;
and that &apos;s the surprise : Oxy the Patient A had a remember of the Patient B.
The stories of colonies were different given that a particularly part of the procedure is the way of the procedure is how termines -- no one of these stories are particularly positive -- but one of the two is particularly positive -- one of the two is particularly worse .
And the worst is that where the pain was very final time .
It &apos;s a negative story .
How do I know it ?
Why did we ask these people after the colonscreen , and even distance of time , &quot; How much negative has been the experience , &quot; How much negative was the experience , everything considered ? &quot;
And he results of a lot of worse for B , in the remember .
So , this is a direct conflict between the sis that lives the experiences and the sis that the reminds .
From the point of view that it lives the experience , it &apos;s clear that B has suffered .
So , what you could do for the patient A , and we &apos;ve actually been doing experiments , and it &apos;s really been done , and it &apos;s actually been done , and it &apos;s actually been done , and it &apos;s actually been done , and it &apos;s been done .
This is going to have a little bit of pain in the patient , but only a little less than before .
And I &apos;m doing this for a couple of minutes , the sis that lives the experience of the Patient is going to be worse , and the set is that remember the experiences of the Patient is going to be much better than his experience .
How do you call a story ?
And this is true for the stories that are from the remember that for the stories that we invention . What we call a story , is the changing moments and the final moments .
The finals are very , very important and , in this case , the final has dominated .
So , the sis that lives the experiences lifetime .
Does where it lives experiences that come out . And what happens ?
And the answer is simple .
They &apos;re lost forever , that most of the moments of our life -- for how I calculated them -- I mean the present psychological psychological psychological is going to be about 600 million in a month , which means that in a month .
Most of most of them are completely ignored by the reminds .
And yet , in some way you have the sensation that should have to count , that what happens in these moments of experience is our life .
It &apos;s the limited resources that we &apos;re spending as we are in this world .
And how to spend it , it would be relevant , but it &apos;s not the story that sets is that reminds for us .
So we have a slide and it is that it &apos;s alive experiences are different enough .
The biggest difference between two is how to treat the time .
From the point of view is that lives the experiences , if you go in the vacation , and the second week is fun as much as the first one , then the vacation of two weeks is two times better than a weeks .
But this is not absolutely the way it works is that remind .
For the themselves that remember , a two weeks is really better than a week of a week of a week of vacation because there are no new rememmemory in addition .
You didn &apos;t change the story .
And in this way , time is the critical variable variable , which distinguishment is that it lives the experiences .
The time has limited impact on this story .
Well , the sis that it remember the experiences is that remember and tell stories .
It &apos;s actually the squeen that takes decisions because , if we consider a patient who had , for two different colonies with two different medical colonies , and he &apos;s decided that he was going to choose , what he choose is what the remember &quot; negative &quot; , &quot; and what it &apos;s going to be the doctor that &apos;s going to be choken .
The sis that lives the experiences doesn &apos;t have voice in these choices .
In fact , we don &apos;t choose between experiences , but among the reminds of those experiences .
And even when we think about our future , we don &apos;t think about our future as experiences .
We think about our future as anticipate memories .
So , you can consider this situation , as a tyranny of sets that remember , and you can think of the themselves is that remind as if the source is that it lives the experiences of which is lives the experiences that lives the experiences that lives the experiences , it doesn &apos;t need .
I have the feeling that when we go to the vacation is often the case that , it &apos;s going to be the services of our source is that reminds .
And this is a little difficult to justify .
Okay , how do we consume , &quot; our memories ?
This is one of the explanations that &apos;s given for the predomination is that it remember .
When I think about that , I &apos;m a vacation in the Antarctica of a few years ago , which is one of the best vacances of my life , and what I think relatively relatively others .
And I probably spent to think of the remember that journey of three weeks , for 25 minutes in the last four years .
If I &apos;ve ever opened up with the 600 photographs of the journey , I would have spent another hour of journey that &apos;s translated in a journey hour and a half hour .
Well , I may be a little extreme in my appeared , in my appear for the consumption of remember , but even though you did more than that , a question is .
Why are we so much weight to the weight that we have experiences ?
Now , I want you to think about an experiment with thinking .
Imagine that in the next vacances , you know that the end of the vacances all the photographs will be destroy , and you &apos;re going to take a medical amnesia because you don &apos;t remember anything .
Would you choices the same vacation ? And if you could choose a different vacation , you would create a conflict between the two sets and you have to think about how to solve that conflict and you have to think of how to solve that conflict , it &apos;s not so obvious because if you think in terms of time , you &apos;ll have an answer .
And if you think in terms of reminds , you could get another answer .
And the because we choose the vacation that we do , it &apos;s a problem that puts in front of the two choices .
The two of journey of happy .
There &apos;s actually two concepts of happy that we can use , one for every night .
So what can you ask : How much happy is it makes experience ?
And then you can ask : How much happy is the moments in the life of the sources ?
And it &apos;s about -- happiness for moments is a complicated process .
What are the emotions that we can measure ?
And by the way , we are able to do a good idea of the happiness of the happiness is that lives the experiences in time .
If you look at the happiness of the sis that remember , it &apos;s a completely different thing .
It &apos;s not how happy a person alive .
It &apos;s about how satisfied or comfortable is the person when he think about his life .
It &apos;s a very different idea .
Anyone can &apos;t be able to distinguished these two notions , it &apos;s not going to make confusion of happiness , and I love a bunch of a group of group of well-being , which have been compiled the studies of happiness for a long period in this way .
The difference between the happiness of sounds that lives the experiences and the satisfaction of the sounds that remember has been recognized in the last few years , and there are now of forced to measure the two separately , the Gallup has a sleep at at the level of the life and their experiences .
And there were other studies in this direction .
So in the last few years , we started to learn about the happiness of two sounds .
And the biggest lesson that we &apos;ve learned , is that they &apos;re very different .
You may know how much a person is satisfied with your life , and it doesn &apos;t tell you very much about how they &apos;re living your life , and it doesn &apos;t tell you a lot about how they &apos;re living your life and neighborhood .
To give you an idea of correlation , correlation is about 0.5 .
What if you means if you meet somebody , and they said , &quot; oh , his father is 1,80 feet along how would you know about her altitude ?
Well , you &apos;d know something about his height , but with a lot of uncertainty .
You would always have a little bit of uncertainty .
If I tell you that somebody thinks that his life is at eight in a scale from one to 10 to be very uncertaints about how happy they are with their themselves .
So the correlation is low .
We have a certain knowledge of the satisfaction of happy .
We know that money is very important , the goal is very important , the goal is very important .
We know that being happy to be happy , it means to be satisfacts with the people who like us , and they like it .
There are some other pleases , but these are the major .
So , if you want to male the happiness of two sets is , you &apos;re going to end up , you &apos;re doing very different things .
The conclusion of what I told is that we shouldn &apos;t think about happiness as one of the wealth .
It &apos;s two completely different ideas .
In more , very quickly , another reason why we can &apos;t think about the happiness is that we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we don &apos;t have attention to the same things when we think about life .
So , if you do the simple question about how happy people in California , you can &apos;t get the correct answer correct .
When you do this question , think you should be more happy in California , which in Ohio .
What happens is that when you think about life in California , you &apos;re thinking about contrast between California and other places , and for that confront is on climate .
Well , it turns out that climate isn &apos;t important for source is that lives the experiences and it &apos;s not very important to the sounds that it &apos;s what they decides are .
But sure the sounds that it &apos;s in charge , you could end -- some people could end , some people could finally , transfer in California .
And it &apos;s interesting .
Well , the sis that lives the experiences will not become happy .
We know it .
But what it &apos;s going to happy . They &apos;ll be more happy , because when they think about it , they will remember how terrible it was time in Ohio .
And they &apos;re going to think of the right decision .
It &apos;s very hard to think of well-being , and I think I &apos;ve given you the idea of how difficult is .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you .
Thank you very much .
When we were at the telephone to a couple of weeks ago , I mentioned that an interesting result from the Gallup .
Is it something that think we could shared that we still have a few minutes ?
Daniel Kahneman : Yes .
I think the most interesting result that we found in the Gallup is a number , which we found in the Gallup is a number , which we had no expected to find .
We found that , with reference to the happy of the sounds that lives experiences .
When we observed as the feelings with the income with the income , we discovered that , we discovered that , at the bottom of a 60,000 dollars a year , for Americans , on a study of a studio sample of about 600,000 Americans , it &apos;s a sample of 600,000 dollars a year .
CA : 60,000 DK : 60,000 dollars a year , people are happy , people are happy , and they become progressively , and they become progressively as poor , Al of above that , we find a foot line .
I mean , I &apos;ve seen up .
Clearly , what happens is that the money doesn &apos;t buy the happiness of experience , but the lack of money certainly buy misery , and we can measure that very quickly .
In terms of the other sis , the remember , it &apos;s all another story .
Agans , more than you are .
This talk doesn &apos;t regardless about emotions .
CA : But Danny , all the efforts of the Americans are about life , freedom , the research of happiness .
If people get seriously this discovery , in practice , you know what we &apos;ve believed , for example , the politics on the pockets and so on .
Is there the possibility that politicians , and the country in general , can take a discovery as that seriously and bring forward a public policy based on it ?
DK : You know I think I recognize the role of happiness in public politics .
The press of consideration will be slow in the United States there is no doubt , but in the U.K. is becoming reality , and in other states .
People are starting to recognize that they should think about happiness when they think about public politics .
It &apos;s going to be there and people are going to begin to discuss if they want to study the experience of happiness or whether they want to study the values of life that we need to begin this debate .
As the happiness , it takes different directions of how you think about how you think , and you think of what you think is that it &apos;s remember or you think it is that it makes the experiences .
That &apos;s all influences the politics , I think , in the years that will come .
In the United States , they are doing the efforts to measure the experience of happiness .
And that , I think , it &apos;s going to be part in the next decade , maybe two , the national statistics .
CA : Well , it seems like this argument will be , or not should be , the most interesting political discussion of political political in the next years .
Thank you very much for the behavioral economy .
Thanny Kahny Kahneman .
I &apos;m going to talk about energy and climate .
It can seem strange , because in my work on the foundation of vaccines and seeds , things to invent the world to help the world to help the two billion people more poorest lives .
But climate and energy , I am extremely important for these people , are more important for people , are more important for them that for everybody else in the world .
A worst climate means , for many years , loss of collection .
It &apos;s going to fall , or too much .
The things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply can &apos;t sustain .
which leads to the hunger . It &apos;s conflicts .
So the climate cambers are going to be terrible .
Even the cost of energy is , for them .
In fact , if you could lead the price of one thing , to reduce the poverty , you would choices the energy .
The price of energy is write in time .
And a design civilization , because of course , in the energy field .
The coal revolution revolution that industrial .
And even in the 19th century , we &apos;ve been to a quick decline in the electricity , which explains why we have frigerators , conditioners , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
So in the rich world , so we are as the electricity in a eccellent situation .
But as the price goes down , for example of the half , we have to respect a new vine , the vincing of CO2 emissions .
The CO2 is scaling the planet , and his equation is very simple .
The CO2 emit causes a temperature , which induce really negative effects .
And the climate and , maybe worse , even worse , Indirect effects in the sense that natural ecosystem can &apos;t look at these changes .
The valuation of how the temperature because of a cause of a CO2 date , and how each one of the two things that are worse , it &apos;s uncertainly inty , but not very much .
And there &apos;s certainly uncertainly about how negative will be effects , but it &apos;s certainly negative .
At the best scientists in the best scientists : we really have to really reduce emissions ?
Don &apos;t we just reduce half or a quarter ?
And the answer is , until we &apos;re going to be almost zero , the temperature will continue to go up .
It &apos;s a big challenge , so .
It &apos;s not like to say , &quot; Let &apos;s make a high-field a 3,5 feet a bridge three . &quot;
It &apos;s not about &quot; leave it a little bit . &quot;
It &apos;s about zero to zero .
Now , we have a lot of CO2 every year , over 26 billion tons of tons of tons .
About 20 tons for every American .
For the poorest countries , it &apos;s less than a tons .
The world &apos;s average is about five tons .
And in some way , we have to do progress that quantity to zero .
Demissions are so constantly increased .
Only some economic changes have changed this tendency , so we have to spend from increasingly declining to zero .
This equation has four factors .
It &apos;s a series of multiplications .
We have the amount on the left , the CO2 , which must be blue , and the factors on the right is the population , the services that in average every person uses , the media energy requires .
We &apos;re going to get each factor and see how we can get it .
Probably , one of these numbers must lead to zero .
It &apos;s algebra high of high school .
Let &apos;s see a little bit .
The first factor is population .
The world has today 6.8 billion people today .
We go to the nine billion .
If we do a good job with new vaccines , health , health , we can decrease it , we can decrease it , maybe 10 , 15 percent , but we recording a 30 percent .
The second factor is the services that we use .
The food that we eat , the food that we eat , the TV , the TV , the scaling .
They &apos;re willing things , and freezing of poverty means to give these services for almost everybody in the world .
And it &apos;s a positive thing that number .
In the rich world , in the rich world , we may probably be saved and use less , but in average , every year , this will probably be .
And therefore , complext , the amount of services that are going to be more than double .
This is a very simple example of service .
You have the illumination in your house , to do the tasks , but these guys are not , so they &apos;re going to read them , and they read their tasks .
At the efficiency -- and , the energy for the unit of service -- there are good news .
This factor is not increasing .
Thank you .
In some services , you can reduce 90 percent .
There are other services , like fertilizers , like the fertilizers , or airplane , where the margins of improvements are very , very nice .
So , complex in the best of the cases , the consumed energy will be reduce from three to perhaps .
But these early three factors are reduction from 26 to the best emissions , maybe 13 billion tons of tons .
It &apos;s not enough .
We look at the fourth factor , the key factor , the amount of CO2 emits to power .
The question is , can we reduce a zero ?
If you burn coal , no .
If you burn gas , no .
Almost all of the ways to produce electricity , except the rept and nuclear and nuclear , they emit CO2 .
So , what we &apos;re going to do on global scale , it &apos;s creating a new system .
And we need &quot; miracles . &quot;
Col termine , I don &apos;t mean something impossible .
The microprocessor is a miracle . The personal computer is a miracle .
The Internet , and his services , I &apos;m a miracle .
People here today have a lot of miracles .
We don &apos;t have a screen , we have a date in which to the miracle .
It &apos;s usually on the window and something happens , something else not .
In this case , we have to drive all speeds , and do a miracle in a very ridge time .
I wondered , how do this concept ?
Is there some natural example , some demonstration that caught the imagination of people ?
I thought about a year ago , when I brought nets , and people found it fun , and people found it fun .
She made them of the fact that , in the world , there are people who are people who convious with the mosquitoes .
This is my idea for energy .
I decided that the lights would be this year my contribute to the environment .
Here are the lights .
They &apos;re telling me that it wasn &apos;t , you know , they could not get out of the board .
So now , we can invent it as this , but they won &apos;t be help .
We need solutions , one or many directions , one or a lot of scale and very reliable , and very reliable , and although it &apos;s being exploring in many directions , I think that only five can surprises .
I got the marries , the geothermal , nuclear fusion , nuclear fusion .
They can also give some contributes , and if they can do more than it , and if they can do more than it , but I &apos;m interested in that we &apos;ll have to work on each of these five , and not required that we &apos;re going to have to work on each other , and not requires .
We &apos;re going to get the first bustion of fossil fossil fossil fuels , or natural gas that it is .
The task of our tasks , but it &apos;s not , and it &apos;s not , and it &apos;s caught the CO2 , after the combustion , pressurizing it , putting it , putting it , putting it on it .
Now , there are experimental technologies that caught the 60 -- 80 percent of CO2 , but reach the 100 percent will be very complicated , and it &apos;s going to be very difficult , and it &apos;s going to be very complicated , and it &apos;s going to be very complicated .
The most pushing issue is that long period .
Who will trust ?
Who will be something that is literally billions of times the fluminy of all kinds of imaginable images , like nuclear or whatever ?
It &apos;s a huge volume .
So it &apos;s a difficult problem .
Another source would be nuclear .
But also the nuclear is three big problems .
The cost , especially in the very regulation , it &apos;s high .
The issue of security , the security issues that nothing can go wrong , sick the emplant is manufacturing human operators , and that the combustible doesn &apos;t be used to be used to beautiful .
And how do you run the scories ?
By the amount of reduced , the worries are so many .
People need to be rassurated .
So , very difficult problems , so that you could solve , and so what you should work .
The last three of the five sources , I &apos;ve gotten them .
They are what people often call &quot; rinnovable . &quot;
And to say the real amount of the great advantage that doesn &apos;t required a combustible , they present some advantages .
The first one is that the density of products with these technologies is really inferior to that one central central central .
It &apos;s about &quot; collecting energy , and so many miles of square kilometers of squareas of a normal normal normal central .
And also these sources are intermyths .
The sun doesn &apos;t share all the day , nor all the day , and even the wind has always been suffy .
So , if you depend on these sources , you have to find a way to be electric energy , even when the source doesn &apos;t produce .
The challenges are attend to the front of the costs .
And the distribution .
For example , we say this energy source is at the end .
So not only you need technology , but you have to do the technology , but you &apos;ve got to do the connects of approvide .
And finally , the problem of accumulation .
To stimate the dimensions of the problem , I analyzed all kinds of bacterial electricity , computers , telephones , I confronted it with the amount of energy electric power electrical power .
So we really need a big step on , a huge of 100 times than the approach to the approaches now in use .
which is not impossible , but it &apos;s not very simple .
This problem has already been manifest when the intermittens to produce more than , we say , 20 or 30 percent of the energy consumed .
If you get those sources for the 100 percent , you need a miraculous bacteria . &quot;
But how are we going to have this road ? What &apos;s the right approach ?
Is it a Manhattan ? What could solve ?
A lot of companies , hundreds , must have to work .
We need at least people in each one of these five sectors .
Most of them , you would call them , you would call them . That &apos;s good .
And I think that in the TED group , many people are already working in these fields .
Bill Gross has different companies , between which one called the eSolar Solar that vanta big technologies .
Vinod Khosla is investing in the dozens of companies that are doing great things , and they have interesting things , and I &apos;m just giving my support to all this .
Nathan Myhrvold , and I are funding a company that , will surprising you , follow the nuclear road of nuclear .
There are some innovations in the run , the nuclear nuclear , nuclear liquid .
But from a little bit of time , the sector is hoping , that there are some good ideas around .
The idea of Terraper is that , instead of the uranium , just part of the uranium , the U235 , one percent of the uranium uranium , we decided to buranium . It &apos;s a crazy idea , in a certain sense .
For the truth for a long time , but it &apos;s never been adequately proved if it would work or not , or not because it would work or not , and you can do a simulation and see that , with the justic materials , it would be going to work .
And since it &apos;s 99 percent of the uranium , the structure of the uranium cost right now .
They burn the scories , and they use how combustible the reactors of the reactors of today , which are becoming , from the problem that they were , a resource to be .
You consume the uranium combustion . It &apos;s a kind of candy .
It &apos;s like a wood wood that burn . It &apos;s often called progressive .
From the point of the combustible the problem is solved .
Here &apos;s a picture of a place in Kentucky .
This is the scaring , 99 percent of the uranium , which has been a lot of the combustible , and so it &apos;s called uranium impoverwhelmed .
These &quot; expensive the United States for centuries .
And by moving the sea water , with an economic process , there would be enough for the rest of the life of this planet .
So , a lot of challenges us , but this is an example of the hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to design .
How would we measure our progress ?
What should they have the paid ?
We &apos;re going to fix the goal , and then we valve the intermeans .
You &apos;ve heard a lot of people talk about an 80 percent reduction for 2050 , it &apos;s very important to be able to do it .
20 percent will be produced by the poor countries , and from a little agriculture .
At that point , hopefully , we &apos;ll solve the deforestation and production .
To come to the 80 percent , so , the nations developed , including nations like China , will have to replace their electric production .
The other question is : are we doing this technology to zero ?
Do we put it in practical countries ?
Are we spread it .
It &apos;s very important .
It &apos;s a key key element .
Actually , what would it look like to be the 2020 ?
Even that should have the same two aspects .
We should implementary efficiency of efficiency to start reductions .
Let &apos;s look at the total amount of CO2 , and so the temperature .
But the vote in this matter , to do things that not behavior reductions , it &apos;s just a weight or even lightly left , which is the speed of innovation of new inventions .
We have to push these progress to all speed , and we can measure the speed from the number of companies , regulations of regulations .
Most of books have been written about it .
The Al Gore , &quot; The book , &quot; The Choice , &quot; and the David McKay , &quot; Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air Gore . &quot;
These books deep the problem and create a context in which to be a context , because these things need to be a sustained substantially .
A lot of things have to have to get contemporary .
So I have a wish .
A very remarkable desire that we &apos;re going to put the technology needs .
And if I had to choose one wish for the next 50 years , between : I could choose the president of the country , the realization of a vaccine , which I have to make this vaccine thing that &apos;s going on , and it doesn &apos;t produce CO2 , I would choose this last last .
It would be the major impact .
If this wisn &apos;t going to do it , the fracture between who thinks and the long-term and the long-term , between the United States and China , between poor countries , and it &apos;s going to be terrible , the life of those two billion people will be great worse .
So what we have to do we have to do ?
What I &apos;m invited to get the beginning and process ?
It &apos;s needed a major of the research .
When countries get together in places like Copenhagen , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about CO2 .
They should be talking about the innovations of innovations , and you would have to stupid you about these innovative approaches .
We need incentives , taxes on CO2 , the CO2 , CO2 , the way , the tools that evidence the cost of the pollution .
We have to spread the message .
We have to make this more rational dialogue and understandable , and it has to include the government choices .
It &apos;s a wish commitment , but I think it realizable .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you .
Thank you . Just to know more about Terraper , here &apos;s --
first of all , can you give us a sense of the size of investment ?
Bill Gates : Realizing the software , to buy the supercomputers , assuming all the great scientists , which we &apos;ve done , it only requires of millions , and even when we have testing the materials in a reactor , to be sure that &apos;s going to have to talk about hundreds of millions .
The difficult thing is to build the pilota , find variety of billions , the competent authority , the place where it will be built the first examal .
Once built the first one , if it works like announced , it will be the eggs of Colombo , because costs , the density of generated energy , are completely different from nuclear energy , are completely different from nuclear that we know today .
CA : So , if I realize it , this implement the building , I &apos;m going to be vertical , of a vertical vertical nuclear combustible , of this kind of short uranium .
And then the process starts from high and progress to the bottom ?
BG : Right . The reactors , today , are reform , a lot of people , many controls that can &apos;t work , open , many people who can &apos;t work , opening , things that are coming in and experience --
It &apos;s not good .
If instead of the combustible is very cheap , and you can stop it for 60 years , put it in and forgotten all of the complexity .
And it turns out there , it &apos;s burn , and then it ends .
CA : A : A nuclear or nuclear ,
BG : Yeah . Well , the reflection can leave them there , you can put them in another reactor and burn them .
And we &apos;re going to begin with the remarkable remarkable , now conserved in vast , or in the contains .
They will be our first combustible .
So what was a problem of the conventional reactors will be the carbon of our , and the volume of reducation is going to be impressive .
CA : But when you speak around the world of the potential of this technology , where the major interest interest to its realization ?
BG : Well , there &apos;s not a place in particular place , and there are all these interesting rules of transparency about everything that is nuclear , so very interest .
Our staff was in Russia , India , China .
I just met the Segretarian for Energy .
We &apos;ve been talking about how this idea to the current program .
I &apos;m optimistic . French and Japanese have done in this field .
It &apos;s a variation about something that has been done .
It &apos;s about a substantial improvement , but it &apos;s a kind of quick reactor , which a lot of countries have built , so anybody has already built , so anybody has already built up .
CA : You know , what are the time and the likely and the probability of something like this .
BG : Well , for one of these scales , which produces energy , which produces , it doesn &apos;t cost much , we talk about 20 years to design it and 20 to build it .
That &apos;s the scadence that the environmental patterns can be tasatives .
Terrapos , if everything &apos;s good , it &apos;s not a little bit of it , it may easily satisfying this goal .
And now there are , fortunately , dozens of companies in the sector , whether analogically , if they &apos;re functioned to work , if the financial functioned , they can competing .
And it &apos;s better if many solutions are going to be successful , because at that point you can remember a set of solutions .
It &apos;s needs that at least a success .
CA : Parling of important innovations , revolutionary innovations , this is the biggest you know ?
BG : A energy revolution is the most important thing .
It would be also not without the environmental vinced vincoli , but the environmental vinced vinced .
In the nuclear are other innovators .
We don &apos;t know their job like this , but one is the nuclear nuclear , a different approach .
There &apos;s a liquid reactor . I seems difficult to do , but maybe they say the same thing of us .
So , there are different , but the beauty is that a molecule of uranium sprison a million times more energy than a molecule of a molecule , and so , if you can manage the negatives , the potential , the potential , in terms of effects about the environment and other , it makes almost a class class .
CA : And if it doesn &apos;t work , what do we do ?
We shouldn &apos;t have to start emergence for emergency to try to keep the terrestrial temperature ?
BG : If you find in that situation , it &apos;s a little bit like when you &apos;re eating too , and you &apos;re going to have a heart attack .
Where are you going to have to be a surgeon or something like that .
There &apos;s a whole line of pursuit on geoengineering , which are various techniques , which are techniques that roughness to make 20 or 30 years in which coordination .
It &apos;s like stipulating policy .
I hope you don &apos;t need it .
Some people say that it wouldn &apos;t even work on the polisity because it could employed you , it would keep eat because so much the surgeon will save you .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a beautiful choice , the importance of the problem , but now in the geoengineered geoengineering solutions in the case that the precipitath events , or innovations came to the predict of the predict .
CA : Clima-skeptical : if I had a sentence or two der , how could you lose them that have come back ?
BG : Well , unfortunately , there are different kinds of skeptical and the ones who have scientific arguments .
Some people say , there &apos;s a negative feedback , because of the clouds that are death the effects of the warming the effects of warming .
It &apos;s very , very , very few things that you can only say there &apos;s a million that there &apos;s probably a million that &apos;s going to have a million that you have the main the AIDS .
You make a mistake now and pay the consequences only a lot later .
And so , when you &apos;re pressed from a thousand , the idea of sacrifice , the idea of sacric that you &apos;re only going to see the results only after --
Sacrifice for junky .
In fact , the relationship of IPC is not necessarily the worst case ; there &apos;s people in the rich world , there &apos;s people in the rich world , it &apos;s not bad .
The fact is that that uncertainty should be pushed to the action .
But my dream is that , if we can realize it economically , and to respect the vinced vincoli on CO2 , so it doesn &apos;t matter me if it doesn &apos;t emits CO2 , almost prefer I would realize it , but I &apos;ll accept it because it &apos;s more economic than the previous technologies .
CA : That would be the answer to the reasoning of Bjorn Lomborg , that if you invest all your energies trying to solve the problem of CO2 , your other goals , are going to be sacrifice , when there are better , it will be sacrifice , when there are better .
BG : Well , the spective in research and development --
We say that the U.S. . A should spend 10 billion in more than they do now is not so ingent .
It shouldn &apos;t have to dest the resources .
The things that are going to be very money , and people who are the reasonable to be , are the funding of anti-economic solutions .
For me , it &apos;s above that .
At until you &apos;re going to finance the curve of learning , to get close to the point where it &apos;s going to become very cheap , I think the efforts are focused in technologies that have the potential of technologies that have the potential to lead dramatically costs .
If the alternative would be , &quot; we make the costosism , so that only the rich energy can alterm it , all the presents can afford it , all the presents can afford energy without changing lifestyle .
The disaster would be for those two billion .
And Lomborg saw his positions .
His the argument now is , &quot; Why don &apos;t you discuss more than Research and Svilp ? &quot;
For his past again , you hit between the &quot; skeptical , but he realized that it &apos;s a pretty righted group , and so it &apos;s lifting the question of Research and Svilp .
And it &apos;s a question that I think is appropriate .
It &apos;s amazing how little you invest in research and development .
CA : Well , I think I &apos;m just talking about the majority of the public name , I hope to see your desire to become reality . Thank you .
BG : Thank you .
I &apos;d like to share with you a discovery that I did some months ago as I was writing an article for the Italian magazine .
I &apos;ve always been my nonymous nonymous , every time I write something , but I had finished to run the article , and I realized that I &apos;ve never been in my word &quot; to see what I would find .
Let me tell you the result .
&quot; Dishable , &quot; aggate , &quot; Damamamed , unuseful , unuseful , inhered , mentioned , mentioned , non-burn , indebulated , untilated , unlike , consumed . Senyle , house , Senile , decrepiece of circulation .
Contrary : In shape , strong .
I was reading this high-listening list to a friend , and the beginning , it was so ridiculous , but , I read my voice , and I had to stop my voice , and I had to stop , and I had to stop , and the impact of these words have me .
You know , we &apos;re talking about , of course .
I &apos;m thinking , it &apos;s going to be an old built , right .
But in fact , the date of the early 1980s .
When I was starting to the elementary schools and learning what happened to be out of my family and about the other children and the world around me .
and , useful to God , I wasn &apos;t using the nonymous dictionary at the time .
I mean , from this explanation looks like I was born in a world that I was born in a world that doesn &apos;t have any positive in a way for them , I &apos;m celebrated for the opportunities and adventure that my life has happened .
So , I &apos;m immediately going to see on the 2009 2009 in the network , waiting to find a review without value .
This is the version of the description .
Unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
I think of the last two words uncomfortable in &quot; particularly scomfortable , &quot; and &quot; discomfortable . &quot; So , it &apos;s not only about it .
That &apos;s what we believe people when we named them with these words .
it &apos;s proposed values behind these words , and how we build these values .
Our language influence our thinking and our view of the world and how we see the other people .
In fact , many antial civilization , including that Great and that Roman , believed that Great true was more powerful , because it was a voice .
So , what do we really want to get to exist , one person who is limited , or an force ?
So , of course , by doing something simple like nominate a person , a child , we could put it in the tapes and throw on their force .
Don &apos;t we want to open the door for them ?
One person like this , who opened me the door of what I was the doctor of Dupon Wilmington in Wilmington , Delaware .
His name is Dr. Pizutillo .
It was too difficult , whose name , apparently , it was too difficult to figure out for most Americans , so it became doctor P.
And the doctor looked at colored , and he had a perfect perfect to work with children .
I loved anything about the period that I spent in hospital , with the exception of the physics of physics .
I had to do what looks like infinite reptions of exercibes with these big elastic phases , in different colors , you know , to help me build muscles .
And I hated these more than anything .
I hated them .
And , you know , I had already known as one of five years , with the Dr. To to try to try and figure out of these exercise , you know .
And , one day , it came to one of my sitting Stancer and inesorable , these sitting .
And he said , &quot; wow , Aimee , you &apos;re a child so strong , I think you &apos;re a child , I think you &apos;re going to break one of them .
&quot; When the romer , I &apos;m going to give you 100 bucks . &quot;
Now , of course , it &apos;s just a small maneufacturing me to the exercise that I didn &apos;t want to do with the exercise that I didn &apos;t want to be the richest child , but , what he did , it &apos;s been to give a very different form to an orrible form to an orrible form .
and transform it in a interesting experience for me .
And I wonder today , the entity of his vision , and his declaration about me as a child , has redefined my vision of me in a strong strong , a poem and athletics to the future .
This is an example of how adults with adults positions can inflamming the force of a child .
But in the example of first with those definitions of the synonymous vocabulary , our language is not the possibility of evolving to the reality that we all want , the possibility of an individuals .
Our language , it wasn &apos;t to the changes of our society , many of which have been created by the technology .
And of course , from a medical point of view , my legs , the operations at laser , the operations at laser , glasses that are helping people who are helping people that are helping people who are helping people to cooperate their skills , and move to the ability that nature has imposed to the ability of social networks .
So , maybe technology is going to be revealing now more clearly what it &apos;s always been a truth , which each one has something rare , and very poderful to offer our society , and the human ability to adapt us is our biggest quality .
The human skills to adapt , is something interesting , because people always wanted to talk to me about unourselves , and I have to admit to you .
This sentence wasn &apos;t good , and I &apos;ve always heard in disconforce to people to this about it , and I think I &apos;m starting to understand why .
it &apos;s underneath in this sentence , unsurprise , it &apos;s the idea that success , or happiness , it &apos;s the idea that success , or happiness , is to rest on the other side of a challenge or signature , if my success in life came from a ability or circumnit &apos;s to be a ability of life with protests , or what people perceive as my disability .
But in fact , we &apos;re changed , we &apos;re married , logically , from a challenge , physically or the bottom .
And I could suggest that it &apos;s a good thing .
The adversity is not a obstacle that we have to figure our life .
it &apos;s part of our life .
And I tend to think it &apos;s like my shadow .
As the known much , and sometimes nearly for anything , but it &apos;s always with me .
And , of course , he wasn &apos;t trying to decrease the impact , the weight of a person .
There are the adversity and challenges in life , and it &apos;s really true and relative to every single person , but the question is not if you have real adversity or not , but how you &apos;re going to dealing with it .
So , our responsibility is not simply protecting people to us to care from aving adversity , but to get them to the right way .
And we do one from our children when we make them feel that they &apos;re not ready to adapt .
There &apos;s a important difference and distinction between the doctor of being a frightened person and the subjective opinion of the society that you can see me or not .
And in the real disability , the only disability that I had to deal with is if the world has ever thought I could be described by those words .
In our desire to protect those those that we love giving them a column , a cold , the truth of their medical prognosis , or , really , the design of their life expectation of their life , we have to be safe not to put the first morning in a wall that will disability someone .
Maybe the existing model to look at what there &apos;s either in you and how to put it back , it can indebulate the subject that the disease itself .
In the complete person in the complete person in the complete potential , not to figure out his potential , we &apos;re creating another disease that are already .
We &apos;re actually giving a vote to the value of a person in our community .
So we have to see through the disease and inside the elenco of human capacity .
and , much more important , there &apos;s a relationship between those perceptual insufficiency .
So , it &apos;s not going to proposed , or negar , these numerous research as something that we want to avoid or oppet , but rather find those opportunities that we want to avoid in one accident .
So , maybe the idea that I want to explain is that there &apos;s not what to overcome , as opposed to it , as you opening it up to it , to try to use a term , to use a term of the lotta , maybe also dancing together .
And , maybe , if we look at an accident as a natural thing and useful , and we are less from his presence .
This year , we &apos;ve got the rid duction of Charles Darwin , and it was 150 years ago , when I was 150 years ago , when I writing evolution , which Darwin has illustrated , I think , the truth of the human character .
To tell it in another way , it &apos;s not the strongest of the spectrum that survive , and it &apos;s not even the smart , it &apos;s the most intelligent .
The conflict is the genesis of the cration .
From Darwin the work of Darwin , we can recognize that the human ability to survive and developed with the conflict of human spirit through the conflict of human spirit through conflict .
So again , transformation , is our biggest quality .
And maybe , until we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re made .
Maybe that what gives us adversity , a sense of possess , a sense of its force .
So , we can do a gift .
We can , re-imagine adversity as something more than the time .
Maybe we can see it as a change .
The adversity is a change that we haven &apos;t adapted .
I think the greatest adversity that we &apos;ve created is this idea of normal . Now , who is normal ? Now , who is normal ?
There &apos;s no normal . There &apos;s a common , there &apos;s a typical .
And would you want to meet these poor people are there ?
I don &apos;t think right .
If we actually changing this paradigm from one about how to get the normality to one on the possibility , or potential , to be a little bit more dangerous , we can understand the force of so many children , and to invite them together to the community .
The anthropologists teach us that what we , as humans , as humans , we always wanted to the members of our community is to be help , to be help , to be help .
There &apos;s a evidence that in Otherefore , 60 years ago , brought to the old triumpes and subjects with the old graves , and maybe because of the experience and the survival of these people was the evidence was the evidence of the community : they didn &apos;t see this people like race , or unuseful and value .
A few years ago , I was in a citizens where they grew up in that area in the north area in the north area of Pennsylvania .
and I was standing in front of a pomodors .
It was summer and I had add of the cords .
I &apos;ve heard this guy , his voice behind me , &quot; but , it &apos;s not Mullins . &quot; And I &apos;ve been taken , and there &apos;s this guy of half age . I had no idea of who was .
And I said , &quot; Scusi Mr. &quot; Do you know , I don &apos;t remember that I &apos;ve ever met , &quot; He said , &quot; but , I wouldn &apos;t remember you .
I mean , when we were met you met , I &apos;d met you were nailed by your mother . &quot;
Rish , that guy .
And , but of course , of course , I had a camp .
That lady was the Dr. Kean , a man I had known only known about my mother on that day , because , I was clear , I was clear , I came up with two weeks .
And so , the hostetrical ginecologist gave , and so the man who did me , so the man who did me born me was a complex extraneous for my parents .
And , because I was born the loss , and I had the foot , some fingers in this foot , and some in this foot , he had to be the messager , this extraneous news .
She said , &quot; I had to give this program to your parents that you wouldn &apos;t have walked , and you would never have the kind of mobility that have the other kinds of mobility that have other children or no independent life , and you &apos;ve given me the good job , &quot; Rissue . &quot; The extraordinary thing is that he told me that it has been told that he had a article in all of my childhood .
I had married with the Girl Scout , you know , Hallows , you know , I &apos;d win my school study of study , or all of my study of study , and he used them , and he used them , he was teaching the students of the medical medical medicine of Hershort and Hershey and Hershey and Hershey and Hershey and Hershey and Hershey and Hershey .
And it &apos;s called this part of the course , the X , the potentiality of human will happen .
No program can hold how powerful it can be , and how it can be in the quality of a person &apos;s life .
And the doctor Kean continued to explain me and he said , &quot; In my experience , unless that it doesn &apos;t come back to him , and even though it gets a burle of support , if it only gets a baby of support , if it only comes . &quot;
You see , so Dr. Kean changed his opinion .
He realized that there &apos;s a difference between a medical condition and what everybody can do with it .
And there was a change in my thinking during the years in this , if you &apos;d asked me when I was 15 years , if I was 15 years , if I had 15 years , if I had 15 years with legs and I wouldn &apos;t have exitated a second .
I had that kind of normality at the time .
If you ask me today , I &apos;m not sure .
And it &apos;s because of the experiences I had with them , not for the experiences that I had with them .
and , maybe change in me , because I &apos;ve been exposed to the people who opened me the door of what they opened me .
You see , all you need is a person that you need is a person who shows you the epiphania of your potential , and you &apos;re starting to give someone of their force , the human spirit , the human spirit is so week , if you can do it and open a door for someone in a crucial moment , you &apos;re educating it in the best ways .
You &apos;re teaching them .
In fact , the meaning of the word of educating comes from the root , &quot; which means , &quot; which means , pulling out what it &apos;s inside , to bring the potential .
So again , what is the potential that we want to pull out ?
There &apos;s been a study case in the 1960s in Grand , when they were past from elementary schools .
It &apos;s called the &quot; provide &quot; continuity &quot; , &quot; we call it &quot; here in the United States .
It means to separate students dependently from their votes .
And the students with the best votes have a bigger program , and teachers , etc , well , they did it for a time of three months , As the students with voting voting voting .
And at the end of this period of three months , they were having the results at the end of this study .
The ones who were remained to school , beyond that I had left .
The crucial part of this study was that the teachers were engaged .
The teachers didn &apos;t know it was this change .
He was told him : These are the students from the very good students , and these are the guys with insufficient .
And it &apos;s how they began to teach them .
So , I think the real disability is to have a spirit spirit , and a spirit damaged spirit has no hope .
It doesn &apos;t see beauty .
It has no longer our natural , child curiosity and our innate capacity to imagine .
If instead , we can support human spirit to keep the hope , to see the beauty in themselves and the others , to be imaginative and curious , halls that we &apos;re using our correctly force .
When the spirit has these qualities , we can create new reality and new ways of being .
I &apos;d like to leave you with a poem from a poet of the 1300 named Hafiz who did me know my friend Jacques Dembois .
and the poem is called , &quot; The God that only knows four words , &quot; Every child has known God , not the God of nomes , not the God of nomes , not the God that only knows four words and continues repeated them .
Thank you .
