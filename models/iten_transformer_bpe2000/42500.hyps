Last year I showed these slidemonstrate to demonstrate that the arctic glacial , which for almost three million years had the size of 48 percent of the United States . By , it &apos;s restrike 40 percent .
And that &apos;s that that underneath the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the spexpended of the ice of ice .
The arctic calotta is , in a sense , the pulsant heart of the global climate system .
You expanding inverter and it &apos;s expanding .
The next slide is going to be a quick carrelated to the living bunch of the last 25 years .
The ice perensigned are signed in red .
And you can see , they expand up to the blue blue .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter , which is summer of summer .
You can see that the ice ice , the cosidly , five years or more , it &apos;s like the blood , which is like the blood , which is that there &apos;s a blood .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been like like this .
This is a problem because the rescale the climbing full , around the ocean , where there are enormous amount of carbon congested , which , science , they &apos;re transformed in the microbes .
Risect to the totality of the atmospheric pollution , global warming , that amount could radical , that amount of not return .
In some short laghi in Alaska , the methane is already rebecting from water .
The professority Katey Walter of the University of Alaska team that was a non-wled lake team .
Video : Wow !
A reason is that this termal exchange that the termal exchange from north .
This is a fighter to glacial .
The door never reached , he never reached .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the South South of Greenland .
If you want to know how the sea level to the sea level to the shake , here is where it &apos;s reaches the sea .
These roughly are increasing , quickly .
As the other side of the planet : Antarctica , the greatest ice of the planet .
The month scientists have been told that the ice scientists is in negative , and that the ice is in negative , and that the Antica artide , which is particularly queye on some submarine , is particularly quickly .
She eival six feet of the watching walking .
Sull Himalayas , the third biggest block , you see new laghi , that a few years ago , who were ice .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population was half of water population from that leaving .
Sull Ange : this glacier is the source of water power of this city .
The door is increased .
But when you declining , the same happens to water .
In California , the snow on Sierra is declinuity of 40 percent .
The hydries are in crisis .
The predictions , as you read , are graves .
The growth security in the world leads to a remarkable increase .
The environmental disaster are increasing a rhythm outside and without precedented .
Four times more numerous in the last 30 years than the previous 75 .
This is an unsustainable thing .
If you look at it in the historical context if you can see the consequences .
We &apos;ve had 70 years we &apos;ve had 70 million CO2 tons of CO2 t2 tons of CO2 tons in the oceans every day .
Look at the area of the East Pacific , from Americas , and the American , and on both parts of the Indian subcontinent , where there is a radical impoverments of oxygen in the ocean .
Most of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossils .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States are one of the two of the most emissions , together at China .
And it was proposed to build a lot of other central carbon .
But we &apos;re seeing to a change .
These are the annoylate projects in the last few years and some of green alternative alternative .
At every way , there &apos;s a political lots in our country .
The carbon industries and oil are oil are 250 million dollars in the last year year to promote the carbon clean , which is a hosymore .
That picture remember something --
Vertains in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion lons of carbon .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the second largest flow of scories in America .
It &apos;s happened around Natal .
The published nature of one carbon industries was this .
Video : My carbon : carbon is a kind of food and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it &apos;s going to grow our economy .
Fross the carbon is and more and more and more and clean .
It &apos;s good , adorable and the work is , the workers are keeping .
Al Gore : From here &apos;s a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest society in the mountain is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Don Blankenship : Don Blankenship : Al Gore , Nancy Pelosososis , Harry Reid -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima Protection of Clima &apos;s launched two .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : ALergy : ALergy , we see the climate change as a sery means to our business .
And that we priority is to invest a great amount of money in a publisher to make publishing and public the truth on .
In fact , the carbon is not sports .
We think it &apos;s clean -- it has a good profit .
So , not preocateful for climate change .
Let me do .
Video : My . My : You clean , you &apos;ve heard a lot of them .
So let &apos;s look at a type in a struggle to the clean of bag carbon .
Straditional carbon ! Machines are a little bit , but this is the sound of the pulishy carbon .
The carbon consumption is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology , but the remarkable technology that you see it changes everything .
You look at a look , this is the clean &apos;s hate carbon technology .
Al Gore : Inally , the positive alternative , the positive alternative and the economic issue .
Video : America is in the crisis ; the economy , the economy , national security , the climate crisis .
The filter that connects them all : our dependence from fossils , like the heads and oil &apos;s oil .
Now , though , there &apos;s a new , audace solution for out .
Repower power : 100 percent of clean energy , 10 years .
A plan to repair America to work , make safety , and help to stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that &apos;s solving our problems .
Repower power .
Al Gore : That &apos;s the last .
Video : I &apos;m going to reducing energy to America .
One of the fastest ways of bring up to the combustible that we are killed to our planet .
She &apos;s : The future is here . I feel , sole , just a new energy .
She &apos;s two : Novi investments for retributed places .
She &apos;s , Repower . It &apos;s time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old old old proverbial proverbial , says , &quot; If you want to go to speed , go to it .
If you want to go away , go together . &quot;
We need to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED I did an introduction on the LHC .
And I promise to return you about how the machine works .
So here I am . And so , for those who were not , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever trial -- 27 kilometers of circumference .
Her task is to rerecreate the conditions that were present less than a billion-second , from the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
All of that is just environment .
This is the car underneath Ginevra .
We picture these mini-Bang Bang inside the repators .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- it &apos;s 44 meters and it has a 22 meters .
This is an image picture of ATLAS spectacular image in the way .
10 to section of the last year we &apos;ve got accent car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was causes of festegments in control .
It &apos;s an image of the first particles of the first particles that had done all around the LHC , go into collision , with a part of the LHC , and it &apos;s spreading particles in the rest .
In other words , when we see that image 10 , we realize that picture was , we realize that the machine worked , which is a great vitter .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to do us to exultent , when somebody went to Google and he saw that the beginning was this .
That means we &apos;ve had a cultural impact impact to the scientific impact .
And there was a week after , there was a problem with the machine , had to these files here -- these dored files .
These files bring 13,000 frightening when the machine works to the maximum of power .
Now , the technicians between you look at the files and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . I &apos;m too good . &quot;
And they can do it because when they &apos;re very cold to become the cost-called superconductors .
So , unless 271 degrees , at less than 271 degrees , to the space between the stars , these files can bring that running that running .
In one of the juncture between the most of the namming play-magnets in the LHC , there was a factory fabrication .
So the films surface , they &apos;re going to read , and 13,000 ampits suddenly meet a likely , and the 13,000 ampays .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressionant if you think these magnets are over 20 tons , and that they &apos;ve moved of about 30 centimeters .
They &apos;re damaged about 50 magnets .
We needed to take them , what we did .
We &apos;ve been resisted and reports .
They &apos;re now back to their place subject .
By the end of marzo LHC is , it &apos;s going to be new integrate .
We &apos;re going to accent it , and we expected data or plugly , and continuing our adventure to discover what the morning to discover what the universe is .
Now , of course , in a way , these crashing , these crashing the debate on the value of science and engineering in frontier .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so difficult , the fact of going to beyond the limits , I think that is the value of things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , I imagine , in the unuseful experiments of his pupillo , his pupillo was Michael Faraday , said , &quot; Nothing is so dangerous for the progress of the human mind that science as the human mind that that we &apos;re ty-handing triumping , which we &apos;re not smistaking out there are . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start asking the rethink about when , from children , as children , played with the morning .
While you reach them and deal with them , and get them , take them and move them , learning , learned actually and solving problems and relationships and relationships and manipulating relationships .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , from the information of the user of our interaction with physical objects , together my consultant Patt-Mayer collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started wonder , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of having the only cursor of the mouse as a pastrings like digital writing , we could make a desktop with dialyze desktop , we could make a desktop with bottom-up objects ,
and systems to our placement ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , by building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable , it &apos;s an interactive computer as a beautiful .
In a few words , a Siftable , it &apos;s an interactive computer as a beautiful .
You can move them with hand , can see them in their moving , they can see that between them , heard and they have a screen and a radio .
But above them , they &apos;re physical objects , like the morning , they can move just up with them .
Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of a new ecosystem for manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physical , knowledge of their movement , and other , and as we become more physical , of other , how we move , of other , how we can explore new and different style and different style style .
I &apos;ll start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configure out to show the video : if I cline in a direction , the video , it will rotate it , if I cline to get back .
These interactive reports are aware of other people .
If you go , they &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re going to do .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can get a little bit .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they can get a little bit .
They &apos;re going to have their movement and including .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the poter using community gesture data , for example , &quot; a color as if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable , as a versor , I can use them to green color in that central , where they &apos;re missing .
and I can use them to versing color in the central , where you meet .
If we &apos;re going to be too , we can put a little bit .
They also have a beautiful possibility of learning , like languages , like languages , where people can try to try to try to try things that are faster , and see the results of it .
I &apos;m now --
This is a sequence of Fibonacks that I do with a program of equations .
We have a game of words that is in the middle and Boggle .
And then , at every turn , to every turn , you get a letter to every Siftable , Pratically , to every turn up to every turn , and when you get a case on every Siftable , and while certainly control it on a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new sitting of letters and new possibilities to try to try .
Thank you .
And here &apos;s the children came up to the Media Lab , I did , made them and I &apos;ve turned a video .
They &apos;re very , very , very , very , very , very , very ,
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people lots of educations .
You just say , &quot; Spons of the words , &quot; and they know what to do .
And here &apos;s other people who are trying to .
This is our youngest Extester , there on the right .
He wanted to implemed them .
They were only morning .
Now , this is an interactive cardboard .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of Lui &apos;s languages .
It can put new characters in the scene , sunning Siftable them .
It can put new characters in the scene , sunning Siftable them .
And that &apos;s , it &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : Sone is spring .
David Merrill : Now , he took a tractor in the scene .
Video : The arange tractor .
Bel work ! Yeah !
So schooling Siftable and put them neighbors can interact the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- inventing their story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide him as it .
DM : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide him as it .
Video : Fly , gets .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , is a recent , to sample , to sample and to exeand music .
it &apos;s a tool , realized by recent , to sample and to exeguide .
The Siftable here are acting from sound , base and the battery .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also put these sound in a sequence to behave in your placement .
And modifying it and just by touch a &quot; sound &quot; and a sequence . &quot;
These are effects that you can control from the view , like the reverse and the filter .
And then the dumble-sound sound to a particular sound , and then clins to be .
And then there are the general effects as time and volume , who are appliance to the whole sequence .
Let &apos;s look at how it works .
Video : DM : We &apos;re going to start with a sequence , &quot; sequence &quot; sequence , &quot; we can systems , we extend it , we extend it , we add base .
Now I put a basis line .
Video : DM : Now I add some percussions --
Video : And I &apos;m going to put the bacteria to the bacteria , so I can control the effect of the view .
Video : DM : I can speed to the entire sequence by inclining the whole sequence of time or another .
Video : And I &apos;m going to add the base to give more expression .
Video : DM : I can reconversation the flight . &quot;
So I didn &apos;t have to plan it first , but I can suddenly , making it longer or more corded .
And now , finally , I can sphert the entire sequence by inclining to the left the Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is build new man &apos;s interfaces , and more like our brain and body looks like our brain and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some possibilities that we &apos;re trying to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to transmit is that it &apos;s coming to this new generation of projects to interact with digital media , that will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the hour to talk to you all .
I &apos;m a writer .
Britain books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the fashion my life .
And I don &apos;t expect that it can change .
But , said that , something particular happened recently in my life and career , who brought me to realibrate the entire relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this book called &quot; Mangy , &quot; Prua , &quot; which , &quot; I , &quot; which , I think , a very snice , for some reason that it became a lot , and it became a great sensational , wildlife , and become a great sensational ,
And the result is that everywhere &apos;s going to go now , people treat me as if I were convicted .
It &apos;s true -- convicted , convicted !
They come from me now , everybody worried and they say , &quot; Don &apos;t fear that you can &apos;t do fear more ?
Do you can &apos;t fear to keep in the whole life without able to create a book that can make a book that maybe someone &apos;s book that makes somebody ? &quot;
What can you important to somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s rassure , you know .
But it could go worse , except that I remember more than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a writer .
I would move to the same reaction based by fear .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t feel I &apos;m going to successful ?
Do you fear that the humiliation of the rejection ?
Do you can &apos;t do this to manipulate all life without any saying out and die on a smoke of dreams of unlifts with the mouthwood . &quot;
These are that , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I fear of all those things .
I &apos;ve always had fear .
And I &apos;ve also fear of a lot of other things that people can &apos;t have to be .
Like the food and other things .
But , as much as I do , to write what I thought and asked me , and I was wonderful , because ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logical that anybody should be expected by being spavented by a work that you feel like ,
But what is so particular in the creative businesses to make us nervous about the mental health mental health in a way that other career do ?
And how my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don &apos;t remember a once in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if he fear to be ear to be engineer ?
There was never -- that block of the John engineer , how does it go ?
Does didn &apos;t work that , you know ?
Onestly , chemical engineers as a group have not certainly , in the centuries , in the centuries of being alcolized manized manized manized manized manized manized .
We have enough , we have enough , we have enough , and not only writers , but creative of every gender , we have this reputation to be enormous instabmentally .
And it &apos;s not going to look at the construction of the magnifices of the magnifics of the magnificent minds , who died young people who died young and often for hand .
And also , the ones that are not suicidated to be really disfacts from their dons .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , &quot; Every book told me a little bit more . &quot; &quot; A extraordinary degree of work . &quot;
But we don &apos;t bad it until the juggling that , because we &apos;ve heard these things that we &apos;ve been totally interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are in some way you reach and the art , finally , it &apos;s going to conduce the angost .
And the question I want to bring to everybody here today is : are you agree with this idea ?
It &apos;s good -- because it &apos;s also , because it looks at it , he &apos;s not good for me .
I think it &apos;s hdiosa .
And I think it &apos;s also pericangerous and I don &apos;t want to see it in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our great creative minds to live .
And I know that , in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start figing out to that I was host of suppositions , above the circumstances are in my career .
That &apos;s what -- look at , I &apos;m quite young , I &apos;ve been about 40 years .
I still about four decades in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything I &apos;m going to write about this is going to be judgly by the world as the job that I did after my last book .
I &apos;m going to be huge , because we &apos;re all about the most friends here -- it &apos;s likely to my biggest hit .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thought that &apos;s kind of thinking that brings a person to start bere in the morning , and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would keep doing this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it looks like , after many reflection , that the way to work to keep write is to create a psychological construction , okay ?
I have to find a safety distance between me , who I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxiety of what reaction is going to get . And as I was looking for the last year , looking for the last year , trying to find other societies to see if they could have some more ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthy and more and more healthy ideas to see if they could have the ideas and more healthy ideas to reactive ided of what reaction is ,
how to help people to manage the emotional who are emotional risks of creativity .
And that research has brought me to the Great and ancient Rome .
Seguitems because it gets into the circle and then come back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t look like to believe that creativity to be from men , OK ?
They thought the creativity was this beautiful dience , and he came to the men from some distant and sell , for reasons , unknown reasons , unknown reasons .
The great-hand called these divinins of creativity &quot; degrees . &quot;
Socry , wonderful , believed to have a demon that elargives .
Romans were the same idea , but they called the same idea , but they called the spirit without a genius .
which is great , because the Romans didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a genius was a particularly smart .
They would have that genius was this kind of divine that was this kind of divine that was created literally in the walls of a artist , like Dobby , and that came out to assist the work of the artist and it came out to assist the work of artist and and model that work .
Here &apos;s a construction -- that is the distance of what I talk -- that psychological construct you that psychological that protected you from your work .
And everybody knew that it was so that it was , right ?
So the anti-people artists were protected by certain things , like the narcism , right ?
If your work was a job was exceptioning , you couldn &apos;t take your whole market , everybody knew that you were helped by this genioral genius .
If your false work , it wasn &apos;t all all the beautiful , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be an inable .
And so people han concept to be creativity in the West for a long time .
Then the Renaissent came and everything changed , and we have this great idea ; we put the human beings on the mixed of the universe over all of the and the misteries and without more to leave the mitive creatures that write you detail from the divinity .
This was the principle of humanissue of humanissue and people started to think that creativity is completely from the hydle .
And for the first time in history , he began to refer to this or that is as an artist as a rather than a person with genius .
And I have to say that , I think it was a big mistake .
I think that to allow somebody , a very simple person to believe that it &apos;s like a source , the essence and the essence of all the mysteries , creative , unknowledge and a lot of ethernal to give to the psyches of human psyching .
It &apos;s like to ask someone to inrow up the sun .
Deape and it completely &apos;s the ego and creates all these ingentips .
And I think it was this pression to having aren &apos;t been to do in the past 500 years .
And , if that is true , and I think it &apos;s , and I think it &apos;s , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between human and human mistake .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t sing 500 years of rational thought in a 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people between the audience who would have literally have a scientific notion , income , if you follow people to do the process of splan on their projects .
I &apos;m probably not going to convince you all about this .
But the question I want to ask is -- why not ?
Why not think that way ?
because it has more sense of all other thing that I &apos;ve ever heard to explain the exasperant exasperant , creative process .
A process that , as anybody who ever tried to do something -- so , basically , all here -- knows , you don &apos;t behave .
And in fact , it can sometimes look completely paranormal .
I did this recently meet with the extraordinary poetry Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but it was a poettern for all life and said that during her childhood in the Virginia , worked out in the field , and he heard , in if a poem came to the landscape .
He said that he was like a fragorous train .
And she was getting up to her landscape .
He heard it came , because he was tremendous to her feet .
He knew he had one thing to do at that point and it was to be , words , &quot; running as a math . &quot;
And so it was running to the home and became wish , and it would have to get a piece of paper and a faster , and a faster , and a faster math , as the transplant , collecting it and shrit on the page .
Sometimes he couldn &apos;t be faster , so correct and correct and correct without having to get up to the home and and the poetry was , and she would keep it up up through the landscape , and he would keep roll through the landscape , trying to say , &quot; another poet . &quot;
Then there were those times -- this piece , I &apos;ll never forget that -- there were some moments when they almost losing , right ?
So , he was running home and was looking for the card and the poetry to the paper , and he would go through , and he was a wandering , and then he said , that it was like you &apos;re going to hold and and the offer .
He offered the poetry from the tail and put her in his body and put her in and he had the page .
And in these cases , poetry , the poetry was in perfect and intact , but the last word to the first .
So when I heard it -- I &apos;m crazy , it &apos;s exactly the same thing .
Not the whole thing -- I &apos;m not a conducture .
I &apos;m a move , and my way of working is ; I &apos;m going to wake up to the same horarian every day and sweet and working and go over and go and go over and enjoy .
But even I , in my test daggin , I &apos;ve stripped against that thing , sometimes .
And I imagine a lot of you did .
You know , even though the work and ideas came up with me , and the ideas were saying by a source , I could not honestly know .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relationto it in a way we don &apos;t lose the head , but rather , rather , what do we hear healthy ?
And as much as I think , the best contemporary example that I is the Musician , which I interviewed in different years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life was the incarnation of the artist &apos;s returning of the artist , trying to control , to manage , glowing these species of totally interiorized impulses .
But then he was realized , he climbed on a machine in L.A. , he changed everything , he changed it all for him .
He was going fast and everything is a sent sent , this little sent melody &apos;s wonderful , and it &apos;s going to his head as the inspiration , elusive , and the various , and the various , and the peeeek , and the desidern , but not knows how to take it .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , it has no caught a city , it has no record .
So , he starts to feel this kind of old anxiety , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;ll remained by this character .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to the panic , he stopped .
And he did the whole process and did something completely new .
And he just watched the sky and said , &quot; Scause , I &apos;m not seen I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Do you look like that he could write a song now ?
If you really want to exist , you go back to a bit more when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , you go to important something else .
You know , Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his work worked out after this .
Not the work , the work , it was still hoscure as always .
But the process , and the anxiety that was remained when he took the genius , the genius , the genius who had nothing else and liberate it back to where it came from , returned it back to where it came from , realizing that it didn &apos;t have to be an interior .
but he was this peculiar , wonderful , wonderful collaboration between Tom and this external thing and this external thing and it was not Tom .
So how much I heard that story began to change a little bit even the way I worked , and he saved to me once .
And this idea , he saved when I was writing , &quot; Manway , &quot; and Prua , &quot; and he falls in a cave of those dispersate , where we all work on something and we can &apos;t start thinking that &apos;s going to be a disaster , which is going to be the worst book , which is going to be the worst book , which is going to be the worst the worst book ,
Not only bad , right , right the worst book .
And I started thinking about to themselves to throw this project .
But then I remember from Tom who talked to the air and I tried to the air and I tried .
So I went up my face in the way of hit into the hit and and I &apos;d say my comments to a purpose of the room .
And I said to the high voices , &quot; Sent , what , both know that if this book isn &apos;t going to be slightly colped my , no ?
Because as I see , because I &apos;m putting it everything I have , I have no more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to introduce you and do your part .
Okay . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , I don &apos;t do anything .
I &apos;m going to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I want to favor for the record that I today to do my part . &quot; Because , it &apos;s so , OK -- it &apos;s so , OK -- it &apos;s doing in the deserts of Africa , North People would go to the slate of the late of the moon of moon , and hours to the sacred on the slate , and hours to the date .
And they were always magnificent , because the dancing balerini and they were fantastic .
But every once a very , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists was actually transmitted .
And I know what I talk about , because I know you &apos;ve all seen it , at some point , a performance like that .
It was like the time he stopped , and the dancing walking through a kind of portal and it was not doing anything different from the usually , like 1,000 notes before , but it all was going to be in .
And suddenly , it appeared as as a human .
But it turns out from the dedriver and the illuminate in the fire divinity .
And when this happened , to the time , people knew what was , they called it with her name .
They were broken their hands and started sing , &quot; Allah , God , Allah , God , God , God , &quot; God , God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
And he was the house night -- when the More invasionally , they took this habitude with them and pronounded , and the pronounced in &quot; Allah , &quot; in &quot; Ollah , &quot; Oklah , &quot; Okay , &quot; , &quot; Okay , the roughly , &quot; whom , &quot; which you can still hear in the flamenk .
In Spain , when an artist did something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , placed , the ALlah , magnific , Jewwish , etching God .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes the day after , for the dancing , when you wake up and discovered that they &apos;re the 11 morning of Martedesday and the 11 morning of God , there &apos;s no longer .
It &apos;s just a mortal with a lot of bad to ginocia , and maybe not able to ask that allow .
And maybe nobody &apos;s name God as again , and what it has to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most painful recognciliations to make a creative life .
But maybe not to be so angoscial if you can &apos;t believe , ancutt , that the most extraordinary expected , that the most extraordinary expectations of your same .
But it just believable to you have data from an unimaginable to this squisite of your life that &apos;s life that you have to go to someone else when you &apos;ve finished .
And , you know , if we think it all changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s certainly like the I thought for several months during the book that I &apos;m going to be in the book , I &apos;m going to do it , so that , I would be followed by my great great successful .
And what I have to keep talking to me when I &apos;m electrized by this is , not fear .
Don &apos;t beyond you . It just your work .
It &apos;s inuates to introduce you for your part , whatever it can be .
If your work is ball , bought to dancing .
If the deal , absurd genius , assigned you decide to left some kind of wonderful , for a moment through your effort , then , &quot; then ! &quot;
Striments , you do the same .
And &quot; Okay ! &quot; Sime ! &quot; It &apos;s the same .
I think , you have to go and I think it &apos;s got to teach it .
&quot; You ! &quot; Sime ! &quot; She , even for you to have human beings and test later , and test shape you &apos;re going to present .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : With !
And as you know , I &apos;ve already talked about some of these projects on the human genome &apos;s discovery .
We &apos;re now starting a new path : We started to digitalize biology and now to start from that digital code we &apos;re moving in a new biology , designing and synthesizing and synthesizing life .
We &apos;ve always been looking for great questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; is something that many biologists I think they &apos;ve tried to understand various various levels .
We tried to have different approaches , we &apos;ve been tined to the minimal terms .
We &apos;re digitizing for 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome &apos;s been going to go from the analog world of the biology of the computer &apos;s digital world .
Now , we can regenerate life , or to create life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome of those who can auoreous to replacement in the laboratory .
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome to create a smaller more smaller .
We &apos;re able to eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 that are here .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our own .
I think , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at time , it &apos;s very improbable that this can bring to a living cell .
So we decided that the only way that we &apos;ve got to synthesize this chromosome in a way that we could modify the components to bring some of these questions .
And so we started the adventure of &quot; Can we synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Can chemistry to produce these great molecules that we never could create the first of time ?
And in case , we can make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a chemical piece of inert material .
The speed that we are able to digitalize life is growing to exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , progre-rediscuss rather , but it &apos;s improving .
And our most recent recent recent results the bring to an exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process has requested a lot of the passionate , starting with a bioethical review .
But we found that DNA is a lot of DNA is very difficult .
There are thousands of thousands of machines in the world that products little DNA , long long , and it &apos;s a degenerative process , and it &apos;s a degenerative process , degenerative process , more errors there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble to assemble these fragments and correct the mistakes .
And that was our first attempt , to start with digital information from the digital information of Phi &apos;s genome of Phi &apos;s genome of the X 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , actually , the correction of the errors and get a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material chemical material and we put it in the bacteria , the bacteria , the bacteria have started to read this genetic particles .
The viral particles have been released from the cells , are come back and they destroyed the E.
I &apos;ve talked about recent with members of the oil industry and they &apos;re told this model .
They re-review more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build his hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things bigger .
We wanted to build the entire chromosome of the bacteria .
They &apos;re over 580 thousand genetic code .
So we &apos;ve thought we could build it in the cassette dimension of the virus of the virus , so that we could change the casses of a living cell .
The program is crucial , and if we start with digital information , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accuratean error for every 10 thousand ble-base .
We &apos;ve found , we would have that , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence , we would never be able to do that work .
One part of the process is to design segments along 50 letters that they &apos;re going to be running with all the other sletters of 50 letters to build underneath smaller than working together .
We &apos;re going to see unique elements here .
You probably have read that we &apos;re going to put on the grains .
Think about it this : we have a genetic code based on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters together to care about 20 amminds , and there &apos;s a specific order to letters for every ammine .
So we can use genetic code to write words , frastion , thoughts .
What we did at the beginning is self-caught .
Some of them were deluses that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
We designed these segments to simply them to join them .
There are enzymes that are repair .
And we started assemble to assemble parts , starting with the five to seven , at the time , and they put them in a segments of 24 mile letters , 2,000 letters to come to 72 ,
We have produced these segments in abundance so we could sequency them sequencing from we &apos;re trying to create an extremely robbust -- how you see in a minute .
We &apos;re looking at automatize the process .
So , this seems to be the tabellone playoff .
When we get to these very long segments , over a very long time , more than 100 mile , they &apos;re not going to grow more directly in E.
It comes to the limit of modern molecular biology .
So we &apos;ve been considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called a homology , which is a biology repaired DNA to repair DNA able to get the segments .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus , it can make three million radiation of radiation .
You can see in the soil as his chromosome as his cromosome is .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s rehard as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can do completely .
They can live under vacuum .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life exists in space , and you can find new environments of water .
Actually , NASA showed that this happens .
This is an image of the molecule that we built up using these processes , just using the lievening with design appropriate segments to put .
The lievitually assembly .
This image was not taken with an electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a very big molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that they cover a six second .
This is the publishing we did a little time ago .
They &apos;re over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the biggest molecule of a definitely ever created by man .
It has a weight molecular to 300 million .
If we prove it with a carat 10 without spaces , it would be 142 pages to transcritation .
Now , how do we do that ? How can we activate it ?
Of course , through a virus is a virus is a boy .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s simplest when it comes to the eukariote as our own : you can just extract it out the nucleus and inserious , which is practically the clonically process .
In the bacteria , the archaea is instead of the cell , but we &apos;ve recently showed that we can do a recently transplant to a complete transplant to another and activity of a cell to another and activate it .
We &apos;ve got a chromosome chromosome from a microbial species .
The two are different than men from mice .
We &apos;ve had some gene in more way we could decide what to choose to this choomosome .
And then he short with the enzymes in a way to kill all proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was studies -- and you &apos;ll be appreciate graphic -- the new cromosome , the new cromosome is gone in the cells .
And we started thought we didn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried anyway , but we tried anyway in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms .
We found that many species have added a second or third chromosome from some part , adding to a new thousands of new training to the species .
So who &apos;s thinking about evolution as a gene at a time that it &apos;s not a lot of the biology .
There are a enzymes called DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell .
The cellula-on cellula-shit .
And it &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other chromosome as a extraneous material , and we found it with only the cells and the new chromosome .
it became blue because of the genes we &apos;ve been inserious .
And in a short of time , all the characteristics of a species have gone out of the whole new software , and it turned out of the new software that we &apos;ve been inserted in the cells .
All proteins are changed , membranananes are changed , and when we read the genetics is exactly to what we &apos;ve transfer .
Now , this could look like genetics altering , but altering the DNA software , we can change things in a fairly substantial .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that here is not talking about genesus -- but progress to go from three and a half million years of evolution , and I &apos;ve already told that we &apos;re going to create new version of the Cambrian explosion .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s quite obvious when we think about our need .
We &apos;re going to pass six billion and a half billion people to nine billion in the next 40 years .
Just to give you an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one in 1946 ; there &apos;s 46 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medicinal and gas , medicinal and gas for six and a half of people .
It &apos;s going to be even more hard to nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion barrels , more than 30 billion barrels .
That means a million barrels a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of processes to replace them , it &apos;s a huge challenge .
We have to have to have to have to have the whole emission of CO2 from these materials that ends into the atmosphere .
And the day today , thanks to scientific discoveries around the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that they &apos;re the design components for the future .
The electronents can only have a dozen about components , and think about how many different things come out .
Our limitations here are principlally from biological reality , and our imagination .
We have techniques , thanks to these synthesization of synthesization , able to create what we call a combinatory .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can produce a million crobot that can produce a million cycal chromosomosomes a day .
Think about these 20 million genes or to try to make the processure to make the processes to produce the processes to produce the processes to produce the vaccines , and we can change , and create more biology , and create more biology , and more biology , and create more biology , and to create more biology .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for the possibility of survival , production or carburging , or carburging , production of ethc vaccines .
This is an instantanizing some of software program to be able to sit and design species to the computer species .
Well , we don &apos;t need to be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
We &apos;re now focusing on carbons of how quarter generation .
You &apos;ve seen , you &apos;ve seen out ethanol from the grain of a bad experiment .
We have a second and third generation that will be out of sugar out of sugar to sugar and more butanants like the open or different types .
But the only way biology can have a big impact without increasing more than food , and limiting the cost of food and limitation is to transform CO2 in matter , before , so we &apos;re working to design that we &apos;re working to design that can reach , and we think we can reach this scope , and we think we could have the first carbon how quarter generation in about 18 months .
The light solar shape with CO2 is a methodownload -- but in our discoveries all over the world , we found different metodd .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , at about 2500 meters of depth of water at the time .
It &apos;s creating by CO2 by CO2 using hydrogen , as a source of energy .
We &apos;re trying to figure out if we can sing CO2 , which can easily be transported through your tubes , converting that CO2 in carburging , to drive this process .
So we can replaced that we could be able to increase what the basis of life , &quot; What &apos;s life . &quot; We have the fit , &quot; We have the goal to replace the whole oil to replace the whole oil to replace the entire oil to replace the entire oil .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can you do ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working on to use the same methods to create vaccines .
You saw this year with influence , we &apos;re always back to a year and with a dollar when it comes to find the right vaccine when it &apos;s going to be the right vaccine .
I think that what is changing by making vaccines in anticype .
And that &apos;s how the future could start seeing , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria , and the euuukariote .
We &apos;re so much like that we &apos;re so much from improving people .
Our purpose is to make it a long time to try to make it . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the most faster , some fundamental work , of the new technology that we took to Microsoft in a followed to a year ago . This is Seadragon . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s an environment where you can interact is at the local level that &apos;s remote with an enormous amount of visual data .
And here we &apos;re seeing here , we &apos;re seeing here , with a kind of digital zoom , and continue to a slums , by a bread , by dispone-fast , by digital , and sponning , and sponning , for the images , how we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these collections are , or images .
Most of digital photographs , but this for example , is a promient from the Biblioteal Congress , and it &apos;s reentrated in the gama of 300 megapiel .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that &apos;s about the number of a system like this is the number of plxel on your screen in any moment . It &apos;s also a very flexelection .
This is a book , you know , data doesn &apos;t images .
This is Dickens of Dickens . Every colonnails is a capital .
To show you that it &apos;s just about textbook and not images , we can make a really , to see that it &apos;s a real representation of the textbook , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a book to read a book electronic .
I don &apos;t recommend that .
This is a more realistic example . This is a number of The Guardian .
Every big image is the beginning of a seeption .
And it really gives you the pleasure of the beautiful experience of a revist of a magazine or a daily journey , which is to nature a lot of means .
We also did something with the corner of this number of the Guardian .
We have created a high-resoluutionary baby resolutic -- much higher than that you use in a published normal contains .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific specific .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that this means put to the pop-up and other places like like like like that , they shouldn &apos;t have to be .
And of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don &apos;t want to lose time , if we don &apos;t say that we have contributed to give in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States , you get a geospace of NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This is now , it &apos;s actually from the Web ; you can go to see .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
A is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting thing in Noah Seadragging , a student in Noah Snavely , a student of the University of Steve Seitz , with Steve Seitz of Microsoft Research Seliski .
And it &apos;s from the view on the web , damn Seadragon .
You can see this when we do this kind of screen , where we can spend a picture to another picture and have this kind of experience to the other , and have this kind of experience .
But the space collocation of the images here has a significant .
The computer algorithms of visualization have recorded these images together , so that they corresponding to the real places that imaging -- all taken nearly -- all taken closer on Montne Roccial Montne Roccial Montne Roccial Montne Redual-show or slide-shape slide-she-show or of the space level , and these things are all the space level .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a few more space .
I want to go to the directly of one of the original data from Noah-hand -- this is from a previous Photosynth prototype of Photosynth , we &apos;ve done the first last summer , -- to show you what I think is really the key behind this technology , technology Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily , and it &apos;s not necessarily about the en-website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a rebuild of the Noththers prese to Dimimages who &apos;s discovered Dimimages .
So , they &apos;re all images taking from Flickr and they were all linked to space in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this way we simple .
You know , I would never have thought to finish working for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very , very , very , very , very , very , very ,
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different types . And that &apos;s the bad of the cellular types , from those of the cellular ground , which is a significant , put together in this environment .
And if I can , try and try and look for those more strange .
Many are blocked by faces , etc .
And somewhere here &apos;s a series of photographs -- etchcolums .
This is a Nothththtrial Dame recorded .
We can go from the poster to the view of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from yet -- from the entire collective -- from the entire collective point of view -- and it connects all those data together .
All those pictures become linked , the higher of the size .
You have a ground model of the land that emerging .
Think about this as a prolonce in Stephen Lawler on the virtual Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows into complexity as complexity as people use it , and the advantages to use it .
Their pictures are marcuted by other people .
If someone comes to the idea of contrast all these sains , and my picture of Nothers , my picture of Noththers , I can use of all those data , and I can use it as a point of all the data , and I can use the way of ingress to everybody else , and universe , using the pictures of anybody else , and have a social experience of anybody else , and to have a social experience of the type of the kind of cross-modity and cross-modity .
Of course , a consequence of all that are extremely elaborate models of all the interesting part of the land , tells you collect not only airs from airs and images , satellite and from the pictures and similar memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What your software will contain us to do is that , in the next years , all the photographs , all the photographs shared from anybody in the world will be ready connected ?
BA : Yes . What &apos;s doing is basically .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it at the basis on the content of the images .
What it becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of the sea of sea that &apos;s what a lot of these images can be .
And as when you do a research of images on the web , you &apos;re going to be a sentence and the web page is a lot of information about the images .
Now , what happens if that picture is linking to all your picture ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of wisdom that comes out of it is really huge . It &apos;s a classical effect .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible . Sputs .
BA : I thank you very .
One of the main pleasure , when you travel and one of the ethnographic research is the power to live between who didn &apos;t forget the ancient traditions , between who have the past in the wind , the driving in the wind , it &apos;s going to flow .
Basts to think that Jagar &apos;s traveling beyond the Vy Lattea , or that the Mattea , or the Mitan , or that the Mian , the buddies of Dharma , the budhs of Dharma , to remember the importance of the anthropology , and that the idea that the world we live in the importance , but it &apos;s just a model of reality , but it &apos;s just a model , but it &apos;s just a model ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stirram has done , well , or bad , a lot of generations ago .
And of course , we all share the essential .
Everybody &apos;s procreating .
We are subjects in the beginning .
We need to death the inexorability of death , so it doesn &apos;t surprising us if we cut and balleet --
We all have an art .
What it &apos;s the path is the particular rate of song , the dance of the song of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that they are the Penan forests of the Borneo , or the folloaces of Haiti , or the Woodoo &apos;s Worriers , or the Kaisut , or a camelas , or a camelmelder the Ange , or a camelas in Sahara .
He was my journey of journey in the desert a month ago , or a yak of yak in the vallees of the Everest , the world &apos;s Mother ,
All of these people teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , and other ways of thinking ,
And , if you reflection a moment , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
Insive , the myriades of the world are a girl and cultural life to spiritual and cultural life that it &apos;s important for the benefit as a biological girl as a biological biological , as a biological biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural natela cultural , like an ethnosphere , and you can call the ethnosphere of all the concepts , dreams , ideas , inspirations , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , the careful , the late of the knowledge .
Ethnosphere is the fantastic patrimony .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be as a kind of inquisitive .
And because the biosphere was very quickly consumed as it as well as it was as much quickly as it was very quickly .
Not biologist , for example , would say that 50 percent of all species is on the extinction of extinction because it &apos;s false , or -- in the highest hypothesis , or in the most opening of the biological diversity -- and not even neipowers -- that are not even neighborhood -- that of the cultural diversity .
The all of that is , of course , is , of course , loss .
When you &apos;re born there , there were 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only composed by a vocabulary or a series of rules .
A language is the bag of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the medium with which the animal of every culture is coming into the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a wish , a spiritual thought .
And the 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re here sitting in Monterey , at least the half is not sushed in the ears of children .
They don &apos;t come from children , whether they &apos;re going to say , unless not to walk something , which is already dead .
What is more sad than being happened by the silent , to be the last one language , to be the last to talk to a language , not having a way to transmit .
This is horring up , it &apos;s the state of somewhere in the world , every two weeks . And every two weeks and a drive and it brings to themselves the labe of an ancient language .
And I know that somebody of you will say , &quot; Isn &apos;t that ?
The world would not be a better place if we parasked all the same language ? &quot; We talk all talk to all the same language ? We talk all talk to the cancer .
Let &apos;s talk about .
You &apos;ll be a sudden thing , you &apos;ll just want to talk about language .
I would like to do a journey through ethnosphere --
a little journey in the ethnosphere to give you a mass of what we &apos;re losing .
They forget to be a lot of us that when I say , &quot; different ways of existence . &quot; I really mean different ways of existing .
We take for example this this Barasana Barasana , in Amazon , the population of anaconda , which creates to provend from the latte of the hements of slatte on the satt of slats in the sacross of slats .
It &apos;s a population that &apos;s not able to distinguish the blue color , because the green cell , is identified in the forest of the forest , which depending the population .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rule , &quot; language &quot; : &quot; to move to move a person who talk about a person who talk about a different language .
All of this has been in the mythological past , though the particularly is that in these extent families that are talking about six or seven languages .
They &apos;re limited to listen and then start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived , the Waoran Ecuador , the Waorans of Ecuador , an incredible people who had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionaries have tried a contact that they have a made .
They &apos;ve done to make it from the top photographs that reports them in a pose that they would realize that this people of pluvial forest pluvial forest .
They &apos;ve collected the pictures of the land , they turned them to the research of a shape or , they didn &apos;t find anything , they have concled it to the dig , and they killed the five with the lance .
But Worans don &apos;t just killed the stranieters .
They were killed to each other .
54 percent of mortality was caused by them .
We &apos;ve been slowed at eight generations and we found two cases of death , and when we &apos;ve been insisted to know , they have a lot of them was so so that they &apos;re aging , and then they killed it . They had a way , and then they had a knowable knowable to know .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine from 40 step and recognizing the species .
I was in the early &apos; 80s , I was a very interesting tassigned when my Harvard &apos;s professor assigned to Harvard to intrue to intrue to intrue to intrue the power of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutout-across , and I impose I used to do the zombie .
To make sense of miraculous , I should have to understand the Vodoun culture and that Vodoun &apos;s not magic .
It &apos;s pretty much of a complex me-complex vision of the world .
Very interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristanesime , Islam , Budhism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has no religious features . And instead , and the Voodoo is not other than religious concepts of these very profound religious concepts of these very profound religious concepts of slavery .
What makes the voodoo is the intense is the intense between life and death .
So , the vive are going to be borders .
The spirits can be invoded by the Great Aqua , they answer to the dance of the dance and they replace to the dance of the view of the vive in the soul .
So , the voodoohists love say , &quot; You go to wasn &apos;t wondering God .
We &apos;re going to give in the temple and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re possitting , is the spirit that you guide you , how can you do the bad ?
So , you assist these incredible events : With the doo in state of trance that touches are touches of the power of mind on the body in the body state of the mind when it &apos;s catalyzed in a state of extremely exciting .
I was all the people with which I lived the most extraordinary people who lived the most extraordinary Kogi Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta , in the Secepital .
Do draw from the ancient civilization , who had on the caraibies of Colombia &apos;s cool to the Colombia , the population was going to be on the vulcanic men that we herself on the carbicy-supplies .
In a slums continent of blood , this population never been conquiped by the spagnols .
And so , I &apos;m government to be a cler , but their formation is really extraordinary .
The young people followed away from the families to three or four years , and they live in a good world , and they live in a good world and shads in a good huge and hombers in the hair of the ice for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years of proposed to reproduce the nine months of exaction that &apos;s moving in the U.K.
For all this time , they &apos;re acculate to the values of their society , values that predicted their prayers and only their prayers to their prayers , or the cosmic balance -- or to say the ecological balance .
Al the term of this incredible initiation , they &apos;re improvide out and for the first time , 18 years , they see a dawn . And that &apos;s in that actioned of the first bad , when the sun burning bers of the first bad , when the sun ballows the values of beautiful landor . The prefer is a step back and says , &quot; The precisely pass a step back and says , &quot; The forth forth forth forth beautiful , and says , &quot; The precise a steal bulation .
&quot; See ? Proprize how I said .
It &apos;s studies . It &apos;s now to you protect it . &quot;
They &apos;re called the high-brothers and say that we , brothers , we &apos;re the destruction of the world .
This is a level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the Indigene people &apos;s inviting and the old houses and the old story of the voices , which is a razy concept in his simplicity or maybe we invoded Thoreau and we say that these people are closer to the Earth of us .
The Indigenes are not not feeling .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the Asmat or gathering in the class of the Tibet , but thanic , and the rhythis , and they created a mystic of the Earth , not on the concept of it , but on an unbelievably , the concept that the Earth can only live because it is infected by the human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
And that &apos;s going to be a child of the Ande who grows up to the mountain is a full of Apu , who will be a deeply different human being deeply different , and it &apos;s going to have a different human being a very different mountain or that place in a Montana who grows up to a little boy , or that a mountain is a mountain .
which is the dimpointed or a mineral cave is a themselves .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that &apos;s the metaphor that &apos;s the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Britannica creating that the forests serve to be cut .
And that made me a different human being from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the forests of Hukuk and the hurk of the paradise and the cannership of the paradise and the cannership of the world , he &apos;s going to be in the Hamatsa beginning .
If you start looking at that these cultures can actually create different reality , you can start to understand some of them sensational sensational discoveries .
I took this picture to open them in the Norock Amazon .
Mayahuge of you have heard about the Ehuge , the most powerful psychoactive of the repertory of the repertoire .
What makes the ey-asker , is not the drug potential drug potential druological potential , but his process . It &apos;s two elements .
From a side , this lian legnosa lian of health carboline , harming and harming harming , harmful hallucinogens .
Taking the only plant , you have a smoke , which alters a little bit of a consciousness , but it &apos;s mixed with the leaf of a coffee of the coffee of the coffee .
This plant to tripptamines , very similar to serotonin , deal on the serotonin , dimethoxydimethoxyyltrypten .
If you ever see Yanomami , you &apos;re going to see the Yanomami that make from a different species , and it contains methoxydimethoxydimethoxydimethods .
Tirking that pollus on the nose is a little bit like being disappear by a file barodd paper and landed on a electricity . See it creates a distortion of reality .
I was often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who wratket the psychedelical , with his discovered of the hallucinogens in the &apos; 30 in Mexico .
And the way , my countries can &apos;t be able because you can &apos;t classify these triptames like hallucinogenic because if you &apos;re not going to be slowly .
It &apos;s possible absolutely if you make it sunce with other chemicals that money are the MAO .
Now , it &apos;s the beautiful : the carboline is that they find in this lian Isaneously inhibitors of the MAO , the same kind of needs . The question : in an 80,000 species of plants , as make these people find out of them , like these people to find two diachieving diaxious dia-like flour , but that if you combined in this way , creating a biochemical version that &apos;s experience to the similar ?
We use the great eufemism of the providing and the mistake , which can reveal infruit .
But if we ask the Indian , they &apos;ll say , &quot; The plants are talking about . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribe , the Cofan , the Cofan , has 17 variety variety , which distinguish network , and that our eyes would be in the same species .
If we ask him how they stabilizing their tassonomy will tell us , &quot; I thought , &quot; I realized , &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is , you get the 17 variety in a notice of lots and each one will song with a different type .
With this is not laurea to Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting to count that to count the prize .
Now , &#91; applies &#93; the problem is that also , the problem is that the people of us who have to the history of the history of the history of history , but in some way to our real world , and pass .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it will not remember his wars or the technology of wars , but rather as we were in and we have been in the way we stopped and we have abuntil activally , or accepted or passively accepted , the masses of diversity biological and cultural . Now the problem is not changing .
All cultures through centuries are involved in a dance for new possibilities .
And the problem isn &apos;t technology .
The Indians Sioux , they didn &apos;t stop being Sioux when they put up and they full they stopped up and full Americans have no stopped to be Americans when they put out of horse and hot .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that threatening the etnosphere . It &apos;s the power .
The domination of domination .
And if you give you a look at the world , you &apos;ll discover that these are not destined to disappearance .
They &apos;re living creatures and dynamics out of identify forces that go beyond their ability of adaptation .
And it &apos;s short disbosing in the Penan patria .
a populated nomad of Sarawak , in Sarawak , a population , a population that lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now reducing to the next reducing and the next regions , where you can see the river of the river of the lives , which seems to bring away the Sarawak to the More Cinestery , where the Japanese naves the Japanese , where the Japanese noundary Morneo , where you can see the horneeded ,
you have to fill the stives with the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that have come with the gold .
If we move on the mountains of the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the dall of the political domination .
And as you know the genocide , the physics of a population , is convicted at the universal level , but the ethninium of a population of a population , not only convicted , but it &apos;s celebrated in in the development , because it &apos;s part of the development of development .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of the Tibet , until you &apos;re not in the beginning .
I &apos;ve lost 6,000 miles from Chengdu in the Western China through the Western Tibet , coming to Lhasa with a young lines , but only came to Lhasa , I realized what &apos;s behind the statistics we &apos;re going to talk about .
6,000 mountain,000 monuments in pollution and centers .
1.2 million people killed from the military Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascrited to Panched Lama .
which means that it &apos;s been killed to the time of Chinese invasion .
Suo uncut is figure out with Santity in the diaspora that brought the people in Nepal .
His mother was imprisoned and his chicken .
It was taken by hidden to the age of two hundred years and hidden his grandmother , because he couldn &apos;t have lived in him .
The sister , who did the same , was , was put in reeducation camp .
And one day , he &apos;s besed a day drop , and for this transgression , and for this transgression , was put in forced to seven years .
The Tibet of the Tibet can be insationally , but the redentor of the population is from keproud .
And the end , it &apos;s all reduces to a choice .
We want to live in the world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s a monoil or we want to collect the policycal policycical world of diversity ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he said that his biggest fear was that , in our Gamorous amorous of the world , we &apos;re going to see the whole gammer of human imagination , but a day limited modality of thinking , but a day we &apos;re going to wake up to the whole modality , but one day we &apos;re able to sleeping to be able .
And it &apos;s humiliating that our species is existed for 600,000 years .
The Revolution Revolution , which has given us the agriculture , who made us to sock the see of the see , and by the slide with the next to the cler , by the cler , creating the hierarchy of specific , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The industrialized world &apos;s about 300 years .
That sharks that story history , I &apos;m not suggests that we have the answers to all of the challenges that we &apos;re going to come to .
When these myriades of the world is asked what it means is to say to be human , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all rediscover the possibility of being what we are , a consciousness , which has to make all the people and all the gardening all the people and flowers can flow . And there are great moments .
I took this picture on the extrity of Baffin , when I went to the island in the hunting of whales with Inuit , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , and this man , and this man , and this man , and he told me the wonderful story of her grandfather .
The canoes government was not always a gentile with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to stabilish our teacher , we &apos;ve been involved in colonies .
The grandfather was refused to go .
The family , template for his life , brought him away , and all his way to do it , and all his attractioning .
You have to know that Inuit &apos;s not cold the cold , they exploit .
The slings of the sleton , they were made of paphic skin .
The grandfather did not put out from the arctic note of arctic or the blizard that was suffipped .
It &apos;s taired out , you &apos;re hot , you &apos;re hot the skin and defecated in their hand . When I made it up , they &apos;re taking it , they work with a light .
He sprayed himself on the short of this caves and when he became solid , he became solid , he had a dog .
She schools and created a brilliant , with the actual huge , and he gets a slaughter , and it &apos;s disappeared on the banchisa , and it &apos;s gone on the resta , and he &apos;s gone .
We want to talk about cavarsely ?
In the open-1999 , the canadvice of the California , the California control of a largest territory and Texas a messy together .
It &apos;s their new patria . It &apos;s called Nounavut .
It &apos;s a independent territory . They constraints all the minerary resources .
One splendidriving example of how a nation-state can recognize with his population .
And , finally , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious at least to who was in these remote zones of the planet , make it remote of the planet , make it remote .
For somebody is home .
They know , the setions of the human imagination that are up to the date of the human imagination . And for all of these children , as dreams of our children , become part of the geography of the hope .
For finally , we are National Geographic , we are convinced that politicians will never come to anything .
We believe that polemies --
&#91; Applausi &#93; &#93; , but we believe that stories can change the world , and we think that stories can change the world , and perhaps we &apos;re the best institution to tell stories of the world . We each month our site reves 35 million visit .
156 countries , countries transmit .
Our reviews are slabeled by millions of people .
Our work is to travel in the etnosphere to bring our public to bring our public to become away from and , hopefully , hopefully , hopefully , hopefully by the central reveation of the anthropology : the world of exists in diversity , and we have to find a lifestyle and multicultural world and multicultural lifts and my-my-my-life style , and mylifts ,
where the wisdom of all the populations can contribute to our collective well-being .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope to call other than others , and I &apos;ll have heard and evidence some connection .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the official dogm . &quot;
The officer of what ?
The offices of all the Western industrial society . The dogm is the dogm of our citizens , &quot; If we want to male the well-being of our citizens &quot; &quot; The way to do it is to male liberation . &quot;
The reason is , from a side , in fact that freedom is in the fact that freezing is the value , is essential , useful , for human beings .
On the other is that if we &apos;re free , each of us can act to do everything that massive to do everything that massive our well-being , without any one that decided to name .
The way to massize freedom is to male choice .
The more choices are more than they are free , and the greater is their liberty , the greater is .
And that , I think , it &apos;s so deeply radicated in the society that nobody would be able to put it in doubt .
And it &apos;s also deeply radical in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly great .
I &apos;m allowing a simple note on the conducting .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conduction , without content , without content , and the 12 acets of oil and 12 acets that you can buy to make a huge number of conducting to you a huge number of the 175 , you can buy to you a huge number of 15 , you have to be a huge of your degrees .
And that &apos;s what the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic store to buy a stereo . Setaths , CD leter , plastra , plastra , among , the plifer .
And in this single single negotial store , there &apos;s a great number of audio .
We can make six and a half million different and a half million combinations using the components that there are in a neighborhood .
You have to admit that there &apos;s a lot of choice .
Other camps : the world of communications .
And once , when I was a child , when I was a child , when I was a child , when I was a bunch that they were provide by Mama Bell .
You &apos;d born the phone , not buy it .
A consequence of that , by the other , was that the phone would never realize .
These times went .
We have a variety variety of telephones , ests of the cellular phones .
Here &apos;s the future cellular cellular .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , cut up , cut up the nose , and the bakery to me .
If you don &apos;t have it seen in the store under the house , you &apos;re going to do it .
And what happens is that the end is that people come into the stopping and the question . And you know what the answer is ? The answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too many things .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more importantly than the bubbburning , the same explosion of choices .
Asitarian sitarian history , not happens in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor and tell you what you have to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do , or B , &quot; Be , &quot; B &quot; has these benefits , &quot; B has these benefits . &quot; She &apos;s got these benefits . &quot;
You say , &quot; Doctor , what should I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; SA has these benefits and these benefits , and the risks . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebats , &quot; Doctor her , what would it do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; I &apos;m not her . &quot;
And we result it called it autonomy &apos;s autonomy , &quot; expression that it does seems to look like a beautiful thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not that a moving the weight and responsibility to make decisions to someone who knows something , which is the doctor , to someone else that doesn &apos;t know -- and it &apos;s not in condition to make the patient to make decisions that real decisions .
There &apos;s a huge marketing products , degree to people like me and you , who if you think about it , that if you think about it doesn &apos;t make sense , of that we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why can we buy them ?
The answer is that they want to ask to change us .
Something so fundamental as our identity is , as we see in this junk , as you see in this junk . &quot; We don &apos;t want to force children . They &apos;ll be able to force their sex right now , &quot; We don &apos;t have to be able to invent .
And we can reinvent how many times we can reinvent .
That means that every morning , to the risk , you have to decide that kind of person want to be .
And I pushed to the family and marriage , a common time , the common , squeeezing almost for anybody , was that there was the most possible , and you started to make the most soon as possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not even what to do after .
It &apos;s really all to play .
I teach to very smart students , and I do do 20 percent in less than a time .
And not because they &apos;re less short , not because they &apos;re less diligent .
but why they &apos;re impensieritititation , I mean , &quot; I would go up or not ? &quot;
&quot; I should myself must get to get to get to spositive to the children or career ? &quot;
They &apos;re saying logorant .
And they try to answer to these questions , even though this implement , not to the compitation that I teach out and not get a beautiful vote to my exam .
And they have to do it . I &apos;m really important questions .
Now , the work : we are lucky , as Carl Soineen , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from Hotel Randolph .
And in the parentestrian , there &apos;s a anglin , and I &apos;m not going to say anybody , where , WiFi works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use it .
What does , this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work ? It &apos;s going to keep , continuously on every moment , if we have to work or not .
We can go to our juggling to play calcium , with the cell in a tank , Blackberry , the Blackberry , and the hung , on gyn-hand , on gynicky .
And even though they &apos;re all spending , every minute that we see our jobs , we also see that we &apos;re also asking , &quot; Do I answer to this call ? &quot;
&quot; Do I have to answer to this email ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , &quot; it makes the experience of your baby of your son &apos;s partite son from what it would be in other conditions .
So , whatever we look at , small things , small and great materials and life style , life is a choices , life is a choices .
Once the world was this : Over , there were some possibilities , but not everything was a choice .
The world today is this : The dilemma is , &quot; Is &quot; is , &quot; Is &quot; Is &quot; is a positive , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Scial .
The positive side , we all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about negative ones .
All this choice is two effects of those two effects of the people .
The first , paradoxally , is that it &apos;s produced paralysis that liberation .
And so many options that choose to choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I offer you an example , meaningful example : a studio conducted plans .
A colleagues had access to the Vanhead data , the gigantic society of sources , with about a million customers in 2000 different companies .
What she found her is that for every 10 percent solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of adhesion , the percentage of adhesion .
With 50 funds of offering , there &apos;s 10 percent in less adhesions of them , because ?
because of 50 funds between whom I choose , is to choose , is to decide , and the choice is remessed to the indomain .
And domorders , and again domorders , domorders , domorders , and of course , domorders , and of course , domorders , and of course , domorders , and of course , domorders , domorances , and of course domorange , domorders , domorders , and of course domorders to domorders , domorders
You can say that it doesn &apos;t just mean that these workers are going to eat for dogs because they &apos;re not going to say that decision is so obstic that decision is so obstic that they lost the decision is so obstic that they also lost the labor of work .
They &apos;re not participating , they &apos;re losing to five dollars from the work , which would be willing to be going to be going to be .
So , paralysis a consequence of the having too many choices .
And I think that makes the world like this .
And finally , for the etchlense : ketchup , or mayonese ? &quot;
Would you like to do that right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and the wrong , and the wrong conducted conducted .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can avoid paralysis and to choice , we finally have full of how we would be satisfying with less options that we would be with less options that choose .
And that &apos;s that for several reasons .
One of them is that with a lot of conducting conducting , if you buy a buy and it &apos;s not perfect , is easy to imagine that you could have a choice that would be better . And what happens is that the imagined alternative , and what happens is that the imagined alternative , and the repieces record defense remaining with the decision , and the record , and the record , and the slightly , and the sh remaining , and the sfactor , and the remaining remaining ,
even when it was a good decision .
The choices are , the more it &apos;s easy to displease all be insodenting of the choose .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert : Dan Gilbert , like the value that we depends on what we &apos;re going to depend on .
In the rest , when there are lots of options , it &apos;s easy to represent the tools of the alternative alternative and be less satisfying of the option that is choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m an example , I &apos;m not in New York .
But that &apos;s what you would probably think .
There &apos;s this copy to Hamptons .
A place of light .
Spight-plendida . Otype , it &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not nothing . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , malediition , is Agost . &quot;
&quot; All my neighbors are out to Manhattan are away . &quot;
&quot; I could talk to their home in front of home . &quot;
And it &apos;s two weeks , from the idea that he &apos;s losing -- every day -- the chance of parking where it wants .
The cost-opportunity is the sodgets for what we have , even when the choice was eccellent .
And the most of options we have to consider , the more the characteristics , we &apos;ll return up as a constitution .
Here &apos;s another example .
This jet us a lot of things .
It &apos;s about the moment , and maybe the slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you choose , you choose to not do other .
The things we don &apos;t choose have so many attractivity that can make less attractive less attractive what we do .
Third point : the spiral growth of the expectations .
I tried it on my skin bought a new jeans .
I remember almost always jeans .
And once jeans were a only kind of a kind , comproud , and they were scomfortable , they were scomfortable , they were just later , they were washing a lot of times , began to go well .
So I went to buy a couple again when the old one , I said , &quot; I need a couple jeans , and I said , &quot; I need a couple jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Would the committing , &quot; Have fit , easy , relaxy and fit ? &quot;
She wants to the grera or bottons ? &quot; Stonewashed ? &quot;
&quot; Lave them . &quot;
&quot; Sow the basic or stretches ? Bumble bla -- &quot; he was bumped to elencing .
I was sought , and after a little jeans , and after a little jeans , &quot; I want the guy , &quot; I want the only guy , &quot; he had no idea what it was , so for a hour , and then I came out of the jeans , and then I came out of the best jeans , with the best jeans I &apos;ve ever had .
It was the best . With the whole choice .
But I was worse .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand it .
The reason I was worse worse is that with all that choice , my own expectations were high , the jeans had to be perfectly .
I had a little bit of a minime . I didn &apos;t wait for anything when it was only a kind of thing , but when there was a kind of a kind of , but when it was 100 different , labor a kind of perfectly a kind of perfectly .
What I had busted was good , but not perfect .
After after that , I was talking to what I was looking for I was insodenting to expectations .
The addition of options in people &apos;s life don &apos;t make the expectations that these have respect to the options of the options of the options of the options of them .
And that will produce less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing if it makes it .
Because if they knew , if they knew what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more to this .
&quot; It was better when it was worse , &quot; The reason it was better when it was worse worse , it was that when it was worse , it was even worse as well as we could meet the places .
In the world where we live -- opulent , the world , industrialized industrialized citizens with the perfection of perfectly -- the maxpatterns are the things to heighbors .
You never surprised out because your expectations , my expectations , they &apos;re an injector .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Basse expectations . &quot;
I mean , little self-autobiographic moment , and my wife is really stupend .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t have to be able to be .
But to be not always , it &apos;s not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of buying a couple jeans soul when you &apos;re only that jeans is that when you &apos;re not satisfied , and you say , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot; The answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What could I do ?
When there are hundreds of types , and you buy a insodenting insodenting , and you ask who is responsible , it &apos;s just as clear that responsible , and you &apos;re going to be .
You would have done better .
With hundreds of variety available , there &apos;s no scuses .
So when people are decisions , even though the result is valid , they feel like , they feel like , and they give the cheapter to them .
For the last years , depression is exploss in the industrialized world .
I think that a meaningful factor -- not the only one , but that &apos;s important -- of this depression is that people have experiences of depression is that people are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation thought that the colpa is them .
So the final result is that we &apos;re better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the offical dogm , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely fake . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that some choice that &apos;s better than having it &apos;s better than having it , but it wasn &apos;t to be a lot of choice .
There &apos;s a critical value , perhaps , I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure that we &apos;ve been over-up , we &apos;ve been out of a level where the choices choices our life .
Now , from political point of view -- I almost finished -- from political point of view , the nocle is .
What allows is the whole choice in the industrial society is the material wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know , that the problem isn &apos;t that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too much much .
So the factory that I &apos;m talking about is a directly to modern a directions of modern , eye society .
And what it does deprove and arrage is this : Steve Levitt to you about how much the expensive and scomods for whether and the car seats are unuseless . It &apos;s a waste of money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and dispendependent , it &apos;s not just useless .
I &apos;m going to be a deleteries .
They &apos;re going to do worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows , it was reversing to those where people have too few possibilities , it would not be only their lives , it would not be only their life to improve but our .
This is what economists call a paretian improvement .
A redistribution redistribution is good at all -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in excess that comes back to us .
To conclude , you can become everything you want to be what you want to do --
You , people of culture , you think , &quot; What does that believe that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t make it in a glass . &quot;
&quot; A castrated imagination , a limited view of the world -- &quot;
and I interpretation it like this , at the beginning .
But then , I thought , I realized that that fish knows that long knows the long .
because the reality of the fact is that if you eat in the slide , so that , &quot; everything is possible , &quot; you can &apos;t get freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you cut the mocking-sea , that all divent you can declining .
You &apos;re going to get the paralysis , and you reduced the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost of course , too strip , perhaps even for us .
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic symbolic and , I &apos;m afraid , for the rovine .
Thank you for heart .
