The year I showed these slide to show that the slide to show that the calculus glacial glacial , which for almost three million years , has the 48 percent .
But this subject , this subject because it &apos;s not shows the gravity of the gap of the ice .
The arten is artic is , in a sense , the pulsant cue of the global climate system .
It expands of inside and result ritira .
The next slide is going to be a rapid rapid py remarkable fully on the last 25 years .
The ice loss loss are in red .
As you see , they expand down to the blue .
That &apos;s the ice in the ice , which is the ice , which retails exted .
You can see that the drap cost , of five years or more , it &apos;s like five years or more , is like the blood , which is like the blood , which is like the blood , which is like the blood , which is like the blood ,
In 25 years , it &apos;s been going to this .
This is a problem because the glasses the entire terrain the ocean artment , where there are enormous amount of conger , where there are enormous amount of conger , and they &apos;re transformed in metan .
Respect to the totality of the atmospheric inquantity , that quantity might radical , that quantity might radical , surprised this point of not .
In some some sharks , very deep in Alaska , the metan is already rebecting from water .
The Katey Walter Satey Walter University of Alaska team in a team pressed team a team layer .
Video : Wow !
A reason is that this term termal scale the Greenland from the north .
This is a quickime to the glacial .
The brought had never reached free .
This is the Kangerlush , in the southeast of Greenland .
If you want to know how to feel the sal level for the gactual ches on land , here is where you can get the sea .
These corrents are increasing rapidly .
Another part of the planet : Antartica , the biggest block of the planet .
The month month , the scientists have diclose that the ice of ice is in negative , and that the Antartica , and that the Antartica , which pographies on some islands , is particularly rapid in the science .
Equive to six feet level , like in Greenland .
Sull Himalaya , the third biggest block , you see new laghi , which a few years ago , which a few years ago , who were glacier .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population remarkable to be half of the water potable to the slide .
Sulle Ande : this ice is the fundamental water of this city .
The brought is increased .
But when you diminishes , the same accept water .
In California is about the Sierra Nevada is diminute 40 percent .
The idrics are in crises .
The predictions , as you have read , they &apos;re graves .
The growth of the growth in the world &apos;s downtown .
The environmental disasters are increasing to a rhythm , and without previous .
Four times more numerous in the last 30 years , I read for 75 .
This is a whole thing about all untest .
If you look at the storyteller if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons -- 25 million tons of tons in the ocean .
Look at the area of the Isn Pacific Pacific , to the West , and on the West parts of Indian until of Indian inextent of the objected in the ocean .
Most of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of it .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States are one of the two of the more emissions , together at China .
And he was proposed to build a lot of other centers .
But we &apos;re assisting to a change .
These are the annulled projects in the last years and some of the alternative verge .
In any way , there &apos;s a politics in our country .
The carbon industries and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon , which is a hoss-babilic .
That picture me , I &apos;d remember something --
SNatal Natal , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion scories of papes .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the second biggest flow in America .
It happened around Natal .
The nature of the nature of the carbon industries was this .
Video : The paper . The carbon is a kind of allegro and happy .
It &apos;s abondant here in America , and it makes our economy .
Fross the carbon is always more and more and more and more clean .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and work work work work work , and they tend to stay stipendence .
Al Gore : From here is a big part of the West Virginia .
The largest society on the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his friendly amministration .
Video : Don Blankenship : I &apos;m clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosis , Harry Reid -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima Protetion .
This is a one of them .
Video : Attor : Alla COALergy see the climatics change as a minute of our business .
So , this is our priority is to invest a great amount of money in a public sector to make public and confuse the verity on carbon .
In fact , the carbon is not spores .
We think it &apos;s a good profumum .
So you don &apos;t preoctation of climate change .
Let me do to us .
Video : Attor : Carbone , you &apos;ve heard a lot of talk .
So let me give you a game in a structure of the clean .
Strican ! The car is a little bit , but this is the sound of the technology of carbon clean .
The carbon is between the crap crap cycles of global warming , but the notion of the carbon clean clean clean clean of clean .
You have a look : this is the clean of the carbon the carbon .
Al Gore : Inally , the positive positive to economic issues to economic issue and the security .
Video : My Minent : The U.America is in the national security , the national climate crisis .
The philo that the basic phils all : our dependence from fossil , like the charbon and oil .
Now , perhaps there is a new , audace solution for using circus .
Really America : 100 percent of pulites , 10 years .
A plan to remove America to work , make more securi , and help to stop and help to stop the global warming .
Finally , one solution that basti basic solution our problems .
Really nice America . She &apos;s ready .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Comment : This is to reduced America .
One of the fastest ways to take the longest of bring the bustible that killed our planet .
Comparse : The future is here . I feel , just a new energy .
Compared to two : Noves investment for places of work ballowed .
She &apos;s got to be realists . It &apos;s time to be realists .
Al Gore : A proverbio African proverbio says , &quot; If you go to fast , you go to the sunclear , you go to .
If you want to go away , you go together . &quot;
We have to go away away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
The year at TED picture in the LHC .
And I promise to go back to the way to work .
So here here . And for those that another time . And for those that other time , there was no , the largest scientific experiment , ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever .
Her compit is to rerereach the conditions that were present less than a billion second from the beginning of the universe -- at 600 million times a second .
All this is simply environment .
This is the car soul under Ginevency .
We must picture these mini-Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Big Bang Bang Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Bang Big Bang Big Bang Bang Big Bang Big Bang Bang &apos;s in .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ALAS -- is 44 meters and has a 22 meters .
This is a spectacular picture of ALAS in building so you can see the proportions .
The 10 seceptember of the last year we have access the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was because of immense festegs in control of control .
It &apos;s an image of the first particles that had done all around the LHC , go into collision , and by by a lot of the LHC , and I &apos;m honey , with a resuler resultor particles in the rest .
In other words , when we see that picture 10 secember , we realized that the car worked , which is a great vitter .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to do us to exulse more or this , when somebody went on Google and the page was this .
What means we have a cultural impact cultural impact on that scientific .
About a week later , there was a problem with the car , just this phili , and these phils here -- these dored dored .
These films are 13,000 ampits when the car works at the massive .
Now , the technicians between you look at the phils and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . &quot; I &apos;m phils . &quot;
And instead , because when they &apos;re very cold the cosidly cosmidle ,
So at least 271 degrees , at a perature of the space between the stars , these phils can bring that rent rent .
In one of the youngest novemila in LHC , there was a fect of fabrical noven .
So the phili slaughter , and 13,000 ampounds , and 13,000 ampounds of improvisly met .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressionant if you think these magneties more than 20 tons , and that are moved by about 30 feet , and that have been moved by about 30 feet .
They are damneggggets about 50 magnetic .
We had to have to take them , what we did .
We &apos;ve repristinate them .
Now they &apos;re going back to all their subtotal place .
By the end of the bzo , the louse is going to be new integro .
We &apos;ll accenjoy it , and we expect to get data or player , and we keep so our adventure to discover what the morning is the morning .
Now , of course , in a way of these , the accidents reaccount on the value of science and engineering the science of the engineering . It &apos;s easy to be .
I think the fact that the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact of go beyond the value of things like LHC .
I &apos;d like to end with words of a Inglese Inglese , Humphry Davy , which , imagine , in the difesa , in the difesight , his bledge was Michael Faray , he said , &quot; Nothing is so pericangerous for the resive of human mind as the science as the rest of the human mind as well as the science of the science of the human mind that are not going to be a new . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start to asking you to rethink about when , from children , played with the morning .
While you can understand them and make them , take them and make them , take them and move them , learned can actually think and solve problems and solve problems .
The space is deeply connected to the way we understand a way we understand graphor of the world around us .
So , from information by the uslity of our interaction with physical objects , together at my consultor Jeevan Kalanithi , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to ask me , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of just a mouse , we could just have a digital information with a digital . I could have a desktop with the way , we could actually get a information ,
and systems our piacement ?
The question was so interesting question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , by building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a whole computer interactive computer .
In a few words , a Siftable is a whole computer interactive computer .
You can move them with the hand , they can see , &quot; you can see , &quot; between them , and they have a screen and a radio .
But surprised , are physics , as the morning , they can move just move them .
The Siftable is an example of a new ecosystem for manippulate information .
And as a hand that become more physical , knowledge of the other , and as we have to be more physical , to know , of other people , as we can explore new , we can explore new stils and fun fun .
I &apos;ll start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configurate to show : if I incline it in a direction , video , the video , the video , the video grimp back .
These results are interactive .
If you &apos;re interested in , they &apos;re interested in .
If they come out , you see it , they noticed it and they can agitate a little bit .
If they come out , you see it , they noticed it and they can agitate a little bit .
They also green their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power to use switch , &quot; to be a hundred of data , &quot; a color like a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable , as a century securate securate , and I can use them for green to green color in that entral , where they miss .
I can use them to green them to green color in that central , where they misk .
If we &apos;re too , we can put a little place .
You also are beautiful possibility of opens , like languages , the math and games of logic , where people can try and see things that are going to try and see it &apos;s a typical results .
Now , I &apos;m --
This is a sequence of Fibonacnal sequence .
Here we have a game of words that is half between Scarabeo and Boble .
Pratically , at every turn to any sliterate on every Siftable , Pratically , to every turn up in any Siftable , and while you can get a letter on every Siftable .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new sector of letters and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s a children came to the Media Lab , I did in a way that they try and turned a video .
They &apos;re very high placeyed .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of thing is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of education .
You only say , &quot; You &apos;ve got to say , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s another people who try it .
This is our birtest younger , there &apos;s the right .
In fact , it just wanted to be implement .
They were only morning .
Now , this is an application of an interactive carton .
We wanted to build a tool for the aper apart of the languages . He &apos;s Felix .
You can put new characters in the scene , sunning the Siftable .
You can put new characters in the scene , sunning the Siftable .
So , he &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : The sun is surprised .
David Merriled : Now he took a treator in the scene .
Video : The art treator .
Boom !
So schools , and put them neiftable , and put them neighbors --
Video : Bau !
To inventing their story .
Video : Ciao !
DM : It &apos;s a story with final open , and it can decide him as you spend him .
DM : It &apos;s a story with final open , and it can decide him as you spend him .
Video : Just it .
DM : The last example I &apos;ve got time to show you is a tool , realized by recently , to try to watch and exeguess .
It &apos;s a recent , realized by recently , to watch and exegue .
The Siftable here are against sound as base , base and bacteria .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choices .
You can also start to put these sound in a sequence of comport .
And modify it just takes it touch a &quot; and a &quot; sequence . &quot;
These are effects that you can controlled from , as the result and philer .
The acks to a particular sound and then inclines to figure out out .
And then there are the effects like time and volume , and volume , which are applicate to the sequence .
Let &apos;s look like this .
Video : We &apos;ll start putting a base in two Siftable . &quot; TTTTTo , we &apos;re going to put it in a series , we extend to add , we add to the other basic .
Now , I put a basic line .
Video : Now I add to the percussions --
Video : And I &apos;ll put the philer philer , so I can controlled the bacteria , so I can controlled the effect .
Video : I can speak the whole sequence , I can fly fast the whole sequence of time from a side or another .
Video : And now I &apos;ll add the bottom to the bottom to get more expression .
Video : I can reach the sequence &quot; to the sequence &quot; to the fly . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to places it , but I can try and make it longer , make it longer or more corner .
And now , finally , I can smoke the whole sequence inking the left Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new man and more like this , and more like our brain and more like our brain and body .
And today , I &apos;ve got time to show you one of the result of this perspective , and also some possibilities that we try to bring out of bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmate is that this new generation of designing to interact with digital media objects , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the hour to talk to everybody .
I &apos;m a writter .
Scut books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than this , obviously .
It &apos;s also the love and the fascine of my life .
And I don &apos;t expect that you can change .
But , said , something particular happened to my life and in my life and in my life and in my life , which brought me to realibrate the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called &quot; Manwealthy , Pua , which , a lot of reason my precedents , for some reason I &apos;m going to be a very big , and it become a great sensational sensational , bestesself-in-interational .
And the result is that everywhere now , people treatment me as if they were condanced .
Do true -- condanced , condanced .
They &apos;re going to be high and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t fear ar a couldn &apos;t you don &apos;t do much more to do ?
You have no fear of continuing to write for all life without power of the life without more to be able to create a book that can important to somebody ? &quot;
What can you important to somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s rasses , you know .
But it might go worse , in part of that I remember 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a scritical .
I met to met the same reaction by the purpose .
And people said me , &quot; You don &apos;t temes to have successful ?
You have no fear that the uilation of the refer ?
You have no fear of doing this to make this all of life for anything that anything was ever ever out and die on a cumule of all infrants with the bought full of cut ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I have a couple of all those things .
I &apos;ve always been fear .
And I also have a lot of other things that people don &apos;t have to inate .
As the full and other things spaventlemerge .
But , as much as I wrote what I thought and I was saying , and I &apos;m sure sure is because ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logic that anyone who have been waiting to be spavented by a job that you feel until to do .
But what &apos;s so particular in the imprised creative to make us nervous about the health of the mental health , others do not ?
As my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don &apos;t remember one time in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if he was asked if he had to be engineer ?
There was never -- that block of the John engineer John , how do you ?
Not work so , you know , you know ?
Onestly , chemicals like group have not certainly , in the centuries , drawings , dagnered the reputation of being almost .
We have a writers , we have enough this reputation , and not only writers but creative of any gender , we have this reputation of being enormously an instasible mentally .
And it &apos;s not a rest of the duces of the magnific death magnific ments that only , only in the 21st century , they die young people die and often to them .
And also , those who don &apos;t have suicidated to be really disdisdisdisdisgued by their dones .
Norman Mailer , before I die , the last interview said , &quot; Every last interview , I know a little bit more &quot; . &quot; A very much more &quot; &quot; One extraordinary about work .
But we don &apos;t bad it , when we heard these things because we &apos;ve heard these things so long that we &apos;ve completely interior that we &apos;ve completely interested and accepted the notion that creativity and the art , and then it &apos;s going to have to reduce .
And the question I want to take to everybody today is : are you agree with this idea ?
You know this thing -- because it also looks at the end of a distance centimeter at me .
I think it &apos;s odious .
And I think it &apos;s pericolous , and I don &apos;t want to see the perpetuate in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encouraging our great minds of life .
And I &apos;m sure that , in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start fuging to that heard of the surroundings , surprises , surprised the circumstances where they are in my career .
That &apos;s true -- you look at the young , I &apos;ve got about 40 years .
I have about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that any thing I &apos;m going to writing now , it &apos;s going to be juddated by the world as a job that was going on after my last book .
I &apos;m going to be slaughter , because we &apos;re all the biggest friends here -- is likely to my biggest .
Oh , Gesus , which think I was !
You know this is the gender of thinking that &apos;s a person to start to start a person to start bunch , and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I &apos;d like to keep doing this work that we love .
So , the question becomes , how do you ?
So it seems to me , after a lot of reflective , which is to create a psychology , OK ?
I have a few way to find a security of security , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxium , and my natural anxium , and I &apos;m trying to do it . And as I was looking for for for the year , trying to find out of the world , trying to find if they could have some more ideas to see if they could have some some more ideas , if they could have some of the better ideas , and more sane and more sane and more sane and more sane . And I &apos;m going to writing it , and I &apos;m going to do that .
about how to help people to make people care , and emotional inerents of creative creative .
And that research got me to the ancient Great and ancient Rome .
Seguitemi because I gave me in a circle and then back .
In the ancient Greef , and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity was from men , OK ?
He thought it was a creativity was this spirit of divine and becomes to a few sources , and that sell men from a few slights and known , for reasons and knowledge .
The greatest called these these beyond the beyond the creativity . &quot;
Sownered , wonderful , creducks to have a demon that elargve .
The Roman were in the same idea , but they called the spirit of a genius .
which is great , because Romans wasn &apos;t really a genius was a very intelligent somebody particularly intelligent .
They have a genius was this kind of divine that would believe that it was creded literally lived in the walls of a studio , a little bit like Dobby , and that was out of a Dobby , and that was going to be able to be hidden the work of the artist and model and moon the result of that work .
Here &apos;s eye -- this is the distance of what I talk -- that is the distance of what I talk about -- that psychological costructed you get to the result of your work .
And everybody knew that was so that it worked , right ?
So , anticient artists were protected by certain things , like for example , like the too much narcism , right ?
If your work was exceptional work was exceptional , you couldn &apos;t take it all the market , everybody knew that you had been helped by this genius .
If your fallian job , it wasn &apos;t all color , right ?
All they knew that was your genius to be an incapable .
And so people who have creativity in Occidest for a long time .
And then Rinning the Rinal came up and all changed , and nactivity this great idea ; we put the human beings to the centers and the mistakes and no more and more and no more to leave the creatures that write from the divinity .
This was the principle of human anesimum , and people started thinking that creativity was completely , and people start thinking that creativity was completely shared .
And for the first time in history , you start to referred that or the artist of a rather than a person with genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big error .
I think that allow somebody , a simple person to believe that it &apos;s like a recipient of being a fundamental as a fundamental , and the surprises , unknown and feeling is a responsibility to be a lot of drawings , and it &apos;s a very big phililum to be a very big philossity .
It &apos;s like to ask someone to inroom .
Deform and completely become the ego and creates all these expectations on performance .
And I think it was this pression to destroyed the artists in the past 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it is , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe you can go back to a more ancient comprecient of human relationship between human and mystery .
Or perhaps no .
Maybe we can &apos;t sing 500 years of rational thinking about 500 years of rational thinking .
And there is people in the audience that only would lawyers of the solleverage , and you do that , you do that followed people to do that people seem , and you do that people sfit .
I &apos;m not going to not convince you all about this .
But the question I &apos;d like to bring is -- why not ?
Why don &apos;t I think that way ?
Because it has more sense of any other thing that has ever heard to explain the exasperant exasperant exasperant process .
A process that , as everybody who ever ever ever ever ented to do something -- so fundamentally , everybody here -- you don &apos;t have a non-rationally .
And , in fact , it can be completely paranormal paranormal .
I did this met recently met with the extraordinary poeter Ruth Stone , which has 90 years , but that &apos;s been a few years , but it was a poetry for all life and said , in his hural . He was working out in the fields , in fact , in fact , in fact , when a few days , and heard , under , when a poetry .
He said , I &apos;m like a fragorous air .
And that was coming back to her out of the landscape .
He felt it was going to be , because he was tremendous ground its land .
She had a sola sunning thing to do with that point and it was words , &quot; run as a math . &quot;
And so it turns out to the house and he was inside this poetry , and it wouldn &apos;t have to take a piece of card and a math , as a fast , as a quick page , and it &apos;s a page .
Sometimes , he couldn &apos;t be fast , so she was recorded and correced and correct and correct up and correct up through the home and the lost and it would continued to rolate through the landscape , and it would continued to rolate through the landscape , and it would continued to be a poet . &quot;
Then there were some of -- this piece I &apos;ll never size it -- there were some moments where it was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and was looking for the card and the poetry and the past through , and he was a math in while that was going to be a math , and then he said , that it was like , and then he said , that it was like that , and he was offered with the other hand , and hunger .
He was offered the poem of the tail and remain his body and transmit in his body and transclean transmit on the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page and intatta , but the contrary , the last word .
So when I heard it -- I can be exactly the same thing to my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conducture .
I &apos;m a move , and my way to work is ; I &apos;m going to wake up with the same orary every day and work and work and go on and work and go on and go on .
But even in my daggin my daggin , I striet contro that thing , sometimes .
And I imagine that also many of you .
You know , even though the job and ideas were gone from a certain fundamental ground , I wouldn &apos;t know it .
What is this ?
And how can we relational to do it in a way to do us to do that , but rather , rather , what do you do you remains ?
For how much much about , the best example I have is the music example I have is music for Tom Waits , which I &apos;ve interviewed for a nal day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life was the incartoward of the life has been forward , trying to controlled , and try to controlled these species of creative impulses .
But then he invected , and a day as he was driving on a day , as he was driving on a &quot; author Los Angeles , changed everything .
He was going to go fast and all of a sent tract , this little little bags , which is wonderful in his head like , which is the inspiration , and the literally , and the layer , and the various , and the wonderful , but it &apos;s wondered , but it &apos;s not as to how to take it .
It &apos;s not a piece of card , it doesn &apos;t have a math , it doesn &apos;t have a recorer .
So he starts to feel this species of old old anxioned in him , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;ll remark up , and I &apos;ll remark up .
I &apos;m not good enough , I don &apos;t have a good good enough . &quot;
And instead of going to go in the panic , he stopped .
I &apos;ll move the whole process and did something completely new .
I &apos;ll just look at the sky and said , &quot; Scush , I &apos;m not seeing ? &quot;
&quot; You know , you know , you can write a song now ?
If you really want to exist , you go back to a more standing when I can take me care .
Altricks , you go to important anything to be .
You know , you know , Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his process was worked after this .
Not work , the job was still like always like .
But the process , and the anxized that was retaken when the genius , the genius that genius , the genius that was nothing else .
but it was a peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration a conversation between Tom and this thing that &apos;s strange and external thing that it wasn &apos;t Tom .
So as much as I felt that story to change a little bit the way I worked and save me once a time .
This idea , I save me when I was writing , &quot; Pua , &quot; Pua , &quot; and I said , &quot; and I &apos;m going to think that we &apos;re all working on something and we &apos;re going to think it &apos;s going to think it &apos;s a disaster , which is what &apos;s going to be a disaster , which is the worse .
Not only bad , just the worse book .
And I started thinking about gecting this project .
But then I got to remind me to the air and try .
So I went to my face in the hritish and I &apos;ll go to a hell of my hand , I &apos;ll go to a hand .
And I said to the voices , &quot; You know , what , we &apos;re going to be not brilliant to be not brilliant interested , not ?
Because as I see there is no more than I &apos;ve got , I don &apos;t have this .
So if you want to have better , you have to presented and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , I don &apos;t do it .
I &apos;ll move the same because it is my job .
And I &apos;d like to do for my own , I &apos;m presented that I &apos;ve been presented to do my part . &quot; Because at the end is so , OK -- in the end of North Africa &apos;s deserts in the North Africa was going to be dancing to the dancer , dancing music sacter that they were going to have a lot of hours and hours to the alba .
And they always were magnific , because the balleres were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every long , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists , and one of these artists .
And I know you know what I know , because I know you &apos;ve view , at a certain point , a performance .
It was like a time , and it was like a long time , and the walking through a special species of portal and was not doing anything about different from the sun , like 1,000 night before , but it was all halling .
And I know not just as a human .
But it happened by the didrawed and subject in the fire of the divinity .
And when this happened , the people knew what was , people know what it was called it with his name .
They were congiven the hands and started to cancer , &quot; Allah , Allah , God , Allah , God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curious storyteller -- when Mororryes , I was asked this habits with them and pronounced with them and pronounce in the centuries of Allah , &quot; Alah , &quot; which you can still hear in the corride .
In Spain , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , by-by-bunch , I was a bunch of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incomprisable , etary , etc , etc , etc , etary God .
And it &apos;s great because we need .
But , the problem comes back , the day , for the dancer , when you wake and discovery that are 11 in the morning of the morning of God , and I &apos;m going to be there .
It &apos;s just a mortal with a mal gran to ginockyyyia , and maybe not to be able to be able to get to that altitude .
And perhaps no one of God while I &apos;m still going to do with his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most sweet to make in a creative life .
But perhaps not to be so angerous , if you can &apos;t believe , anzyutt , which is , which the most extraordinary exts of your being being being being being from you .
But you believe it &apos;s just a little bit of data from a unimaginable inable to the squisite of this squisite of your life that you have to go to anything else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think that all changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s securly as I thought for different months during the book that I &apos;m going to have a book that I &apos;m going to take a pressing , and I &apos;m going to be following my great successful .
And what I have to keep me when I feel electrized by this is , not not have fear .
Not you . It &apos;s not just your work .
And it &apos;s inuates to presented you for your part , whatever you can .
If your job is ball , you know .
If the wine , I &apos;m sure to you ask to leave some kind of wonderful kind of wonderful kind of wonderful , for only through your street , then you know , &quot; Go ! &quot;
Altracks , you have the same dance .
And &quot; Oh ! &quot;
I think about it . I think you have to teach it .
&quot; You know , you know , only for the same , only for human-test love and test tal table to be presenting .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Good !
As you know , I talked about some of these projects on human genome , what it can meaning and discovery new set of genes .
Now we &apos;re starting a new perspective : We started to digitalize biology and now to speak from that code we &apos;re going to go into a new biology , designing and synthesizing and synthesizing life .
We &apos;ve always been trying to take big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot;
We &apos;ve tried different approaches , reduced the minimes .
We &apos;re digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequence the human genome , they were sequence from the world &apos;s analogic world of the digital world of the computer .
Now , we can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smaller genoma , which is the smaller genoma .
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genoma even smaller .
We &apos;re able to eliminate a hundred of genes about 500 genes that are here .
But when we have a look at his metabolic maps , it &apos;s relatively simple respect to our .
I think you have to do this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this can bring to a living cell .
So we decided that only to design was synthesize this croma way that we could modify this chromosoma way of power those fundamental questions .
So we started the adventure of the &quot; we can synthesize a ? &quot;
Can chemistry to make these big molecules that we never have to create before ?
And in case , we can make a crazy crowd ?
A chromosome is just a chemical material chemical material chemical material .
The speed that we are able to digitalize life is growing up with life is growing up .
Our capability to write the genetic code , rather progress ram rather than it , but it &apos;s better .
And our most recent returned the branch on a exponential curve .
We &apos;ve started more than 15 years ago .
The process has requires , starting with a bioethic review , before we start with a bioethic reatening .
But we found that DNA is very difficult .
There are deces of thousands of machines in the world that produces are small segments of DNA , the longer of 30 to 50 letters and it &apos;s a process : the challenge is a long time .
So we had to develop a new metod to assembling these fragments and read the herrors .
And this was our first test , to start from the digital information of the genoma of Phi &apos;s genoma 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills to kill .
We designed the fragments , effective , effective , and you get a molecule of DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of inert material chemical material chemical material , bacteria have inert in bacteria , bacteria have ininitiated this genetic code and producing particles .
The viral particles are then you stay from cells , they &apos;re back and they destroyed to the E.
I talked about recently with membres of the oil industry , which they have certainly compress this model .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software really going to build his same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the biggest things .
We wanted to build the whole chromosome of bacterium .
They are more than 580 mount letters .
So we &apos;ve thought of built it in the size of viruses , so that we can change casses the casses of a living cell of a living cell .
The progeption is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequence this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accuratezing was a herror for every 10 mile base .
We &apos;ve found it , required red , 30 errors . If we had that original sequence , we &apos;d never be able to do that work .
One part of the process is designing sectity , 50 letters that have a little bit of 50 letters to build smaller subject to build smaller subject to build small working together .
We &apos;ll try ununclean elements here .
You probably have a read of that we put up the filist .
Think of it : We have a genetic genetic code on four letters : A , C , Good and T.
Three of those letters together , and they code up about 20 amminds , and there &apos;s a specific order to every letters for every letters .
So we can use genetic code to write words , frasurements .
What we did in the beginning was self-doing .
Some of them were in the fact that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
We designed these segments to simply them to be just unununit with the enymes .
There are a entire entire figure out that .
And we started to assemble with parts , starts with segments , starting with five to seven to form , unenduge them in a way to form of forming 24 ments swites to get to 7,000 letters .
And every step , we made these segments in abundance so we can sequence them that we &apos;re trying to create a very robuy process of crease a minute .
We &apos;re trying to authomatize the process .
So , this seems to be the tabellon a by-basket play-by-by-by-basket .
When we get to these very long segments , the more than 100 midle , the more than 100 middle in E.
It comes to the limits of modern biology .
So we &apos;ve been considered mechanisms .
We knew to another mecchanism called a recognizes , which in biology is going to repull DNA to repair DNA to degree the segments .
Here &apos;s an example .
This is called organism Deinoccurs , can make three million rad rad .
You can see in the square of superior as his chromosome as his becomes destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours comes out of as before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can completely .
They can live under a various .
They &apos;re absolutely sure that life in space , and you can find new environment .
Actually , NASA showed that this is .
This is an image of molecule that we have building these processes , just using the full free segments to insert .
The free full of the authomatically .
This picture was not taken with a electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a very big molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that they coholed a period of about six seconds .
This is the published that we did a little bit ago .
They are more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the biggest molecule of a definitely definitely created by man .
He has a fish molecular slaughter to 300 million .
If we stop it with a career 10 without spaces , they would like 142 pages only to get this genetic code .
Now , how do we work it ?
Of course , you can have a virus is a little girls .
It &apos;s a little more complicated when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s simpler even when it &apos;s cell when it is : you can just extract as our : you can just just extract the nucleo and inserious process to another , which is practice .
In the archaea , the cromosome is integrated by the cell , but we &apos;ve just recently demonstrated that we &apos;re able to do a complete trapion of a cell of a cell of a cell of a cell of a cell of a cell of a cell of a cell of a cell of a bunch and activity it .
We have a balance chromosome from a microbial species .
The two are different as men from the topes .
We &apos;ve added some genes in a more way way to decide what chromosomous for this chromosoma .
The slide with the scientist in a way to kill all proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was study -- and you open our software graphics graph -- the new chromosoma -- the new chromosomous chromosoma .
And we started thinking that we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to spush us more in there .
This is one of the major of evolution .
We &apos;ve found that tanssize species have added a second or a third or a third of a few part , added in a thousands of new new trained new trained species .
So who thinks about evolution as a gene of a gene at the time that it doesn &apos;t have a lot of biology .
There are a scientist called the &quot; &quot; &quot; The entives of restriition that addiction that addiction the DNA .
The croma that was in the cell of it didn &apos;t have a lot .
The cell phones that we have inserit-the-box cellphones that we have .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other croma , as an extraneum , and we found it up with only cell and the new cell .
it became blue because of the genes we &apos;ve inserted .
And in a short lass of time , all the characteristics of a species , and you &apos;ve got lost , and it &apos;s transformed on the new software that we insert in the cell .
All proteins are changed , membranes are changed , and when we reach the genetic code , and when we realized .
Now , this might seem seemm to genetics , but altering the software we can change things in a way .
Now , I &apos;ve got explained that here is not talking about genesius -- but I &apos;m going to start from three million years and a half million years of evolution , and I &apos;ve already said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of this .
Why do this ?
I think it &apos;s pretty obvious when we think about our necessity .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to give you an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946 , there will be four years , there will be four .
We &apos;re going to have problems now to find food , fresh water and pulity , medicinal and well-zin a half billion people .
It &apos;s still more dare doing it for nine billion .
We &apos;re going to use more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion barbarili .
That means million barili barili a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replaces to replaces them , it will be a huge challenge .
In more we have to tent of all the CO2 , these materials that finished in the atmosphere .
At day day day , thanks to the scientific discovery in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the designed components for the future .
The electronic industry only is a dozen of components , and think about how many different things are come .
Ouur limits here are basically from biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have some techniques , thank these synthetization , able of these synthesization , we call genomics combinatory .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can producing a million craft crobot that can producing a day .
Think of these 20 million genes or try to get these 20 million genes or try to make the processes to make it , new vaccines , we can change , and new vaccines , we can change , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for possibility of survival , chemistry or carburing , or of carburant , production of vaccines .
This is an anea of some software program that we &apos;re working for to be able to be able to seeing and designing species on computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know , we don &apos;t need as well as they are .
We know exactly what they &apos;re their genetic code .
Now we &apos;re now focus on the carbons of how quarter generation .
You &apos;ve seen you see that you extract from the grain was a mal experiment .
We have carbons of second and generation that will use enough by by the szechero to carbons of carbons of butananals as the open or different butanwils .
But the only way that biology can have a great impact with no increasingly increasing more more than food and limitations the cost of food and limitations the disphert of the food , which we &apos;re working to design cells that can make this scale , and we think of the purpose , and think we could make this scale scale the first carbon of how many generation in about 18 months .
The solar solar combined with CO2 is a metodom -- but in our discovery in all the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism that we have described in 1996 .
It &apos;s going to have to be about 2500 feet of depth of deep depth of the water .
They &apos;re going to put from CO2 by using idrogen molecular how much energy .
We &apos;re trying to figure out what we can do is the CO2 , which can make it easily be transported through your , convertising that CO2 in carburant , to drive this process .
So we think we can think we could be able to increase what we can do is increase what the question of &quot; that &apos;s life . &quot; We have the modest of remains . &quot; We have the modest of replacing the whole oil industry .
Exactously . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can you ?
And it would come a principal of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working to use the same metods to create vaccines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with influence , we &apos;re always forward a year and with a dollar at least when it &apos;s about find the right vaccine .
I think what you can change change , and build vaccines in anticipate .
Here &apos;s how the future might start seeming change , now , the tree now , accounerating evolution with synthetic bacteria , and then we have a honey , and the eucariote .
We &apos;re so much like that from the impressed people .
Our scale is to make a very long enough to try to try to make it . Thank you very much .
I &apos;ll try to do it , the most quickly possible , some fundamental work , some fundamental job that we brought to Microsoft in the following in the following in the following . This is Seadon .
This is a environment that you can interact with a huge amount of visual data that remote with a enormous amount of visual data .
Here we &apos;re seeing multiplies gabyte with a kind of digital ses with a kind of switching , and I keep the images as we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big the amount of information that we see , how much big these colors of data or images .
Most of the digital photographs , but this is a scanning scanning from Bible Shyblioteel .
It doesn &apos;t do any difference because the only thing that limits the prestains of a system like this is the number of full the number of floor . It &apos;s also an architecture .
This is a whole book , you don &apos;t have a whole book .
This is the Casa desolate of Dickens . Every colonnurses a capital .
To show you that it &apos;s about heads and not images , we can do something like that , to see it &apos;s really a real thing , to see it &apos;s really a real representation of a real .
It might be a little bit a way artificial way to read a book for a book .
It doesn &apos;t have the judgly .
This is a more realistic example . This is a number of the Guardian .
Every big picture is the beginning of a seem .
And there really is a lot of drive and beautiful experience the pattern of a daily reversion of a daily drawings , which is for nature a lot of a median .
We also have something with the corner of this number in particular number of this particular number of this particular .
We have created a fasull resolutional solutic -- much more higher than that usual construction -- and we &apos;ve inserted you to have inserious extra extra .
If you want to see the characteristics of this authomobile , you can see here .
Or other model , or even though specific .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate limits of space on the screen .
We hope that this means to put the pop-up and other cheries , and other cheries , they wouldn &apos;t have to be more .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this not want to lose time , if not to say that we have contribute to date that .
These are all the streets in the U.S. Sovrapposes of NASA .
So now we go to the other thing else .
This is actually actually from the website ; you can go to it .
This is a project called Photosynth Photosynth , which is two different technologies .
One is Seady , and the other is a very interesting research on the computer very interesting computer takes from Noah Snavely , a student in the University of Micross Seadton , with the Steve Seadrtive of Microsoft Rick Seliski &apos;s Rick Seliski . It &apos;s optioned . It &apos;s open collaboration .
And it &apos;s from the view , I was a beautiful Seadon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can spend from an image of picture , and have this kind of experience to the multiply solution multiply .
But the space of images here has effective .
The signs of the computer , they recorded these imaging pictures together , so that you know , so that corresponds to the real place where the imaging imaging -- all the neighbors on the laghes Grasses , are scacting . So , there are been scape . Here you see , they were scaped . So , there are been scaped . Here you see the elements of a slide-de-de-stable .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some much more space .
I want to go to one of the Noahs of Noahs -- and this provide from a Photosynth Photosynth , we have done for the first time , to show you what we have done for the first time , to show you what I think is really the key , to be the key ey ey , and it &apos;s not so much much as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as the web .
We had to have to worry about legal and so on .
This is a rebuildings of Nothers Dothers Flickr . Bast Do &apos;s digitate Noththers . In Flickr , and you get images of types in magic , others , and so on . Or one of these arancies represents a picture that &apos;s discovery .
So , I &apos;ve got all been takr from Flickr and they all have been all colleagues in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to nursing way .
You know , I wouldn &apos;t have thought to end for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratiffy to receive this kind of account here .
I think you can see that this is a lot of different types of different types of focus , from those of cellphysical cellular ground . SLR , a number meaningful , put together in this environment .
And if I can take you , try to try to look for those more strange .
Many are blocked by faces , etc .
Somewhere you have a set of photographs -- etc .
This is a Nothers of Nothers recorded correctly .
We can go from the poster of this environment of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is taking data from the whole memories of how to apply the land , from the interface , from vision of vision -- and colleagues .
All those pictures become connected , most of the parts .
You have a ground model of the entire term .
Think about this as a prolgment of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as people use it , and the people use , and the people who are using it , and the people who use to use it .
Their pictures are married with metadician by other people .
If someone comes to one comes to contrast all these saying , my photographs , my picture of Nothers Deaves , I can use the several experience of all those data , and I can use as a point of ingrand inside of the spacectrum , in that metaphopefully , using the photography , and have a social experience of cross-moth-like chosen , and to have a social experience of a chososen and ches .
Of course , a consequence of all this is virtual model of all of the earth , and nursatellitarious company , not only only as a satellitarians and satellyfish .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What &apos;s your software , what your software us to do is that at a certain point in the next years , all the photographs from everybody in the world will be practically connect together ?
BA : Yeah . That &apos;s what he &apos;s doing is to find .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , you want to get , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the basic pictures .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about recise information recky information that many of these images .
As when you have a research of images on the web , and the heb on the web , has a lot of information about the picture .
Now , what happens if that picture is connected to all your pictures ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of the amount of recchezing that it is really enormous . It &apos;s a classical effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible .
BA : You &apos;re very very much .
One of the main pleases when you travel and one of the research , and the powerful power between who didn &apos;t forward the way , the way , the traditions , and the past in the wind , and the wind is in the rainside of the rains , and he &apos;s gets the rains , and he &apos;s gone in the leaving of the plant .
Basti think Jaguar Jaguar , still still beyond the Via Lattea , or that &apos;s Milites are still connected to meaning , or that in Himalaya , the budget the respiece of Dharm , to remember the importance of Dharm , to remember the importance of anthral anthral , and that the idea that we live not in sense of the world that we live not in sense of the world that we live not in sense of the way , but it &apos;s actually not just a model , but it &apos;s just a true ,
the consequence of a particular choices that our stirs has done , well , well or mal , many generations ago .
And of course , we all share about essential .
All we all nax . We all procreating .
We &apos;re subjects at the beginning of initiation .
We need to death the inexorability of death , so it doesn &apos;t take us if we go and ballie --
We all have a art .
What colpisce is the particular ryritm of cancer , the rhythm of every culture .
Not matter that are the Nort Do &apos;s forests , or the following of Haiti , or the Wooks of Haiti , or the World Wight-sept-septonal field , the Ande of the Sahara .
He was my journey in the desert a month ago , or a month ago , or a hyak of yak in the values of the Everest , dea mother of the world .
All these people teaching us that there are other ways of exists to be other ways of thinking , others of move in the world .
And , if you reflected a active , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
And with the cultures of cultures in the world creating a spiritual life and cultural life that has been taken the planet and is important for the planet as a biological biological hysics as a biosphere .
And you can think about this biological girl as a nosphere , and you can call the ethnosphere , and you can call the ethnosphere , uns , inspirations , inspirations , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , and you can see it from the conscience .
The ethnosphere is the fantastic patrimonium of human .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how much inquisitive .
And because biosphere was graved by by the ethnosphere is happened to the ethnosphere and too much much more quidly .
Nobody , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species was on the extinction of all species was , or on the extinction , or the more opypothesis -- in the most opeyed in the field of biological diversity -- and you don &apos;t have neipowered as much as much as a little bit of cultural cultural diversity .
The injection of all this is , of course , the lost linguistic .
When you were born there 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not only a voymen by a vocabolar or a series of grammaticals .
One language is the spray of human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle with which animum of every culture in the material world .
Every language is a forest , a bine , a thought , a thought , a thought , a thought , etosystem of spiritual possibility .
And those 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re seeding here to Monterey , at least half the house is not sushed in the orecchies of children .
They don &apos;t come to be teached . The one that wants to say , less you watch something , which are already .
What &apos;s more trists of being taken from the slaughter , to be the last to talk a language , not have a way to be the wisdom of the wnership of the bunch of the children ?
This is a physical state of somebody in some part of the world , every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks and brings with it in the tomba .
And I know somebody who will say , &quot; Isn &apos;t that ?
The world would not be a better place if we talk all the same language ? &quot; We talk all talk about yoruba . We talk all talk all the yoruba . We talk all talk about cancer .
Let &apos;s talk about kogi .
You &apos;ll find a tract thing you can &apos;t talk about their language .
I &apos;d like to do a journey through the ethnosphere --
a little journey in the ethnosphere to give you a little journey of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us mental depend that when I say , &quot; different ways of exists , &quot; I really mean , &quot; I really mean , &quot; I really mean ,
We take for example this bimbo Barasana , in Amazon , the population of anacony , which creates the middle of the full further in the latest sacred of sacred sacred .
It &apos;s a population that &apos;s not able to distinguished the blue color from the green color because the cell of the forest , where it &apos;s income .
They have a language language and a quick rule , devices , &quot; exactly language , &quot; You have to move a person who talks about a person who talks about a different language .
All this has been radical past , yet the particularity is that in these families that are talking about six or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven or languages .
They limited to listen and then start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived , the Waoran of Ecuador of Ecuador , an incredible population , an incredible population that had the first contact in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionary , they &apos;ve got a committ-contact .
They did come from the photographs that retraditional , which they retraditional , forest that this population of pluvial forest pluvial forest had never seen anything in the white .
They collect the picture , they have a bunch or a shape or a shape or a shape , they don &apos;t have any concluses that they were the digure that they were the die , and they kill the five missionary .
But Waoran don &apos;t just killed the straniesters .
They kill on their own .
54 percent of mortality was caused by their own .
We &apos;re slowed to eight generations and we found two of natural death and when we insisted to know , they have admted that one of them was invecting that one of them was invecting it , and then they kill it . They had a very much known known of knowledge .
The hundred of degree , and we can recognize the animal from 40 steps and recognizes .
In the early 1980 , I was assigned a very interesting compiece when my professor of Harvard professor was assigned to be in Haiti to intrue between the society of Dualier and Tonton Maces , and I was just asked to do zome .
To give a sense of myracy , I should have to understand the Vodoun culture Vodouble and Voodoo is not magic .
It &apos;s pretty much more of a metaphysics of the world .
Many interesting interesting .
If I asked you to tell me great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Budsm , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has no religious feels . And instead , and instead of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious religious religious .
What it makes interesting is the report is the report between life and death .
So , the view are going to be non-up .
The spirites can be invocated by Great Acqua , answer the back of the dance and replace to the soul of the view in a way that for a short of the view in a very short way that for a short .
So , for this voodooists saying , &quot; You go to talk about God .
We give you a dance in temple and becomes God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re posting to you , is the spirit that guide you , how can you do you do that .
So you have to these incredible events : following voodoo in the state of trance , which touch a little bit of infuels .
I was all the people with which I lived the most extraordinary , the most extraordinary Kogi Sierra Nevada in the Colombia , in Colombia .
So , it &apos;s going to make tyrange of civilization , who live on the carby planets of Colombia , the population of the conquist , the population of the crazy vulate planture .
In a continent of blood , this population was never conquered by the spagners .
In fact , I &apos;m government , but their formation is really very strakes .
The young people following away from the families to three or four years , and they live in a bunch of good and bombers in a bombers in the basic broken to the basic for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years choices to proposed the nine months of gestation that transcorrate in the uter of the mother , now are metaphor in the Great Mther .
For all this time , they &apos;re acculated to their society , values that their predicts that their predicts and only their preger and only their pregent balance -- or for better than the cosmic balance .
At the term of this incredible initiation , they &apos;re improvised out and for the first time in their life , at the age of 18 years , you see a high . And in that actional consciousness , when the suncle band , all the values of beautiful landscaped in the tea bunch of his balance . The prey prise is a passionate . The prec pass a past and says : : a past back and says : a past a past back and says :
&quot; I &apos;m going to be like I said .
It &apos;s stuguy . Now it &apos;s at you protect it . &quot;
It &apos;s called the most of them , and say that we , frree them , we are the pevolution of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about Indigene and environment we invoil Rau and the old story of the old story , which is a razy concept , which is a razy concept Thoreeau , and we say that these are close to the Earth are close to the Earth of us .
The diges are not not not not sentimal sentimal sentimental .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the paludium in the wind vents in the wind vents of the Tibet , but thanks to the time and realized a mystic Earth doesn &apos;t have a mystic intuition of the most of the esserent of the most ununtile : the concept that the Earth can only because it &apos;s infected from consciousness .
What does it mean ?
He mean , a little bit of a little bit of the Ande who grows up with the mountain is a spirit . And that &apos;s going to be a depth of a lot of different human being a very different human . And it will be a full further than a ki-different places of the mountain a Montana that grow up a mountain in a mountain in a mountain .
which is the dimall of a spirit or a mineral cycle is irrievant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia credancy that forests serve to be cut .
And what I realized me a different human being different from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that forests are the dimmonths of Hukuk and the downtown , and the downtown that live in the north of the world , explrites that live in the north of the world , explained Hamatsa .
If you start consider that these cultures can actually actually create different reality , you can start to understand some of them , you can start some of them .
I took this picture to open in the Western Amazon Amazon .
Mayahuash , some of the Mahuash , the most powerful suspsychoactive of the repertorium .
What it makes it fascinating the ayahuask is not the potential drug of sustance , but his elaboration . It &apos;s composed by two elements .
She &apos;s a side , this lian lian lian ar-carboline series , harmed harmful , harmful , harmed , and read slightly .
Phinking the sun , you have a bluaxer that altera little bit of the consciousness , but it &apos;s mysceled with the leaves of a house of the family of the caffected .
This plants power mainly triptamines , very similar to serotonin , dimethoxylthoxylthoyltryltryptamines .
If you ever see the Yanomami to the suscity that make from a different set species , which is a different species , which is methoyltryltryltryltryltryltryltrylech .
Tiring that pollution is a little bit like to be a little bit like to be spared by a fucile of pines and bacterial dian on a ming of electricity . Restern &apos;t creates a distortion of reality .
I had spent to often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , man who wrote the psychedelic , with his discovery , with his discovery of the fungi in the 1930 in Mexico .
And the tese tese can &apos;t classify these triptamines like , because if you &apos;re not going to tell anybody . And you can &apos;t tell anybody to be sleep .
It &apos;s possible to assume , if you under unset with other chemicals that denatural ses that denatural people that denaturing the MAO .
Now , it &apos;s the beautiful : the carbon behinibitors are injected in this lian unclean to be the same kind of need to be the triptames . The spontaneous question : in 80,000 species of plant , like these are are not several , like these are , like these are , but that &apos;s not spent , but if you do these are not slaughter , but that &apos;s a tricky that &apos;s terrial chemical tricals .
We use the great eufemism of the herror , which can revealing infrured .
But if we ask to the Indian , they &apos;ll say , &quot; Purn about it . &quot;
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuask , which distinguished in the forest , and that our eyes would be in the same species .
If we ask them how do do stabilises , they &apos;re going to tell us , &quot; I thought I was going to tell you , &quot; I wouldn &apos;t be able to do it . &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you get 17 variety in a night of a ller and each one will care with a different tone .
And that &apos;s not laurea to Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than contact .
Now , &#91; ophistory , the problem is that also the problem of us that have the people who have the people who have the history , but somehow reduces are putting out of the history of the world , and pass .
In fact , the 19th century , 300 years , it will not be reminded for his wars or sues of technological innovations , but rather as the way we stop and active activity , but rather than we stopped and active , active , it &apos;s not the masses of diversity and cultural cultural . Now the problem isn &apos;t changed .
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibility .
And the problem isn &apos;t technology .
The Indian Sioux , they don &apos;t have to be Six when they put it up and fully as American as as American have no stuck to be American when they put out of horse and head .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that mines are mining the nosphere . It &apos;s the power . It &apos;s power .
The wall of the domination .
And if you give you a look at the world , you &apos;ll find that these are not destinate cultures .
They are creatures and dynamics spines out of identifiable forces that go out of identifiable adaptation .
And what it is disboss in the patria of the Than --
a population of Sarawak , in the south care , a population that has lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to a generation ago , and now reduced to the ress of the human field , where you can see the physical physquinated by the squinter , where the naves the named Merian Cinese Pargugued the naves , where the Navorances the Navorances the Naves , where the Nareas ,
I repull the stive with the stive to the forest .
Or , in case of Yanomami , are the disease that are come with the discovery of those who are .
If we move on the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the wall of the politics .
You know , you know , the physics of a population , is a populated level , but the ethnight , but the ethnight , the distriction of life , not only is not only not only condanced , but it &apos;s not only not only condanced , because it &apos;s makes part of the development .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering Tibet .
I &apos;ve lost 6,000 miles from Chinengager in China in Western China in Western Chinengines , coming to Lhasa with a young colleagues , but only realized what &apos;s behind .
6,000 mounds sacrates in poles and cens .
1.2 million people killed from the military Rvolution .
The drop of this guy was absolutely to the Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed to the time of Chinese invasion .
And I was a guy with Sanity in Santity during the diaspora that has taken the population in Nepal .
She was imprised and his color was to be recicivil .
It was taken to hidden in career to the age of two years , and he was nursing under his gonna because he couldn &apos;t have living without him .
The sister , which has done the same , it was messed in the field .
A day has been indeed with a raffurant faser Mao and , for this transgression , and for this transgression , was messed to the seven years .
The Tibet of the Tibet can be insoptaable , but the spirit of the population is from tener .
At the end , all of it , all reduces .
We want to live in the world world world world world &apos;s a mocromatical world or we want to collect the policycical world of different different diversity ?
The great anthropologa Margaret Mead , before we die said that his bigger was that , in our own living vision of the world , we &apos;ll not only see the whole whole of human imagination . We &apos;ll just just see the whole ama day , but a day , a day , but a day , a day we &apos;re going to see it as well as well as well as there was other possibilities .
And it &apos;s uilant to remember that our species is existed for 60,000 years .
The Neolitic Rivolution , which has given us the agriculture , which has done us to the cult of the sees of the sees , replace the poem of the swering , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The industrialized world has been 300 years .
That squeen history is not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we should be in the millennia to come .
When these myriades of the world is asked what it is to say to be human , resonate with 10,000 different voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we &apos;ll all find the possibility to be what we &apos;re : a consciousness , which has to do that all the people and all the people and all the people can fall . And there are great moments . And there are great moments .
I took this picture on the north of Baffin , when I went to the North Baffin , when I went to the balene with Inuit , and this man , and this man , and this man , and this man , he told me the wonderful story of his non-non-history .
The government has not been tyle with the Inuit and in the 1950s to stabilic our supremistakes .
The non-man was refed to go .
The family , I &apos;m going to bring up all the arms , and all of his own own tune .
You have to know that Inuit doesn &apos;t tempted the cold , they don &apos;t .
The bathers in origins were made of fish basic skin fish skin fishing papes .
The non-hand-wouldn &apos;t have to say from artic night , or from the blizard , or the blizy-suffior .
It &apos;s gattached out , it &apos;s heated the balance in the skin of foca and defecated in their hand . When I did her work . When I did the fecks are conged , he &apos;s working on a lama .
He was spruzed on the pointer of this cluster , and when it was solid , he killed a dog .
He schools schools created a bria , with the high casses , he made a sliter , he imbridge another cane , and it &apos;s shared on the bancha , clean in rest .
We want to talk about cavar with nothing ?
In 1999 , the 1999 , the government reduced by the Inuit &apos;s total controls of a larger territory of California and Texas a myself .
It &apos;s their new patria . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a territory territory . They constraints all the resources .
One of the splendido example of how a national state can recognize with his population .
And , finish , I think it &apos;s rather obvious to the less of us who was in these slands of the planet , make it doesn &apos;t have any remote .
For somebody &apos;s house .
They represented by the human imagination that risalks are risalba on the top of the days . And for us all these children , as the dreams of these children , as our children , become part of the geography .
For finally , we are not going to be convints that politicians never arrive to anything .
We believe that polemy --
&#91; Applauses are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and perhaps we &apos;re the best institution to tell stories about the world . Every month our site , and we &apos;re going to have to tell the stories .
156 countries , we transmitted our canal televisive .
Our ressts are slets from millions of people .
Our work is travel to bring our public audience in the eyes of wonderful cultural places , and they &apos;ll get out of what they saw and hopes , and hope , they &apos;ll get a full of anthropology . The markital world of exists , and we need to find a style in a world , and we need to find a style in a world , and we need to find a world of life in a world , and multicultural lives from from .
where the gezens of all populations can contribute to our collective well-being collective .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope reverse called other people you &apos;ve heard and I &apos;ll try to avoid some colleages , in case , in case not notice .
I want to start with what I call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The official dogma . &quot;
The dogm official dogm of what ?
The dogm official nurses of all society industrial society . The dogma official official is , &quot; If we want to male the well-being of our citizens . &quot;
The reason is , from a side , in the fact that freedom is in the fact that freedom is precious , useful , useful , useur for humans .
Another is in fact that if we &apos;re libers , each of us can agency for it to do everything that massive our benefit , no one that decide in name .
The way to male is to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the choice .
More choices people have , the more libers , and most of their liberty , the greatest is their liberty , the greatest .
This is so deeply radicated in the society that nobody would dream , and nobody would have dreamed it in the society .
And it &apos;s also deeply radicated in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I hope a simple note on the injury for injuggle .
In my supermarket , there are 175 condents , without contextreme 10 variety of oil , and the 12 acetes that you can buy a number of condition that you can buy a huge circumstance in including rescious conditions that nobody &apos;s 175 proned is to your degree .
Here &apos;s the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic to buy a stereo : case , CD , radio , radio , radio , radio , radio , radio , radio ,
And in this single negotial negotial , there &apos;s a great number of audio .
We can make six million different combinations of different combinations that there are in a store components that there are only a negotial .
You have to admit that there is a very much choice .
Although the fields : the world of the communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all the phone , they could get all the phone of the basic services , and bat that they were fornes from Bell .
He was born the phone , it didn &apos;t buy it .
One of this , one consequence of this , was that the phone had never been .
These themes are gone .
Now , we have a variety of phones , especially between cellular phones .
Here &apos;s cellphones of the future .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , MP3 , cut , and forces for the eye , and forces for the eye .
If you don &apos;t have seen it in the store under the house , you &apos;re going to get to come to get it .
And what &apos;s finally happened is that people are in the watch and does this question . And you know what is the answer ? The answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell that doesn &apos;t do too much things .
So , in other expect of life that are much more important than the busts , you greion , and that &apos;s the same explosion .
Assistence : Salth care not going on the United States that you go to the doctor and doctor what you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor says , &quot; OK , we can do it , or we can do it , or we can do it , &quot; As these benefits . &quot; As these benefits . &quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Dr. &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A has these benefits , and these well-hythrow . &quot;
&quot; You want to do ? &quot;
And you rebats : &quot; Dr. &quot; And you know , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor : &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result we call it &quot; the &quot; authonomy of malate , &quot; expression that makes it look a beautiful thing .
But actually it &apos;s not a lot of fish and responsibility to take a decisions from somebody who knows something , which is the doctor , whatever you know , and so it &apos;s not a -- and so in the ideal condition to take decisions that &apos;s true for patient patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing products , and you know , as you know , and that if you think there &apos;s no sense , and that if you think there &apos;s no sense , that we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why do it ?
The answer is that they want to say , we call the doctor to ask them to change .
Something like this is our identity as our identity is an identity , as you see in this junk . &quot; We don &apos;t want to force the children . Scear their seven-herself . &quot; We don &apos;t hert t t . &quot; We don &apos;t have to inventing .
And we can reinvented us a lot of times .
which means that every morning , you have to decide that guy , you have to be .
I pect to the family and mathemselves , a time , a time time , until the slaughter , almost anyone , it was that there was a most of possible , and it started to make the most of possible .
The only choice was with who , not even when , and not even when , and not even what to do after .
Ogyday , all is really to play .
I teach in a very smart students , and I think about their 20 percent in less than a time .
And it &apos;s not not because they &apos;re not not not because they &apos;re not not not because they are less diligences .
but why I &apos;m impensierites , I mean , &quot; I should be able to do it now ? I should do it now ? &quot;
&quot; I should move me more targument ? I have to think about children or career ? &quot;
They are logorant .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this implement is not completely the competitors that you don &apos;t get a bel voted to my exame .
And they have to do it . They have to do it .
Now , the job : we &apos;re fortunate as Carl Sottoleen , because the technology allows us to work every day , every day , every day , every day , every day , and on the planet , and on the Hotel Randolph .
I &apos;m talking about , there &apos;s a angolin , and I &apos;m not going to not say anybody , where , where , where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use it .
What means , this incredible freedom of choice that we have to do that , we have to continuously on every moment , if we need to work or not .
We can go to the slaughter , with the cellphone in a task , Blackberry in the other , and the night , and the night , and the night , on the ginockyyia .
And even though they &apos;re all spended , every minute that we see our son , we &apos;re also saying , &quot; I &apos;m going to answer this called ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? I have to go this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is not , &quot; all this is not , &quot; all this experience of your son , very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , from any of any of the little bit , little big materials and great materials and stili stili , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : Once , there were some possibilities , but it wasn &apos;t a question of choice .
The world today looks like this : The dilemma is : &quot; That &apos;s a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Short .
So , we have a positive labor . So I &apos;m going to talk about that .
All this choice , two effects negative effects on people .
The first , paradoxide is that produces instead of liberation .
And many of a lot of options , becomes very difficult to do it .
I offer an example meaning : one study conduct study conduct .
A colleagues had access to the data of Vantue , the giant society of the fundamental climents in 2,000 companies in 2,000 companies .
What she found out she &apos;s been going to be that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , percentage of adesion drawings .
For 50 sources , there &apos;s 10 percent of offered adesions , when they &apos;re available only five . Why ?
Because with 50 source between those of which choice , is dieclose to decide , and the choice is remanded to the indomority .
And at the domorges , domorange , domorange , domorous , and of course , it never arrive .
You know , you don &apos;t have to be able to be workers from food because they don &apos;t have enough money because they don &apos;t have enough money , even say that decision is so obstic that decision is so obstic that they also have a trained dator of work .
Not teaching , they &apos;re losing to five dollars a year from the dator of work , which would be willing to be it .
So the paralysis a consequence of the scowned .
And I think that &apos;s going to make it .
&quot; And finish , for the eternity : ketchup , feelape or maionese ? &quot;
You &apos;d like to take the right decision , if it &apos;s for ethernity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and nepurpure the wrong .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even though we can avoid paralises and do a choice , we finally have less satisfaced from the result of how we would have been with less options .
And that is a different reasons .
One of these is that with many of these is that , if you buy , if you buy a and it &apos;s not perfect , and it &apos;s not perfect , and it &apos;s not to imagine that you could make a different choice that you could make a different choice . And that &apos;s what happened is that alternative imagined . And that happened is that the sofull remains the spectation , and the slide , and the soon from the decision , and it &apos;s not remainly the soon the decision ,
even when it was a very good decision .
More choices are , more easier to displeasy of whatever details that it is insoftware .
And also , there &apos;s what economists called costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert aslear very well as the value we think about things that we &apos;re depending with things that we confrontiers .
And in rest , when there are many options , it &apos;s easy to represent the career cares of the alternative patterns that you have to be less ssoon .
Here &apos;s an example . I wrote with all those who are not New York .
But that &apos;s what you &apos;d probably think .
There &apos;s this coppia .
A place of lussize .
Spillled . Ottttttype . It &apos;s all for them .
Nothing . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , maledition , is Agost . &quot;
&quot; All my neighbor . &quot;
&quot; I could talk about the front of home . &quot;
And the past two weeks , the idea that &apos;s lost of dying -- every day -- every day -- every day -- every day -- every day --
The costo-opportunities is the soddduces for what we have , even when choice was ector .
And the most are the options that we have to consider , the more of the characteristics of the cos-opportunities .
Here &apos;s another example .
This jects us sets a lot of things .
We talk about the living time , and perhaps a living lently .
But the most important point is that any thing you choices , you &apos;re going to choices , you &apos;re not to do .
The things that we don &apos;t choose have a tactivity that can make less attractive .
Tirst point : spiral growth of expectations .
I tried it on my skin comprising a new jeans .
I &apos;m almost always like .
Once the jeans were a kind of beside , and they wondered them , they were several , only after they were several , only after they were a lot of them , beginning to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple of them , when those old old old them , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
The committed me , &quot; You know , &quot; Who wants to fit , relaxy and fit ? &quot;
He wants with the cerniera or with the Stonewashhed ? &quot;
&quot; You want you to have streets ? &quot;
&quot; Sight the bla or stretch ? Bla bla bla -- &quot; Continuate to elency .
I was balordit , and after a little bit , I had to say , &quot; I want the kind of -- which was the one of the guy , so for a little bit of what was , so for a little bit of the diejeans , then use me from the negotional states , then I &apos;m going to be .
It was the very big . I got the best . I got the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a book for the book .
The reason I was worse with all that I was worse with all that choice , the jeans had to be perfect , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was not expectations . I wasn &apos;t expected me . I wasn &apos;t expected me , but when there was a kind of 100 different , I &apos;d be huge .
What I had buy was good , but not perfect .
After I was talking to that choose with what I was insoon in the expectations .
The advanced of the people don &apos;t do that increase the expectations that these have respect to the ector of options .
And this producing less satisfation , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the marketing world , if I realized .
Because if they knew it , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more to this .
&quot; He was better when it was worse , &quot; The reason that I was worse when you were worse when you were worse , it &apos;s been worse , and it &apos;s been possible to meet the surprised of the prises .
Ogyday , in the world that we live -- opulents , industrialized citizens with the perfection -- the massive that we can hope is that the things are about the high-the-like .
You never have surprised pieces of your expectations , my expectations , you &apos;re ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; You &apos;re expectations . &quot;
I mean -- little authophical moment authophic -- which is really moved and my wife is really stupend .
I wouldn &apos;t have to do better , I didn &apos;t have acted .
But it &apos;s not always a good thing .
Finally , a consequence of buy a couple of jeans is when there &apos;s only that when there &apos;s only that when there &apos;s only that when there &apos;s just a jeans , and you ask &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot;
The world is the responsible . What could I do you do you do you ?
When there are hundreds of types , and you buy a insod-like insod-you who is responsible , and you ask you who is responsible , is otherwise you .
You &apos;d have to do better .
With hundreds of variety , there are no scaren &apos;t there for the insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even though the result is valid , they feel unconversation and they give the color to them .
In the last years , the last years is exploss in the industrialized world .
I think a meaning meaning -- not the only one , but important -- this is not the only one of this depression is that people have experiences of depression is too high .
And when they need to explain this situation think that colpan is their own .
So the final result is that we &apos;re better better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogm , what we all take for good and it is completely false . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit better that , but it &apos;s better than it didn &apos;t have it . But it doesn &apos;t make it a lot of choice is better than a little bit .
There &apos;s a critical value , I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m pretty sure we have surface by a piece of the level where the choices our life .
Now , from political point -- I &apos;ve almost finished -- I almost finished by political point , the following .
What allows all this choice in the society is the material recky of material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you &apos;re going to know , where the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is they have too little little little bit .
So the facility I &apos;m talking about is a malesclusive to be a diesclusive society .
And what it does to do is this : Steve Levitt &apos;s this Steve : the Steve talked about how much cost-satching seats and scomfortable seats for the money . It &apos;s a spread of money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and dispendious , it &apos;s not just that they &apos;re just unuseful .
They &apos;re going to have addicting .
They do it worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows a little bit of choice was revered in those where people have too much much possibility , it would not be a few possibilities , but also our life .
This is what economists call a parethrow .
A redistribution of the reduction is well , not only the poorest -- because of this choice -- because of this choice that turns us .
To conclude : &quot; For you can become all of what you want &quot; --
You can , people of culture , you &apos;ll think , &quot; What does you believe that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t make anything in a glass . &quot;
&quot; A casued unclean image of the world --
and I &apos;ve been interpretation , at the beginning .
But then , I realized , instead , I realized that that fish the long-s-.
Because the reality of the reality is that if you eat in the way that &quot; everything is possible . &quot; You don &apos;t get your freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you take the broke in a way that all divents possible diminiits sodisfation .
You get the paralysis , and you reduced the well-being .
All they need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too street , perhaps even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the axis of some symbolic symbolic symbolic for the round .
