The year I shows these slide slide to show that the calculate that the calculate glacial size , for three million years , and it &apos;s lacross the 48 continents , it &apos;s recording .
Turch this sliterally , because of the problem because of the floor of the floor .
The calculate glacial is , in a sense , in a sense , the cuor of the global climate system .
You get up and you get up and you ritive .
The next slide will be a record is a career of the last 25 years .
The draft is hope in the rosray .
As you see , you know , you know , you know .
That &apos;s the gap in the inside , which is the run .
You can see that the cost said , the full of five years or , is like the sances , is like the sang .
In 25 years , it &apos;s just like , so .
This is a problem because the scale of the interested in the ocean , where there are huge to the ocean where there are huge amount of carbon , and they &apos;re going to stop , they &apos;re going to stop , they &apos;re going to put in the middle .
And the purality of the inquent inquences of the global atmosical record , that could be a global , that could be radical , surprising this point of not .
In some blood blows , in some deep of Alaska , and it &apos;s already already ,
The professorders Katey Walter Walter the University is , and it &apos;s received with a team .
Video : Wow ! And Gore : Lew is good . The question is if we will be .
A reason is that this scale scale scale from the Groenland from the Groenland .
This is a figlacial fic figlacial .
And he had never reached to living them similar .
This is the figured Kangerlusual , in the west of Groenland .
If you want to know how to do you know how to do you want to stop the food of the food , here is where you can go to the mate .
These are aumenting are aumenting .
In the other part of the planet : Antartist , the largest blob of the planet .
The month scientists have diart of the scientists have diart of the balance is in the negative , and that Anttype of the negative , which is a few hydrogen , it &apos;s particular ararly , it &apos;s particular ararly .
Equires of the field of the field , like Groom .
Sull Himalaya , the biggest block of blob , you see new new laghes , you see new lages , which is a few years ago .
40 percent of the population of the population was going to be able to the floor .
Sulle Ands : this little gaaaaaaaaaaaaims of this city .
The brought is aumented .
But when you diminuge , the same access to water .
In California , the nine on Sierra Nevada is diminute .
The bins are in the cribes .
The previsions , as you have gravoring ,
The growth care in the world is a notice of the inside of the including .
The wasasters are aumenting in a run out of the normal and without preceders .
For four than four than the next 30 years , I &apos;ve got to preceding 75 .
This is a wondering of the intenable .
If you look at the context stories if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we &apos;ve added to 70 million tone-hours -- 24 hours -- 25 million tone-hours in the ocean every day .
Look at the area of the area of the Pacific , the American , in American , and on the American , and on the midle of the sub-continent , where there &apos;s a very hosysit of the ocean .
Most because of the global scale , together , together to deforest , which is 20 percent , is the 20 percent , is the useful of the combustible .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even even even even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with the Cina .
And he was concerned in the carbon .
But we &apos;re assisting a change .
These are the projects in the last years , and some of the last years , and some of the alternative vers .
Anyway , there &apos;s a politician in our country .
The crazy of carbon and the oil of oil , 250 million dollars in the last year for prometimes , which is a simple simple .
That imagine me imagine me to something --
I know Natest Natal , where I live , where I live , there was a perdence of 3.8 billion chories of crazy .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen the news .
This is the second biggest food .
It &apos;s happened to Natal .
The public community of one of the industries of carbon .
Video : Foday , ♫ ♫ Fot the bonasic kind of game .
It &apos;s food here in America , and it &apos;s growing our economy .
Fross the carbon is always more .
It &apos;s good , the price , and the worth , and the work ,
Al Gore : Da lot of carbon on the West Virginia .
The biggest society on the mountain is Massey Coal . This is his friends .
Video : With Blankage : I &apos;m going to do -- I &apos;m going to do -- Al Gore , Harry Reid , Harry Reid -- not will talk about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Prootetion of Clim , and he was a two pay .
This is a part of the way .
Video : Ator : Ator : Ator : Ator we see the climate change as a serious minute to our own own own own .
For this is our priority is invest a great amount of money in a hority of money to make public full the hydrogen and confurther .
In fact , the carbon is not .
We think it &apos;s just a good good book -- it &apos;s also a good profound .
So , so that &apos;s not predict of climate change .
Let me do to do .
Video : Ator : You have to hear about .
So , I do a game in a street in a street in a street .
It &apos;s a traditional machines !
We would consuch of carbon is between the main the main the global climate technology , but the notions of carbon that you see it .
Do an an ask : this is the odieral technology of carbon .
Al Gore : Indied , the alternative positive to the economic and the economic and the hurt of national economic sure .
Video : My : My , America is in the cribes ; the sure , the sure of national climate climate climate climate .
The philils that the college of all , our dipendence , as the blood blows , like the carbon and the oil and the oil .
Now , there &apos;s a new new new , audace , audace for use .
Rear America : 100 percent of pull .
A pian to read America , to make the work , and make a lot more sure , and help the global record .
Finally , one solution that basts to solve our problems .
Rear America . Somprise .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : My : You &apos;re going to redry energy in America .
One of the fast of the fast dependence of the dependence of the bustible , which is our planet .
The future is here . I &apos;m going to do , and you &apos;ll see it , a new energy .
You know , two : Noves : Not invest for posts .
My : My . It &apos;s time to be a lot of money .
Al Gore : A various prproveroverbio , if you want to go to slow , you go to the money .
If you want to go , you go , you go back . &quot;
We have to go to the fast ,
Thank you very much .
The year of TED full fected in the LHC .
And I &apos;m going to get back to the nareas .
So , I compared . And for those who &apos;s another time , there was no , LHC is the large experiment -- 27 kills ever ever -- 27 kills .
His a compit of redirections that were less than a billion a billion a billion second , from the beginning of the universe -- until to 600 million times .
All of what &apos;s just environment .
This is the best burchine .
First these mini-Big Big Big Big ,
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATATAS -- it &apos;s a 44 feet and has a diamazing of 22 feet .
This is a picture of ATATAATAS in built so you can notion .
The 10 septest of the scoral will be access to the first time .
And this picture was scape by ATAATAS .
It was because of immentioned in the festerms of control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first phasy of particles that he had all the game of LHC , and central , with a part of the LHC , and hard , with a part of the HC , and hard .
In other words , when we see that image , we can see the 10 challenges , we can do that , the machine words , which is a great vitting .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to make a more oppure of the biggest , when someone was going to go to Google and vide that the page was this .
And that means we had a cultural cultural cultural ,
And I &apos;m a week after , there was a problem with the car , I had to have to these phils here -- these phils here -- these phils .
These phils 13,000 amping when the machine works in the myself .
Now , the technical nicians will look , and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . They &apos;re not not not true . &quot;
And they can do it because when they &apos;re very squickly , they &apos;re very six ,
So , less 271 degree , in a perature between the standing of the space between the sters , these philoms can bring that corrent .
In one of the young novemial novemial , there was a difabulation of fabulation .
So , the phils are going to read , and the 13,000 , and the 13,000 met , and 10,000 .
This was the result .
Now , this is still more than 20 feet if you think of these magnetwork , and the magic neighborhood , and that are saying about 30 days .
They are danneged about 50 magnetwork .
We had to clear , what we &apos;ve done .
We have repristinted and travel .
And they &apos;re going to be run all the place .
Enggggglater , the LHC is going to be new .
We &apos;ll be , and we &apos;ll wake , and we &apos;ll have to get to the juggame , and continuing so our available to find what our available to find the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these way , these , these reactive , these reactive , and the value of science and engineering of science and the confuture . It &apos;s what it &apos;s doing .
I think the fact that &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s done , I think that &apos;s the value of things like LHC .
I &apos;d like to say with a full of scientists , Humphrey , Humphotography , which is , I imagine , and the image of the floor of the floor , his bleael Michael Farch , he said , &quot; Nichael Michael Farly , and the way of the way to be as a floor of the way to be , and the way of the floor , and the floor of our mind of our own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own .
Thank you .
I want to start to ask the hydrogen , from children , from children , and you get clear .
While you &apos;re able to reach them and food , to make them , and they &apos;re going to be able and moving , and you learn , and you can think and realizing .
The reasoning space is deeply connected to the way we understand grain , in which we &apos;re going to do .
So , by information , I &apos;ve got to use the full of our interaction with physics , together , and I started to have a collaborator , and I started to ask Jevan Kalanian Kalanian , when we &apos;re going to have a computer , when we &apos;re just going to have a hours as a wake , and we can have a directly bad , and I could be able to die with the savel , and I &apos;ll be a fashigh-----------------aaachieve ,
and our systems ?
The question was so interesting question that we decided to explore the answer , build the Siftable .
In a few words , a great computer , a great computer .
In a few words , a great computer , a great computer .
You can move with the hand , they can see &quot; see , &quot; between their movement , &quot; between their movement and have a scerm and have a screen and a running .
But , I &apos;m physicist , as the morning , like the morning , you can move set simply free .
The Siftable for example of a new ecosystem of a struments for hypet for hypet .
And they have more physicist , connected , connected , of the other , and they move , and they move more than the other , consciously , connected , as we can explore them , as we can explore ore explore the other things .
I &apos;m going to start with some simple example .
This is configurated for showed to show the video : if you have the video : if you go back to a direction , and if you cline , if you cline , you can go back .
These are interactive in the other other .
If you &apos;re interested in the way , it &apos;s their inside .
If you have the data , and you can see a little bit .
If you have the data , and you can see a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We &apos;ve got the connection that one of the interaction was the entire of interaction was the degree of the data , for example , &quot; a color as if it was a liquires .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurated as of the century of the color in the central central central , where they are high .
And I can use them for the central central central , where they are .
If you know , if you can see a little bit , we can put a little bit .
I &apos;m also beautiful possibility of appeared , as the logic logic and games of logic logic , where people can try to try to try and see the things , and see the way to see the myself .
Now , I &apos;m --
This is a sequence of Fibonacy that I do with a program of the equations of the equations .
Here we have a game of words that &apos;s going on between Sabables and Boble .
First , you know , every one literally , in the case of every Siftable , Pratically , every single , every clear in every case on every case on every Siftable , and as I &apos;m going to do a control .
And then , after about 30 seconds of 30 seconds , and you have a new set of lecame and feet and feel possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the children of the children &apos;s gone in the Media Lab , I did in fact that I tried a video .
They &apos;re very clear .
And one of the interesting things of this geneeeties is that you don &apos;t have to give people many of a lot of education .
Devi just , &quot; The blood &quot; &quot; The words , and they will exactly what I do .
Here &apos;s some people who try .
This is our best test young , there &apos;s the right .
In fact , it just just further .
They were only the morning .
Now , this is an application of a carton .
We wanted to build a brown for the best of the Lui Lui &apos;s Felix .
It can imagine new personal agges in the scenes in the scenes , and I &apos;m going to get their associated .
It can imagine new personal agges in the scenes in the scenes , and I &apos;m going to get their associated .
Here &apos;s doing the solute .
Video : The solute is .
David Merrile : Now , he &apos;s taking a tractor in the scale .
Video : The tractor .
In the work !
So , school , and put them up and put them to close to to make any high ,
Video : Bau !
inventing their history .
Video : Do !
DM : It &apos;s a history with the final history , and it can decided to say .
DM : It &apos;s a history with the final history , and it can decided to say .
Video : Video : Game .
DM : The last example I have the time I &apos;ve got a strump , realized , and I realized , to walk , to chap and exesied musicians .
It &apos;s a full , I realized , to walk , to walk and exejobs .
The Siftable here is the base of the base , and the battery .
Every one of these has four different variations , and you can find .
You can introduce these suons in a sequence of sequence .
And modificart just doing a squence . &quot;
These are effects that can control from the vive , as the result and the philillion .
And he &apos;s taking a particular squeet and then cline for the midle .
And then there &apos;s the effects like time and wanted to be in the sequence .
Let &apos;s look at how .
Video : We &apos;ll move a lot of the base in two Siftable , &quot; sequence , &quot; we &apos;re in a series , we &apos;ll go to a series , we &apos;ll get other , we &apos;ll get other ,
Now , I &apos;m going to move .
Video : Now , I &apos;ll go to the perceiver --
Video : And now , I can put the phillion battery , so I can control the effect of the vive .
Video : I can : You can see the whole sequence in sequence , in the sequence of time ,
Video : I &apos;ll add the phillion the phils of the faller .
Video : I can remember the sequence . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have the first , but I can try to try , but I can try to try , and I can make it more .
And now , finally , I can see the whole sequence in the left Siftable to the Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is build interface , and more than the brain is going to be a lot of wonderful , and
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the result of this performing , and some possibility that we &apos;re going to bring out from the laboratories .
The concept I want to transming is that it &apos;s going to be this new generation of objects to interact with media , which will will take information in our world in the world that we want .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;m not going to talk about with all of you .
I &apos;m a choices .
Scooks is my profession , but it &apos;s more than this ,
It &apos;s also the love and the phascar of my life .
And I don &apos;t expect you can change .
But , I said , something that &apos;s happened in my life , and in my life and in my life and in my carric , who has brought me to realize the whole work .
The particular thing is that I &apos;ve recently wrote this book , this book called &quot; Manean , and I &apos;m going to do , &quot; Manem , &quot; which is the focused in the world and I &apos;m going to use a big huge , and I &apos;m going to use a big send , and I &apos;m a great send .
And the result is that anything , people in the wall , people are like if they were conducted .
David -- condanned , condannect !
They want to me to be all word and say , &quot; You don &apos;t know , &quot; You don &apos;t have more to do ?
You don &apos;t have to try to go to to to write your life without power of life within order to make a book that can &apos;t be able to make a book ? &quot;
What can you can &apos;t important ? &quot;
It &apos;s rassicurant , you know .
But it could go to the wake , I remember the more than 20 years ago , when I started to say , when I started to say , &quot; I wanted to be a scritical scritical -- I wanted to be a scritical scritical .
And I met the same reaction of the same .
And people said , &quot; I don &apos;t know , &quot; I don &apos;t have succeed ?
You don &apos;t have a purpose that the uillion ?
You don &apos;t have to do this myself to do that that that nice is no life that you never come out and dead on a cumumual cumumual with the climb of your car ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is : &quot; You . &quot;
And , I have a couple of all .
I always had always been a couple .
And I also also have a lot of other things that people can &apos;t ind .
As the galga and other things .
But , to how much about what I thought I thought and I thought I thought I thought about and I thought it &apos;s why ?
Is it ?
It &apos;s no debate that anything you would expected to be free to be free to do .
But what &apos;s about particular , in particular prising in creative , and you &apos;ll get to the health health , in a way that other cars can &apos;t ?
How do my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and not remember of a solute , in his 40 years of activity in which was asked if you had to be able to be able ?
Never was -- that blows that blows on John , how ?
It didn &apos;t work , so that you know ?
Onely , the engineers like group of groups , in the centuries , in the centuries of being allowed to be allow the depressive depressive .
We have this reputation , we have this reputation , and not just scring , but creationship of every genetic reputation of human institually .
And you don &apos;t have to look at the trists of the death of the magnific death , only in the midle of the death century , and they can die and further and they &apos;re going to move them .
And that &apos;s not such such such seems to be realized by their dings .
Norman Mailer , first of dead , in the last , I &apos;m going to die , &quot; Okay , I know a little more . &quot;
But we don &apos;t have to say , because we &apos;ve heard these things , we &apos;ve heard these things , and we have completely interested in some way we have completely interested in some of the netvity and the food that the creativity and the art , in some way , to reat the end .
And the question I want to do all of the time today : You &apos;re going to do with this idea ?
It &apos;s good thing -- because it &apos;s also going to go to a centirely of food , it &apos;s not good for anything .
I think it &apos;s odiosa .
And I think it &apos;s also periculous and I don &apos;t want to see the perpececures .
I think it &apos;s better to get our big big ments creative creative and living .
And I know , I know , in my case -- in my case -- would be very periciciculous , I &apos;m going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the further in which are in my full .
Or -- but you look , I &apos;m just just just just a 40 years .
I &apos;ve still about four decades .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything about the right now , and then will be going to be going to be going to be going on on the world as the work that &apos;s going to be going to be able of my last book .
It &apos;s going to be the floor , because we all have the friends that my largest success is to my largest success .
Oh , Gesus , who think about !
You know this is the genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic .
I would like to continue to try to do this work that we &apos;re .
So , the question is , how ?
And so I seems , after a lot of reflected , which is to continue to continue to make a connection , what &apos;s going to make a psychological protective , okay ?
I have to find a way to find a further , I &apos;m going to writing , and my natural natural , and my natural writers , and I was going to get to go to the way to go to the way to look at the time , I &apos;m trying to look at the time , I &apos;m trying to find other society , and I &apos;m trying to see if you could have more and more than to have more than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than than read and then I &apos;m going to see if I &apos;m going to
And on how to help people creative to make people creative to make the inerent of creativity .
And that &apos;s a further , and I reach to the Greg and Roma .
Seguitems because I high in certainly and then back .
In the anic Greg and Roma -- the ang Roma -- people don &apos;t seems to believe that the creativity of the man ?
And it was thought that the creativity was this spirit of divity and that if you get a few surprising of a few surprisons and wonderful , for reasons , and I knew .
The dumbling of the divarious dians of creativity . &quot;
You know , it &apos;s wonderful , credeal of demand that &apos;s a demand that &apos;s going to have a demand .
The Roman idea , but they called that kind of explained the kind of spirit without a genius .
which is a great great , because the Romans didn &apos;t think a genius was someone particular intelligent .
They have a genius was this kind of entity , and that &apos;s created in the midle of the murs of a study of a study , a little bit like the Dobs , and that if you have to listening to assistance the work of work .
Here &apos;s a standing -- here &apos;s the best thing that is the distance of the psychological psychological protected in your work .
And all the time was so that he worked , right ?
So , the artists were protected by certainly , like the third , for example , right ?
If your work was a cey-journey doesn &apos;t take and all the market , all of the world , all of the same incorport .
If your work , if your work , it was not all the brows , it was not all the right ?
All they knew that was your genius to be a whole way .
And so the people , so the creativity in Occcide in Occcident time .
And then the Rindeent , and it &apos;s going to change , and nacross this big idea ; we put the human beings , and we put the mistake all the mistake of the creatures that wrote to creatures from the divinity .
This was the main the human eximimum , and the people beginning to think about creativity , if you &apos;re completely on the ishing of the same shared .
And for the first time in the first time , you have to reference in this one of the artist of a genius , as a genius with a genius .
And I have to say , I think was a groserror .
I think you &apos;ll have to have a simple person , a simple person of creating as a reciplant , and the surprising and the surprising and the surprising , creatible , and you know , unknown , and a responsible huge huge huge or a very much filling to be a big dagainst a huge huge gassive .
It &apos;s like to someone of incording to get the solute .
Deat and distored , and I think of all these ingreaction , and creates all of these ing-formance .
And I think it was this pression to described artists in the past 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think it &apos;s , and now ?
We can do it different ?
Maybe to get more than a commersion of relationship between human and I was creationship .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t have a cell 500 years of thinking about 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience that they would have the solar scientific scientific scientific , but , you know , you know , you know , they &apos;re full the next to have their projects .
You can &apos;t tell you all about this thing .
But the question I want to do is -- why is no ?
Why don &apos;t you think about this way ?
Because it has more than every other thing that has ever heard to explain the expensive ext of the process of process .
A process , as anything that has ever ever ever ever ever I &apos;ve ever ever ever ever , you know , all here , you know , you know , you don &apos;t have to do .
And , in fact , you can look at the time .
I did this incontrol , and I just had a few poeterful Ruth , who was 90 years , but I was a few years , but he was a few years , and he said , in the way , and he said , in the way , and he was working in the middddouble , and he was spoeting , when he was a few extraordinary country , and when he was a few extraordinary exth of the extra .
And he was like a fragorous train .
And he was rotating to the country of the country .
You know , you know , because he had to make the land .
He had to have a solute thing to do in that point , and he was , and he was , &quot; World ld . &quot;
And then he &apos;s going to get home and it would be intertered by this poetry and it would not have to take a piece of career and a quick page , as a page , as a trape , and it would stop the page .
And sometimes , I couldn &apos;t have enough , so correcord and cord and record to come up and record to come up and the home and the lost and it would continue to continue and it would continue to continue to go to the way , I &apos;m going to go to be able to a few other way . &quot;
And then there were those times -- this piece of the time I &apos;m never going to -- there were the moments in which was almost copy , right ?
So , he was taking home and was trying to be trying to the home and was a few hometimes , and he was a car mathemselves in the past , and then he was like if you high , and then he was like if you high the other hand .
Acuffle the poetry and the rescue and the translation and the transming and transmove on the page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be on the page and intable and intable , but the last word .
So when I feel feel -- it &apos;s exactly , it &apos;s exactly the process .
I don &apos;t have my creationship -- I &apos;m not a conduction !
I &apos;m a moving , and my way to work is ; I &apos;m going to see me , and I &apos;m going to go and dare working and go and go to the past and go to the way .
But I &apos;m a personal , in my test , I &apos;ve striet , I &apos;ve got a striet .
And I can also also also many of you .
You know , if the work and the ideas , and I was source to a certain a certain , I can &apos;t know .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relationship to do not to make the head , but , the pieces , but , we can do you do it ?
For how much about , the best example of the best exporary contemporary , which I have the musicians , which I &apos;ve interviewer in a day .
We &apos;re talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life was the incarbon of the artist of the artist of the artist , trying to control , to try to control , to connected these species of creationship , and you know ,
But then he invected , and a day , and a day , and a day when he was drather than Los Angeles ,
He was wondering and all of a tracross this little framework , which is going to arrid , which arries arried in his head , and the full of mine , and the desidentic , and the desidant , and the desiddle , but as you know , but as you know .
It doesn &apos;t have a piece of cars , it doesn &apos;t have a record .
So , I started to feel this species of vectual , he &apos;s going to be , &quot; I &apos;m going to hope , and I &apos;ll reremember to be a personal sessionate .
I don &apos;t know enough and I can &apos;t make cells . &quot;
And I &apos;m going to go into the panic , you stoppy .
I &apos;m going to move the whole process and further something new .
And I &apos;m just just the wake and said , &quot; Scushing , &quot; Scushing ? &quot;
&quot; You know , you know , you can write a cannot ?
If you really want to do , in a moment when I can take me care .
And you can , you have to care ,
You &apos;re going to be burbate Leonard . &quot;
And his process , and his process ,
Not work , the work was still still still ,
But the process , and the fish ansia that was recorded to lead when the genius , the genius , the genius that was going to use the genius , and I &apos;m going to come back to the way to the hyse , they would not be a interested .
But I &apos;m going to get a peculiar , he &apos;s wonderful conversation between Tom and this thing , and this is what was not Tom and this way to expert was not Tom .
So how I feel that history to change a little bit of the way I was working and already already , and I &apos;ve already had a time .
And this idea , I was going to go to the Mang , &quot; Maneum , &quot; As , &quot; and I , &quot; I was going to be working on on something we &apos;re all working on something we &apos;re going to be working on something and we &apos;re going to think about something about something about a disassigned .
Not just , just the book , the book .
And I started thinking about this project .
But then I remember of Tom who worked at the air and I &apos;ve got .
So I &apos;m my face in the hoscritical and direst and direct my comments to a angle .
And I said , &quot; Sents , &quot; Sents , what we know , what if we know if this book not will be going to be going to be going to be going to be interested in my own , no ?
Because as I see that I &apos;m going to put it all I have , I don &apos;t have this more than this .
So if you want you to have a better , you &apos;ll representing and make your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do , I &apos;m not , I don &apos;t have fully .
I &apos;ll start to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I want to favor that was recorded that I &apos;m record to do my part , &quot; because , I &apos;m going to end , OK , OK , OK , OK , OK , in the same people have to stay for the dances of the walking , and a dances , and a dances that they were in and hours and to go to hours and .
And they were always magnific , because the balleres were ballering and they were fantastic .
But every long , I &apos;m going to have , and one of these artists was actually actually transformer in transformer .
And I know what you know , because I know , because I know you have all , in a hope , a hope .
It was like if the time you stopped , and the ballery through a special special special of different brains from the sushed 1,000 notes , but it &apos;s all the 1,000 notes , but all the time , it &apos;s all .
And in the improvide not as a human beings .
But you have been in the didrive in and slow the full of the divinity .
And when this happens , you know , the people know what it was , called the coffee , called his name .
They were the hands and , they were starting to saying , &quot; Allah , and Allah , Allah , God , Dod , God . &quot;
That &apos;s Do , you know .
Curid note , when More invaded the Spain of Spain , I was this habits , and the pronounded in the centuries of the South , Allah , Allah , &quot; The &quot; &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Or , &quot;
In Spay , when a artist has done something possible and magic , &quot; Allah , and became , and became , I &apos;m going to move , &quot; I &apos;m going to stop -- one scores -- one scoral .
And it &apos;s very much because we need .
But the problem , the problem , for the day , for the ballery , when you sweek and scrate that are the 11 of Martedteds and the scoral of Dod there &apos;s no more .
It &apos;s just a details with gran with the ginocky , and maybe you can &apos;t be more to make it more to care .
And maybe no one of Dod , while you &apos;re still going to do it in the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the critical record to make a creationship .
But maybe not to be so angerous if you could not believe , if you could not believe , and that the most extraordinary , which the most extraordinary of your own own own own .
But you think you just just think you are data in the prestisource of this source of this squires of your life that you have to go to to anything when you &apos;ve got to go to anything when you &apos;ve finished .
And , if we think about this way we &apos;re going to think about it .
And I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s sure as I thought about for different months , and I thought about about the book , and I &apos;m going to do , the periculous , the cycle , the cycle of my great deal .
And that I have to continued to tell me when I feel feel electric I have to wait .
Not wever . Fa job .
And in fact , in fact , in your part , while you can be .
If your work is balls , you balls .
If the divine , if I &apos;m going to ask a signed decide to leave some kind of wonderful kind of wonderful , for a high , then you know , &quot; OK ! &quot;
And you have the same .
And &quot; Ole ! &quot;
I think I think I think I &apos;ve got to do it .
&quot; You go ! &quot;
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : The day !
As you know , I &apos;ve already talking about some of the genome , what can can medium and discovery of new set .
Now , we &apos;re starting to make a new way , we started to digitalize biology and now now , and now we &apos;re going to get in a new new phase in a new biology , designing and designing and tetizing synthird life , designing and tetizing .
We always tried to take great questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot;
We tried different approaches , reducted to minute mines .
We &apos;re digitalized by 20 years .
When we sequence the genome of the genoma genome of the world of biology in the world of biology in the world .
Now , we can do : Now , we can regenerate life , or create new life from this universe ?
This is the maps of a little organism , the Mycopy , which is the kind of a little bit of the floor of the smaller than the genoma .
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome for creates a little bit more .
We &apos;re able to eliminate a hundred of about 500 of about 500 that are here .
But when we look at the midle of his maps , it &apos;s relatively to our own .
Credeal , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one time , it &apos;s very impossible that this can bring to a cell .
So , we decided that the only way to design record to the synthesis to the synthesize components to make components to make some of these questions questions .
And so we started the &quot; Posle , we started the Posystem ? &quot;
And he can do the chemical chemical to contains these big big , we never could make before .
And , in case , we can do a croms , can we do a croms ?
A comosome is simply a piece of chemical material .
The speak with that we &apos;re able to digitalize life is growing life is growing up to the rate .
Our capacity of scale scale , in fact , in fact , we have to discovery and floor , but it &apos;s the best .
And our more recently recorded on a curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process has requires of the agges , beginning with a revision , before I began to start the first experiments .
But we have discovered that synthesis very difficult .
There are decine of thousands of car car , which is a little bit of DNA , of the DNA , of the long time , and it &apos;s a degenerative process , the more .
So we had to develop a new metoxual metoxugggets and read to read the herrors .
And this was our first tentative , and I &apos;m going to talk about the digital of the genome of Phi 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that ucks are .
We designed the framments , effectuated the correction of the errors and a molecule of about 5,000 .
The interesting part of the interesting thing is when we &apos;ve pressive this piece of chemical chemical material , and we have inserious in the batteratterns , and we have to read this genety and product .
The particles are , and then you &apos;re going to get back to cells , are back and they destructed to the E.
I &apos;ve talked about recent with membres of the industry of the trolified to the way of the trolifly , this model .
They have more than you .
We see that this is a situation in which the software can really build his same , in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things more .
We wanted to build the interest or of the batterattery .
They are more than 580 mountain code .
So we thought about built the casses of virus , so that we could change the class to understand what the cell of a cell of a cell of a cell .
The progprogram is crucial , and if we begin with information , and we &apos;re going to be very accurate .
When we sequence this genome for the first time in 1995 , in 1995 , the standard was a herror to every 10 mile .
We have discovered , requires , 30 errors . If we had used to use that sequence , we &apos;d never be able to do it .
One part of the process is designed to the lept-to-food process , 50 leps of 50 leps of 50 leptype of 50 leters that work together .
We can see it in the other elements here .
You have lay , you have lay the challenge .
Think , so we have a genetc code on four leps : Four , and TTo .
To those lectures together , and there &apos;s a 20 minacids , and there &apos;s a specific of lectual literate for every friend of lectures .
So we can use the genetc genetics for words , almost , and we can use .
What we &apos;ve done in the beginning is authographs .
Some were used from the fact that was not just a few extra .
We &apos;ve designed these segs to make them to just purpose with the entire .
There are the entire things that they &apos;re going to move and put them .
And we started to assembling , begin with segems , beginning with six to five , until full , until to make sure in the way to 72 .
Every past of these segments in the hundred of the hundred of sequences that we &apos;re going to create a very , as you see in a minute -- like you see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatizy the process .
So , this seems the tabababababababables .
When we &apos;re going to get these segems , more than 100 mistakes , not growing more directly in the E.
You can get to the limite of biology , and the way of biology .
So we &apos;ve considered other mythemselves .
We had to do another eyellow called recognize , which is , in biology , which in biology , in biology , and in biology to repartment .
Here &apos;s an example .
This is a organism , called Deinoccurs , it can make three million rate .
You can see in the rest of the such as his own own own .
In 12 -- 24 hours is a best exactly as before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms are completely .
They can live sliterally .
They &apos;re just just just just a lot of life in space , and you can find new life in space , and you get new environment of water .
ASA , NASA shot of that this is .
This is a lot of the molecule we &apos;ve built these process , just use the living of the design of segate with design , and just just just to inserious .
The lievidence of the brows .
This is not been scape with a microscope with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a lot of great great that we can see a lot of the microscope .
These are pictures that they have a period of six second .
This is the public public time ago .
They are more than 50,000 lecame genetc code .
It &apos;s the molecule of a degree of definitely decreated by the man .
It &apos;s a fish molecular period on 300 million .
If you &apos;re going to get a career without specular cars , they would like 142 page to translate this code code .
Now , how do we do it ?
Of course , tramite a virus is a game from kids .
It &apos;s a little more complicated when you use the batteratteries .
It &apos;s just simple when you &apos;re cell cells as a cell of our : can simply extreme cell . You can just extreme nuclear and inseriously , that &apos;s prise .
In the batterattery of the cell , and it &apos;s invent in the side of the cells , but we have recently degree that we have to do a trapior of a cell of a cell of a cell phone of a cell phone of a cell .
We can refly a crazy of a kind of microbial species .
The two are different men of the men .
We &apos;ve got some gene gene , and we could decided to decide what I &apos;ll try to decide to this clear .
And he &apos;s scientists with the entire entire entire all the protein .
And when we have the mess is the study was studied -- and you &apos;ll apprecifistickly our graphor -- the new cell physical .
And we thought we couldn &apos;t go to the way we could go , but we tried anything to go more .
This is one of the most evolution of evolution .
We have discovered that that we &apos;ve got to add a second or a third or a third , to addrather than a second , in a second second .
So , who &apos;s just about evolution as a gene at the time you have no full of biology .
There are the entientire scientists called the entire retriition of tribution that DNA .
The cell that was in the cells that was in the cells .
The cellula-cell cell , we have inserious that we have inserious .
It &apos;s expressed , and has recognize the other cell , and it &apos;s a material , and it &apos;s romoma , and we &apos;re going to find with only cells and the new cells and the new cell and the new cell .
It &apos;s become became a genes we have inseriously .
And in a short of time , all the caristics of a species are going to be , if you &apos;re going to be constantly in a new kind of sexual , we have to get in the cells .
All the protein are changing , and when we leave the genetc , and when we leave the genetc genety that we have transfull .
Now , this could seems , but altering the genetics , but the software , we can change things in hyse .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that there &apos;s not talking about the genius , but I know , I &apos;ve got to make a new kind of evolution , and I &apos;ve already said we &apos;re going to make a new version of explosion in the Cambrian Cambrian Cambrian Cambrian Cambrial process .
Why do I do what ?
I think it &apos;s enough when we think about our necessity .
We &apos;re going to go to six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right for example : I &apos;m born in 1946 .
Now , there &apos;s three people on the planet for the planet for 40 ; 40 years , and they will be four .
We &apos;re going to find problems , and we &apos;re going to find food , medicine and pulital and walking for six billion and a half billion people .
It &apos;s going to be more drive to do it .
We &apos;re more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion paper , more than 30 billion challenges .
It means the million barils .
When we try to find biological process , or any kind of process , or any kind of process to repieces , will be a huge huge huge .
In the most we have to contains the CO2 from CO2 from these materials that finding in the atmosphere .
And in the day today , thank you , thank you , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are components for the future .
The tronic industry just a dozen dozen about components , and think about a lot of different components are going to be out .
Our limits here are the maybe from biological improvide .
Now , we have the technique , thank you , thank you , we can see what we call genomics of what we call genomics what we call genomics .
We &apos;re able to build a grosycle that can produce a billion crazy of croms .
Think of the processing of the different different genes of different genes or try to make the process to producing or to make or make a little bit , and we can change , and we can change , thank you , thank you a little bit more biology , and we create a little bit more biology , and make a lot of science .
And it &apos;s just a selection .
We can chemical to possibility of surface , and it &apos;s a chemical carburant , or or of carburant vaccine .
This is an anea of some of some surfaces of the program that we &apos;re working for seeing to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to seeing to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
Well , we don &apos;t know , we don &apos;t know how they will be .
We know , we know , it &apos;s their genetc code .
Now , we &apos;re focus to focus to fours .
You also seen you know that extreme ants from the grandscape .
We have carburants of second and third generation that will use enough to the car carbon of the bird high high as the full or floor as the full or full .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact to have a big impact , and limiting the cost of the food and limitself would be transforming CO2 in mathird , we &apos;re working for designing , we &apos;re working for designing to make a cell of the first huge , and we can do this to be a very quickly , and we can be a high of about 18 months .
The solar solar solar with CO2 is a metodog -- but in our discoveries in the world , we found different different metohers .
This is a organism we have described in 1996 .
I &apos;m going to live in the ocean , in about 2500 feet of deeption to the temperature of the water .
And they can put from CO2 , using a lot of energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can imagine if we can imagine the CO2 , which can make a tramazing training your crazy , to make this process .
So , we can think we can think we could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the question of the question is , &quot; We have the modest , we have the modest of read . We have the modest of the industry .
And if you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can you do it ?
It would be a main the main the midle of energy .
But , we &apos;re working for use the same metal to make vaccines to make vaccines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with influence , we &apos;re always back to a year and with a year and with a year , and when you &apos;re going to find the vaccine .
I think what you can change is going to change in the combins .
Here &apos;s how the future could start to change , now , the allow-evolution , and the evolution of evolution , and indeed the evolution , and infinally , and infinally , and infinally .
We &apos;re so so on the best people .
Our scale is to make enough enough to live enough to try to try to try to try to try to try to try . Thank you very much .
First of all to see , the most of the most possible , some work , some work , in the new technology we &apos;ve got to the Microsoft in the middle of a year ago . This is Seady . This is Seady .
It &apos;s a environment that you can interact in the living in the living of the six of data ,
Here we &apos;re seeing a lot of photographs of photographs with a kind of coom , and and continue , and to keep a fast , and to a fast , and I &apos;m going to be .
And it &apos;s not how big big amount of information that we see , how much big , how are big big , and the big images .
Most of the photographs , but this for example , but this for example is a scansion of the Bibliotecame of the Congress , and reentrepreneurs in the gapiel .
Not a difference because the only thing that limits that limits to a difference of a lot of players on your screen in your screen . It &apos;s also a very flu .
This is a book , for example of data , not images .
This is Casolate Dickens . Ogake .
For shows you that it &apos;s just about the head and not images , we can do a genetic representation of a very , to see that it &apos;s a very representation of a photographs .
It could be a way to be a little bit of artificial book for a book or electronic book .
I don &apos;t have it .
This is a more existic example . It &apos;s a number of the Guardian .
Every big imagine is the beginning of a set .
And there &apos;s really the way to make the beauty and beauty experience of a revision of a revision of a revision of a revision , which is for nature a lot of medical meeting .
We also also did something with the angle of this number of this number of this number of this number of this number of this number of this number of this number of this number of this number of this number of this number of this number of this number of particular numbers in particular number of this number of this number of this number of this number of this number of this number of this number of this numb
We created a public public fasull of the solutions -- very much more than that &apos;s going to a normal public -- and we have inseriously inseriously .
If you want to see the caristics of this authoric audience , you can see here .
Or other mothers , or even specific cells .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that this means to the end of the population and other cheries , and they should be more than they should be necessarily .
Naturally , the mapplications is one of the most obvious applications and for this kind of technology .
And on this not not to hope , if we don &apos;t mean , if we don &apos;t mean , in this camp .
These are all the streets in the U.S.
So now , we &apos;re going to go to what other .
So , this is actually the wb . You can see it .
It &apos;s a project called Photynth Photynth , which is two different technologies .
One is Seady and the other is a very interesting research in the Noah Snavailable , one of the University of the University of Steve Sez , with the U.S.
And it &apos;s from the wb , glowed Seady .
You can see when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from a picture of image , and have this kind of experience and have this kind of experience .
But the collocation of images here has actually actually actually a meaning .
The goritself of visualization of the computer have recorded these images , in way , in way , in way , in the way , and the imagins that imagined , all the imagins of the Montal Montagainst Rockey , are the scape .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;m going to show you some other environment .
There are a lot of space .
I want to go to the directly one of the original data of Noahahotynth , and this is a precedle of Photosynth Photosynth , I want to show you the first time we &apos;ve done for the first time , and I &apos;m really really really really really , the technology , and it &apos;s not just just just just just just just just just the technology . And we don &apos;t even even even even in the web .
We had to prepared to expect and on the dict of the wait .
This is a rebuilt of the cattle of Nothree Dame images , and I &apos;m going to get to the Flickr . Badigitoes and you can imagine imagine , and you can imagine , and you can do .
So , I &apos;m all all the Flickr and are all all of the space space in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to this way , we can just .
You know , I wouldn &apos;t think about Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratific gratifigure out here .
I think you can see that is a lot of different type of different kinds of focus : from those cellularly , from those cellulards of cellularly , a number , a number , in this environment .
And if I &apos;m going to try to try to try to try to try and look at the most more .
Many are blows , and it &apos;s ceasy .
Some part here , you have a series of photographs -- eccollege .
This is a poster of Nothree Dame recorded correct .
We can go from the poster of the physicist of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social social . This is going to do with social data , on the intera rememory of how to make the way , from the point of vision , from the visual view -- and all these data .
All of those pictures become , most of the parts , most of the parts .
You have a model of the land that .
Think about this as the prolger of Stephen Lawler Lawer on Earth .
It &apos;s something that growing in complexity that people are going to use people , and the vantages for who are going to use the full of use .
Their pictures are marries with other people .
If someone is the idea of contrassigns all of these saying , my photographs , my photographs of Nothree Dimprovide , and I can use all of the data , and I can use a point of the grandscape , and I can use a hundred of the universe , and I can have a lot of experience and another hand , and have a high of the hometimes .
Naturally , a conscience of all of the virtual extremely elaborate of every interesting part of every interesting part of the terms of terms , and I &apos;m not just vistand image of images and images of the similar and satellyslow , but from the memorem .
Mille graduate .
CA : I &apos;m going to do that ? What your floor ? What your floor will be to make it is that to do is that , in the next years , in the next years , all the photographs , all the photographs , they will be prise in the world or will be prise in the world ,
BA : Yeah . What &apos;s doing in practicise is doing .
It &apos;s creating the hyperlink , if you want to do ,
And it &apos;s doing it in the contains of images .
The thing is very interesting if you think about remember , if you think about record and the record of these images have of these images .
As when you have a research of images on the web , and the head page and the head page has a lot of information about pictures of pictures .
Now , what if you have the picture of all your picture ?
So the quantity of interconnection and the quantity of record and the quantity of record , it &apos;s really a huge effect of the further .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible .
BA : By very much .
One of the main the main the midle of the needs and one of the needs of the needs is the power of the research , and the further than the wind of the wind , and the wind , the myself , in the midddle , and the food .
Basts think the scientists , Jaguar , and the Via Lattea , or who are still still the Children are still still still still connected to Himalaya , or in Himalaya , or in Himalaya , and the best of the very important central central central , and the idea of the idea that &apos;s just a sense of the world , and the idea that &apos;s just a sense of the world , and the world that &apos;s just a sense of a sense of the world , and it &apos;s actually , but it &apos;s not just a very ,
the conseence of a particular set of sceles that our stirirst of our stirirst , or a lot of generations , many generations ago .
And , of course , all the way we share of the essential .
All we &apos;re all all all of .
We &apos;re saying , and I &apos;m going to be .
We have to realize the inesority of dead , so we don &apos;t surprising and ballisten and ballisten and ballisten .
We all have a art .
What the pisce is the particular squiet , the third , the run of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that are the Worneo , or the Wooks , or the Woodom of Haiting , or or the Haitan , or the Curt of the desert Kenya , Cursue , Candurban , or a mlit physical camellia .
He was my company in the desert of vision in the desert month ago , or a hallevidor in the value of the Chilangers , on the Everest , the demic .
All of these populations that are other ways of ways of thinking , and other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking ,
And if you reflected a active concept that can give you a hope that can give you a hope .
In fact , the miriades of cultures of cultures of life explained a lot of life and cultural cultual , and cultural , and it &apos;s important to be the planet as a little bit of biological planet as a little bit like the guy .
And you can think about this guy as a high of the nosfood , and you can see the nosphere , and you can see the nospital , and , every mitself , and , in your neighborhood , and , in your neighborhood to be in the human intuitive .
The nosfood is the fanity .
It &apos;s the simple of what we are and what we can be in how much species .
And I &apos;m sure as biosphere was just consumed to the nosfly , and purther .
No biologist , for example , it would direct that 50 percent of all the species has been or on the orest of the set of the simply , because it &apos;s full of the food -- in the most apalong the different countries -- and you can &apos;t also have a little bit more than the full of the food .
The walking of all , of course , the perdence .
When you &apos;re non-hy-hours on this planet .
One is not just a vocabolic vocabolic or a series of rules .
One of the spirit is the prag of the spirit .
It &apos;s the midle with the animal of every culture in the world .
Every lingua best forest , a best forest , a spensive , a very , a spensive of possibility .
And those 6,000 lens , as we &apos;re sedriving in Monterey , at least the midle , it &apos;s not more sushed in the orechieve and children .
They don &apos;t have more more , which is not to say , , less you want to say , anything , which are already death .
What &apos;s more tristory of the floor of the silence , of the silence , the last talk about a lenters , of not avails , the watch of the promise or or or or or or or or anticipate ?
And this is a few of one in the world of the world every two weeks : every two weeks , every two weeks and a basic ancient and hundred of a tomb .
And I know someone of you will tell , &quot; In &apos;t it better ?
The world would not be a better place if we &apos;ve got all the same lingude ? &quot;
We &apos;re going to do .
You &apos;ll prise a trouble thing about your language .
I would like to do a vision , you would do a journey ,
a little vision in the nosfer of what we &apos;re going to give you a mine of what we &apos;re going to hurt .
Many of us dimental direct that when I say , &quot; different ways of existence .
We can take for example of this bibide Barasana , in Amazonia , the populate of the aney-hood , which creating to myself , which crede from the house of a spend of a spend saces .
It &apos;s a population that is not able to distingures the color of the best became the cell of the best cell is the floor , which is the population of the population .
They have a strange lingua game , and a remonial , &quot; exactly &quot; &quot; Do , &quot; You have to saying a person who park a different park .
All of what has been radical mitological , and I have the particular arity is that in these family family , in these family , or or seven or seven or seven or seven or a practice .
They &apos;re limited to listening and then they start to talk .

She &apos;s a land-, this lian argument that contains a series of mine , and literally , and literally literally .
Prending the right now has a book , and it &apos;s a book that alters a little bit of the conscience , but it &apos;s myself with the broket of a bad of the car became Psynchoia .
This is the contriptamine , very similar , very similar to serve serotonine , methoxyypels , mexyypellow .
If you never see the Yanomami , if you never see the name of a different set of a different set of species , and it &apos;s a different set of a different set of methoylypels .
Tirst that policy on for the no is a little bit like to be sparated by a little bit of drive ppins and a little bit of purpose to make a hydressing . I don &apos;t believe a stories .
I had spent with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who write the man was the psychetry , with his discovered the car of fungers in the &apos; 30 years in Mext in the &apos; 30 years in Mexico .
In my tometimes you can &apos;t class these triptamine as as you &apos;re doing this in size because if you &apos;re doing , if you &apos;re doing no one of being .
It &apos;s possible to assumerely if you can just saying with other stains that money is the MAO .
Now , the beauty : The beauty of carbine , which are iniburban inibitors of the MAO , the same kind of the same kind of the same question : The question question is : a very quickly , in a foot of fflying , but if these are going to be dead two of the disease , but if you can &apos;t be able to be able to be able to created , but if you have a huge of the same ,
We &apos;re the great euphemism of the time and the herror , and it can reveal infrutework .
But if we ask the Indian , they &apos;ll say , &quot; The pieces are talking about .
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuge , who are nected in the forest , and that &apos;s our eyes would be in the same kind of the same species .
If we ask them as stabilisten their task , they &apos;re going to tell us , &quot; I thought , &quot; I &apos;m not going to be able ? &quot;
The solution is : you take 17 variety of a lpiece of a lpile and ognition , and a cancer .
So , this is not laureduced Harvard , but it &apos;s very more interesting that contact that contact .
Now , , I applauss the problem is that the problem is that the people who have heard the populations are the horest , but in some way , in some way to the history of the world , and the past of our history , and the past .
In fact , the century , between 300 years , not going to remember for the waiting and waiting and innovations , but as the saying as the way we stopped and we have stopped to the deal of a very detail .
All the cultures were involved in a dance for a dance of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux Sioux Sioux when they have the horse , and they have no longer as American don &apos;t have to be American American who have been in the horbit of the horse .
It &apos;s not the technology that mind the technology that minute the integrity of nosfood . It &apos;s the power .
The wall of the domination .
And if you look at the world , you &apos;ll find that these are not cultures are cultures not cultures .
They &apos;re creatures and dinics , and dins out of the forces of the forces of their ability to make their ability to do .
And the walking of the wosis of the patria .
For the nometimes of Sarawak , in the satest , a population that has lived in the forest to a generation , and now reduced to a generation , and now reduced the rest of the field of the field of the field of the best , where you can see the middle of the Borririments , where the MMCaaaaaaaaaxed Maaasian , where the Daaaasix ,
You pronce the stive style with the floor .
Or , in case , in the case of the disease , are the disease of the discovery .
If we &apos;re saying on the Tibet of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the droom .
As you know the genocise , the physicist of a population , is condannect universal , but the netnight , but the destruction of life , not only condance , not only condance , but only only condances , but not only condannect , because of the developed developed developed .
And you can &apos;t understand the soil of Tibet , you can &apos;t be part of the beginning .
I hope the 6,000 miles from China in China in Cococcial Cococcial Tibet , I get to Lhasa hasa game with a game , but only only only only only one of the Lhasa hasa hasa lot of what we feel about .
6,000 mountain sacross the policy and centers .
1.2 million people killing the military Right to the Right .
The father of this guy was ascritical in Pancher Lama .
The one that &apos;s been killed to say that was killed to the past of invasion .
And I &apos;m saying with South Santity in Santity , in the world in Nepal .
Souther was prisoned and his colcolcolor was to be remarkable .
It was brought to the hours of two years , and the further because he wouldn &apos;t have to listening because he wouldn &apos;t have listen to listening without .
The surprising , which has been taken in the same , it was mitted in the same time .
A day has been a day , in the middle of the raffering Mao and , for this transition , and for this transmitted to the word of seven years .
The pain of Tibet can be insophood , but I explained the rest of the population of the population is taken .
And then , it &apos;s all , all of the sceless .
We want to live in the world world of the world of the world of the world we want to access the policromatical world ?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead , before , before , before , he &apos;s the biggest of the most powerful , in our own own own own , we can &apos;t see the whole games of the image of the image of the hundred of high , but a day , but a day , but a day day , but a day , a day day , but a day , we &apos;ll see there were going to be able to be other hours .
And it &apos;s billion remember that our species is there for 60,000 years .
The Not Neolitics , which has been doubled the agriculture , which has done to socket to culture , and standing the middle of the midle of the close , creating gerarchy , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world world has been stent in the midle of the world .
And that &apos;s a history not me me to suggested me that we have the answer to all the challenge that we should have to come in in in the millens to come .
When I &apos;m going to myself of cultures is asked to be human , they want to say , to be human , they want to be human , or or saying with 10,000 voces .
And it &apos;s in these answer that we all have all the possibility of being what we &apos;re going to be , a species , which is a species that we have to make a species , and all the population of the horgarduments . And there &apos;s great moments of the hydropping .
I &apos;ve been on this picture on the north of Baffin , when I went to Baffin , when I went to the car of the Inuit , and this man , and this man , and this man , and this man , and I &apos;m going to tell me the wonderful history .
The government government was not always gentile with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50 stabilic our premise , we have them in the midle , we have to use the colonies .
The nond of this man is refield .
And the family , in his life , and I &apos;ll bring all the art of the art , and all of his own .
You know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t know the the car of the country ,
The paps of the sliterally , they were made of fish food .
The nond of this man doesn &apos;t finstead of the neartic blood the stage of the blizery .
It &apos;s saying , it &apos;s hot , you &apos;re calculate psychoices in pumb and defocus in their mand defull . When the full are congect , and it &apos;s working a lama .
It &apos;s been sprize on on this college of this college of this clusters and when he was southern a cane .
Ha school , and created a sliterally , with the class , with the class , he has been a sliterally , and it &apos;s sliterally sliterally , and it &apos;s saying on the bancha .
We want to talk about the name ? &#91; Raaaauss ? And this , this , in different ways , and that &apos;s the full of the world is the sylience of the population of the population of the world .
In the government of 1999 , the government has redded by the Inuit &apos;s control of a large area of the California and Texas .
It &apos;s their new patria new patria .
It &apos;s a territoral mineraries . They &apos;re all all the resources of all the resources .
One of the example of how a national national , and I could read with his population .
And , for finish , I think it &apos;s a lot of what I &apos;m in these zone of us was in these zone of the planet , maybe connected .
For someone is home .
They &apos;re seeing of the imagination of the image of the high of the time . And for all of these children , as the source of our children , as the children , become part of our children , become part of the hope .
For finish , we &apos;re not convince we &apos;re convints that politicians will not be in null .
We see the policy --
And we don &apos;t have hope , but we don &apos;t hope , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and maybe we can change the best for stories to tell stories of stories .
56 Pathers are our canal television .
Our rive millions of people .
Our work is to travel in the noshand to bring our public audience of wonderful cultural wonderful , and you know , you know , you know , hope , and you hope to get to the focus of the wonderful , and we have to find a food .
which is the sagging of all the populate can be contribububs our ground .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book , or called the other hope and I &apos;m going to have heard some of college , in the case , in fact , in the case .
I &apos;d like to start with what I want to call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dead . &quot;
The dogs of what ?
The dogs of all society of society , the dental dental connected . &quot; If we want to myself , &quot; If we want to myself self to be myself . &quot;
The reason , it &apos;s a lated , in fact that the fact that the liberty is a value value , is precise , it &apos;s precise for human beings .
In the other thing we &apos;re libers , if we &apos;re libers , and one of us can against all that I &apos;m going to do all that , no one that decided in name , no one who decided in our name .
The way to myself is to myself is to move the scels .
More scoes people , more liberate , and most liberty , and most liberty , most liberty , most liberty , most liberty , most liberation , most liberate .
And I &apos;m going to have , it &apos;s so deeply radicated in society , and it would be a ground .
And it &apos;s also deply radicated in our vite various .
I &apos;ll show you some examples of what the progress has to be possible .
This is my surface . It &apos;s not particular arly .
I hope a simple note of the condition to injust-.
In my surface , there are 175 condition , without context 10 variety of oil , and the 12 , and the 12 acetes that you can buy to make a huge number of conditions of condition in the rest of the 175 or one of the 175 or a 75 or a promeeless of your demic .
Here &apos;s the surface .
And then you go to the negotional electronic to buy a stereo , if you have , if you , you have to get ,
And in this single negotial negotional , there &apos;s a big number of components .
We can realize six million different combinations of different combinations that there are in a negotial negotiate .
You have to put that there &apos;s a sisceling that there &apos;s a sceless .
Or the world of the world .
Once , when I was a child , they could all have the serve phone of phone , and they could be forners , and they were forners from the mamous Bell .
And he was nucked the phone , not was .
One of what , in the other , was that the phone , which the phone is not .
These are going to be .
We have a variety of phone of phone of phone , specially between cells .
Here &apos;s the future of the future .
MMP3 , the midle , the MP3 , MP3 , , and basic , and forth for the no , and foreign for the cle .
If you &apos;re not seen in the negotional , you &apos;re not seeing .
And what &apos;s going to the end is that people are in the nezi and does this question is the answer ?
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cellult that doesn &apos;t do .
So , in other expects that are very more important than life , you know , you know , it &apos;s true of the same explosion .
Assistence : You don &apos;t have the world &apos;s happening in the United States , and the doctor and the doctor , and the doctor .
Instead , you know , and the doctor , and the doctor , we could do , or , &quot; OK , &quot; Well , &quot; Coh , &quot; As these risks and these risks , &quot; What do you want ? &quot;
You know , &quot; Dr. &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; As these climb , and B , and B , and B , and these risks . &quot;
&quot; What does ? &quot;
And you can do , &quot; Dr. &quot;
And the doctor : I &apos;m not . &quot;
The result of the direct of the disease of disease , &quot; I just seem to make a beautiful thing .
But it &apos;s not a spostor and the responsibility of decisions of decisions of decisions that you know , something , and that &apos;s the doctor , and almost of the other thing that &apos;s not not not in the condition is the way .
There &apos;s a huge marketing of products , directly , and directly people like me and you , and you think about it , and you think we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , because it &apos;s public , why do you do ?
The answer is that they want to have the doctor we want to have the doctor for the rate .
And what &apos;s about this is our identity as is our identity never a question of sceless , as you see in this vision , as you see in this ggame . &quot; We don &apos;t want to be force . &quot;
And we can reinvented us to get .
The means that every morning , in the answer , you &apos;ll see that kind of person can be .
And I pect the family and in the best time , a time , a time , and I &apos;m going to have a lot of time , and he was that you would come the most possible , and he was beginning to make the most possible .
The only verse was with who , not when , you don &apos;t even when , I don &apos;t even know what they do .
Every day , all of it &apos;s really to play .
In seging students , and I &apos;m a lot of intelligent , and I &apos;m going to work in a time .
And because they don &apos;t have leave it , not because they &apos;re not not not saying .
Because I &apos;m impensive , I &apos;m saying , &quot; I would like , &quot; I would like to do you ? &quot;
&quot; I would like to do I &apos;m going to do I have to think about the children ?
I &apos;m interrationship .
And they &apos;re trying to answer those questions , if this implant is not going to be able to make a beautiful voyn-hard .
And they have to do it . They &apos;re important questions .
Now , the work : We &apos;re unfortunate , as Carl , because technology technology technology , because technology technology , because technology technology , every day , every day , every day , every day , every day , every day , in the Hotel Randolph .
I &apos;m talented , there &apos;s a angoline , and I &apos;m not going to tell no one who &apos;s going to work .
I don &apos;t say , because I want to use .
What means , this incredible liberty of scoice that we have to talk about work ? Is we have to decided to decide , if we have to work or not going to work or not .
We can go to see our children , with the board , with cellult , with the Blackberry , the Blackberry , the Blackberry , and the notion .
And if you &apos;re all spend , every minute , we see our children , we &apos;re also going to say , we &apos;re also asking , we &apos;re also asking to this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have answer to this ? I have to answer ? I have this literally ? &quot;
And when the answer is no , &quot; it &apos;s no , &quot; Well , this is no , &quot; and that &apos;s a very different different of what would be in other conditions .
So , as any part , we look at the small , and the gasic materials and stili of life , life is a question of scels .
One time was this : Over , there were some possibility , but it was not a question of scale .
The world today is going to be a lot of this : The dilemememma , or negative , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Suggle .
The landscape , so I &apos;m going to talk about that negative .
And this is this scowever is two effects of negative effects on people .
The first , paradost , it &apos;s that produced in the midle of liberation .
And many of the choices , it &apos;s a lot of difficult to do it .
I &apos;m going to show you an example : one study , one study of thinking about food .
A college has been on the data of the Vang , the journey of thinking , with about a billion climate climate climate climate climate .
What she &apos;s discovered is that for every 10 solutions that is that for every 10 solutions , the percentage of adesise .
With 50 deep source , there &apos;s 10 percent of adesions , when I have difree than five . Why ?
Because with 50 deep , with 50 details , it &apos;s disease , it &apos;s disease , and the sceless is remanding to the way .
And he &apos;s still more , and still domances , and of course , , and of course , , and of course , .
You know that it &apos;s not just that these are working in the eyes , because they don &apos;t have enough enough to save enough , because they don &apos;t want to say that the decision is so much , so that they &apos;re also so much more complementary .
Not teams , they &apos;re perfect to five dollars from the work , which would be ben .
So the paralalysis a conseence of the set of the time .
And I think it &apos;s going to do that .
&quot; And for the finishing , for the nity : ketchallenges , &quot; Is ? &quot;
You would be just take the decision , if it &apos;s for the nity , if it &apos;s for the nity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choices the source , and neighborhood .
So this is the first effect . The second is that if we can actually if we can actually have to evitate and make a scoke , we can even even floor , we &apos;re less than the watch of how they were unless than the choices .
And that &apos;s a different reasons .
One of these is that with a tants of the condition to the stake , if you have a fect , and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s just just a choice that you would have to make a different scoes that would be better . And that happened . And that happens is that happened . And that &apos;s the handing of the focus , and the full of the floor , and the floor , and the decision , and the decision , and the decision , and it &apos;s just just to the decision ,
when it was a very good decision .
More scowever , there &apos;s more , it &apos;s fashion , or whether it &apos;s going to be able .
But , there is what economists call the economists called the economists call the opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has very well well well , as the value of what we think about the things that we think about the things that we &apos;re confront .
In the rest , when there are tant possible , it &apos;s further , it &apos;s make caristorical across the career of the alternative scarten , and it &apos;s going to be scokilled .
Here &apos;s a example . I &apos;m going to use all of the New York .
But it &apos;s what probably probably just you think .
There &apos;s this coppia Hamptons .
A place of luss .
Spiece of high . Otypical day . It &apos;s all about .
Not anything . But that he thought about it is : &quot; Well , it &apos;s Agost . &quot;
&quot; All my close close to Manhattan are on . &quot;
&quot; You can set up right now . &quot;
And the two weeks in two weeks , and it &apos;s later , every day -- every day -- every day -- the possibility of parcheating where .
The cost of opportunity to diminute the sodle of that we have , when the choice is been except .
And more are the options we have to look at , more caristic caristic , you have to remember as a very , or as a very critical high .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
There &apos;s the living time , and maybe of living .
But the most important point is that any thing that &apos;s almost thing about .
The things that we don &apos;t find a construction that can make a way we can do .
Terzo : You can see the cent growing .
I tried on my pument in my pin the pumb .
I &apos;m almost always jeans .
And one time , I was just a kind of kind , and they were wonderful , and they were saying , and they were saying , only after them a lot of house , just after them a lot of times , they begin to go to go back .
So , I went to buy a new country when I &apos;m going to buy , and I said , &quot; I &apos;m serve a couple of jetry , this is my cut . &quot;
The said , &quot; Li says , &quot; Li says , &quot; Li says , &quot; Li &apos;s fit , and fit ? &quot;
Who says with the name or or or the bottoons ? &quot;
&quot; Let says , &quot; Li ? &quot;
&quot; Some people want to the broken ? Ble bble , &quot; Continually , &quot; Continually ,
I was balordie , and after a little bit of me , I want to say , &quot; I want the kind of -- which was the only one of what was , so for a kind of what I want to try to be able to be able to dead from the best . And then I want to use the best , and then I &apos;m going to have .
It was the myself . I had to get the best .
But I feel feel .
Why ? I write a book for the capable .
And I &apos;m going to stop , I was that with all the sceless is that with all the mistake , the jeans were going to be fect .
And I had expected minime . I won &apos;t expected nothing was just a kind of kind of , when you have a kind of different kind of different , when you have a kind of different kind of a kind of kind of hope .
What I had been buy , but they don &apos;t hope , but I don &apos;t hope .
After the paragoned that I was trying to find what I was trying to confront in confront .
And to add the options of the life does not do that that they can &apos;t expectative .
And this will be less than squation , when the result , when the result of them are good .
No one in the marketing world , if you make it contains .
Because if I knew , if I knew about .
The real hurt of this .
&quot; You was better when you were best when he was best , &quot; The reason for the best when you were better when you were best .
Egone day , in the world where we live -- the world , industrialized citizens with the expection of perfeel -- the myself that we can hope is that the things are in the world &apos;s hope .
You never have surprising the prising of your expectative , and you have expected , you &apos;re ingiant .
The sound of happiness -- what you are here -- it &apos;s : &quot; Basse , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , you want . &quot;
I mean , little little time , I want to say , and I &apos;m really saying , and my wife is really studied .
I won &apos;t have to do , I &apos;m not going to do ,
But it &apos;s not always a butter thing .
And finally , a conseence of jeans of jeans , when there &apos;s just that kind of jeans is that when you &apos;re not saying , when you &apos;re not saying , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot;
The world is the responsible . What could I do you can do you do ?
When there are hundred jeans , and I &apos;m compressing one insodent , and you ask you , and you say , you &apos;re going to slow you to do that .
You could have to do better .
With hundred variety , there &apos;s not the indeed .
So when people are decisions , if the results , if the result is valized , they sentincome and days , they &apos;re going to stop .
In the last years of the last years is explant in the world world .
I think a meant , a meant -- not the only one , but important -- it &apos;s not the only one of depression is that the people have experiences because the other experiences are too much high .
And when they have to explain this situation is their colcolor is their own .
So the final record is that we &apos;re better , we &apos;re better , but we &apos;re going to feet .
Let me remember you .
This is the dogm , what all we all take for good good , and it &apos;s completely full . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no bbio that a little bit of sceless is better than that I don &apos;t have to do that .
There &apos;s a critical value , I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve got surface the surface of the scels that the sceles are our life .
Now , from the view of view , I &apos;ve almost -- I &apos;ve got about the viewer is the name is the following .
What you have to have this scoil in society is the rechallenges of the material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , in which is not that the problem is that they don &apos;t have too .
The problem is that they have too poca little bit .
So the cences of the fallt of the modern is a disease of modern modern , and remarkable to society .
And that does do that , and that &apos;s this : Steve Levitt Levitt Levitt &apos;s talking about how those are about how those are inusual gols . It &apos;s a full or money . It &apos;s one of money .
I mean , that these scoes , complicated and I &apos;m just just just saying , it &apos;s not just inutionary .
I &apos;m going to tell the car .
They do it stage .
If a little bit of what our society is that in our society was reversed in the way where people have too few possibility , not only to be the best of life , not just to be better life to be better .
This is what economists call a best pareties .
One of the redesibution of the redduction ago , not only only to poverty of this scoes that scoes us .
For conclude : &quot; Fly , you can get all the way you want to do &quot;
You , people , you &apos;ll think , &quot; But what does ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s not visual to make null the bock of the glass . &quot;
&quot; She imagine , a vision , a limitated vision , &quot;
and I &apos;m interpretated this , I &apos;ve interpretated , in the beginning .
But then , I think about , I &apos;m going to realive , I &apos;m connected that that that fish is a long time .
Because the fact of the fact that if you get to the franker , in way , in way , &quot; it &apos;s possible . &quot; You can &apos;t be able to your health .
If you take the bock in the way that all of divent divent .
You have to reducted the paralalycle , and you &apos;ll have the wait .
All they need a food .
This is almost too much of course , maybe , maybe in the fish , and sure for us .
But the astraining of some simbulthrow is a remarkable to happiness , and , for rovine .
Thank you very much .
