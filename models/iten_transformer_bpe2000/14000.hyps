The year I showed these slide to show that the cotta glacial glacial glacial glacial glacial , is restream restream , is restream restream restream , is restream restream restream , and it &apos;s restream restream , it &apos;s restream returned to the artage of the arcle glac
So , this is a very obvious gravity of the problem because not shows it &apos;s not showing the ice of the ice .
The artic glacial glacial is , in some sense , the pulsant heart of the global climate of the global climate .
It &apos;s expanded up and you &apos;re totally expected .
The next 25 years , is going to be a carrelated by the last 25 years .
The ice loss are drawn in red .
As you can see , you can see , the blue blue .
That &apos;s the ice in the ice in the winter , which is the test run .
You can see that the cohydrops , five years or more , it &apos;s like the blood , which is five years or the blood , which is five .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been sitting .
This is a problem because the interested in the entire terrible , the entire art-up , where there are enormous amount of carbon congar , which , is , they get transformed in metanches .
Respect to the totality of the atmosphphpherical inquantity , that quantity might radical , surface , supersupersupersuper-rhydrops , supersupersupersuper-run .
In some of a little bit deep in Alaska , the metane is already rebulled from the water .
The Katey Walter Walter Walter of the University of Alaska is a team later , a basis called the inversity .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : The question is well . The question is if we will also be .
A reason is that this term term surgeon surrounded the Greenland from the north .
This is a glacial figures .
The brought was never reached faster .
This is the Kangerlusual Kanglush , in the southern of Groenland .
If you want to know how the level of the sea level of the ice ice to the ice the ice of the ice , here is where the sea .
These corrents are increasing .
Another part of the planet : Antarctars , the biggest block of ice ice ice planet .
The months scientists have died that the ice of ice is in negative , and that the gative Antarctis in negative , and that the Antarctars on some island , which is particularly review , is particularly required in the science .
Equival eye to six feet level of the action of the action .
Sulla Himalaya , the third biggest block , you see new lagues , that few years ago were ice .
40 percent of the world population has been metaphors from the water power of the power of the world .
Sulle Ande : this ice is the source of the water power of the water power of this city .
The brought is aumented .
But when it diminus , the same accept water .
In California , the snow on Sierra is diminuitable .
The hydrops are in the crisis .
The predictions , as you have , they &apos;re gravior .
The growth growth in the world &apos;s door to a notion of the incends .
The environmental disasters are aumenting out of the normal and without previous .
Four times more numerous numerous , for the last 30 years , I read the 75 .
This is a whole thing about all unstainable .
If you look at the context , if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 , 24 hours -- 25 million tons of tons in the ocean .
Look at the U.S. Pacific area , from American area , and on the American parts of the subcontinent , where there is a radical radical impact of obxyges in the oceans .
Most because of the global warming , together to the deforestation , which is the usual combustable .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with the China .
And it was proposed to build a lot of other central central .
But we &apos;re seeing a change .
These are the annarrow in the last few years , and some of a few years , and some of the trained of the trained of the trained of the alternative projects .
And in a way , there &apos;s a political lotta in our country .
The industries of the carbon and oil have spread 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon , which is a hosysimoften .
That picture me remember something --
Servous , in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion paper of carbon the carbon of carbon .
Maybe you saw it up .
This is the second biggest flow in America .
It &apos;s happened to Natal .
The published nature of one of the carbon was this .
Video : ♫ ♫ Fross the carbon is a kind of a type and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it &apos;s growing our economy .
Fross the carbon is always more and more .
It &apos;s good precise , adorable and work , they keep keep the stipendent .
Al Gore : Da is is part of the West Virginia .
The largest society on the mountain is Massey Coal . This is his ministrator .
Video : Don Blankens : Sarked up , Nancy Pelosis , Harry Reid -- not know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Protetion of Clima Protetion of Clima &apos;s ppaid .
This is a part of them .
Video : Attor : Attor we see the climate change as a serious serious change as a serious serious ground of our business .
So , this is invest is invest a great amount of money in a great amount of money in a public force to make public force and confuse the verity .
In fact , the carbon isn &apos;t spores .
We think it &apos;s a good good profound .
So not preoccurateful change .
Let me do .
Video : Carbon -- you have heard -- you &apos;ve heard very .
So , let &apos;s make a town in a structure of a car clear .
Stradaditional machines are a little rumor , but this is the sound of the technology of the carbon the paper of the carbon of the carbon of the paper .
The carbon is between the major cycle crowd , but the notion of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon the clear that you see changes .
You have a look at this : This is the odierny of the carbon .
Al Gore : Inend , the positive alternative alternative , the healthy of the security and the security of security .
Video : My America is in the crisis ; the economy , the economy , the national crisis .
The philoses that the college of all , our dependence from the bustible combusts and oil oil and oil oil .
Now , perhaps there &apos;s a new , audace solution for circne .
Really America : 100 percent of energy , in the 10 years .
A plan to do America to work , make us more sure than safety , and help to stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that basts to solve our problems .
Really America . Scoprite more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It &apos;s a slide energy .
One of the fast faster than to dependence the combusts that kills killed our planet .
She talks about this . I feel , solely , a new new energy .
She &apos;s got two : Noves investment for places of work .
She &apos;s a &quot; Repower America . It &apos;s time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old proverbian old proverbian says , &quot; If you want to go to the slate , you go to the slate , you go to the slate , you go to the slate ,
If you want to go away , you go back . &quot;
We have to go away away , fast .
Thank you very much .
The year at TED fectors a fectors on the LHC .
And I promise to get back to travel about how it works .
So , I did . And for that the other time . And for that the other time , LHC is the biggest experiment , never experiment -- 27 kilometers of circumconference .
And his compiece is to reach the conditions that were present less than a billion second of the universe -- until the beginning of the universe .
And that &apos;s just environment .
This is the car car .
We &apos;re going to pick these mini-Bang Bang in the resifloor .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- is 44 feet and has a 22 feet .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in buildings so you can see the proportions .
The 10 september 10 settember year we have accested the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was because of the immentioned festhetic healthy in the room of control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first phasm that had the whole of LHC , by the LHC , by a part of the LHC , and it &apos;s a part of the LHC , and particles in the resion .
In other words , when we see that picture the 10 secember , we can see that the machine worked , the machine worked , the machine worked , which is a great vitten .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to make us exultate more or this , when somebody went on Google and vide that page was this .
That means we &apos;ve had a cultural impact .
About a week after , there was a problem with the machine , I had to these films here -- these dored dored dored .
These are taking 13,000 lasses when the machine works at the massive machine works in the massive .
Now , the technical technical is going to look at the philoms and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . &quot;
And they can do that because when they &apos;re very cold to be the deal with the conduction .
So , at least 271 degrees , at a temperature inferior to the stand , these phils can take that corrent .
In one of the young novemious magnetic magnetic in LHC , there was a fect of fabric fect .
So the philos square saying , and 13,000 people , and 13,000 ampount of existence , they can have a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is still more impressive if you think that these magnetworks fulled full , and that are several feet of about 30 feet .
They &apos;re damed about 50 magnetworks .
We had to take them , what we did .
We &apos;ve repristinated and travel .
So they &apos;re returning all the subtotally .
Enger the end of the LHC is will be new integrate .
We will happen , and we expected data to play the data or light , and continuing to continue our adventure to discover which is the morning of the morning .
Now , of course , in some of the way , these indebate , these indebate on the value of science and engineering engineering . It &apos;s easy to understand .
I think that the fact that it &apos;s so difficult , the fact of going to be the value of things like LHC .
I &apos;d like to conclude with the words of a Inglese Inglese Davy , which , imagine , the imagine , the imagine , the bael , his basic pulled the bael of the Michael Faray , he said , &quot; Nothing is so much for the progress of human mind that that the ideas of human mind that the ideas of human science as a science that we don &apos;t have to us .
Thank you .
I want to start wonderful to say when , from children , you play , you play to climbs .
While you can get them and they &apos;re going to make them , take them and move them , learning , learned , learning , learned , and you can actually think of space .
The reasoning reason is deeply connected to the way we understand grains part of the world in the world ,
So , from the information of our interaction with our interaction with physics , together at my consult Patts , and my collaborator , and my collaborator , I started asking me , I started to ask me , &quot; And if we use a computer , invent to have the spring of the mouse of the digital wind , we could have a digital information with the wildness of information , we could have a further ,
and we can systems ?
The question was so interesting question that we decided to explore the answer , built the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a whole computer interactive computer .
In a few words , a Siftable is a whole computer interactive computer .
You can move with the hand , they can see , &quot; you can see , &quot; You can see , &quot; you can feel the movement and a radio and a radio .
But surately , they &apos;re physics , as a morning , you can move simply ferrandually fascinating .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipping information .
And as they get more physical , consciousness of the movement , and as as a lot of other , and as we have become more physical , we can explore the movement , we can explore new and different stils and different stils of interaction .
I &apos;m going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configurated to show a video : if you incline in a direction , the video , the video gurated video , if you incline from the other side back back .
These reactive realized are interactive .
If you &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re going to do around .
If they get circumstates , and they can agitself a little bit .
If they get circumstates , and they can agitself a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realize that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power to use of the interaction of the data , to be a liquid color like a liquid color .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurated as a verny of the color in the color in the color in the color in the central , where they &apos;re going to be .
And I can use them to be able to be able to be able to be able .
If we &apos;re going to be too , we can can get a little place .
There are also also a chance to open , as languages , like languages , and games where people can try and logic and logic and see the logic results .
Now , I &apos;m going to be --
This is a Fibonacy sequence of Fibonacy .
Here we have a word of words that is half between Scarabeo and Boble .
Pratically , to every turn out a letter to case on every Siftable , Pratically , Pratically , in every Siftable , and while to be a letter on a letter . And as try to be a control on a dionce .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new sletters of letters and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the children came up to the Media Lab , I did so I did in the way I was trying to do and I turned a video .
They &apos;re very excited .
And one of the interesting things of this application is that not not to give people a lot of education .
You just say , &quot; The words , and they &apos;re exactly exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s some other people who try it .
This is our young flower , there on the right .
In fact , it just wanted to implement .
They were only morning . They were just cut .
Now , this is a application of a whole cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of languages .
It can inserve new characters in the scens , soleving the Siftable .
It can inserve new characters in the scens , soleving the Siftable .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : The sun is source .
David Merriled : Now he brought a treator in the scency .
Video : The arange arancient .
By work !
So schooling Siftable and put neighborhood can interact the characters --
Video : Bau !
And we &apos;re looking at their story .
Video : I &apos;m going to be a !
DM : It &apos;s a story with final final , and it can decide it as you know .
DM : It &apos;s a story with final final , and it can decide it as you know .
Video : Vola on , gave .
DM : The last example I &apos;ve got time to show you is a tool , realized , to wait , to wait and exeguide musical and exeguide music .
It &apos;s a realized instrument , to wait and exeded music .
The Siftable here is against sounds like basis , basically , and the bacteria .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose which is to use .
You can also inserve these sounds in a sequence sequence .
And we modifying it just takes a sound . &quot;
These are effects that you can control from the vive , as the reverse and the filter .
The acks to a particular sound and then incline to the way .
And then there are the effects like time and fly , which is opped to the interest sequence .
Let &apos;s look at how .
Video : We &apos;re going to start to put a base in two Siftable . &quot; sequence , we &apos;re doing systems in a series , we add , we add other base .
Now , I &apos;m going to look at a broken .
Video : Now , I add of the percussions --
Video : And I &apos;m going to put the philomy to the bacteria , so I can control the effect of the view .
Video : I can speak the interest sequence the entire sequence inking the entire sequence the whole sequence of a side or another .
Video : And I &apos;m going to add the philomenon the bottom to get more expression .
Video : DM : I can reach the sequence .
So I don &apos;t have to be able to do the first , but I can try , it makes a longer or the corner .
And now , finally , I can do the whole sequence inters in the left Siftable to the Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is built new man &apos;s building new man always works like our brain and body &apos;s a lot of the brain and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the result of this percoral , and also some possibility we try to take out out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmate is that is coming up this new generation of objects to interacting with the media media , which will will will take information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time to talk to all of you .
I &apos;m a written .
It &apos;s a book is my profession , but it &apos;s more than this , of course .
It &apos;s also the love and the phascine of my life .
And I don &apos;t expect that you can change .
But , said this , something that &apos;s recently successful in my life and my career , who has taken me to recalize the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is I recently wrote this book , this book called &quot; Manda , Prua , Prua , Prua , Ama , &quot; which , a few reason my floor , for some reason , for some reason , for some reason in the world and become a great sensitive , besty besespecially , book , bespecially book , and it was a great sensitive ,
And the result is that everybody &apos;s going to get people on me as if I were condanned .
Davoid -- condanned , condanned !
They &apos;re going to be worried and they say , &quot; Don &apos;t you have to do better ?
You don &apos;t have to get to write for all of life without being able to be able to make a book that can &apos;t be able to somebody &apos;t be able to somebody ? &quot;
What can you know ? &quot;
It &apos;s rassure , you know .
But it might be worse , I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I was to say to people -- I was a cool adolescent -- I wanted to be a written .
And I was in the same reaction from the pure .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t themselves , &quot; I don &apos;t have succeed ?
Don &apos;t you fear that the kills of the kills ?
You don &apos;t have to do this must do this all of life without the whole life without the slements that you have to die on a cumulo of all the infrant with the fallowing clean of fallowing ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yeah , I have a couple of all things .
I &apos;ve always had a couple .
And I also have a lot of other things that people can &apos;t have to be .
As the algap and other things .
But , how much about the write what I thought I was and I was crazy , I &apos;m saying is why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logic that anybody has been expected to be spavor from a work that you feel like to do .
But what &apos;s so particular in the creative creative creative creative to make us nervous health , as a way that other carried can &apos;t do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and not recorse of a sune in his 40 years of activity in his 40 years of activity in the way to be engage ?
There was never -- that block of engineer engineer John , how ?
Don &apos;t that work so , you know ?
Only , the engineers like group , they have not certain , in the centuries , drop the reputation of being colized manizated .
We have enough this reputation , we have enough this reputation , but creative of every gender , we have this reputation of being an instable memered .
And not rest other people who are going to look at the conteach of the magnific ments , just in the 20th century , they died , they died , they died ,
And even the ones that are not sickly , they &apos;re not saying from their dons .
Norman Mailer , before we die , in the last interview , in the last whole book has killed me a little bit more . &quot; A very much more . &quot; A extraordinary retural about the work of their life .
But we don &apos;t bad when we heard of this because we heard these things so long that we &apos;ve been interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and the sofference are in some way , and the art , the end will , the end will always be in some way , and you know , the end .
And the question I want to do all of today is : are you agree with this idea ?
It &apos;s going to you to be able to be a floor of a distance , it &apos;s not good for anything to do is not good for anything .
I think it &apos;s odiosa .
And I think it &apos;s also pericolosa and I don &apos;t want to see the perpetuate in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to get our great minds of living in our great creative .
And I &apos;m sure that , in my case -- in my situation -- would be very dangered to get to the surprised of the suppositions , surately surattens to the circumstances in which I &apos;m in my careful .
That &apos;s really -- I &apos;m a very young young , I &apos;ve got about 40 years .
I have still about four decades in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything about the time , and then it will be juded by the world as the work that was used after the success of my book .
I &apos;m going to be slavery , because we all have more friends here -- is probable that my biggest success is to my house .
Oh , Gesus , which they thought !
You know , this is the gender of thinking that that &apos;s a person to start to get a person to start to the nine of the morning and I don &apos;t want to do that .
I &apos;d like to do this work we &apos;re going to do this work .
So , the question is , how ?
And so it seems , after a lot of reflections , which is to be to write is to create a psychological costricks , OK ?
I have a few way I have a safety of safety between me , and my natural , and my natural natural , and my natural , I was trying to do this . And as I was trying to do this year , I was trying to look through the time , trying to see if they could have been looking for the best ides and more sances and more several ides and more sane and more severely sancies and more severly and more severly ,
to how to help people creative to report the inerent risks of the creative risks of creative creative .
And that research me to the ancient Great and ancient Roma .
Seguitems because I gave up in the circumstums .
In the ancient Great and ancient Roma -- people didn &apos;t look that the creativity was in the man , OK ?
It thought it was this creativity was this spirit of divine and that if you men from a few several slightly several surgery and knows , for distant and healthy .
The degrees called these divines of the creativity of the creativity .
Soowonderful , credeep to have a demone that elargiven from the lots of slate .
The Roman were of the same idea , but they called that sort of a kind of genius .
The Romans who were not really smart , because Romans didn &apos;t really think a particular person was a particular particular .
They have a genius was this kind of dine , which is a whole whole thing that has been living in the murs of a artist , a little bit like the ellow phror , and that if you &apos;re out of a Dobby , and that was out of the work of the artist of the artist of the work .
Here &apos;s a major -- here is , that &apos;s the distance of which is the distance of the psychological costruth that protected you from your work .
And they all knew that was so that it worked , right ?
So the anticient artists were protected by certain things , as the way , as the way , not ?
If your work was excited to work , you can &apos;t take it all the market , everybody knew that would have been helped by this genius .
If your fallip , it wasn &apos;t all the basic work , right ?
They all knew that was your genius to be a incapable .
And so people concept the creativity in Occident Occident for a long time .
And then the Renascient Renasn n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n the universe , and without the mistakes and without more and without more to the creatures of the divinity .
This was the maintains of human human human human human human human human human beings were completely by the sharing .
And for the first time in story , you start to referring to this or the artist of a rather kind of a rather person with a kind of genius .
And I have to say that was a big herror .
I think we can lose someone , simple person to believe that I &apos;m like a fun , the essence and the source of all the mistakes , creative , creative , creative , creative , creative , and the responsibility to the basic philomy of human beings .
It &apos;s like to give somebody to give a sun .
Deapappears and creates all of these engaged expectations .
And I think it was this pression to destroyed artists in the past 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think it &apos;s , and I think it &apos;s a question , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe to get back to a surprising commercial of human relationship between human and mystery .
or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t cell 500 years of thinking about a rational talk about 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience that solither suspects about the scientific , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , they &apos;re going to be square ,
I &apos;m not not going to have you all about this .
But the question I &apos;d like to take is -- why not ?
Why don &apos;t I think that ?
Because it has more sense of every other thing that has ever heard to explain the exasperant exasperant exasperant process .
A process that , as anybody ever ever ever ever ever as a thing -- so , you know , all of the fundamentally , you know , you don &apos;t have a rational rational .
And in fact , it can sometimes seem completely paranormal .
I did this meet recently with the extraordinary poetc strake She was now 90 years , but it was a poetched poetry for all of life and said that it was in the Virginia , working out in the camps , and he heard , in the fields , and I heard , when a few , when a few waiting was a poetry .
He said that it was like a fragorous trained .
And that was rolling to her from the landscape .
It was going to be , because it was a tremendous under the land under the land under the land .
He knew to have a solar thing to do to that point and it was , words , &quot; corring how a mathemselves . &quot;
And so it turns out to home and it was introduced by this poem , and it wouldn &apos;t have to take a piece of card and a fast matter , as the trape , and a fast , and it &apos;s a page .
And then , sometimes I couldn &apos;t be fast , so correverded and corrups and corrupted out and the poem roll through the house and she will continued to roll through the countries , trying to get a poor , trying to get a poor , trying to be a poor .
Then there were the piece -- this piece of the next next -- there were never -- there were a moment where the almost lost , OK ?
So , he was run up and he was trying to the card and poetry and the poetry was going through , and he was going to be a mathemselves in the past , and then he said , that it was like the other hand the hand the hand the hand the hand was offer .
It was taking the poem of the tail and he was put in his body and the page was going to pay .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the page and intouched , but the last word before .
So when I heard it -- it &apos;s putting it , it &apos;s exactly the same thing .
Not everything is not a conducture . I &apos;m not a conducture .
I &apos;m a move , and my way to work is ; I &apos;m wake up to the same horarious and to work and spend it .
But even I , in my testardaggine , I &apos;ve striet I &apos;ve been a way .
And I can also imagine that many of you ,
You know , even if the work and ideas were saying from a certain both certain both , I can &apos;t know that .
What is this ?
And how can we relationship us to do that not to do us to lose the head , but , rather , rather , which do you do you ?
And as I look at the best example , the best example I have is the music example I have is the music , which I &apos;ve interview of a nal days .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of the life was the incarried of the artist of the artist of the artist of the artist of life , trying to be , to deal , to deal , to deal , these species of creative impulse .
But then he was wondered , and a day as he was driving on a Los Angeles , changed everything to him .
He was wonderful and all of a sent wently this little broken , which is wonderful wonderful , elusive and the rest of the head , and the respected , and the residential , and the desidentire , but not knowing how to take it .
It &apos;s not a piece of card , it has not a mathemselves .
So , he began to feel this species of old old anxion , &quot; the site to lossessionate , and I &apos;ll remarried by this song , and I &apos;ll remarried by this song .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And he was going to go into the panic , he stops .
I &apos;m going to be the whole process and did something new .
And I &apos;m just going to just the sky and said , &quot; Scause , not see that I &apos;m not seeing ? &quot;
&quot; You know , you know , you know ?
If you really want to exist , you get back to a more spoints when I can take care of you .
All you go to importantly .
You &apos;ve got to be Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his process worked changed after this .
Not work , the work was still hoscure as .
But the process , and the anxized fish that was remarkable when the genius , the genius , the genius that was going to be able to the other problems and liberked back to where they were realize that they didn &apos;t have to be a whole thing about the whole thing was interested and to be a whole thing that was reminded and remined .
But it was a peculiar , wonderful bizarre , a conversation between Tom and this thing that &apos;s not not Tom .
So how much I feel that story to change a little bit the way I worked , and already saved me a time .
This idea , I saved when I was writing &quot; Many , Prua , Ama , and the car in one of the save of the deperation of the disperation in something and we &apos;re not going to think that it will be a disaster , that what &apos;s going to be a disaster , which the worse is going to be a disaster .
Not only book , just the worse book .
And I started thinking about this project .
But then I remember Tom who talked to the air and I tried us .
So I went to my face in the hoscritish and drawings to a hangle of the room .
And I said to the vocoice , &quot; Sent , what , is , what we &apos;re going to be brilliant not be brilliant not interested in my , no matter ?
Because as I &apos;m seeing us all I &apos;m not going to do that .
So if you want to be better , you have to presented you and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , I don &apos;t do it , you know , I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;ll start write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to favor that was recorded to me to do my part of &quot; because of the end is , OK -- at the end is , OK -- in the world of the North Africa in the North Africa was going to be a lots of lots , damage and music saving and until the damage .
And they were always magnific , because the balleres were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every a very , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists would be actually transcending .
And I know what I &apos;m going to talk , because I know you &apos;ve all vision , a performance .
It was like the time , and it was saving , and the walking walking through a special species of a portal special , as 1,000 nights before , but all you &apos;ve been ineased .
And I &apos;m not not just appeared as a human .
But it happened by the didrive in the fire of the fire of the divinity .
And when this was going to be , the time , people know what was , they were called it with his name .
They were working , and they were starting to song , &quot; Allah , &quot; Allah , God , God , God , God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curiosa night -- when the Morical invassud the Spain , took this habits with them and the pronounce of the Spain , Allah , Allah , Allah , &quot; to , the word , &quot; OOOOf , the boole , &quot; which you can feel in the flamency in flamency .
In Spain , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , the bah , the way , the basic , I &apos;m going to be , except , except -- a God wish of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need .
But , the problem is coming up , the next day , the backwards , when you see and the swake up and discovery that are the 11 of the Martedtedutes of the Martedtedge , there &apos;s no longer .
It &apos;s just a mortal with a mal graph with the ginocky , and maybe not going to be able to the tree .
And maybe no one will be the name of God while I &apos;m going to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s difficult .
This is one of the most sweet sweet to make a creative life .
But maybe not to be so corosciant if you can &apos;t believe , you can &apos;t believe , anzy-s-care , which extraordinary extraordinary extraordinary expected .
But created that that you &apos;re just going to have a full of this squish indeed by a squish of your life that you have to be .
And , you know , if we think about this way .
And so I started thinking , and it &apos;s sure , and it &apos;s sure as I thought I was thinking for different months in the book that I &apos;m going to do , the performance , the dangerous , exactly , we expect the success .
And what I have to say when I feel like , I fear , I fear that is not not .
Not wait . It just your work .
It &apos;s going to presenting you for your part , whatever you can be .
If your work is balling , balling .
If the divine , absolutely assigned you to leave some kind of a wonderful kind of wonderful wonderful , then you can just through your fors , then , &quot; ! &quot;
All you do , you do that your dance .
And &quot; Oh ! &quot;
I believe that , I think you have to teach it .
&quot; You know , &quot; to you , even just for the same , even for the human human and test tal tape taps from the tal tal tal to be continuously .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Good !
You know , I &apos;ve already talked about some of these projects on human genome , what can meaning and discovery new set of genes .
We &apos;re now starting a new perspective : we &apos;re beginning to digitalize biology and now to talk about that code we &apos;re entrating in a new phase of biology , designing and synthesizing life .
We &apos;ve always been trying to do great questions .
&quot; What is the life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists I think they &apos;re tented to understand various various livels .
We &apos;ve tried to make a lot of the minimal minimes .
We &apos;re drawing up from almost 20 years .
When we sequency was a human genome , was a lot of the world &apos;s biology in the world world &apos;s digital of the computer biology .
Now , we can we regenerate life , or create new life from this universe of this universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species of the genoma smaller between the smaller genoma .
And we tried to reduce the genome for the genome for creating one again .
We &apos;re able to eliminate a hundred of genes about 500 that are here .
But when we look at her map in metabolic , it is simple relatively simple respect to our .
Cret , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes we can eliminate , one at the time , it &apos;s very imviliable that this can take to a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to design was synthesize this chromosomous chromosomous components to make some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the avventure of the &quot; Pan , we can synthesize a crazy ? &quot;
It can chemistry to produce these great molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create before ?
And in case , we can make a crazy ?
A chromosomosome is just a piece of chemical material .
The speaking we we &apos;re able to digitalize life is growing up to the exponential exponential .
Our capacity to write the genetic code , instead , instead , but it &apos;s pretty slowly , but it &apos;s improving .
And our most recent returned the brought to a exponential curve .
We &apos;ve been beginning more than 15 years ago .
The process has been required , began with a bioetical review before we began to begin the first experiments .
But we found that DNA is very difficult .
There &apos;s decake up of thousands of car machines in the world that they produce of DNA , the long-letters of 30 to 50 letters and it &apos;s a degenerative process , the segment is .
So we had to develop a new method to assembly these fragments and correct the errors .
And this was our first tentative , to talk about the digital information of the Phi 174 .
It &apos;s a small virus that kills .
We designed the fragments , effectured the correction of the errors and get a molecule of DNA lot of DNA .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of this chemical material chemical material , and we &apos;ve inserious material , the bacteria have started to read this genetic code and producing the particles .
The viral particles are refed by the cells , they &apos;re going back and they have destroy to the E.
I &apos;ve talked about recent with the members of the oil industry was saying them that they have certainly compress this model .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build his same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the biggest things .
We wanted to build the whole chromosomous chromosomous .
They &apos;re more than 580 mountain of genetic code .
So we thought we build it in the casses of the virus of the virus , so that we can change the casses are components of a living cell .
The design is critical information , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be accurate .
When we sequency this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accuratean herror for every 10 mile based .
We &apos;ve found out , 30 errors . If we had this original sequence , if we &apos;ve been used that sequence we &apos;ve ever been able to do that .
One part of the process is designing switching 50 letters that they &apos;re going to be a little bit of 50 letters to build sounds 50 letters to build sounds together .
We can see it up here .
You &apos;ve probably read that we &apos;re inserious .
Think about that : we have a genetic code on four letters : As , C , and T.
Three those letters together , and there &apos;s a specific minacids , and there &apos;s a specific order to every love to every love .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , spend , spend .
What we &apos;ve been doing is autographs .
Some have been delusually from the fact that it &apos;s not a few .
We designed these segments to simply help them just ununit with the entire .
There &apos;s full them , they &apos;re saying them .
And we started to assembly , starting with a five seven from five to seven a letters of a letters of 24 ments , unclear letters to get to them to get 7,000 letters .
At every step , we have produced these segments in abundance , so we can sequency them to create a very robustot process -- as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems the tabellone play-broket play-.
When we go to these very long segment segment , more than 100 midle , they will not grow more directly in the E.
It &apos;s turned to the limit of modern biology .
So we &apos;ve considered other mechanisms .
We knew another mechanism called the Rombination called the Romomomology , which in biology is to repair the DNA can can see the segments .
Here &apos;s a example .
This is organism , called Deinoccurs , it can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be .
You can see in the square requare as his crazy cromoss .
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassemen as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can do completely .
They can live under the way .
They &apos;re absolutely sure that life in the space , and you can find new environment of water .
Actually , NASA showed that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule we &apos;ve built these processed processed , just using the learning of the appropriate design segment .
The lievening them to automatically .
This picture was not taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a very big molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that takes a period of about six seconds .
This is the published we did a little time ago .
They &apos;re more than 580,000 letters of code code .
It &apos;s the biggest molecule of a defined structure of the man .
It &apos;s a molecular fish to 300 million .
If we &apos;re going to be a career 10 without spaces , they would want to get this genetic code .
Now , how do we do that ?
Obviously , you know , you know , a little girls .
It &apos;s a little more complicated when they use batters .
It &apos;s simple when it &apos;s a cell of the eucariots like our : you can just extract the nucleo and inserious process , and you can just have a clonely clear process .
In the bacteria , the cromosomous is instead of the cell , but we &apos;ve just been inside the cell , but we &apos;ve just demonstrated that we &apos;re able to do a complete cell from one cell of a cell cell from one cell and activity it .
We can get a crazy of a microbial species .
The two are different things are founded by the tops .
We &apos;ve added some gene in a way to decide that to chromosomous for this chromosomous .
The one has then full with the entire such a way to killing all the proteins .
And when we put in the cells was study was study -- and open our graphics -- the new chromosomosoma -- the new chomosomosoma .
And we began to be able to go over , but we &apos;ve tried to be , but we &apos;ve tried to spusers .
This is one of the most mecchanisms of evolution .
We found that a very very special species have added a second or a third or a third of a few part , address in a second thousand of the species of new new ones of the species .
So who are thinking about evolution as a gene gene at time , it &apos;s not not understood of the biology .
There is a full of the entire fun called the full of the DNA .
The cromosome that was in the cell of it didn &apos;t have a cell .
The cell phones that we have inserito--cell phones that we have a .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other chromosoma material material as a material material , and we &apos;ve got up with just cell the new cell and the new chromosoma .
it &apos;s become blue because of the genes we &apos;ve inserious .
And in a short lass of time , all the characteristics of a species are going to be losed in a new species , based on the new software we inseriously in the cell .
All the proteins are changed , members are changed , and when we law the genetic code code , and when we &apos;re going to get .
Now , this might look like genetic alchemy , but altering the software DNA software . We can change things in a lot of sushing .
Now , I &apos;ve already explosed that here is not talking about a few million years old , but I &apos;ve been doing for three million years and a half years old , and I &apos;ve already said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the Cambodies that are going to be a new species of this process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s enough when we think about our necessity .
We &apos;re going to pass six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to give you an example : I &apos;m born in 1946 .
Now there &apos;s three people on the planet for each existing in 1946 , in 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re having problems now , and it &apos;s fresh water , fresh water and pulity for six billion people and a half billion people .
It &apos;s still going to be more dare to do that for nine billion .
We &apos;re going to be more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion barrasses .
That means millions of barili a day .
When we try to find process processes , or any kind of process to replaces , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to have a more construction of CO2 from these materials that &apos;s actually enters in the atmosphere .
At the day today , thanks to the scientific discoveries in all the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that they &apos;re going to think that they &apos;re going to think that are the designed for the future .
The electronic industry just a dozen dozen about components , and think about how many different things are come out .
Our limits here are mainly by biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , thank you very quickly , able to create what we call genomic genomic genomic .
We &apos;re able to build a robot that can produce a robot that can produce a million crobot .
Think about this 20 million genes or try to get a different genes or try to get the processes to make the process to producing the process to producing , new vaccines , we can change , thank you to a small team , and create more biology , and create more biology , and we can make a small of science .
And it &apos;s just a standards .
We can choose for possibility of survival , and production , chemistry or carburn , production of vaccines .
This is a few software of some software programmed on we &apos;re working for being able to seem and design species on the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how they &apos;re going to be .
We know , exactly what they &apos;re exactly their genetic code .
Now we &apos;re focus on the carburant of how quarter generation .
You &apos;ve also seen you extract from the grain was a very very very , it was a very finished experiment .
We have a second second and third generation that will use enough to be prove enough to the carburant carburant , as a different types of butanol .
But the only way that biology can have a great impact without increasing a great impact , and we can limited the cost of food and limited the CO2 in mathery before we &apos;re working to design cells can make this cell cells can make this cell , and we think of the early , and we think of this scaling , and we think of the early 18 months .
The solar solar combined with CO2 is a downwners -- but in our discoveries in the world , we found different metods .
This is a organism we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
It &apos;s going to be in the ocean , about 2500 feet of depth of the water .
It &apos;s put from CO2 using idrogen by CO2 as a lot of energy .
We &apos;re trying to figure out if we can incancer CO2 , which can be transported through your books , convertising that CO2 in carburn , to drive this process .
So we think we can think we can be able to be able to increase what the question of basis , which is the question of &quot; is the life is Noil dest , we have the dest dest of replaced to replacing the whole industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do that TED , where can you do ?
It would be a main the main of energy .
And we &apos;re working for using the same methods to create vaccines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with influence , we &apos;re always forward to a year and a dollar in a year , and in a dollar .
I think that what you can change is build vaccines in anticipated .
So , here &apos;s how the future could start changing , now , the tree of evolution , accellerating evolution with the synthetic evolution , and finally , under the eucarian , and finally cells .
We &apos;re going to be so from the improvide .
Our purpose is to make a way to live enough to try to make cell . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the most of the most fundamental work , some fundamental work , which we &apos;ve brought to a year ago ago ago , a year ago ago . This is Seadon . This is Seadon .
It &apos;s a environment where you can interact is to the local level that remoon with a enormous data .
Here we &apos;re seeing a lot of digital gabyte of digital picture with a kind of a kind of squick , and a bread , to a bread the images of how we want .
And not matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these colracy of data or images .
Mosectricks are common photographs , but this is a provide scanning from the Bible of Congress , and reentrepreneurs in the gamma of the Congress , and reentrepreneurs .
It doesn &apos;t do any difference because the only thing that limits the prestakes a system like this is the number of a system on your screen in any moment . It &apos;s also an architecture .
This is a book , example of data not .
This is the Casolate of Dickens . Every colonny is a capital .
So to show you that this is just a text and not images , we can do a thing , to see , to see that it &apos;s a real representation of the heads of the head , not a picture .
It could be a way to read a little artificial to read a book .
It &apos;s not to be considered .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s a number of the Guardian .
Every big picture is the beginning of a seed-up .
And it really gives you the pleasure and beauty experience the version of a review of a date or a lot of drawing , which is for nature a lot of a few days .
We also did something with the corner of this number of this particular number of the Guardian .
We created a fasull of the along solutic solutic -- much more than that is usually usually in a public normal contained .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
or even specific pattern , or even specific .
And this really shows some of these ideas to do to do the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that this means to get pop-up and other downwners to other door cheries , they don &apos;t have to be necessary .
In fact , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say we have contributes to dare also in this camp .
These are all the streets in the USA Sovrappost-SA picture of the NASA .
So now we go to what else .
This is actually actually actually from the Web ; you can go to the website .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which is two different technologies .
A is a Seadon and the other is a visual research in the computer very interesting computer from Noah Snavely , a student of the University of the U.S. , with the U.S.
And it &apos;s from the Web , gesters from Seadon .
You can see that when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from a picture of another and have this kind of experience , and have this kind of experience solution .
But the location of the images here has actually a meaning .
The size of the computer visualization of computers have recorded these images together , so that they corresponse to the regions of the real place where the imaging of the world -- all the neighbors of the Montags Rocky Montne Rockcial Montne . You &apos;re taking . Here you see a slide of a slide broads , and these things are all the college .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more space .
I want to past directly to one of the original data set of Noahahotosynth , and this is a prototype of Photosynth Photosynth , showing you what the first time , to show you what I really think is the key , the key technology , Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily website .
We had to worry about the legal expect and so on .
This is a reconstruction of Noth-Damamamazing Cathrow from Flickr . Bauckr Din Flickr and you get images of a types in magnews , other fields and drowning . Each one of these fields and drowning . Each one of these connections that you have been discovered by this model .
So I &apos;m all images from Flickr and they &apos;re all all college to the level of space in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to have this simplicism .
You know , I &apos;d never thought I &apos;d never thought I &apos;d like to work for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifying this kind of account here .
I think you can can see that this is a lot of different types of different types of the cellular cellular cellular cellular graduate , a number meaning , in this environment .
And if I can , I try try to try to try to look for those more strange .
Many are block , except .
Sometimes you have a series of photographs -- except .
This is a Nothter poster of Nothers .
We can spend the poster to the physical vision of this environment .
The essential point is we can do with social environment . This is taking data from the whole memory of how to applies the Earth , from the view of vision -- and college . They all those data together .
All those pictures become college together , most of the parts .
You have a model of the earth of the earth of the earth .
Think about this as a prolgment of Stephen Lawler Lawler on Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity , and that people use it , and the people who are usually , and the vantages to use it .
They &apos;re married with metadherself ,
If you someone is the idea of contrast to all these saying , my picture of the name , my picture of Noth-run care of the Noth-run , and the can use of all those data , and the can use of the way of introducing , and I can have a picture of them , and have a picture of them , and have a picture of them from the crazy and to have a crazy chososs .
In fact , a consequence of all are virtual virtual virtual extremely elaborated in the earth , not only only as a vistand from satellitarious memory and slots , but from the memory memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What your software is going to contain us to do is that , in the next few years , all the next years , all the photographs of all the world will be practical to be practical .
BA : Yeah . That &apos;s what it &apos;s doing is going to practical .
It &apos;s creating the hyperlink , if you want , you want , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the contains .
The thing is very interesting is if you think about the recognize of the simple information of the simple information that many of these images .
As when you do a research of images on the Web , it &apos;s a sentence and the page of the page of pictures .
Now , what happens if that picture up to all your picture ?
So the amount of the interconnection and quantity and quantity quantity that &apos;s really huge is really enormous . It &apos;s a classical classical classical classical .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible .
BA : You &apos;re very much .
One of the main the major of the main , and one of the research of the research is the power of the power of the research , in the past of the traditions , in the wind , the past in the midle , the past of the flowing of the flowing of the flowers .
Basts thinking that sciamans Jaguar vious Via Lattea , or that the Lattea , or that the mites of the Inuit &apos;s still still still meaning , or that in Himalaya , or that in Himalaya , to remember the importance of the central central of the central central central central central , but only is just a sense of a sense , but it &apos;s just a model of reality , but it &apos;s just a sense of a model , but it &apos;s just a central realm ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stirt stirles that our stirt stirles , a lot of generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential .
We all all all we do . We all project .
We &apos;re subjects in the time .
We have to dead the inesorability of death , so we don &apos;t take us to stand ,
We all have a lot of art .
What the color is the particular is the particular run is the particular song , the dance of the dance of every culture .
Not matter that they &apos;re the Than forests of the Borneo , or the following Voodoo of Haiti , or the Curander &apos;s Kenya settler in Kenya settler , or a camelas , or a mellier in the Sahara .
He was my own journey in the desert of a month ago , or a month ago , or a month ago , in the Everest values , the den Everest , the mother of the world .
All of these people teaching us that there are other ways of exists to have other ways of thinking , other ways of dies in the world .
And , if you have a active thing that can give you a hope that can give you hope .
And in the cultures of cultures of the world creating a spiritual life , and cultural life that has the planet and cultural benefit &apos;s important to the planet as a biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural girl as a cultural nosphere and you can definitely defined the nosphere , the whole broken , ideas , ideas , inspiration , ideas , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions of human imagination from the human imagination from the human imagination .
The ethnosphere is the fantastic patriage of human human .
It &apos;s the symbrown of what we can be in how inquish inquish .
And as the biosphere was very much flowed by the ethnosphere is success and too much much more quickly .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all the species of all the species of all the species of the extinct of the simply , or -- in the most apocalycle -- in the most open of the biological biological countries -- and you don &apos;t have to be neipowerful hypothemselves -- that of the different cultural cultural cultural diversity .
The injected all is , of course , the lost language .
When you &apos;re born , they were were 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just a composed by a vocabolar or a series of rules .
A language is the sprake of human spirit .
It &apos;s the midle with the animation of every culture is actually in the material world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a bind , a bin-like , a spensive , an ecosystem .
And the 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re sitting at Monterey , at least the half of the children .
They don &apos;t come to the children , which is not to say , not not to the kids , not not weld something , they &apos;re already dead .
What &apos;s more trists of being fly from the silence , of being the last one , to be the last to talk about a language , not have a way to be able to be able to be the wisdom of the children ?
This is , I &apos;ve been a few weeks in some of the world every two weeks : every two weeks a weeks , and a door with the tomba , and a lingua language .
And I know someone will say , &quot; In &apos;t that ?
The world would not be a better place if we all the same language ? &quot; Benish , then we all talk all the same linguba . We all talk about the cancer .
Let &apos;s talk about the kogi .
You &apos;ll take a tract thing you want to say not to talk about their language .
Today I &apos;d like to do a journey through the nosphere .
a small journey in the etnosphere to give you a lot of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us of us forward that when I say , &quot; different ways of existing , &quot; I really mean ,
We take for example this bimfood Barasan , in Amazon , the population of the anaconda , which crew to the U.S. , crede to try of the latest latest west sacrates of the latest sacrate .
It &apos;s a population that &apos;s not able to distinguished the blue color because the birth color is identified in the forest , which is identified in the forest , which is the population .
They have a language and a mathemselves , called &quot; The language , &quot; exacamia , &quot; You have to site a person that park language a different person that park language .
And that &apos;s all radical past in the mythological past , and the particular families that are in these families , or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven or language .
They can limited to hear and then they start talking .
Let &apos;s take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived , the Waoran of Ecuador , a incredible population , a incredible population of the first contatts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionary , they &apos;ve been a very commiterror .
They &apos;ve been taken from the photographs that they retraditional and they &apos;ve got them in positive , dimentation that this population of the forest pluvial forests .
They have been colracy , they &apos;ve got the research of a shape or a shape , they have no matter , they have concluses that they were a dioxide , and they killed the five missing .
But Waoran don &apos;t just killed the straniests .
They killed on their own .
54 percent of the mortality was cause .
We &apos;re slowed to eight generations and we found two deaths of natural morning and when we &apos;ve insisted to know , they &apos;ve got that one of them was invecting that is dead , and then they killed it .
The People were able to recognize the urina from 40 step and recognize the species .
In the early 1980s , I was assigned a very interesting compared when my professor of Harvard was asked to Harvard to intrained in the bottom of Duvalier and Tonton Macton , and the Tonton Macton Macton Macton Macton Macton the wait .
And to give a sense of the Vodoun , I should take the Vodoun culture . And that the Voodoo is not magic .
It &apos;s pretty much more than a physical vision of the world .
Many interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the big religions of the world , what you would be ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , except .
A continent is always left out , thinking that Africa &apos;s un-Saarian is not religious feeling . And instead , and the Voodoo is not the distilled of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious concepts .
What makes the voodoo is the intense is the intense between life and death .
So the view they &apos;re going to get the spirits .
The spirits can be invocated by Grande Aqua , response to the rhydrops and they can replace temporary to the animation of the vive anima way that for a short of the way we would be the followed .
So , this is the voodooists say , &quot; You can go to talk about God .
We &apos;re going to dancient and we become God .
And from the moment you &apos;re going to you , is the spirit you , how can you do you do the main that ?
So you can look at these incredible events : followed voodoo in the state of the trance of the point-touched dimonstring a rather force of the power of the power of the mind of the power of the mind of the power of the mind of the power of the mind of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of mind .
The people with the people who I lived the most extraordinary people are the Kogi of Siar Nevada Siar Marta , in Colombia , in Colombia .
It &apos;s taking the civilization that a time live on the carbly carries of Colombia in the Colombia , the population of the Colombia , the population of crazy vultimate that has been herself on the planure of carbic carbicy-cle planture .
In a drug continent , this population is not conquired by the spagners .
And in fact , I &apos;m government by a closer , but their formation is really extraordinary .
The young people are taking up from the families to three or four years , and they live in a world world of good and they live in a world of good and bombs in a bombs of the ice for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years , in the country of the nine months of gestation that turn into the mother of the gestation of the mother , now are metaphor , now are metaphor .
So , so this time , they &apos;re acculated to the values of their society , values that their precise and only their precise equilibrium -- or for the cosmic equilibrium -- or for the balance equilibrium .
At the most of this incredible initible initiation , they &apos;re improvide out and the first time in their age , at age 18 years , see a high halba . And in that activity of the first best , when the sold of the first best values , everything that have learned in theory is conference all the properly . The precise is conster .
&quot; Do you ? Proprize how I said .
It &apos;s just a look at you protect it .
They &apos;re called the most people and say that we say , frackers , frackers , we are the bevolution of the world .
This is extremely important level is extremely important .
When we think of the Indigene and environment , we invochieve Reu and the old story of the old story of the notion of the notion of the notion of the Earth , or maybe we can see that these populations are more closer to the Earth of us .
The Indigenes are not not unsentimate sentims from the nostaly .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the Paludiaric vents of Aphasian elids of the Tibet , but thanks to the Earth , they created a mistic mystic war &apos;t the concept of the Earth &apos;s based on a hydrops , but the concept that the Earth can only live from the consciousness of human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
It &apos;s going to be a girl who &apos;s growing up with the Montants of the world is a spirit of Apu that is going to be a depth of human human . And it will be a foundly different , and will have a full of the montages of the Montana who growing a Montana who growth is growing that a mountain a Montana of the mountain .
That &apos;s the dimour of a spirit or a mineral cent is irric .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia cred-up , creating that forests serve forests to be cut .
That has been a human being different human from my friends from my friends Kwakiutl that credimes are the dimour of Hukuk and the song of the paradies and the dog cannot in the north of the world , spirits that we live in the Hamadies of the Hamath of the Hamatef of the Hamatef .
If you start to consider that these cultures can actually make different reality , you can start to understand some of them , you can start to understand some of them . We can do this plants .
I &apos;ve taken this picture to the Amazon ,
Mayahuash , I &apos;ve heard of the Eahuash , the most powerful psychoices of the repertorium .
What it makes the Eahuash is not the drug is not the drug of sushing , but his elements . It &apos;s composed by two elements .
From a late , this lian lian ly-carbs that contains a series of the harmine , harmine and harmine , literally read .
Phoods the solar plants , it &apos;s a blueasn that alterms a little bit of the consciousness , but it &apos;s mysceled with the floor of the family of the caffected of the caffected of the caffected of the Caffy .
This is a thowner , very similar , very similar to the serotonin the serotonin the dioxyltricyltricyltricyltricyltricyltricypes .
If you never see the Yanomami to the Yanomami , the sushing that they do from a different species , it &apos;s contained methoxyltricks .
Tiring that policy for the nose is a little bit like being spared by a figure fucies of the diption of the dipaling and lots of electricity .
I &apos;d have often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who wrote was psychedelical discovered the fungi of the fungs in the &apos; 30 Mexico .
And the tamp , you can &apos;t classifly these triptams like alucinogens because if you &apos;re not going to tell anybody .
It &apos;s possible to be able if you under the other chemicals who money with other chemicals who money money to the MAO .
Now , it &apos;s the beauty : the carbs that are inibully inibitors are inibitors of the MAO , the same kind of necessary , the same thing that is the sprint . The source of flowed , in a 80,000 species of plants , like these people find a way , but if you have a real way , but if you believe a real real way , but if you believe a real way , they believe a real real way , but if you believe a way ,
We use the great euphemism of the herror , which can can revealing infruck .
But if we ask the Indians , they will say , &quot; The plants are talking about .
What does that mean ?
This tribes , Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuge , who distinguished in the forest , and that the Eastern will reentrery in the same species .
If we ask them how they stabilises their tasonomy will tell us , &quot; I thought , &quot; I didn &apos;t know ? &quot;
The solution is : you get 17 variety in a night of lots and each cannot have a different tone .
With this is not laureduced to Harvard , but it &apos;s very interesting to contate the stami .
Now , in fact , the problem is that also the problem is that the problem of us who have the cuor people find them are putting them are paths , but in some way to the history of the history of the history of the story , and the past of the world , and the past .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , not will be remember for his drive innovations or innovations , but rather as we stopped as we stops and we &apos;ve been broken actively or the deal of the surrounded of the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All the cultures are involved in a dance for new possibilities of life .
And the problem is not the technology .
The Indians Sioux , they don &apos;t have to be Sioux when they have been part of the arrow up and flowed as as American have not have been American , when they have been in the horse and hot .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that mind the integrity of the elements of ethnosphere . It &apos;s the power .
The wall of the wall of the domination .
And if you look at the world , you &apos;ll discover that these are not destined that these are not destined to be talking .
They &apos;re creatures and dynamics spines out of existence that are going to be a full of their adaptation .
And the thing that is disbospiting in the patria of the thought --
a population of Sarawak , in the south Asian , a population , a population of the world , and now reduced to a generation ago , and now reduced the result of the field of human fighting , where you can see the fifth of the lim that seems to get to the Borest or MaCinese Misish Cinese Mdier Cinese , where the naves , where the navorite is the Japanese , where the navorite is naves the sive of the size of the sillllllllly ,
It &apos;s going to reach the stives with the slate launched the forest .
Or in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that are come with the discovery of the old .
If we &apos;re going to take a mountain of the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the political wall of political domination .
As you know the genocide , the physics of a population , is condanned to the universal level , but the distriction of life , not only is condaned , not only is condanned , but it &apos;s not just condaned in certain in certain front of the developing world .
And you can &apos;t understand the soon of the Tibet .
I &apos;ve got the 6,000 miles from Chengineer in Chengineer in the Western China , came to Lhasa with a young college , but only came to Lhasa , but only came to Lhasa , but only came to the statistics of we hearing .
6,000 monuments of sacrates in policy and centers .
1.2 million people killed from the military Rivolution in Cultural Rivolution .
The drop of this guy was ascrited to Panchen Lama .
The Chinese is that it was killed to the time of the invasion of the invasion .
Sancient is fuged with Santity during the den deasporates that has taken the population in Nepal .
South mother was imprisoned and her color was being receight .
It was taking to the age of two years , and they can have a age of two years , nask it , because it wouldn &apos;t have living without him .
The source , that has been a very , was a message in the field of reeducation .
A day has been inaven a fasn fascinating a raffign fasn &apos;t a transgression , was been been mitted by the seven years .
The Pore of the Tibet can be insophistory , but the redest of the population of the population of the population is .
And then , all you can get a choice .
We want to live in the world world world &apos;s a monotony or we want to want to get the policy world of different policyromatical world ?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead , before we die said that his largest lasses was that , in our love to this vision of the world , not just see the whole gamm of human imagination , but a day we &apos;re seeing a modality of the human imagination , but a day we &apos;re going to be able other possible .
And it &apos;s a humiliating that our species is existed for 60,000 years .
The Neolitic Rivolution , which has given us the agriculture , which has been taken us to the cult of the sea of the sea of science , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The industrialized modern world has 300 years .
That square not suggests that I &apos;m not suggests that we have to all the challenges that we have to do it in the millenses to come .
When the cultures of the world is asked what it is asked to be human , respond to be human , respond with 10,000 voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all report the possibility of being what we &apos;re , a kind of consciousness , which is to be what we &apos;re all the population of all the people and all the people can figure . And there &apos;s great times . And there &apos;s great times .
I &apos;ve taken this picture on the north of the Abalene , when I went to the crownered with Inuit , and this man , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya story of his non-history .
The government is not always a gency with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to stabilies our own square , we reink them in colonies .
The non-man of this man was refening to go .
The family , I &apos;m telling for his life , he brought the arms , and all his attracted tor .
You have to know that Inuit &apos;s not the cold , they &apos;re not the cold .
The batts of the slites were made of fish flows in the pink of caribs .
The non-hand this man don &apos;t have to be saying from the arcrazy or the blizy that was suffior to the blizing .
It &apos;s taking up , it &apos;s copy , it &apos;s copy in the skin of the skin and defecated in their hand . When the fectors are conged , the work , they &apos;re working a lama lama .
It &apos;s spruzed on the top of this cold of the cacca and when it was solid , he killed a dog .
He &apos;s schools and created a bridge , with the cassa cassy , he has a sliter , he has a slited song and it &apos;s sprint on the bancha , clear tells the crownership .
We want to talk about name ?
In the fact , 1999 , the government has reded to the Inuit &apos;s a total control of a great area of the California and Texas these mas .
It &apos;s their new patria . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a territorum territory . Contricks all the resources .
One splendid example of how a national national state can reciliar with his population .
And , to finish , I think it &apos;s quite obvious to the people of us was in these zones of the planet , makes that not remote .
For somebody is house .
They know , they &apos;re seeing sections of human imagination that they &apos;re rising the time . And for us all these children , as the snades of our children , become part of the safety of the sperance of the hope .
Fighborhood , we &apos;re convinced that political convinced that political isn &apos;t going to be anything .
We believe that polemies --
&#91; Applauses are not persuasive , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month to tell the stories of our livisiting 35 million living .
156 countries have our television .
Our revists are leven millions of people .
Our work is travel to get our public audience in the audience of the wonderful cultural slate from how they have seen , and hopefully , to be hopefully , to be a floor of the world &apos;s anthesize of the world of exists , and we have to find a style style and met multiple life in a fun and multicultural world to a lot of life in a world , and murallowly ,
where the wisdom of all population can contribute to our collective benefit .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope called other people you &apos;ve already heard and I &apos;m going to have some college , in case , in case , in case , in case , in case , in case ,
I want to start with what I call &quot; the dogma dogma dogma .
The dogma dogma dogma ?
The dogma dogma of all society Western industrial society . The dogma official well-being of our citizens , &quot; The way to do it is to be massive the individual liberty . &quot;
The reason is , from a side , in fact that liberty is in the same value , is precious , useful , useful , useful , for human beings .
At the other is in fact that if we &apos;re libers , each of us can agree to do everything that that massive our benefit , without any one that decided in name our .
The way to move the freedom is to massive the choice .
The people have , the people have , the more flowers are , and most of the liberty , most of them is their well-being .
This is , I think , it &apos;s so deep in the society that no one would dream of dream would be able to the doubbio .
And it &apos;s also deply radically in our lives .
I &apos;ll show you some examples of what progress has rescue .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly great .
I &apos;m hoping a simple note on the condents for insalate .
In the supermarket , there &apos;s 175 condents , without the 10 variety of the oolids of the olive oolids and 12 acets that you can buy to give you a huge number of condent condent condent , which no one of the 175 pronce that no one of the 175 proned is of your deal .
Here &apos;s the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic negotial to buy a stereous : if , CD leter , radio , radio , radio , radio , radio , radio ,
And in this single negotial negotial , there &apos;s a great number of audio .
We can do six million different and a half million different combinations are using the components that there are in a negotiate .
You can must must admit that there &apos;s a very much choice .
Also , the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could all all the serve phone of the phone , the bad of the phone , the main that Bell .
It was born the phone , not did it .
A consequence of this , was that the phone was not roman had never been .
These themes are going to be .
So we have a variety of phones , especially between cellular cellular phones .
Here &apos;s the cellular cellular cellular .
My preferred is that in the midle , MP3 , cut up the nask of the nases of the car , and forts to the car car .
If you don &apos;t have the switching the house , you &apos;re certain that will be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be .
And what &apos;s going on is that people in the news and does this question is , and does this question . And you know what the answer is ? No .
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cellphones that doesn &apos;t do too much .
So in other expect of life that are very much more importantly than the first badies , you will be the same explosion .
Assistence : not going on the United States that you &apos;re going to be in the United States and doctor dams what to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we can do it , or we can do it , or these benefits . &quot;
You say , &quot; Dr. &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A has these benefits and the risks , and B has these benefits . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebroke , &quot; Docse if she was me , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor : &quot; But I &apos;m not . &quot;
The result that we call it &quot; autonomy of the &quot; &quot; &quot; autonomy of the thing .
But in fact , it &apos;s not a fish and responsibility to take decisions of somebody knows something , is the doctor , and almost of some of the other people who don &apos;t know -- and so that it &apos;s not not the patient of the patient condition to figure out the patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing products of products , directly , directly , and that if you think about it doesn &apos;t understand them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why do they &apos;re doing ?
The answer is that they want to domacine , we call the doctor to ask us the recise .
Something like this is our orthesize is a question of choice , as you see in this game , as you see in this jobs . We will not want to force children . We will not want to do the right now . We don &apos;t want to invent the right now .
And we can do that how many times we can do it .
The means that every morning , to the swake , you have to decide that kind of person want to be .
And I said to the family and matriage , a time , a time time , a time time , it was that you can have the most of possibly , it was that you can get the most present possible , and it began to get the most possible .
The only downwn-up was with who , not even when , not even when , not even what to do after .
Every , it &apos;s really to play .
And I &apos;m smart students , and I think of them 20 percent of work in less than a time .
And they &apos;re not not not because they &apos;re not not not because they &apos;re not not not because they &apos;re not not not because they &apos;re not not not not because they &apos;re not not not not because they &apos;re not not not not because they &apos;re not not not not because they &apos;re not not not not because they &apos;re not not not because they &apos;re not not not because they &apos;re not not not because they &apos;re not not not because they &apos;re saying .
Because I &apos;m impensive , I mean , I mean , I mean , &quot; I &apos;d like to do that ? &quot;
&quot; I have to spose ? I have to think before the children or the career or the career ? &quot;
They &apos;re interrupting logorant .
And they &apos;re trying to answer these questions , even though this implement is not completely the compitself that segment , and not get a bel vast of my exor .
And they have to do that . They &apos;re really important questions .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , as Carl , because the technology is allowed us to work every day , every day , every day , from every day , from every day , from the Hotel Randolph .
It &apos;s a parentesespecially , and I &apos;m not going to tell anybody , where WiFi works .
It &apos;s not not to do that , because I want to use me .
What does that mean , this incredible liberty of choice that we have to continually decided , if we have to continuously decided , if we have to work or not .
We can go to our son to see our son , with the cell phones in a cell phones , the Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , and the ginocky , on the ginocky .
And even though they &apos;re all spend , every minute we see our son , we &apos;re also looking at the partners , we also asking , we also asking this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this ? I have to get this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , &quot; all this makes the experience of the partners of your child very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , we &apos;re part of that we look at , small things , small things , the material things , life is a question of choices , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : Over , there were some possibility , but not all a question of choice .
The world today is a positive this : The dilemma is : &quot; It &apos;s a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Sometimes .
The positive lots of positive , so I &apos;m talking about that negative .
And this is all about two effects of those two effects of negative effects on people .
The first , paradoxically , is that produces are paralysis that liberation .
And so many options that choose choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I &apos;m officed , you know , a studio conducted study conduction .
A college has had access to the data of Vants of Vanald , the giant society of the world , with about a million climate cents in 2,000 companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that for every 10 solutions that are offered in the most of the percentage of the adesion of two percent .
With 50 source , there &apos;s 10 percent of the adesion , and it &apos;s just five . Why ?
Because 50 source the source that choose , is a very difficult decided , and the choice is remanding up to the indomorate inatoms .
And by domories , and again , domories , domories , domorous , and of course , not not arrive .
You can &apos;t just say that these are not just means that these works from the drawings because they don &apos;t have enough money , it also want to say that the decision is so obstic that they also lost the complex of the dator .
Not teaching , they &apos;re losing to five for a year from the work , who would be willing to be going to be versary .
So the paralysis is a consequence of having too .
And I believe that it &apos;s going to make it .
&quot; And we finish , for the eternity : ketchup , feeling or maionese ? &quot;
Do you want to take the right decision , if it &apos;s for the nity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and nepure the basic condent condent .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can also evitate the paralysis , we can also have to be slowed by the result of how we would be with less options .
And that &apos;s a different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of these is that a lot of the choose , if you buy a lot of not , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have to make a different choice that would be better . And that that &apos;s the alternative imagined us , and that the alternative imagined us to the scowers of the choice , and the replaces from the decision , and the decision , and the switch , and it &apos;s replaces from the decision ,
even when it was a very good decision .
The choices are , more easy than you can detail of whatever detains is insurfacing .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has asked very well , as the value as the value we &apos;re going to confront of what we &apos;re going to confront .
In the rest , when there &apos;s a lot of options , is easy to be able to be able to be square , and be less square , and be less square choice .
Here &apos;s a example . I write with all that I &apos;m not not in New York .
But it &apos;s probably like you would think .
There &apos;s this coppia Hamptons .
A place of lush .
It &apos;s splendes . Otyma date . It &apos;s all about them .
Not ething . But what he thought is , &quot; Well , malbuilding , is , malbuilding , is Agost . &quot;
&quot; Everybody &apos;s near Manhattan are on . &quot;
&quot; I could talk about home . &quot;
And in two weeks sled from the idea that &apos;s led -- every day -- every day -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The cost-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-cell , even when the choice was eccellent .
And the most are options we have to considered , the most of the careful careful , they will be a control of opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
We &apos;re going to live the moment , and maybe of the living .
But the most important point is that anything you &apos;re going to be choices , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to do the other .
The things we don &apos;t choose have a tactivity that can make less attractive what we do .
Tirzo : the growth of expectations .
I tried to my skin compring a new jeans .
It &apos;s almost always jeans .
And then the jeans were just a kind of thing , I buy them and western western , they were comofy , just after they were saying , just after they were going to go .
So I went to buy a couple of a couple of , when that old them were games , and I said , &quot; I have a couple jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
The committed me said , &quot; Li want slim , fit , relaxy , relaxy and fit ? &quot;
You want to the certain or with the bottoons ? &quot; Stonewashed , or &quot; Do you ? &quot;
&quot; Li want the stream ? &quot;
&quot; Sow the black or the stretched ?
I was balordit , and after a little bit , I was able to say , &quot; I want the only kind of the kind of thing that was the only kind of a &quot; thing that was , so I &apos;ve got to be a little jeans , then used to be a jeans , then used the best of the negotiations , I &apos;ve ever had .
It was the very , I had a lot of the choice I had the best .
But I felt about it .
Why ? I wrote a book for the short .
The reason I was worse , I was worse with all that the expectations were altissim , the jeans have to be losed .
I was expectations . I didn &apos;t expected in the thing I was going to be a kind of a kind of a kind of , but when you have a different kind of a different kind of , I was going to be perfect .
What I was purpose was good , but not perfect .
After I was talking about that I was trying to what I was insoon in the confront of expectations .
The expectations in life of the people don &apos;t do that expectations that these have been replaces in the eccellence of options .
And that will be less sofying , even when the result are good .
No one in the world of marketing .
Because if they didn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is a more to this .
&quot; It was better when it was worse or &quot; The reason why it was better when it was worse , it was worse , when he was worse or was still possible to meet the surprised was still possible to meet the surprising .
Egyday , in the world where we live -- opulent , industrialized citizens with the perfection of perfection -- the massive thing that we can hope is that the things are to the head .
You &apos;ve never surprising full because your expectations , the expectations , they &apos;re ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Basse expectations , &quot; Yes , you want . &quot;
I mean , small moment , small moment -- which are really sposed and my wife is really stupend .
I couldn &apos;t have to do better , I &apos;m not going to do .
But it &apos;s not always a good thing .
So , a consequence of the fixed of the fixes of when there &apos;s just that kind of jeans is that when you &apos;re not saying , and you say , &quot; Why ? &quot;
Who is responsible ? &quot;
The world is responsible . What can I do you ?
When there are hundreds of a jeans , and you buy a types , and you can ask you who is the responsible , is otherefore you .
You could do better .
With hundreds of variety , not there are no choices for the insuccess .
So when people are decisions , even though the result is valid , they &apos;re slowed and they &apos;re going to their college .
In the last years , depression is exploss in the industrialized world .
I believe that a fatter fatter -- not the only thing , but the great -- of this wonderful watching is just that people have experiences of the people are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation thought that the color is .
So the final result is that we &apos;re better better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me give you .
This is the dogma official , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely fallen . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than it is not not to do but it doesn &apos;t want to be better than a lot of a little bit .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we have surface from a piece of the level where the choices are going to be our life .
Now , from political point of political vision -- I &apos;ve almost finished -- from political point , the nocise is the following .
What allows this whole choice in the industrial society is the material recchoice .
There &apos;s a lot of places in the world , and you know , where the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too much .
So the factory I &apos;m talking about is a malesclusive malesclusive , recidested society .
And what it &apos;s going to be able to get is this : Steve Levitt has talked about how those costosis , and spoke segols for bibs . It &apos;s a spread of money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and dispendent , it &apos;s not just inutionary .
They &apos;re going to be a deleteries .
They do do it .
If a little bit of what in our society allows is restrained in those where people have too much much powerful possibility , not just their life , not just their life , but also , it would not be the imprint , but also our improvement .
This is what economists call a horse pareties .
A retroduction of the reduction ago , not just the poor -- not just the poor -- because of this choice in the excess excess except that .
To conclude , you can become all of what you want .
You know , people of culture , you think , &quot; But what you believe fish ?
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t make anything in a glass of glass . &quot;
&quot; Sometimes , a limited vision of the world --
and I &apos;ve been interpretation , I &apos;ve interpretation .
But then , I think , instead , instead , I realized that the fish .
Because the reality of fact is that if you eat in the bocks , in the way that , &quot; everything is not possible . &quot; You can &apos;t get the paralysis .
If you can get the broke up the way that all divent means possible dium .
You can &apos;t be the paralisis , and you reduck the well-being .
Everybody needs a sfhere .
This is almost too much too much , maybe even a fish , maybe even for us .
But the achieve some symbolic symbolic symbolic for the rovel .
Thank you very cuor .
