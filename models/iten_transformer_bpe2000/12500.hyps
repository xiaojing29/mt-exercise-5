The year of the last year I showed these slidemonstrate to demonstrate that the calculate glacion , which for almost three million years has had the size of 48 percent of the United States , is about 40 percent .
Toky this , and it &apos;s a gravity because of the problem because it &apos;s not showing the ice of the ice .
It &apos;s calculation is , in a sense , in a sense , the poor of the global climate system .
You &apos;re going to be expanded and it &apos;s ritive .
The next slide is going to be a full of the last 25 years .
The ice ice ice gacross are signed in red .
As you can see , you expand down to the blue .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter , which is the test text .
You can see that the ice said that the ice ice , five years or five years or more , it &apos;s like the blood , which is where the blood of the body .
In 25 years is past that , so .
This is a problem because the interested in the artage of the artage , and it &apos;s huge amount of carbon congent , and they &apos;re going to take , and they &apos;re transformed in metan , they &apos;re transformed in metan .
It &apos;s just about the totality of the atmospherical inquent , global ants could rading , that it may raduate , surrounded to this point of not not .
In some laghes , in some laghes , the metan of the water .
The professorites Katey Walter Walter Walter , it &apos;s recognized with a team literately a basis bunch a basis .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : She &apos;s good . The question is if we &apos;re going to be .
A reason is that this exchange the Greenland from the Greenland from the north .
This is a glacial figured .
The brought had never reach to fast similar .
This is the Kangered Kangered in the south of the Groenland of Greenland .
If you want to know how the level of the sea level of the walking of the ice on terrain .
This is increasing rents are increasing .
At the other part of the planet : Antartide , the biggest block of the planet .
The month the scientists have died that the ice of the ice is in the ice is in negative , and that Antartarctes , which is about some of the sophydrops , which is particularly released in the science .
It &apos;s just similar feet of action , like Greenland .
Sull Himalaya , the third biggest block , you see new laghes , you see new laghes , which poes were glacier .
40 percent of the population of the world &apos;s power to the water power of the power of the power .
Sulle Ande : this ice ice is the source of this city .
The brought is ather .
But when it dimind , the same accept to water .
In California , the non-40 percent of the Nevada is 40 percent .
The dries are in cribes .
The predictions , like you &apos;re graves .
The growth of the world &apos;s taking to a notevoes of incended .
The environmental disases are inside of the normal and without preceding .
Four times more numerous numerous in the last 30 years , you know , 75 .
This is a beautiful watching of the instuck .
If you look at the context of storic if they can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 , every 24 hours -- 25 million tons -- 25 million tons .
Look at the area of the area of the Pacific Pacific , to the American , and on both the American continent , where there is a radical impact of the obsian area of the obsian exyges in the oceans .
Most because of the global warming , together to the deforestation , which is the 20 percent , is the use of the non-fuel .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worst .
The United States are one of the two of the countries with the China .
And he was proponed to build a lot of other central central .
But we &apos;re asking to a change of direction .
This is the annative projects in the last years and some of the alternative version of alternative version .
And every way , there &apos;s a politics in our country .
The industries of the carbon and oil they have spent 250 million dollars in the last year for promoting the carbon , which is a host , which is a host .
That picture me remember to something --
I think of Natal Natal , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion pounds of 3.8 billion paper of carbon .
Maybe you saw it up on the news .
This is the second bigger than scores in America .
It &apos;s happened around Natal .
The published nature of one of the carbon was this .
Video : I &apos;m going to be the carbonaium is a kind of like , and happy .
It &apos;s abababundant here in America , and it &apos;s going to grow our economy .
Fross the carbonasic is always more .
It &apos;s good precenable , adorable and work , they &apos;re doing it .
Al Gore : Da is part of the West Virginia .
The largest society on the mountain is Massey Coal . This is his friendly friendly .
Video : Don Blankening : I &apos;ll be asked to Al Gore , Nancy Pelosious , Harry Reid -- not know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Protetion of Clima Clima &apos;s got two campaign .
This is one of the one of them .
Video : Ator : All COALergy see the climate change as a minute of climate climate change as a minute of minute .
So , this priority is invest a great amount of money in a high of the public force to make public and confuse the truth .
In fact , the carbon is not sports .
We think it &apos;s just a good profumping -- it &apos;s also a good profumping .
So , not predicatem of climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Ator : Carbone -- you &apos;ve heard about it .
So let me give you a game in a structure of the car .
Straditional machines are a little rumorous , but this is the sound of the paper of the paper of the carbon .
The carbon is the craft crows of the global warming , but the notion of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon the carbon of the carbon .
You &apos;ve got a clear technology of the carbon of the carbon .
Al Gore : Inend , the alternative positive alternative issues to the economic issue of national security .
Video : She &apos;s like America is in cribes ; the economy , the national crisis .
The philos that the college of all , our dependence from the nice , like the carbon and oil and oil oil .
Now , perhaps there &apos;s a new , solution for use .
Repower America : 100 percent of pulites , in the years .
A plan to put the America to work , make us more sure , and help us to get the global warming global warming .
Finally , a solution that bastes to solve our problems .
It &apos;s power America . She &apos;s pressed .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It &apos;s about reduced energy in America .
One of the fast fast fast to bring up to the bustible dependence that killed our planet .
Compared : The future is here . I &apos;m just just a new energy .
She said to two : Nuoves investment for places of work .
She &apos;s going to be realists . It &apos;s time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old old old old it says , &quot; If you &apos;re going to go quick , you go to the sun .
If you want to go away , you go back . &quot;
We have to go away , very quickly .
Thank you very much .
The year at TED fectors a duction on the LHC .
And I promise to go to the car about how it works .
So , I recommended . And for that the other time , there was the LHC is is the biggest experiment , the most big experiment .
Her compit is to reach the conditions that were less than a million second from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times to the second .
All this is just environment .
This is the south Ginevening .
We picotograph these mini-Bang Bang Bang in the resident .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- it &apos;s &apos;s 44 meters and has a diameter diameter .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in buildings so you can see the proportions .
The 10 section of the scored year we have accested the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taking from ATLAS .
It was because it was of immentioned in control of control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first facility that had done all the the LHC , in the LHC , in the LHC , and a honey of the LHC , and diffon-spent in the result .
In other words , when we see that picture the 10 september , we could have the machine that the machine words , which is a great vitter .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to do it , when he went on to Google and vide that the page of the page that the beginning was this .
That means we &apos;ve had a cultural impact cultural impact .
And it &apos;s a week after , there was a problem with the machine , it had to these files here -- these dored dored here .
This is 13,000 ampatterns when the machine works to the machine works to the machine .
Now , the technical technical of you will look at the philos and they will say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . &quot;
And they can do that because when they &apos;re very cold of become the surface of the surconducts .
So , at least 271 degrees , at a temperature of the space of space , these phils can bring that corrent .
In one of the young ger novemile in the LHC , there was a difect of fabulation .
So the philos surgeon , and 13,000 ampounds , and 13,000 ampatterns .
This was the result .
Now , this is still more impressionating if you think that these magneties more than 20 tons , and that &apos;s got sougher than about 30 centire .
And they &apos;re danneged about 50 magnetes .
We had to take them , what we did .
We &apos;ve got resistance and traveled .
And now they &apos;re going to come back to their sock .
The end of the best LHC is will be in the new integro .
We &apos;re going to happen , and we expect the data to the right , or and continuing so our adventure to discover what we &apos;re going to find out of what they are the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these involved in a way , these involved in the value of science and engineering ingeneery of the fronties of the fronties of it .
I think the fact that the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that I think is the value of things like LHC .
I want to conclude with the words of a Inglese Inglese , Humphrey Davy , the imagine , imagine , in the difesis of his ploved , his bleael Faraday , he said , &quot; Nith is so dangerous for the progress of the human mind that &apos;s about the human mind , which is not about the progress of the human mind that is not about the progress , which is not about the square of our own ,
Thank you .
I want to start to asking the car to rethink when , children , you get clear to clock .
While you know , you know , and they &apos;re going to take them and move them , and they &apos;re going to get them and die , and they &apos;re going to figure out space .
The space is deply connected to the way we understand the way we understand that graps of the world around us .
So , from the information of our interaction with our interaction with objects , together to my consulfighting the Patese , and my collaborator Jeeean Kalanithththththi , I started to asking up a computer , and we can have the switch as a douse of the wind , we could have the swital , we could have the scale of the desktop , we could have the information ,
and the full our feet ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , built the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer interactive like a birth .
In a few words , a Siftable computer interactive like a birth .
You can move with the hand , they can see &quot; between them , they can see &quot; between them , and they &apos;ve got a screen and a rate and a rate .
But surately , they &apos;re physics , as the crows , you can move to move to it .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystema new ecosystems to manippulate the information information .
And as they become more physics , consciousness of the movement , others , and they become more physical , consciousness of other , how we can move them to the other , how we can explore new and different ttents .
I &apos;m going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show it up to the video : if you incline , the video gets out there , the video gets back to the other hand back .
This is about the interactive of the interactive .
If you &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re going to get around .
If they come out , and they can agitate a little bit .
If they come out , and they can agitate a little bit .
They &apos;re also going to be their movement and inclination .
We &apos;ve got the construction that one of the interaction was the power to use communities , in the entire data , &quot; to be a color like a color like a color like a liquid .
In this case , we &apos;ve got three Siftable as a center of the versor to be able to be able to be the color in that central , where they &apos;re missing .
and I can use them to be able to be the central , where they missing .
If we &apos;re too , we can repect a little bit .
And they &apos;re also beautiful possibility of open , as the languages , mathematics and games of logic where people can try to try and see the logic and see the results .
Now , I &apos;m going to be --
This is a sequence of Fibonacy that I do with a equations .
Here we have a game of words that &apos;s half between Scarabeo and Boble .
And of course , at every time , you reach a literally , in any case on every Siftable , Pratically , in every crop on every Siftable to every Siftable to , and while certain words .
Then , after about 30 seconds of the size of letters and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
This is the children in the Media Lab , I did so they tried them and I gave a video .
They &apos;re very huge .
And one of the interesting things of this application is that you don &apos;t have to give you a lot of education .
You just have to say , &quot; You know , &quot; and they &apos;re exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s what other people who are trying to do .
This is our young test , there on the right .
And it was just just implement .
They were only morning .
Now , this is a whole application of a interactive cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool for the opening of Lui languages .
It can inserve new characters in the scenes , solve the Siftable .
It can inserve new characters in the scenes , solve the Siftable .
So , it &apos;s doing the sole .
Video : The sun is surprising .
David Merries : Now he brought a treator in the scenes .
Video : The arange tree .
By work ! Yeah !
So schools Siftable and put closer to interact the character .
Video : Bau !
And by inventing their story .
Video : Ciao !
DM : It &apos;s a story with the opened apert , and he can decide it .
DM : It &apos;s a story with the opened apert , and he can decide it .
Video : Vola game .
DM : The last example I &apos;ve got time to show you is a tool , realized of recent , to watch and exequires .
It &apos;s a tool , realized of recent , to watch and exeguide .
The Siftable here agreed on the sound of the battery , basically and bacteria .
Every one of these has four different variations , and you can get that .
You can inserve these sound in a sequence of comport to your fall .
And modific just doing it to be a sound , &quot; and a sequence . &quot;
This is you can control from the vive , as the rest and the philos .
And it &apos;s acks to a particular sound and then incloses to the way .
And then there are the general effects as time and fly , which they &apos;re just going to be interested in the sequence .
Let &apos;s look at how .
Video : We &apos;re going to start a base in two Siftable , &quot; sequence , &quot; we &apos;re doing the systems , we &apos;re going to add other basis .
Now , a basically , a basically one line .
Video : Now , I &apos;m going to add of percussions --
Video : And now , I &apos;ll put the movie on the bacteria , so I can control the effect of the vive .
Video : I can Posse the entire interested in the drive sequence of time , and it &apos;s another .
Video : And I &apos;m going to add the basis to the basis to dare more expression .
Video : I can reach the sequence . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to do it before , but I can make it a lot more cord or more cord or the most cord or the most cord .
And now , finally , I can make the entire interested in the left Siftable to the Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new interfaces like this is more and more more like our brain and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the result of this lost , and even some possibilities that we &apos;re trying to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I &apos;m going to transmate is coming to this new generation of objects to interact with media media , which will bring information in our world we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time to talk to all of you .
I &apos;m a written .
And it &apos;s my profession is my profession , but it &apos;s obviously .
It &apos;s also the love and the fascine of my life .
And I don &apos;t expect that you can change .
But , said this , something particular happened in my life and in my life and in my life , and in my career , who bring me to the entire relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I &apos;ve recently wrote this book called &quot; Manda , this biography called &quot; Manda , Ama &quot; which , different , different , of course , for some reason I &apos;m going to be a lot of reason , for some reason in the world and become a great sensitional , bestablic .
And the result is that anyone now , people treatment me as if they were condannated .
That &apos;s true -- condanned !
They &apos;re going to be worried and they said , &quot; You don &apos;t have to do you don &apos;t have to do it better ?
You &apos;re not going to be able to write for all of life without power without being able to create a book that can important to somebody ? &quot;
which can important to somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s rassicity , you know .
But it could go worse , at part of that I remember 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a wrote .
I &apos;m going to met the same based by the pure .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t temes me to have successful ?
You don &apos;t have to killed that the refer of the refer ?
You have no fear of this to do this to all of life without the lifestyle ever you have to die on a cumule of every infranknicks with the cumb of them . &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yeah , I &apos;ve got lots of these things .
I &apos;ve always had a couple .
And I &apos;ve also also fear of many other things that people could not inate .
As the tree and other things .
But , how much much about what I thought I was going to write what I thought , and I &apos;m asking me is why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logic that anybody has been expected by a work that you &apos;re going to be sent to do .
But what &apos;s about this particular in the emprize that they &apos;re going to make it nervous health the mental health of the mental healthy .
How do my father , for example , he was a chemistry and not recall of a sunlight in his 40 years of activity in which was asking it if he had to be engineer to be engineer ?
There was never -- that block about the engineer John , like it &apos;s it ?
It was&apos;t work so , you know , you know , what ?
Only , the engineers like group , they &apos;ve got a group , drop , dust the reputation of being alcolized .
We have enough this reputation , we &apos;ve got enough this reputation , but creative of every gender , we have this reputation of being an enormous member .
And it &apos;s not about the trists of the magnific death of the magnific magnific ments that , just in the 20th century , they died , death , they died , they died , they died , they died and often for them .
And the ones that they &apos;re not suickly sounds they &apos;re going to be very disdisdisdisdisdisappeared .
Norman Mailer , before I died , in the last interviews said , &quot; Every book , &quot; Every much more extraordinary flower to work on the work of their life .
But we don &apos;t bad when we heard these things , so long that we &apos;ve heard these things so we &apos;ve completely interiorized and accepted the nothing that creativity and the soffering and the soffering and the soffering , will , to conduce it .
And the question I want to take all of this thing about today is : are you agree with this idea ?
It &apos;s going to be this thing -- because it looks like a centify none of distance .
I think it &apos;s odiosa .
And I think it &apos;s also pericolosa and I don &apos;t want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our big creative ,
And I &apos;m sure that , in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start to figure out that he was very dangerous to that host the circle of the circle that they are in my career .
That &apos;s very -- look at it , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;ve about 40 years .
I &apos;ve got about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that any thing about now , it &apos;s going to be judicated by the world as the work that was going to be successful ,
I &apos;m going to schip , because we &apos;re all over here -- is likely that my bigger is to my bigger .
Oh , Gesus , which they think they think .
You know this is the gender of thinking that that &apos;s a person to start to start to ball the granding of the nine of the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would just continue to do this work that we &apos;re going to do this .
So , the question is , how do it ?
And so it seems , after a lot of reflection , which is to work to write is to create a psychological psychological psychological , okay ?
I &apos;ve got to find a distance of safety between me , which I &apos;m written , and my natural natural , and my natural natural , and I was trying to get to the year , and I was trying to do it , and I was trying to find other society to see if they could have to find other society to see if they could have the best ideas and more several ideas and more and more several ides and more severes and more horse of the best ides and more sure and more than the world .
to help people creative people creative to reach the inerents of creative creativity .
And that research me to the ancient Grex and ancient Rome .
Seguitems because he gets back to the circle and then back .
In the ancient Grex and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity came to the men , OK ?
And it was thinking that creativity was this spirit about divine and that came to a little bit of a few distant distant and soughout , for reasons and known , for reasons and knowledge .
The greatest called these beyond the berites of creativity .
Sooy , wonderful , it would be a demone that elargiven saged by the landscape .
The Roman was the same idea , but they called that sort of the sort of a genius .
which is great , because the Roman , because the Roman was smart .
They have a genius was this kind of income , which is created that has lived in the muri of a study of a artist , a little bit like the elfloor of a .
Here &apos;s a little bit -- this is the distance of which I &apos;m talking about that -- that is the distance of psychological , which is the distance of your work .
And they knew that was so that he worked , right ?
So the anticient artists were protected by things , like the too narcisism , no ?
If your work was exciting was excetional , they knew that they could have been helped by this genius , they knew that would help it .
If your work , if your work , it was not all the college , right ?
Everybody knew that was a huge .
And so people full creativity in Occident Occident for a long time .
And then the Rind came to the whole thing , and he changed this great idea ; we put it up to the human hard . We put the human surprising and and without more and not leaving space and not least space to the creatures that wrote from divinity .
This was the main the map of human human rational and people started to think that creativity came out of the ishared .
And for the first time in the story , you &apos;ve got to reference this or the one of the genius of a ployed genius .
And I have to tell you , I think that was a big herror .
I think that allow somebody , a simple person of creating being like a reciplent , the essence and the sistence of all mysters , creatives and the sister of them , creatives , unknows , and inknows , and they &apos;re responsibility to human-ring , and they &apos;re responsibility .
It &apos;s like to ask somebody to income the sole .
It &apos;s fully the ego and creates all these inexpectable .
And I think that was this pression to destroyed the artists in 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it &apos;s the question is , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
I &apos;m going to get back to a more ancient of the relationship between human relationship and creative .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t song 500 years of thinking about 18 minutes .
And there is people in the audience that sold literally , the scientific network of , involved that they follow people to do that follows the next photographs or their projects .
And I &apos;m not going to convince you all about this .
But the question I &apos;d like to bring is -- why don &apos;t it ?
Why don &apos;t I think about this way ?
Because it has more sense of any other thing that has ever heard to explain the exasperant exasperant exactly the process of creative process .
A process that , like anyone who ever have ever been doing something -- so fundamentally , it &apos;s basically , it &apos;s not going to comport .
And , in fact , it can be completely paranormal .
I did this met recently control with the extraordinary poetetry , which has 90 years , but it was a poetic for all of life and said that he was in his infancient in the Virginia , working out in the camps , and he would feel out of it , when a poetry .
He said that he was like a train ,
And that was coming to to her driven from the landscape .
And he was going to come , because he was going to be under his piees .
He knew to have a solute thing to do to that point and it was , words , &quot; run like a mathemselves . &quot;
And so it would come to home and , it would have to be able to this poetry , and it would not have to take a piece of card and a mathemselves , and it would have to rate it , and he would have to rate it on the page .
And then , sometimes it could be fast enough , so correed and correed and correverse and corruption and the poetry and the lost and the lost and she would continued to rolate through the country , and he would continue to rolate through the country , and he would continue to go to the landing , and he would continued to go to the lost . &quot;
And then there were the time -- this piece of the time that was going to be -- there were some moments in the moments that the almost lost , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was trying to the card and the poetry and the poetry and he was going to be a math in the watch , and he said , that was like if you wonder and he said , that was like the other hand and the across .
He was the poetry from the code and the cover the cover and the page to the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the page and intatta , but the last word on the last word before .
So when I heard it -- it &apos;s a couple , it &apos;s exactly the same .
It &apos;s not the whole process -- they &apos;re not a conducture .
I &apos;m a move , and my way to work is ; I &apos;m waking up to the same horarian every day and go on and go on and go on and go out and go out .
But even I &apos;m going to be in my testardages , I &apos;ve stripped that thing , sometimes .
And I imagine that &apos;s also a lot of you have .
You know , if the work and the ideas they were date by a certain the bottom of the bottom of the source I could not know that .
What is this ?
And how do we relationship us to do not make us sure the head , but , rather , rather , which do you do it ?
And as I think about the best example of the best example of the Tom Waits , which I &apos;ve interviews I &apos;ve interviews that I &apos;ve interviews for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of the life is the incarnation of the whole whole country , and trying to control , to try to control , to move these species of the impulse of the impulses of the impulses of the interested .
But then he invected , and a day while he was driving on a dright-built to Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
He was going to go to quick and all of a type of melothers , which is going to be in his head like this ispiration , and the allow-up , and the respect , and the desidence , and the desidence , and the desider , and the desidence , but it &apos;s not like to take it .
It &apos;s not a piece of card , it doesn &apos;t have a record .
So he started to feel this species of old old , and he &apos;s going to be in him like , &quot; the site to lossessionate , and I &apos;ll remarried by this song of characters .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And he invent to go to the panic , he stopped .
And he standing the whole process and fully something new .
And I &apos;m going to just the sky and said , &quot; Scususes , not see that I &apos;m watching ? &quot;
&quot; You know , what does it looks like to write a cancer now ?
If you really want to exist , you get back to a care , when I can take care of you .
All of the imments , you know , you can get any other today .
You know , you know , Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his process was working on this .
Not work was still hoscure as well as well as well .
But the process , and the anxy anxized was remarked when the genius , the genius , the genius that was used to use anything else and libered it to the back to where they came , and they realized that he had to be a whole thing about .
but it was a peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration a conversation between Tom and this strange and this strange and externer-wasn &apos;t Tom .
So how much you feel that story about to change a little bit of the way that I was working and save me a time .
This idea , I &apos;m going to saved when I was writing , &quot; Mangia , Ama , &quot; and &quot; basic , and it in one of the disaster we &apos;re working on something and we &apos;re working on something and we &apos;re not going to be a disaslead , which is going to be a disask , which is going to be the worst book .
Not just the book , just the worst book .
And I started to think about this project .
But then I remember Tom who talked about the air and you tried .
So I went to my face in the hoscritish hot and days my comments to a role of the room .
And I said , &quot; Senends , what , we &apos;re going to get out that if this book will not be right .
Because as I &apos;m seeing up all that I &apos;ve not got more than this .
So if you want you to have to be better , you &apos;ve got to give you a part of it .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , I &apos;m not going to do anything .
I &apos;m going to go to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I would like to do that I &apos;ve been recorded to do my part of &quot; because I &apos;m talking about it , OK -- at the end of the North Africa in the deserts of North Africa in the deserts of the North Africa , and he sacross the wonderful , and the sacross the alba .
And they were always magnific , because the balleres were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every long , of course , something happened , and one of these artists become really transcendent .
And I know that you know what I &apos;m going to talk that you &apos;ve all vision , a performance .
It was like the time , and the balleres , and the balleres through a species of bring and it was not doing anything about the soul , like 1,000 notes , but it &apos;s all hallineed .
And I &apos;m suddenly not just as a human .
But it happened by the didinner and under the fire of the divinity .
And when this happened , you know what was , they knew what was , they called it with his name .
They were boring the hands and started to song , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , God , God , God , God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curiosa history -- when the More invasols the Spain , he was this abitude with them and the pronoundation , and the land-grounded , Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , and said , &quot; which , &quot; which you can feel in the flow or the flow in the flow .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , workers , OK , and I &apos;m going to be , I &apos;m going to take , &quot; I &apos;ll give a scores -- one wrong .
And it &apos;s great because we need .
But , the problem is the day , the balleres , when you wait and wait and wait and wrote it &apos;s 11 of the morning of Martedge and the wrote of God is not .
It &apos;s just a dead with a dead with mal ginocy , and it will never survive to the tree .
And maybe no one of the God still while you have to do with his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most of the most porous recognize that we &apos;ve got a creative life .
But maybe not to be so angerous if you can &apos;t believe , anzutt , anzutt , which the most extraordinary extraordinary extraordinary to be from you .
But created that that they &apos;re just going to be on a inpicture of this inpicture of this squid of this squid of your life that you have to come to to something else when you &apos;re finished .
And , you know , if we think about it all changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s sure as I thought about for different months in the book that public book that public , I &apos;m going to stop , the dangerous , very , exactly my great success .
And what I &apos;ve got to continue to tell me when I feel electried to this is , not going to have .
Not weren &apos;t going to be your work .
It &apos;s inuates to the part of your part , any possible can be .
If your work is ball , you ball .
If the divine , abulous death , you know , asked me to leave some kind of wonderful kind of wonderful , for a moment , then you know , &quot; Okay ! &quot;
All of the same dance .
And &quot; Okay ! &quot;
I think about it , and I think you &apos;ve got to teach it .
&quot; You know , &quot; You know , just for the same , just for the human and test hammer and test tals tal tape .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I &apos;ve already talked about some of these genoma , on what can meaning and on the new set of genes .
Now we &apos;re starting a new percorse : we started to digitalize biology and now to talk about that code we &apos;re going to get into a new fase of biology , designing and synthesizing and synthesizing and synththesizing .
We always tried to take big questions .
&quot; What &apos;s life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists I think they &apos;ve got tented to understand various .
We &apos;ve tried different approaches , reducing the minimes .
We &apos;re digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the genome of the human genome , it was going to be the analogic world of the biology of the computer world .
Now , let &apos;s asking us : can we regenerate life from this universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species of the smaller genoma little bit of those who can autoroy-to-to-to-to-to-those who can autorum in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome of creating one again .
We &apos;re able to be able to eliminate a hundred of genes about 500 that are here .
But when we have a look at his map measured , it &apos;s relatively simple than our .
I think of this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes we can eliminate , it &apos;s very imlikely , it &apos;s very imlikely that this can bring to a living .
So we decided that the only forward to do this chromosomous chromosomosoms in way way to do some of these things .
And so we started the adventure of the Pan do we synthesis ? &quot;
Can the chemistry to make these big molecules that we &apos;ve never done to create before .
And in case , we can make a cromosomous crop ?
A chromosomous material chemistry .
The speak we are able to degree of life is growing up to the life is growing up .
Our capability to write the genetics , instead , instead , but it &apos;s just a lot of lently , but it &apos;s is better better .
And our most recent returns the exponential tree on a exponential .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process has required many pasages , beginning with a biothic reat before the first experiments .
But we &apos;ve discovered that synthesis that we &apos;ve been very difficult .
There are thousands of thousands of miles in the world that produces have small segments of DNA , the long letters of 30 to 50 letters and it &apos;s a longer , more rules .
So we had to develop a new methodd to these framments and correct the herrors and correct the herrors .
And this was our first tentative , to talk about the digital information of the genoma of the genoma Phi 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that killed batteries .
We &apos;ve designed the framments , actually , the remarkable repectured and a molecule of DNA .
The interesting part is when we &apos;ve taken this piece of chemistry and inered it in the bacteria , the bacteria , the bacteria , batteries , and they started to read this genetic code and producing the particular viral particles .
The viral particles are remarkable to cells , they &apos;re going back and they &apos;ve got back and they have destroyed the E.
I &apos;ve talked about recent with member of the oil industry that they have certainly compress this model .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation in which software can really build his same hardware .
But we wanted to do the most of things .
We wanted to build the whole craft of the bacterium .
They &apos;re more than 580 mount letters of genetics .
So we &apos;ve thought about the casses of the virus of the virus , so that we could change the casses of the components of a cell of a cell .
The program is crucial information , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these message , they have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 the accuratetry was a herror for every 10 mile .
We &apos;ve discovered it , it &apos;s about 30 errors . If we had used that original sequence that original sequence we would never have been able to do it .
A process is designing is designing sectity , 50 letters that they have to have to the others of 50 letters to build the smaller of 50 letters that we &apos;ve been working together .
We &apos;re going to see the only elements here .
You probably have lad that we put up of the great .
And we think about it , we &apos;ve got a based genetc of the letters : A , C , C and T.
Three of those letters together , and there &apos;s a specific remarkable to them , and there &apos;s a specific order to every ammalong .
So we can use genetc to write genetics , spensive , spensive .
What we &apos;ve done in the beginning was autographs .
Some of them were delighed by the fact that it was not poetry .
We designed these segments to simply with the entire just helping with environment .
There are the encysts and they &apos;re assive them .
And we started to assembly the parts , starting with segments , and seven to seven to seven to form a literally , unendangered to them to make it to them to get 7,000 letters to get 7,000 to 7,000 myths .
And every step we &apos;ve got produced these seats in abondance so we could sequency to create a process of building process that we &apos;re trying to create a very robuy .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems the tabellone of a basket .
When we get to these very long segments , more than 100 midle , more than 100 middle , they will not grow more directly in Ecoli .
It &apos;s got to the limits of the modern biology .
So we &apos;ve been considered other mechanisms .
We knew another mechanism called the recognize of a type , which in biology is , which in biology is to repuring the DNA to degree .
Here &apos;s a lot of example .
This is organism , called Deinoccurs , it can make three million rad rad .
You can see in the rest of superior as his chromosomous bs .
In 12 -- 24 hours is exactly like it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
This is organisms of organisms ,
They can live under it wants .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life exists in space , and you can find new environment of water .
At the real , NASA shows that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we &apos;ve built these processed processed , just using the lievening of the segments to insert .
The lievening them to the automatically .
This picture was not taken with a microscoope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a tool we can see it with a microscope that we can see it with a microscope .
This is pictures that coholes a period of about six seconds .
This is the published that we &apos;ve done a little bit ago .
They &apos;re more than 580,000 letters of genetics .
It &apos;s the bigger of a structure that ever created by the man .
It &apos;s a fish molecular molecular sent to 300 million .
If we &apos;re going to have a cartoon 10 without spaces , they would like 142 page to transcare this genetc code .
Now , how do we do it ?
Of course , you know , it &apos;s a game from kids .
It &apos;s a little more complicated when they use batters .
It &apos;s simple when it &apos;s about cell , and it &apos;s about the nuclear cell of the nuclear and inserve one of the clonto and inserve another , which is practical process of clonely clonely .
In the bacterium , the cromosomous , is integrated by the cell , but we &apos;ve recently demonstrate that we &apos;re able to do a complex of a chromosoma , and of a cell of a cell of a cell of a cell of a cell of the other and activating it .
We can refying a chromosomous cromosomous species .
The two are different than the topes .
We &apos;ve add some gene of gene in a way of power that they could decide to this chromosomous .
The one of the full of the entire way that we kill all the proteins .
And when we put in the cells was studies -- and you &apos;ll open our graphic graphic graphic -- the new chromosomous cromosomous is going to the cell .
And we started thinking that we couldn &apos;t go to the way , but we &apos;ve tried to be more , but we &apos;ve tried to spuser .
This is one of the most mechanisms of evolution .
We found that tanssize species have added a second or third or a third of some of the new , addition to a second thousands of new new new .
So who think about evolution as a gene gene of the biology .
There is the entire entire entire clear of the restriition that advice that advice the DNA .
The cromosomous cell that was in the cell of it .
The phone of the cell phone that we &apos;ve inserit--taking cellphone .
It &apos;s expressed , and he has recognized the other chromosoma extraneo , and it &apos;s got it , and we found out with just the cell and the new chromosoma .
It become blue , because of the genes we &apos;ve inseriously .
And in a short lelass of time , all the cards of a species are going to be along , and it &apos;s transformed on new software we inseriously in the cells .
All the proteins are changed , the members are changed , and when we region the genetc code of what we &apos;ve transfered .
Now , this may seems to genetics , but altering the software , but altering the software .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that this is not talking about genesis , but I &apos;m going to put from three million years and a half million years and a half of evolution , and I &apos;ve already said that we &apos;re going to create a new version of the needs that will be new species on this digital process .
Why do this ?
I think it &apos;s pretty obvious when we think about our needed .
We &apos;re going to spend six billion people in the next 40 billion in the next 40 years .
Right for example , I &apos;m born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each other , there &apos;s 40 , 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re going to find food on the food , fresh water and pulital , medicinal and well-s-half billion and a half of people .
It &apos;s going to be more dure to nine billion .
We &apos;re going to use more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion barili .
That means millions of barili .
When we try to find processing biological process , or any kind of process to replaced them , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to have the whole emission of the CO2 from these materials that &apos;s atmosphere .
At day day , we have a database in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that they &apos;re going to think that they &apos;re designed for the future .
The electronic industry just a dozen about components , and think about how many different things are come out .
Our limits here are the principles of biological reality and our imagination .
Now we &apos;ve got techniques , because of these metods of synthetization , able to create what we call the combinatory .
We &apos;re able to build a big robots that can produce a million croms .
Think about this 20 million different genes or drugs or to get the processing processing to make the process to produce the process to produce , new vaccine , we can change , thank you to a little lot of molecular biology , and create more biology now , and create more biology .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for possibility of survive , chemistry or carbon , or chemistry , production of vaccines .
This is an anea of some software program that we &apos;re working on to be able to seeing and designed species and designing species and designing species .
Well , we don &apos;t know , we don &apos;t need to be .
We know what we know about is their genetics .
Now we &apos;re focus on the carbons of how much generation .
You &apos;ve seen you &apos;ve seen to the grain of it was a very very experiment .
We have carbons of second generation that are pretty much more generation that will use enough to carbon carbon the car of the bigger , or different kinds of buts .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without aumenting , and the climitation of the food and limitate the disponbility would transform the CO2 in mathery , we &apos;re working to design cells , which we &apos;re working to design this , and we just just just just to do this scale , and we think of it was about 18 months .
The solar solar combined with CO2 is a dog -- but in our discovered in the world , we found different different different metothers .
This is a organism we &apos;ve describe in 1996 .
It &apos;s going to be about 2500 feet of the foundation of the foundation of the water .
It &apos;s going to put from CO2 using idrogen as a molecular energy .
We &apos;re trying to figure out if we can incanaling CO2 , which can make it be transported treatment , convertie that CO2 in carbon , to driven this process .
So we think we could be able to be able to be able able to be able able to be able to reach what the basis of the life is Not , we have the dest of the real dest industry .
And it &apos;s just . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can you do it ?
It would be a main the car energy .
And also , we &apos;re working on for using the same metods to create vaccines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with the influence , we &apos;re always going to be a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s about to find the wine .
I think that &apos;s going to change in anticipated binable .
This is how the future could start to change , the tree of evolution , accelerating the evolution , accellerating the evolution of the synthetic , and finally , and finally functic cells .
We &apos;re so much like this from the impressing people .
Our purpose is to live enough to try to make it . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;ll show you , the most of the most people , some fundamental work , new technology we &apos;ve brought to the Microsoft in a few following in a year ago . This is Seadon . This is Seadon .
It &apos;s a environment that you can interact with a local level that remoon with an enormous amount of visive data .
Here we &apos;re seeing a lot of digital picture of digital picture with a kind of swital zoom , dying the slip , driving the images like we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much the amount of information that we see , how much they &apos;re great these college data or images .
Most of the most photographs , but this is this for example is a prise of the Bibliotef of the Congress , and reentrepreneur , and reentrepreneur .
It doesn &apos;t have any difference because the only thing that it &apos;s the only one of a system like this is the number of a system on your screen in any time . It &apos;s also an architecture . It &apos;s also an architecture .
This is a whole book , of data doesn &apos;t imagine .
This is the Casolate dest of Dickens . Every colonnaw is a capital .
So to show you that it &apos;s about head and not images , we can do a kind of thing , to see it &apos;s really about a real thing about a real representation of the head , not a picture of the head , not a picture .
It could be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of electronic book .
It &apos;s not consider it .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s a number of the Guardian .
Every imagine is the beginning of a seat .
And it really the please and beauty experience of a read version of a reversion of a revist or a daily newspaper , which is for nature a lot of a methemselves .
We &apos;ve also done something with the angle of this number in particular of this particular in the Guardian .
We &apos;ve created a fasull of the alalong solutic solutic -- much more than that it &apos;s uses in a very much more than extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra .
If you want to see the cards of this authomobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even specific models .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that this means to put the people in the way to the people , and other cheries , they should not have to be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not going to lose time , if we don &apos;t have contributs to date that .
This is all the streets in the U.S.
So now we &apos;re going to past something else .
This is actually actually from the website . You can go to it .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which is two different technologies .
A is Seading and the other is a visual of Noah Seading , a student of Noah Snavailable , a student of U.K. Seeeeths of the UW of the UW of Microsoft Rick Seliski of Microsodd Research . &quot;
And it &apos;s from the website , the Seady .
You can see it when we do this kind of paper , where we can spend from a picture of another and have this kind of experience to resolution .
But the space of images here is actually a meaning meaning .
The size of the computer record of the computer have recorded these images together , so that they corresponse to the record to the read of the record to the read of the Montants -- all the neighbed to the Montanananesize of the Montne Rocky , and you &apos;re going to see . And anybody &apos;s in the space .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;ve got time to show you some other environment .
There are some more space .
I want to spend one of the original set of Noahahahs -- and this provide from a Photosynth of Photosynth that we &apos;ve done done for the first time the extent , to show you what I really do is the key technology , Photosynth-hot-like technology , the technology , we &apos;ve got to be website in the website .
We had to worry about the legal expect and on .
This is a rebuilt of the Nothers of Nothers . It &apos;s a Flickr . Bast Din Flickr Din Flickr and you get images of types in magnews and driven .
So I &apos;m all imagery from Flickr and they &apos;ve been all colleagues in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate in this simplicish .
You know , I would never think about to finished to work for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifffull this kind of account here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of different types of the cellphone of the cellphone of the cellphone of the cellphone number , a number meaning , in this environment .
And if you can , I &apos;m going to try to look at those more strange .
Many of the block of it , etc .
Sometimes you find a series of photographs -- etc .
This is a Nothers of Nothers Drat Nothers .
We can spend from the vist of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do with social things with social environment . This is coming out of the whole memory of how to do the Earth , from visivoyn-view -- and colleagues .
All those pictures become colleagues , most of the parts .
You have a model of the interest that emerging .
And think about this as a prolungment of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity , and they use it , and the people who use it , and the anages that they use to use .
Their pictures are marring with other people .
If someone is the idea of contrast to all these saying the name , my picture of the cedle of Noths of Noththers , and I can use the data , and I can use the data , and I can use as a point of the data , and I can use the place , and I can use the scale of them , and to have a lot of chross-to-to-to-to-mos of the name of the city .
Of course , a consequence of all of this virtual virtual model of every interesting part of the Earth , and they didn &apos;t have just just vists and and images and images and images and spending and satellite .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What your software is going to contained us to do is that , in the next few years , all the photographs , all the photographs will be practiced to the whole world will be practiced to be practiced to be practically realized ?
BA : Yeah . That &apos;s what &apos;s doing is doing is going to find out .
It &apos;s creating the hyperlink , if you want , you want imagery ,
And it &apos;s doing it in the basic pictures .
The thing is very interesting if you think about remember information of simancient simancient information that many of these images have .
As when you &apos;re a picture of images on the web , it &apos;s a sentence and the head on the web on the picture of pictures .
Now , what happens if that picture is about all your pictures ?
So the amount of the interconnection and the amount of remember that it &apos;s really enormous . It &apos;s a huge effect of the network of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible .
BA : I &apos;m going to be very much .
One of the main the major of the main and one of the needs of the ethnographic research is the power of the traditions , and the dunch of the wind , the dunch of the wind , the drop of the floor , the drop of the flows .
Bastes to think that Jaguar Jaguar , and the Via Lattea , or that the Midites of the Inuit &apos;s still in Himalaya , or that in Himalaya , or that in Himalaya , the central Dharm , and that the idea of the central central central of the world that we live not in sense that we live in sense that we live in sense of the world that we live not in sense of the world , but it &apos;s just a central , but it &apos;s just a central , is just a critical , is just a central , but it &apos;s just a lot of a , but it &apos;s just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just a , but it &apos;s just
the consequence of a particular set of scoes that our stiring has done , well or a very generations ago .
And of course , we all share about the essential .
All we all do . We &apos;re decreating .
We &apos;re saying in the beginning of initiation .
We have to have to death the inesorability of death , so it doesn &apos;t surprising if we &apos;re saying , and
We &apos;ve got a lot of art .
What the song of the song is the very particular song of cancer , the rhythm of every culture .
It &apos;s not not import that the the banforests of the Borneo , or the follows of the Haiti of the desert Kaisut , or the desert Kaisut , the Curandards of the Sahara .
He was my company of the journey of the journey in a month ago , or a hallevator in the Everest , on Everest , on Everest , the mother of the world .
All these populations teaches us that there are other ways to be existing other ways to be moving in the world .
And if you reflected a bad , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
And we have the cultures of cultures of the world creates a spiritual life , and cultural that &apos;s important to the planet and it &apos;s important for the planet and it &apos;s important for the planet as a lot of the planet like this is like biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural girl as a nosphere and you can defined the nosphere , and you can defined the nosphere of all the concepts , ideas , and inspirations , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , and you can be involved by the human ination .
The ethnosphere is the great patrimonious of humanity .
It &apos;s the simple of what we &apos;re and what we can be in how species inquisitive .
And because the biosphere was actually consumed to the ethnosphere is success to the etnosphere and much much much more quickly .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all the species of all the species of all the species of the extinction of the simply , or -- in the most apocalong -- in the most of the different biological different biological -- and you don &apos;t have neighborhood , and it &apos;s not neighborhood .
The injection of all is , of course , the lost linguistic .
When you &apos;re boring 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just a very good babiolic or a series of rules .
A language is the sprake of the spirit .
It &apos;s the medium with the animation of every culture in the material world .
Every language is a forest , a bine , a spensive , a spensive , an ecosystem of possibility .
And those 6,000 languages , while we &apos;re sitting at Monterey , at least half the other half of the children .
They don &apos;t come more teached to children , which you want to say , less you watch something , which is already death .
What &apos;s more trists of the slency of being being the last to talk to a language to talk about a language , not have a way to transmit , or not have the promiping the promise of the children ?
This is horing was somewhere in some of the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks and a drop of the tomba .
And I know somebody you say , &quot; In &apos;t it better ?
The world would not be a better place if we &apos;re talking about the same language ? &quot; Benish , we &apos;re all talking about yoruba .
We &apos;re going to do it .
You &apos;ll take a tract of a tract what you want to say is not to talk about their language .
I &apos;d like to do a journey through the ethnosphere .
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a little bit of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us mentican of us that when I say , &quot; different ways of existing existing .
Let &apos;s take this Barasana Barasana , in Amazonia , the population of the anaconda , which creates to do the floor of latest in the switch of latest in the sacrates of latest sacross .
It &apos;s a population that &apos;s not able to distinguished the blue of the green because the cell of the green , which is identify the population of the forest , which is the population .
They have a strange language and a matrimonious , &quot; exactly , &quot; exactly , &quot; exactly , &quot; You have to put a person who who talks about a person that language .
All has gone in the past mythological , and yet the particularity is that in these families , and they talked about six or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven ,
They &apos;re limited to listening and then they start to talk .
Let &apos;s take one of the most interesting tribe with any of the Ecuador Ecuador Ecuador Ecuador , an incredible population , an incredible population that has been the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , seven , they &apos;ve got tented a bunch of a very good nice .
They &apos;ve done to come from the high high high photographs that they reach them to the people who reaching the population of pluvial forest , and it had never seen anything about bi-size .
They have the pictures of the land , they &apos;ve got to research a shape or a shape or and , not find nothing , they have conclush , and they &apos;re not going to the five sionary and they kill the five missionary .
But Waoran issues are not just killed the straniesters .
They kill them .
54 percent of the death of the death of them .
We &apos;re allothes to the generations and we found two homes of natural death , and when we &apos;ve insisted it to know , they &apos;ve got to have a type of them was invecting , and then they killed it . And then they killed it . And they had a incredible bly known of the incredible forest .
The basic hundreds were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the early 1980 , I was asked a very interesting compiece when my professor of Harvard of Harvard was asking me if I wanted to go to Haiti to ink the basis of Dualier and Tonton Mactual powered and Tonton Mactual Tonton Macky , and imposed to use the zome .
For a sense of methemselves , I would have to understand the Vodoun culture Vodoun and the Voodoo is not magic .
It &apos;s a pretty much of a complex vision of the world .
Many interesting thing .
If I asked you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you would have to me ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Budddged , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-harian Africa has not not religious feet . And he invaded it &apos;s not the other than the distilled of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious concepts .
What &apos;s interesting is the voodoo is the intense is the intense between life and death .
So the vive they do the spirites .
And the spirites can be invocused by Great Aques , they response to the dance of the dance and they stand and stand returning to the anima short that for a short that for a short .
So , this is the wonderful vooths , you &apos;ll go to to talk about God .
We &apos;re going to say , &quot; We come in in the temple and we &apos;re going to go . &quot;
And from the moment that you &apos;re going to sitting you , how do you do that .
So you assists to these incredible events : following the wild of trance that touches , ink a strong demonstration of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the mind of the mind when it is catalyzed in a state of extremely excitation .
It &apos;s all the people with which I &apos;ve lived the most extraordinary the most extraordinary Kogi Sierra Nevada Santa Marta , in Colombia , in Colombia .
It &apos;s entering of the ancivilization that had a living on the planet &apos;s carbon the planet of the conquicts of the conquickly , the population of the city that &apos;s climate on the planture .
In a lady continent of the blood , this population has never been conquicted by the spagners .
And there is now , they &apos;re government by a clery , but their formation is really extraordinary .
The young people come up to the families to three or four years , and they live seem in a world of good huge and bombs in a world of the bombs of the ice for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years , and they &apos;re going to reproduce the nine months of gestation that transcornine months of the mother , now are metaphor , now they &apos;re metaphor of the Great Man .
So , this is acculate , they &apos;re acculated by their society , values that they predict their predict and their predict , and their predict balance -- or for the cosmic equilibrium .
And then in this incredible initiation , they &apos;re improvide out and over the first time in life , at 18 years , and they see a 18 years , you see a high . And in that we will see a high , when the sole the sunlight of the beautiful values of the beauty of the beauty . The prevented behind it &apos;s confered in the wind and says , and it &apos;s a past .
&quot; I &apos;m going to do that ? Proprise you .
It &apos;s studies . Now it &apos;s about to protect it .
They &apos;re called the most people and say that we are , fractor , we &apos;re the crothers , we are the colums of the world .
This level level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the initioning populations and the environment , and the old story of the noble story of the noble story of the noble , which is a razy concept in his simplicity or maybe we say that these people are more closer to us .
The population population is not indebolital indebolites from nostalking about name .
There &apos;s not space for these things in the paludiaric paludiaric vents of the Tibet , but thank you at and the running , and they &apos;ve created a mistic of Earth , they &apos;ve created a mistic intuition of the Earth is not about the concept that the Earth can only because it &apos;s just infected by the consciousness of the consciousness of the consciousness .
What does it mean ?
And he mean that a little girl of Ande that a kid of Ande that the mountain a spirit of Apu that will walk out of the Apaper , and it will be a very different rport of the mountain that , and it &apos;s going to be a little bit of the Montana that &apos;s growth of the Montana that &apos;s growth to be scavoid .
That &apos;s the dimour is a horrise or a cow , it &apos;s irrievant .
What &apos;s interesting is is the metaphor that &apos;s the relationship between the individual world and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia credating that forests serve to be wrong .
And he was a human being switched to my friends Kwakiutl that credimutal forests are the dimour dimet of Hukuk and the bag of the paradise and the spirits that we live in the world , and we will have to the nornorthern the Hamatse of the world , the Hamatse Hamatory of the world , and they &apos;re going to go .
If you start to look at that these cultures can actually create reality , you can start to understand some of them .
I wrote this picture to the Amazony in Amazony noroccurs .
Mayaask some of you have heard of the Eastern Eastern huge psychoat the repertent of the repertent .
What it &apos;s fascinating the Easter &apos;s not the potential of the drug is not the drug of the room , but his elaboration . It &apos;s got two elements .
She &apos;s a literally lady that contains a series of the huge , harmine and harmine , literally read , read literally .
And then , it &apos;s a little bit of the burning of the burning of the crows that alters , but it &apos;s myscoes a little bit of the family of the family of the family of the family of the caffected of the caffected of the caffected .
This planet , this planet , very similar to the serotonine , a similar , dithod-toamin-method-method-methodd-toams .
If you ever see the Yanomami to the nose to the nose to the susstance that they do a different species , anched methods methods .
Tiring that policy on the nose is a little bit like being spared by a little bit like a fucile of the dipaper of electricity .
I had spent with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has wrote the psicheedelic , with his discovered the fungi of the fungi in the &apos; 30 in Mexico .
And I think of my tese tamptamping these triptaminogens , because if you &apos;re doing you can &apos;t tell anybody to be hallucinated . And Risate triping to anyone of being .
It &apos;s possible to assume if you have to assustaining with other chemicals that money money that money money money to the MAO .
Now , the beauty : the beauty of the MAOr , the same kind of the MAOr , the same kind of the MAOr , the same kind of needed . The exactly the same thing about 80,000 species of 80,000 species of plant , like these are , they actually , but if you have two dies , but if you have a real way , they &apos;re not not spend , but if you have a real way , they &apos;re inside this , but if you &apos;re soughout of the parts ?
We use the big eufemism of the herror , which can revealing infruttifully .
But if we ask the Indians , they &apos;ll tell us &quot; The full they &apos;re talking about . &quot;
What does it mean ?
This tribe , the Cofan , 17 variety of Eastern Eastern , which they distinguished in the forest , and that we would come in in the same species .
If we ask them how they stabilies their tasks to us , they &apos;ll tell us , &quot; I was not going to say , &quot; I didn &apos;t know anything ? &quot;
The solution is : they get 17 variety in a night of llots and each other .
With this is not lauread to Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting that contact .
Now , &#91; &#91; &#91; &#91; opplauses the problem is that the problem of us who have gone of us who are the people who are the writing of the history of the history of the history of the history of the world , and over .
In fact , the 19300 years , it will not be remember for his driven , and it &apos;s just about the technological innovations , but rather like the was where we stopped and we &apos;ve been basic and we &apos;ve got activity , and we &apos;ve got activity of the biological biological biological diversity and cultural cultural . Now the problem is not the problem .
All the cultures were involved in a dance for new possibility of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux not have to be Sioux when they put out of the ark and fast as American and fashioned as American , and they &apos;ve got been horse and calculus .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that integrity of the ethnosphere . It &apos;s the power .
The wall of the domination .
And if you give you a look at the world , you &apos;ll find that these are not cultures that are not destinate to comparised .
They &apos;re creatures and dynamics spines out of the identify forces that will go over the identify of adaptation .
And the thing that is about disbospiting in the patria of the think --
a population of Sarawak , in the south asian , a population that has lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to the reduced and next to the next reduction of the fighting of the fighting of the full of the full of the floor to the Maasian , where the naves the navailums , where the naves the naves , and the Navorite , where the naves , and now is the navailable , and we &apos;re naves the navailums , and the nees the naves the navailable ,
You have to replaces to replaces with the sunlight .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that are coming with the discovery of the golden .
If we put on the mountain of the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the political domination of politics .
As you know the genocide , the physics of a population , is condanned to the universal level , but the ethnic destruction of a population , not just condanned , but it &apos;s not just condaned , but it &apos;s not just condaned , but it &apos;s part of the developing of developing world .
And you can &apos;t understand the soon of the Tibet .
I &apos;ve lost the 6,000 miles of Chengines in Chind in the Cina in the Eastern Tibet , came to Lhasa with a young , but only came to Lhasa , but only came to Lhasa , but just came to the statistics that we feel about .
6,000 feet of sacrates in policy and cening .
1.2 million people killing people killing the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascrited to Panchen Lama .
which is that it was killed to say that it was killed to the income .
She &apos;s ggiant with Santity in Santity during the deaths that has taken the population in Nepal .
She was imprisoned and his colpurn was to be receive .
It was taking to the age of two years , and they would have been boring under his gonna because it would not have to live without him him .
The extended , which has been mitted in the same , it was in the result of reeducation .
A day has been involved a fashion-raise fasx Mao and , for this transgression , it was mitted by seven years .
The pain of the Tibet can be insoppable , but it &apos;s redenter redenter .
And finally , it &apos;s all about it .
We want to live in the world world world &apos;s a mocropy or we want to get the policromatical world of different different different .
The big anthropologa Margaret Mead , before we died said that his bigger was that , in our hard to this vision of love of the world , we &apos;re not just going to see the whole gamma of the human imagination of the human imagination of the human imagination , but a day we &apos;ll see that there were other possibility .
And it &apos;s a billion remember that our species is there for 60,000 years .
The Rivolution of Neolitics , which has given us the agriculture , which has done soul of the set of the sea , remarkable poem , and they &apos;re talking about 10,000 years ago .
The industrialized world industrialized has about 300 years .
That slide is not suggest about the square we having the answer to all the challenges that we &apos;re going to come .
When these cultures of cultures of the world is asked what to say to being human , they response with 10,000 voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we &apos;re all going to be what we &apos;re .
I wrote this picture on the north of Baffin , when I went to the Baffin , when I went to the balene of the balene , and this man , and this man , and he told me the wonderful story of his non-history .
The government was not always gency with the Inuit and in the 1950s to stabilier our premise , we &apos;ve got them in colonies .
The nonone of this man came to go to it .
The family , tempting for his life , he brought up to me , and you all the arms .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t have the cold , they sframes .
The batts of the slites were made of fish slites .
The nonone of this man doesn &apos;t get to the artic art , or the blizeard , or the blizy that he was suffered .
It &apos;s been helped out , it &apos;s calculated the banons in the skin of focus and defecated in their hand . When the fectors are conged , it has been conged , it &apos;s working on a lama .
It &apos;s burded up on the points of this cacca cacca and when it came up , and when it came , he killed a cane .
He &apos;s high schools and created a short , with the casses , and he has gone , has imbridge another another cane and it &apos;s sliterate on the bancha , the caccount of caccount .
We want to talk about cavarsell ?
In the fact , 1999 , the canadvice of the U.S. has redded the total control of a territorum of the California and Texas the bigger and Texas hot .
It &apos;s their new patria . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a third of independent . They &apos;re all the resources of mineraries .
One of the splendeal of how a national national national had to reach with his population .
And , finish , I think it &apos;s rather obvious at least of us was in these zones of the planet , make it construct that they don &apos;t have remote .
For somebody is home .
They represented the human imagination that will be at the top of the stuff . And for us all these children , the source of these children , like every children , as every one of the geography of the geography of the hope .
For finish , we &apos;re not convints that politicians will never get to nothing .
We believe that polemical .
&#91; Applauses are not persuasive , but we believe that history can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the best institution to tell the world of us to tell the world . Every month to tell our size 35 million lived .
156 countries , we &apos;ve got our canal televisive .
We &apos;re saying , our rescue slies .
Our work is traveling in the ethnosphere to our public , and the marketing cultural beautiful , and they &apos;ll go out and hope , and they &apos;ll give them out of the central world , they &apos;ll go to the central world of exactly the central world of exists , and we have to find a high world in a world , and we have to find a high world in a world , and multiculticultural world to find out of the world in a world , and muralists and multicultural .
where the gegezy sages of all population can contribution to our collective well-being .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I &apos;m going to come to to evidence some of the college , and I &apos;ll find some college , in case , not not notice .
I want to start with what I call the dogm . &quot;
The dogm offices of what ?
The dogm of all the society of all the society of the Western tricity . The dogm citizenicial . &quot; If we want to myze the individual . &quot;
The reason is , from a late , in fact that liberty is in the same value , is precious , it &apos;s precious , useful , for human beings .
At the other is that if we &apos;re libbers , each of us can agree to do all that that makes our well-being , not no one that we decided to name our .
The way way to myze the liberty is to be able to be the choice .
The next scoes people are , more libely , and most of the liberty , most of them is their liberty , most of them is their well-being .
This , owever , it &apos;s so deply radicated in the society that nobody would have dream of them .
And it &apos;s also deply radicated in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress is possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly great .
I lost a simple notes of the condents for injection .
In my supermarket , there are 175 condents , without the 10 variety of oolier and 12 acetes of the olive and 12 acets to buy a huge of condition that you can buy to give you a huge of the indeal of the income to the record of your demic .
This is the supermarket .
And then you go to the electronic of electronic to buy a stereo : Brhydropping , plastra , literally .
And in this single negotiate , there &apos;s a big number of audio .
We can realize six million different combinations in a components that there are in a negotiate .
You have to admit there is a lot of choice .
Also , the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all the serve services desiderable , the path that they were fornited by mamong Bell .
It was born the phone , it was not buy .
A consequence of this , the other one , was that the phone would never have .
This themes are going to be .
We &apos;ve got a variety of phone , especially , specially between the cellphone .
Here &apos;s the cell of the future .
My preference is that in the middle , MP3 , tapels of the nose , and forts for the crop of the crows .
If you don &apos;t have seen in the south home , you &apos;re going to take you to get it to it will be .
And what &apos;s going to end is that people are in the nears and does this question . And you know what is the answer is ? &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cellphone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
So , in other expect of life that are much more important than the pursues , you will be the same explosion .
Assistence : It &apos;s not going to happen in the United States that you &apos;re going to be the doctor and doctor .
Instead , you know , you know , the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do it , or we could do it , or or the B , &quot; Are these benefits and these benefits . &quot;
You know , &quot; Dr. &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A has these benefits and these risks , and they have these well-risks and these risks . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebats , &quot; Dr. You know , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor : But I &apos;m not going to be . &quot;
The result that we call it &quot; authonomy of the diseased , &quot; expression that it seems to do a beautiful thing .
But it &apos;s not that one to site the fish and responsibility to decisions of somebody who &apos;s going to be the doctor , which is the doctor , and and almost certainly is disease -- and so it doesn &apos;t know , it &apos;s not direction .
There &apos;s a huge marketing of products , drugs to people like me and you , which if you think about it doesn &apos;t have any sense , that if you think we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why do they have them ?
The answer is that we call the doctor to ask us to change the read for us to change the recise .
That &apos;s what the fundamental hythemselves is is a question of scoice , like you see in this gets , like you can &apos;t want to force the children . We will not want to force the children . We will not want to do not to be a identity : we &apos;re going to have to inventing .
And we can reinvent to us how many times us aggrade .
which means that every morning , you have to decide that kind of person who want to be .
And he was just going to the family and the mathemselves , a time time the next community , almost any , it was that there was that there was that there was a most most possible , and he started to get the most possible .
The only trust the only choice was with who , not even when , and not even less that we do .
Every , it &apos;s really to play .
And it &apos;s about a lot of intelligent students , and I think about 20 percent of a time .
And it &apos;s not because they &apos;re not not not because they &apos;re not less diligenes .
because I &apos;m impensierites , I would say , &quot; I would have to spose or not ? I would have to site it now ? &quot;
&quot; I should I have to sell me ? I have to think about the file or career ? &quot;
They &apos;re interrational .
And they &apos;re trying to answer to these questions , even if this implement doesn &apos;t completely type that you &apos;re not going to have a beautiful voice to my exame .
And they have to do that . I &apos;m important to be questions .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , as Carl sopoleen , because the technology we &apos;ve allowed to work every day , every day , from the Hotel Randolph that from Hotel Randolph .
It &apos;s a lot of angoline , there &apos;s a angoline , and I &apos;m not going to tell anybody , where , the WiFi works .
It &apos;s not to say that because I want to use it .
What means , this incredible liberty liberty of scoice that we have to continuously decided , and we &apos;ve got to decide , if we &apos;ve got to work or not .
We can go to our son to see our son , with the cell phone in a task , the Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , and the notebook , on the ginocky , on the ginocky .
And if they &apos;re all spend , every minute that we see our son , we &apos;re also going to go to this , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; I have to answered to this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this ? I have to sell this literate ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; not that makes the experience of your child a lot of different parttexperience that would be in other conditions .
So , from any of any of the things , small things , small things , and the materials and stili , life is a question of scoes .
On the world was this , there were some possibilities , there were some possibilities , but it was not a question of choice .
The world of today is , &quot; The dilemma is , &quot; Is it &apos;s a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Shorry .
The size , we &apos;re all going to talk about that negative them .
This is this choice is two effects of two effects of negative effects on .
The first , paradosses , is that it &apos;s smooth invent .
With a lot of options to choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I &apos;m office for example , you know , a study , a study of the full flighting .
And a colleagues had access to the data of the Vantue , the giant society of the works of the implease in 2,000 companies .
What she found out of two percent of the solutions that for every 10 solutions that are offered in the most , the percentage of adesion .
With 50 source , there &apos;s 10 percent of adesions , it &apos;s just five . Why ?
Because 50 source of the basic frankly , it &apos;s dieased , and the choice is remanded to the inometers .
And the domanants , and the domananian , domananian , and of course , it &apos;s never going to be .
You know that it doesn &apos;t mean that these are going to eating food for canes because they &apos;re not going to have enough money , it wants to say that decision is so obstic that they &apos;re lost the complex of the dator of the dator of the work .
Not teaching , they &apos;re losing to five to five dollars a year from the work , which would be going to be the real way .
So the paralysis a consequence of it .
And I think that &apos;s going to make the world .
&quot; And to finish , for the eternity : ketchup , or your maybe or major ? &quot;
You would you want to take the right right decision to the right nity , if it &apos;s ethernity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong basic , and nepurpure the wrong basic condent .
So this is the first effect . The second is that if we can just evitate the paralysis , and we &apos;re less soon , we &apos;re less soon , we &apos;re less soon , we &apos;re less sitting the way to which we would have been in the way we would have been in the way to be able to be less options .
And this is a different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of these is that with a lot of them , if you buy a and it &apos;s not perfect , is easy to imagine that you could have to do a different scoes that would have been better . And that &apos;s that &apos;s going on is that alternative imagined us to the scoes of the scoes of the scoes , and the repimounds of the decision , and the sought of the decision , and it &apos;s just just about the decision ,
even when it was a very good decision .
And there are more , more , more , it &apos;s easy than any details that it &apos;s inso-inso-inso-on .
It &apos;s also what economists call economists called costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has asked very well , as the value as the value that we &apos;re going to depend on the things .
And the rest , when there are a lot of options , is easy to represent the carters of the alternative of the option of option that is about the option of option that is scoes .
Here &apos;s a example . I wrote with all that they &apos;re not in New York .
But it &apos;s probably like you would think .
There &apos;s this coppia of Hamptons .
A place of lush .
It &apos;s full . It &apos;s all about them . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not not eat anything . But what he thought is , &quot; Well , disease , it &apos;s Agost . &quot;
&quot; Everybody my near to Manhattan are so on . &quot;
&quot; I could just talk about home . &quot;
And the past two weeks sled by the idea that &apos;s dating -- every day -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The cost-opportunity diminus is the sodation for that we &apos;ve also , when the choice was except .
And the most of options that we have to considered , more acactual characteristics will return up .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
We have to live the moment , and maybe of the living .
But the most important point is that any thing about it , you know , you &apos;re not going to do other .
And the things that we don &apos;t have a lot of actives that can make less attractive what we do .
Terzo : exploiting the growth of expectation .
I tried to my skin , and I &apos;ve been doing a new jeans .
All of almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were just a kind of , and they were wonderful , they were comfortable , they were sitting them a life and worked a lot of times , they started to go to them .
So I went to buy a couple of a couple when that old them was going to be , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my wrong . &quot;
The committed me , &quot; Li slim , easphit , relaxed and fit , relaxed and fit ? &quot;
You want to the certain or or with the broken ? &quot; Stonewashed &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do ? &quot;
&quot; Let him want to the streets ? &quot;
&quot; Some people wants to elected them or strects ? Bla bab . &quot;
I was high , and after a little bit of I could say , &quot; I want the kind of -- which was the only one of that -- that was the only one of that was , so for a little bit of which was , so for a little bit of the best , and then used to the negotise , and I &apos;m going to be able .
It was the very best . I had that choice the best .
But I felt about it .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for it .
The reason I was going to be worst with all that choice , and the jeans had to be altising , the jeans had to be lost .
I was the beginning of it . I &apos;m not expececcetic when there was only one , but when there was a kind of , but when you live 100 different , lately , at least a kind of , at least a kind of , at least a kind of , lost .
What I had buy was good , but not lost .
After the had talking about that I was trying to be inatatered in the waitative .
The addition of options in life of the people don &apos;t do that involved in the expectations of options .
And this will produce less sofation , even when the result of them are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing if it &apos;s takes .
Because if they knew that they would not know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is a little bit more .
&quot; It was better when he was worst , &quot; The reason that he was going to be worst when he was best when he was worst , when he was going to controversil of the propticed ,
Everyday , in the world we live -- oil industrialized industrialized , industrialized the citizens -- the massive that we can hope is that the things are going to high is that the things are in the tree .
You &apos;ve never surprised to the prize , because your expectations , you &apos;re ingiant , they &apos;re ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- that &apos;s what you &apos;re here -- it &apos;s , &quot; Basse , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , you want . &quot;
I mean , small moment , and I &apos;m really saying , and I &apos;m really sposed and it &apos;s really study .
I couldn &apos;t have to do better , I &apos;m not going to be exactly .
But it &apos;s not always a bad thing .
So , a consequence of the bought of the jeans scomodds when you &apos;re only that when you &apos;re just sitting , and you ask you say , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot;
The world is responsible . What could I do you do ?
When there are hundreds of types of jeans , and you buy a display , and you ask you who is the responsible , is otherefore you &apos;re responsible to you .
You would have to do better .
With hundreds of variety , there &apos;s not there &apos;s no sculpts .
So when people are decisions , even if the result is walking , they sentence , they sentence , they &apos;re sently insoon .
In the last years of the last years , is explosa in the industrialized world .
I think a meaning meaning -- not the only one , but it &apos;s important -- this is this depression of depression is that people have experiences of the people are too along .
And when they have to explain this situation thinking that the colpurn is their .
So the final result is that we &apos;re better better , but we &apos;re features , but we feel worst .
Let me remember you remember .
This is the official dogm , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely fully fully . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no ld or that a little bit of choice is that it &apos;s not going to get it , but it &apos;s not going to be a little bit better than a little bit better than a little bit .
There &apos;s a critical value , I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s .
But I &apos;m sure that we have surface of the level where the choices are our life .
Now , from the view of political vision -- I &apos;ve almost finished by vist the policy is the following .
What we &apos;ve got to allow this to the industrial society is the receive material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you &apos;re going to know , which the problem is not that they have too much .
The problem is that they &apos;ve got too poca little bit .
So the facility of the modern that I &apos;m talking about is a modern of modern , realize society .
And what it makes you have to deprove is this : Steve Levitt talked about how those cost-to-to-to-cyesterday and comodds for whites . It &apos;s a spread of money .
I mean that these choose scoes , complicated and dispendioxipppull .
I &apos;m going to have a lot of deleteries .
They do it worst .
If a little bit of what we &apos;re going to have a little bit about that , it would be reversed in those where people have too few possibility , not just would be their lives , not just would be their lives .
This is what economists call a horging high himself .
A desibution of the reduction of the reduction -- not just the poor -- because of this choice in the except that there is .
For conclude , you can become all of that you want to be what you want &quot; --
You know , people of culture , you know , &quot; But what is it &apos;s going to think about fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t get anything in a glass . &quot;
&quot; She &apos;s just a limitation vision of the world -- &quot;
and anched the interpretated , I &apos;ve been interpretated .
But then , thinking about it , I realized that that fish the long .
Because the fact of the fact of the fact that if you &apos;re managed to the broodd , so that , &quot; You can &apos;t get the liberty .
If you rompet the slighting in a way that all possible diminule possible diminus .
Ak the paralysis , and you reduced the well-being .
All they need a sfurther .
This is almost certainly too , perhaps for the fish , and urely for us .
But the assumption of some simbolic symbolic symbolic , and teme , themselves .
Thank you very much .
