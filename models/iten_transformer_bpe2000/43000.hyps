Last year I showed these slide to show that the arctic calculate , which for almost three million years , he had the size of 48 continental United States continental continental , it was 40 percent .
However , this underlying the gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice of the ice .
The artic calotice is , in a certain sense , the pull of the global climate system .
It expands out summer .
The next slide is going to be a quick carrelated to the advance of the last 25 years .
The ice perentrials have signed in red .
As you see , they expand to blue .
That &apos;s the glasses in the winter , which is a summer .
You can see that the cost gap , five years or more , it &apos;s like the blood , which is like the blood , which is like the blood , which is like the blood .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been so .
This is a problem because the rescaling the ground , and that &apos;s a ground of the arctic , where there are enormous amount of carbon congel that , microbes , and they &apos;re moving , they turned into methane .
I &apos;m putting to the totality of the atmospheric inquittion , that amount could radical , that amount could run , surgery , super-up , super-up , super-up , super-up , surgery , super-up amazing point .
In some deep laghi in Alaska methane is re-holding methane is rebroading from the water .
The professorse Katey Walter of the University of Alaska , has been received with a team at the winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : She &apos;s good . The question is if we &apos;re going to be .
One is that this termal exchange that this termal termal Greenland from north .
This is a fighting fighting .
The led was never reaching slumped .
This is the Kangerlush in the South West , the South of Greenland .
If you want to know how to smooth the sea level of sea ice of ice on terrain on terrain , here is where it reaches the sea .
These roughly , they &apos;re increasing .
At the planet : Antartiica , the biggest block of ice the planet .
The month scientists have directly diclear that the balance of the ice is in negative , and that the Antartica Antartica , which is particularly in the slums , which is particularly , particularly , it &apos;s particularly in the melting .
She was six feet of watching watching , like in Greenland .
Sull Himalaya , the third block of ice , you see new laghands , and they see new laghands , which a few years ago ,
40 percent of the world population is going to be half of the world &apos;s potable by the slip .
Sull Ande : this glacier is the source of the city of this city .
The carried is increased .
But when you diminishes , it &apos;s the same happening to be cool water .
In California , the snow . It &apos;s decrease , 40 percent .
The house house backinds .
The predictions , as you read , they &apos;re graves .
The growth care in the world leads to a remarkable increase .
environmental disasters are increasing a rhythm outside and without precedented .
Four times more numerous in the last 30 years , I replied to 75 .
This is an unsustainable to the whole thing .
If you look in the historical context , if you can see the consequences .
For the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 25 million tons of CO2 every day .
Look at the East area of the Pacific , from Americas , and on both the west , and on both parts of Indian subcontinent , where there &apos;s a radical impoverments of oxygen in the ocean .
Most of global warming , together at the deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the fossil of fossil fuels .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States are one of the two of the most emissions , together at China .
And he was proposed to build a lot of other central central .
But we &apos;re starting to a change .
These are the annulled in the last few years and some of the alternative alternative .
At every way , there &apos;s a political model in our country .
The carbon industries and oil are spent about 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon clean , which is a hosysteric .
That image of that remember , I remember something --
Very Natal , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a lost of 3.8 billion lons of carbon of carbon .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the second largest scories in America .
It was around Nanky .
The natalizing of one of the carbon industries was this .
Video : My carbon is a carbon and happy .
It &apos;s abondant here in America , and it &apos;s growing our economy .
Actually , carbon is more and more cleaned .
It &apos;s good , good adorable and the workers are keeping the stipendent .
Al Gore : From here &apos;s a lot of the West Virginia .
The largest society about mountains is Massey Coal . This is his amministrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I &apos;m going to be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosis , Harry Reid -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Protection of Clima Clima has launched two campaign .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Ator : At COALergy see the climate change as a sery ,
For that we have a great amount of money in a great amount of money in a effort to make a public effort and confuses the carbon .
In fact , the carbon is not spork .
We think it &apos;s clean -- it also has a good profit .
So , not preoctor of climate change .
Let me do .
Video : Ator : Ator : You &apos;ve heard about it .
So let &apos;s look at a test in a clean to advances .
Straditional machines are a little humor , but this is the sound of the clean technology of clean clean .
The carbon consumption is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology of clean clean clean that you see changes everything .
Do you have a look : this is the clean of clean clean .
Al Gore : Infinally , the positive alternative alternative , and the national security .
Video : Add is : America is in crisis ; the economy , national security , national climate climate crisis .
The filter that connects all of our connection of fossils , like the headquarters , like the spork and oil .
Now , it &apos;s a new audace , there &apos;s a new audace for us .
Repower : 100 percent of clean energy , 10 years .
A plan to put America to work , make sure more safety , and help to stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that &apos;s to solve our problems .
Repower power .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It &apos;s about it &apos;s energy to reduce America .
One of the faster ways to bring up the combustible that killed our planet .
She &apos;s : The future is here . I feel , just a new energy network .
She &apos;s got to be two : Nuovi investments for places of work broads .
Ask : As America . It &apos;s time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old African proverbial proverbial says , &quot; If you want to go fast .
If you want to go away , you go together . &quot;
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED I did an introduction about LHC .
And I promise to return you about how the machine works .
So , here I am . And for that the other time , there was no LHC is the biggest scientific experiment , never tried -- 27 kilometers of circumference .
His task to recreate the conditions that were present less than a second billion second from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
All this is just environmental .
This is the machine under Ginevening .
We picture these mini-Bang Bang inside , within the relevators .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- it &apos;s 44 meters and it &apos;s 44 meters .
This is a spectacular image of ATLAS in buildings .
Ten to 10 to get the last year we got the car year we got the car for the first time .
And this photograph was taken by ATLAS .
It was cause of immense festegamming in control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first particles of the particles that had all the LHC , go into collision , with a collision , with a part of the LHC , and spreading particles in the resevent .
In other words , when we see that image 10 to secret , we realize that the machine worked , which is a great vitter .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to do us exultate more or this , when somebody went to Google and saw the page was this .
That means we had a cultural impact to the scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had to these files here -- these dorful files .
These files bring 13,000 lams when the machine works at the massive of power .
Now , the technical technical in the files and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . I &apos;m very very thin . &quot;
And they can do that because when they &apos;re very cold to become the cost called superconductors .
So unless 271 degree temperature at a free temperature in the space , these files can bring that run .
In one of the gunture between the most novemials in the LHC , there was a fan of factory .
So the files surrounds , and 13,000 ampounds of ampings , and 13,000 ampounds improved a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magnets are more than 20 tons , and that they &apos;ve moved about 30 centimeters .
They are damaged about 50 magnets .
We had to take them , what we did .
We &apos;ve been returned and traveled .
Now they &apos;re back now , they &apos;re back to their submit .
By the end of marzo LHC is is going to be new integrate .
We &apos;re going to accenate it , and we expect to get the jugly , and continuing our adventure to discover what the morning is about the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain qual way , these crashes the dibate on the value of science and engineering in frontier .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so difficult , the fact of going beyond limits , I think is the value of things like LHC .
I &apos;d like to conclude with the words of a Ingan scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , I imagine , in the indeed useful experiments of his pupillo , his pupillo was Michael Faraday , said , &quot; No is so dangerous for the progress of the human mind that the science of the human mind that we &apos;re not mysteries in nature , which we &apos;re not going to be mistake . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to rethink when , as children , played with young people .
As you figured out how to get them and make them , take them and moving them , learned actually to think and solve problems , you actually realize problems and manipulating problems .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , from information inspired by the useful interaction with physical objects , together at my consultant . And my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to ask me , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of having the only cursor of the mouse of the mouse as a digital digital , we could consult a information with a information with a desktop of information with bottom-up with both hands ,
and systemate our ployment ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a computer interactive computer like a beautiful scooks .
In a few words , a Siftable is a computer interactive computer like a beautiful scooks .
You can move them with the hand , they can see them , &quot; they can see &quot; between them , feel their movement and they have a screen and a radio wireless .
But above , they &apos;re physical objects , like the morning , you can move just up with it .
Siftable is an example of a new ecosystem of a new ecosystem for manipulating the digital information .
And as they become physical , consciously consciously , and as others , and as they become physical , of the other people , how we can explore new , of the other people , how we can explore new and fun are interacting .
I &apos;ll start with a few simple example .
This Siftable is configurated to show the video : if you incline in a direction , the video will rotate it , if you cline on the other side .
These interactive re-interactive re-a-others .
If you go back , they &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re around .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they see it and they can get a little bit .
If they &apos;re surrounded , they see it and they can get a little bit .
They &apos;re going to have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the poter using common gestures , &quot; a color like a liquid . &quot;
In this case , we have three Siftable , as a center as a configured and I can use to use them to make color in that central , where they &apos;re missing .
and I can use them to make color in that central , where you mix .
If we &apos;re going to be too , we can put a little bit .
They are also beautiful possibility of learning , like the languages , mathematics and games where people can try to come up with fast things , and see the results of immediately .
Now , I &apos;m --
This is a sequence of Fibonaces that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a game of words that &apos;s in the Scarabeo and Boggle .
At every turn on every turn , you know , a letter to every Siftable , Pratically , every turn , to every turn , and you know , and he &apos;s trying to compose words , and he &apos;s trying to figure out it .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new set of letters and new possibility to try to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s a field of the Lab Media Lab , I made them and turned a video .
They &apos;re very placeased .
And one of the interesting things about this application is that you don &apos;t have to give people many instructions .
You just have to say , &quot; Compons of words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s another people who try it .
This is our young biggest , there on the right .
It really really wanted to implane them .
They were only morning for him .
Now , this is a interactive cardboard .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of Lui languages is Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , suncable .
It can put new characters in the scene , suncable .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : Sun is source .
David Merrill : Now he took a tractor in the scene .
Video : The arange tractor .
Bel work ! Yeah !
So , I school the Siftable and put them near the character --
Video : Bau !
To inventing your story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It &apos;s a story with open-open , and it can decide him as it &apos;s going to be .
DM : It &apos;s a story with open-open , and it can decide him as it &apos;s going to be .
Video : Fly , gat it .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , realized by the way , to sample , to sampling and to exect music .
it &apos;s a tool , realized recently , to sampling and to exectool music .
The Siftable here are agenda sound , base and battery .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose what we use .
You can also put these sounds in a sequence to compose these sounds in a sequence .
And modifying it to just touch a &quot; sequence . &quot;
These are actually you can control from alive , like the reverse and the filter .
The drive to a particular sound and then including it .
And then there are the general effects like time and volume , and they apply , and they apply .
Let &apos;s look at how it works .
Video : DM : We &apos;re going to start putting a base in two Siftable , we put them in a series , we extend , we add base it .
Now I put a base line .
Video : DM : Now add of percussions --
Video : DM : And I &apos;ll put the movie to the bacteria , so I can control the effect of the living .
Video : DM : I can speed the entire sequence in the time , by one side .
Video : And I &apos;m going to add the movie to the base to give more expression .
Video : DM : I can reombing the sequence . &quot;
So I didn &apos;t have to plan it , but I can suddenly improving , making it longer or more cord .
And now , finally , I can get the whole sequence of the whole sequence of the Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new man &apos;s building new man &apos;s interfaces in the brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this patent , and also some possibility that we &apos;re trying to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to transmit is that it &apos;s coming to this new generation of design objects to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time speak with you all .
I &apos;m a writer .
Boy books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , obviously .
It &apos;s also love and the fass of my life .
And I don &apos;t expect that it can change .
But that said , something particular happened recently in my life and my career , which has taken me to realibrate the entire relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called &quot; Mang , &quot; Ama , &quot; which , and it &apos;s a very much of my books , for some reason books , for some reason that was in the world and become a great sensational , well-ler .
And the result is that everywhere &apos;s wonderful , people treat me as if I were condamaged .
Do true -- convicted , convicted !
They &apos;re all worried and they &apos;re all worried and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t fear you fear about it ?
You don &apos;t fear to continue to write all life for the whole life without any more to create a book that can make a book that can important ? &quot;
What can you care to somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s rassuring , you know .
But it could go worse , part of that I remember more than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent -- that I wanted to be a written .
I would move to meet the same reaction based by fear .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you can &apos;t get succeed ?
Do you fear that the humiliation of the rejection of you ?
You don &apos;t fear to do this for all life without any life without any of it &apos;s going out and die on a slide of dreams of unleft to love with the mouth of loving books ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I fear about all the things .
I &apos;ve had afraid .
And I &apos;ve got afraid of many other things that people can &apos;t inate .
As the food and other things are expecting .
But , as much as it write what I thought and I was thinking and I was wondered , is it ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logical that anybody &apos;s waiting to be pushed by a work that you feel to do .
But what is so particular in the creative thing about in creative to make us nervous health of mental health , in a way that other careers do not do ?
Like my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don &apos;t remember a once in his 40 years of activity that he was asked if you fear to be able to be able to be able to be able you ?
It was never -- that was -- that block of the John engineer , how it does it do ?
Does didn &apos;t work that , you know ?
Onestly , chemical engineers as a group have not certainly , in the centuries , gets , they adagnered depressed manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized manized the reputation of being caught .
We have enough to have this reputation , and not just writers , but creative of every kind of thing , we have this reputation of being enormous instable .
And it &apos;s not to look at the trists conteous death of the magnify of the magnificent , only in the 21st century , died young people died .
And the ones that are not suicidated to be really disfaced by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before he die in the last interview , &quot; Oray , my book killed me a little bit of more . &quot; An extraordinary relationship about work of your life .
But we don &apos;t bad when we hear it because we &apos;ve heard these things that &apos;s long , long , we &apos;ve been interized and accepted the notion that creativity and the notion that creativity and suffering , and that art , finally conduce it .
And the question I want to ask all over here today is : are you agree with this idea ?
That &apos;s good -- because it &apos;s also , because it looks at a centimeter of me , not that &apos;s good for anything .
I think it &apos;s hdiosa .
And I think it &apos;s dangerous , and I don &apos;t want to see it perpetuate in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our great minds to live .
And I know that , in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start fuging to that the guy of suppose , above the surrounded circumstances I &apos;m in my career .
That is true -- I &apos;m looking , they &apos;re pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I have about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything I will write about it &apos;s going to be judged by the world like the work that I use that was coming out of my last book .
I &apos;m going to be himself , because we &apos;re all about it -- it &apos;s likely that my greatest success is to my greatest success .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that &apos;s about a person to start boundary nine , and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would stop doing this work that we do this work that we do .
So , the question becomes , how do you ?
And so it looks like , after many reflective , which the way to work to continue to write is to create a psychological construct , right ?
I have to find a safety distance between me , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxy at what reaction is about what reaction is going to get . And as I was trying to do this year , trying to find out the year , trying to find out the time , trying to find other societies to see if they could have ideas and more healthy and more healthy and more healthy .
how to help people to manage the emotional risks of the creativity of creativity .
And that research has tained me to the Grex and ancient Rome .
I &apos;m guitems because I &apos;m in circle and then back .
Nelse Grex and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t look not like creativity to believe that creativity is from men , OK ?
And he thought the creativity was this spirit of divine , and that he was saying to a few distant and unknown , for distant distant and health .
The greatest called these beyond these spirits of creativity &quot; demons . &quot;
Soowever , wonderful , believed to have a demon the landscape .
Romans were the same idea , but they called the same kind of spirit without a genius .
which is great , because the Romans didn &apos;t really think that a genius was someone particularly smart .
And they thought a genius was this kind of entity divine that was created literally in the walls of a artist , a little bit like Dobby , and he came out of hidden , and he came to hidden work of that artist and model the result of that work .
Here &apos;s the way that -- this is the distance of which I speak -- that psychological construct that protects you from the results of your work .
And everybody knew that was so it worked , right ?
So the anti-gent artists were protected by certain things , like the narcism , right ?
If your work was exceptional work was not going to get all the marketed , everybody knew that you had helped by this genius incorporation .
If your work , if your fallies , it wasn &apos;t all the bag , right ?
They all knew that was your genius to be a inable .
So people han creativity in the West creativity in the West for a long time .
Then the Renaissance came and everything changed , and we put this great idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe over the center of the universe , and mysteries and leaving to the mitive creatures that write from divinity .
This was the rational principle of humanism and people started to think that creativity is completely about the creativity was completely from hydle .
And for the first time in history , it began to refer to this or that artist as an artist as a rather than a person with genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think that we allow somebody , a simple person to believe that as a replent like the source , and the source of all the mysteries , creative , inknowledge and a very much bigger to the psychronically , to be a very big philable to to be to give to the psychallenging the human psychallenges .
It &apos;s like to ask somebody to enjoy the sun .
Sform and shape distores completely and it creates all these expectable on performance .
And I think it was this pression to the artists in the past 500 years .
And if that is true , and I think it &apos;s , and I think it &apos;s , and now ?
Can we do that different ?
Maybe back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and creative mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t sing 500 years of rational thought of a rational thinking about 18 minutes .
And there is probably people between the public who would have to legitimate the scientific solution , instead , you know , they follow people to sfit up the next phatases of their projects .
I &apos;m probably not convince you all about this .
But the question I &apos;d like to ask is -- why not ?
Why don &apos;t you think about it ?
because it has more sense of all that I &apos;ve ever heard to explain the exaspering exaspering of the creative process of creative process .
A process that , like everybody who has ever been trying to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- it &apos;s not a rationally , you don &apos;t composed rationally .
And in fact , it can sometimes seems completely paranormal .
I did this recently , with the extraordinary poetry Ruth Stone , who now 90 years , but it was a poetched poetry to all life and said that during his childhood in the camps , and he heard , in the camps , and he heard , in the field , and he heard , in the landscape .
He said that it was like a fragorous trains .
And he was getting up to her landscape .
He felt it was going to get , because he was tremendous land under his feet .
He knew he had one thing to do at that point and it was about , words , &quot; running like a wager . &quot;
And so it was walking up to the home and he was washing up from this poetry , and he had no paper to take a piece of paper and a faster , and it &apos;s faster , and he would take it and deal with it on the page .
Sometimes he couldn &apos;t be enough , so it was correct and correct and realized without having to get to the home and the poetry was roll through and she would continued to roll through the landscape , and he would continue to roll through the landscape , and he said , &quot; another poet . &quot;
Then there were those times -- this piece I &apos;m going to be ever forget -- there were some moments when they were almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was trying to paper and the poetry was willing through , and he would go through , and he was going to go , and he said , that he was like you walk up with the other hand and the offer .
He was in the wire from the tail and put her in his body and put her in the page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be presented on perfect and intact , but the openly contrary to the first .
So when I thought , it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly the same thing to my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conducture .
I &apos;m a mulo , and my way to work is ; I &apos;m wake up every day and play and play and to work and go and work and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and work on it &apos;s going to be done .
But even I , in my test , I &apos;ve striscilent against that thing , sometimes .
And I imagine that many of you do it .
You know , even though the work and ideas came up with me , you know , I could not honestly know .
And what is this ?
And how can we relate it in a way we don &apos;t lose the head , but , rather , rather , what do we do you get healthy ?
For what I think about , the best example , that I &apos;ve got the musician , which I interviewed Tom Waits , which I interviewed a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most most of life was the incarnation of the artist globe of the artist globe , trying to control these species of pulls , to run these species of totally interized impulses .
But then he was driving , he was driving on a day while he was driving on a &quot; highway in Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
He was going fast and everything is a slip of a sent melody , and it &apos;s a little bit of melody , and it &apos;s wonderful , elusive , and the wants , and the wants , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the desidery , but it doesn &apos;t know how to take it .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a pencil , it has a registerator .
So , he starts to feel this species of anexiety to lose , &quot; I &apos;m going to remained , and I &apos;ll remained by this personal song .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to the panic , he stopped .
It was going to get the whole process and he did something completely new .
And he just watched the sky and said , &quot; Scause , I &apos;m not seen that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Do you know , &quot; Do you have a song now ?
If you really want to exist , you get a more of a time time when I can take care of you .
Otriments , you go to important something else today .
You &apos;re going to be Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his work worldwide changed after that .
Not the work , it was still hoscure as always .
But the process , and the anexy that was retaken to the genius , the genius that &apos;s out of him , the genius that was nothing else problems and libering it back to where , realizing that didn &apos;t have to be a interiorized thing and gmented .
but he was wonderful , wonderful , wonderful collaboration between Tom and this external thing and this external thing and this external thing that lose wasn &apos;t Tom .
So how I felt that story about changing a little bit even the way I work and I was saved .
This idea , he saved me when I was writing , &quot; Mangy , &quot; Ama , &quot; and falls in one of those disperation that we all have when we &apos;re working on something and we can &apos;t start to think that it &apos;s going to be a disaster , which is going to be the worst book or never wrote .
Not just bad , just the worst book .
And I started thinking about themselves to throw this project .
But then I remember about Tom who was talking about the air and I tried to get .
So I went up my face in the manoscrits and I &apos;ll say my comments to a pay of the room .
And I said to high voices , &quot; Sments , both of course , if this book is not going to be bright , it &apos;s not going to be bright ?
Because as I &apos;m going to put everything I &apos;ve got , I &apos;m not going to do that .
So if you want to be better , you have to press you and do your part .
Okay . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , I don &apos;t do anything .
I &apos;m going to go to write the same because it is my work .
And I &apos;d like to do my handle recorded that I today to do my part , &quot; because -- it &apos;s so , it &apos;s so , OK -- it &apos;s so , it &apos;s securious -- the people would raduned for the North Africa &apos;s wonderful , sacred and sacred sacred that they were going to have to have a hours and hours .
And they were always magnificent , because the dances were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every time , it was rarely , something happened , and one of these artists had been going to transcendent .
And I know you know what I talk about , because I know you &apos;ve all seen it , at a point , a performance .
It was like the time he stopped , and the dance ballerin a kind of walking , and it was not doing anything about it , like the 1,000 night before , and it was all .
And sudden not just like a human .
But it turns out from the dedriver and under the fire in the fire of divinity .
And when this happened , to the time , people knew what was , people knew what was , called it with her name .
They were congioned the hands and began to sing , &quot; Allah , Allah , God , Allah , God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
He was the historic night -- when the Morororic was Spain , they took this habitude with them and pronoundary changed in the centuries by &quot; Allah , Allah , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Of , run in the flew . &quot;
In Spain , when an artist did something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , run , bully , Allah , magnificent , broken , this -- a God score .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes the day after , for the dance himself , when you wake up and discovered that are the 11 of Martedesday and discource it &apos;s 11 .
It &apos;s just a mortal with great ginocy to the knee , and maybe never going to be able to get to the altitude .
And mayor nobody &apos;s name will sing God as it &apos;s gone , and what &apos;s going to do with rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most sweatest sweet sweet in a creative life .
But maybe not to be so angoscial if you can &apos;t believe , in fact , that the most extraordinary aspects of your own being coming from you .
But it just makes you just get data in a unimaginable , from an inimaginable inable source of this squish of your life you have to go to something else when you &apos;ve finished .
And , you know , if we think it all changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s sure as I thought about it for different months in the workers , which we have been doing the president , the dangerous , I spare , the dangerous , and I would have been followed by my graduate success .
And what I have to keep saying when I feel electrized by this is , not to fear .
Don &apos;t beaving you . It just your work .
Continuates to present you for your part , any one can be .
If your work is baling , ballow .
If the wind , absurd to you assigned to leave some kind of wonder , some kind of wonderful , for one moment through your efforts , &quot; then , &quot; Okay ! &quot;
You do the same dance .
And &quot; Okay ! &quot; Since . &quot;
I think about it , and I think you have to teach it .
&quot; You know , &quot; With you , even for you to have human and test lovely , you know , you &apos;re going to present you continually .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I &apos;ve already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what it can meant and discovery of new set of genes .
Now we &apos;re starting a new patent : We started to digitizing biology and now to start from that digital code we &apos;re moving into a new biology , designing and synthesizing and synthesizing life .
We &apos;ve always been trying to ask big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; is something that many biologists I think they &apos;re trying to understand various landscape .
We tried to have different approaches , reducing it to the minimes .
We &apos;re digitizing for almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome to go from the analog world of the digital biology world of the digital world of the computer .
Now we can regenerate life , or make life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome of those that can authority in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome to create a more smaller .
We &apos;re able to eliminate a hundred of genes about 500 of them that are here .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple respect to our .
I think me , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at a time , it &apos;s very improbable that this can get to a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to design was to synthesize this chromosome in a way that we could modify the components to bring some of these questions .
So we started the adventure of &quot; Can we synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
Can chemistry to produce these great molecules that we never have been able to create before now ?
And in case , can we make a comous crowd ?
A chromosome is simply a piece of inert material .
The speed that we can digitive life is growing up with life is growing to exponential .
Our ability to write the genetical code , instead , progress ram rather , but it &apos;s better .
And our recent recent recent returning the bringing to a exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process has required many passionate pass , starting with a bioethic reatences before the experiments .
But we found that DNA is very difficult .
There are dealing thousands of machines in the world that produce small , the long time of DNA , of 30 to 50 letters and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the more than the segment is , the more errors there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments and correct the mistakes .
And that was our first attemptership , to start from digital information of Phi &apos;s genome of Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , actually , the correction of the mistakes and get a molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material chemical material , and we put it in the bacteria , the bacteria started to read this genetic code and produced the viral particles .
The viral particles have been released by cells , are come back and they destroyed E. coli .
I &apos;ve been talking to recently members of the oil industry , and they &apos;re told this model .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build its hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things larger .
We wanted to build the entire battery of the bacteria .
They are over 580 midle of genetic code .
So we thought we had to build it in cassette of the virus of the virus , so that we could change the cassette components of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information , they have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accurateful standard was a mile for every 10 mile base .
We found , we &apos;d discovered it , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence that original sequence we would never be able to do that work .
One part of the process is to design set up 50 letters that you overall the other sides of 50 letters to build fighting tiny , smaller than it is working together .
We &apos;re going to see unique elements here .
You probably have read that we put on the crab .
So , think of it : we have a genetic code based on four letters : As , C , G and T.
Three of the letters code together , and there &apos;s a specific adminus of letters for every amine letters for every amine amine .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frastruck thoughts .
What we did at the beginning was self-care .
Some were deluses that were not poetry .
We designed these segments to simply them to get to join with enzymes .
There are enzymes that they reputs them .
And we started assemble to assemble parts , starting with five to seven ments from five to seven thoughtful segments of 24 mile letters to get to it to get to 72 mile .
We have produced these segments in abundance so we could sequenced to sequence that we &apos;re trying to create a very robust , and we &apos;re going to see a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems to the tabellone playbloon .
When we get to these very long segments , more than 100 midle , they &apos;re not going to grow more directly in E.
It comes to the limit of modern molecular biology .
So we looked at other mechanisms .
We knew a mechanism called a homologic ination , which is in biology to repair DNA to repair DNA can get the seats .
Here &apos;s one example .
This organism , called Deinococcus , it can absorb three million rad of radiation .
You can see in the superior as his chromosome as his chromosome is destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s been refully as before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can get completely .
They can live under empty .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life exists in space , and you move to find new environments of water .
Actually , NASA showed that this happens .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built these processed , just using the lievening with the appropriate design of the appropriate segments to put .
The lievening them assembs .
This image wasn &apos;t taken with a electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are photographs that cover a period of six seconds .
This is the published we did a little time ago .
They are more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the biggest molecule of a definitely ever created by man .
It &apos;s got a molecular molecular superior to 300 million .
If we prove it with a paper to 10 without spaces , it would like 142 pages to transcriting this genetic code .
Now , how do we do that ? How can we do that ?
Of course , through a virus is a virus is a game from boys .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s simpler even when it &apos;s about the eucariots and how our : you can just extract the nucleo and put up the nucleo and put another , which is basically the process of clonely clonically the process of clonely clonically the process of clonely clonely , when it &apos;s about clonely clonically the process of clonce .
In the bacteria , the cromosome is integrated inside the cell , but we &apos;ve just shown that we &apos;ve demonstrated that we can do a complete transplant to one and activity .
We &apos;ve got a chromosome from a microbial species .
The two are different are how men from topes .
We &apos;ve added some gene in more way that we could decide what to chromosome for this chromosome .
He then slightly with enzymes in a way to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was study -- and you &apos;ll be become our graphic graphic -- the new cromosome graphic -- the new cromosome .
And we thought we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we &apos;ve tried to get more .
This is one of the greatest mechanisms .
We found that many species have added a second or a third or a third or a third chromosome somewhere , add in a second thousands of of the species .
So , who thinks about evolution as a gene at a time that has no understood a lot of the biology .
They are enzymes called &quot; &quot; restriction enzymes that addition digerism .
The chromosome that was in the cell .
The cell phone that &apos;s cellula--insert .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other cromous as extraneous material , and he was sticated , and we found it with only the cell and the new chromosome .
it became blue because of the genes we &apos;ve inserious .
And in a short time , all the characteristics of a species , and you lost , and it turned out of all into a new species , based on the new software that we put in the cell .
All the proteins are changed , the membranananes are changed , and when we read the genetics code exactly what we &apos;ve transfer .
Now , this might look like genetics , but altering the software . We can change things in a way to change things in a way .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that there is not talking about genesus -- but I can rest by three million and a half million of evolution , and I &apos;ve already said that maybe we &apos;re going to create new version of the Cambrian explosion of this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty obvious when we think about our needs .
We &apos;re going to go to six billion and a half of people at nine billion in the next 40 years .
Just to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one in 1946 ; in 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medicinal and gas , medicinal and a half of people .
It &apos;s going to be more hard to do that nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion , more than 30 billion barray .
That means million barrels a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replaces , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
We have to have to hold all the emission of CO2 from these materials that ends up in the atmosphere .
At the day today , because of the scientific discoveries around the world , we have a database with about 20 million of genes , and I like to think that they are the designed components for the future .
The electronic industry is only a dozen about a dozen about it , and think about how many different things came out .
Our limitation is basically from biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , thank you for these metods of synthesization , able to create what we call combinatory genomic synthemselves .
We &apos;re able to build a big robots that can produce a big robots a day .
Think of processing these 20 million of genes or try to optimize the processes to produce the processes to produce the processes , we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create molecular biology , which is now in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for a possibility of survival , production or carburn , production of vaccines .
This is an instantly of some of software program about being able to sit and design species to species to be able to sit and design species to the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know necessarily how they &apos;re going to be .
We know exactly what they &apos;re going to do is their genetic code .
We &apos;re now focused on the carbons of how much generation .
You &apos;ve seen that you extract ethanol from the gry grain was a very bad experiment .
We have a second and third generation that are going to use enough to do a carbon of sugar to sugar on the higher or different types of butants .
But the only way that biology can have a great impact without more than the food and limited the cost of food and limitation the cost of food and limitation is to transform CO2 in matter , before we &apos;re working to design cells that can achieve this , and we think we can actually get this scale , and we think we could have the first carbons of what we can do is , and we think we could have the first carbons of that are .
The solar light combined with CO2 is a methodownloaded -- but in our discoveries all over the world , we found different methods .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , about 2500 meters of deep at the time of the water temperature of the water temperature .
It &apos;s creating the way by CO2 using hydrogen as a source of energy source .
We &apos;re trying to figure out if we can put CO2 , which can easily be transported through your toubt , convert that CO2 in carburn , to drive this process .
So we think we might be able to clear what we could increase to increase what the base of the base of what life is . &quot; We , &quot; We have the objective , we have the objective of replacing the whole oil industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can you do it from ?
It would have a main source of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working to use the same methods to create vaccines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with the influence , we &apos;re always always behind a year and with a dollar in until it &apos;s going to be .
I think that that it can change building vaccines in anticype .
That &apos;s how the future could start to look like changing , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria , and finally the eucariote .
We &apos;re so much from better to improve people .
Our purpose is to make it very long enough to try to try to get to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;ll show you , the most quickly possible , some fundamental work , some new technology that we took to Microsoft in the followed to a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s an environment where you can interact is at local level that remote with a huge amount of data .
Here we &apos;re seeing a lot of gabyte photograph gigap with a kind of zoom expensive , and continually , for a panoramic speed , imes the images of images , how we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these collective collection is .
Most of digital photographs , but this is a scan of example is a scanning from Biblioteca of the Congress , and it turns into the gama of 300 megapiel .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that &apos;s the only thing that &apos;s the number of pators on your screen in your screen in any moment . It &apos;s also a very flexible architecture .
This is a whole book , you know , not of images .
This is Dickens of Dickens . Every colonnail is a capital .
To show you that it &apos;s about text and not images , we can do something like this , to see really , it &apos;s about a real representation of the text of text , not a photograph .
It could be a little artificial to read a book to read a book electronic book .
Don &apos;t recommend it .
This is a more realistic . It &apos;s a lot of the Guardian .
Every big image is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure of the wonderful experience of a magazine or a newspaper , which is for nature a lot of median .
We &apos;ve also done something with the corner of this particular number of the Guardian .
We created a high-resoluutionary high-resoluutionary -- much higher than what you use in a published normal advertising .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see it .
Or other models , or even the specific specific .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hopefully that this means to the pop-up and other similar cheries , they should not be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this not , I don &apos;t want to lose time , if we don &apos;t have to say that we have contribution to this field .
These are all the streets in the United States . It &apos;s about a geospatial image of NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually from the web . It &apos;s actually from the web ; you can see it .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon , and the other is a visual search in Noah Snavely , a student of the University of Washington , with the help of Steve Seitz of UW and Resezeliski of Microsoft Research Seliski .
And it &apos;s from the web , he &apos;s been drawn by Seadragon .
You can see , when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from a image to another image and have this kind of experience to multiple resolution .
But the space location of images here has actually a meaning .
The computer algorithms of visualization , they have these images together , so that corresponds to the real places that the real scattle -- all the close to the real crowd Montne Rocket Montne Rocket Montne Rockcial Montagne Reales . So this dogs of a slides of a slides of a slandscape of imaging , and these things have been all related to the whole space level .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some more environment .
There are some much more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original Soahs -- and this is from a previous precedented Photosynth of Photosynth that we &apos;ve done done last summer , to show you what I think is really the key is the key behind this technology , Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily , and it &apos;s not necessarily watching the environments that we have in the site .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a rebuilding of Noththree . Do images images in Flickr . It &apos;s a Nothtrial . It &apos;s digitating Nothtrial and you get images of types in magic , and so on . Every one of these arancions represents a picture that &apos;s discovered .
So , they &apos;re all images took from Flickr and they were all related to space in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this way we simply .
You know , I would never have thought to end up for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifying to get this kind of access here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of different kinds of things to focams : from those of the cell phones to the professional cellphone , put together in this environment .
And if I can , try to get those more strange .
Many are blocked by faces , etc .
Somewhere there is a series of photographs -- here .
This is a Nothtrial Dame registered .
We can go from the physical poster of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is taking data from a beautiful memory of how the earth , from the entire collective , from the point of vision -- and connected those data together .
All those photographs become linked , greater than the sum of the parts .
You have a ground model of the earth that emerges .
Think of this as a Stephen Lawler &apos;s work on the virtual Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as people use it , and the people uses to , and the advantages for people who use it .
Their photographs are marcrowed by other people .
If someone comes to contract all these sets saying the name , my photograph of Nothtrial . And I can suddenly get up of all that data , and I can use as a point of all that data , and I can use as a point to , and I can use a point of set , using the photograph of anything else , and having a social experience of anybody else , and have a social experience of the cross-moded ,
Of course , a consequence of all that are extremely elaborate els of every part of the land , you collect not only from airplanes and from images and satellitary images and satellitary memory .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I understand what your software it &apos;s going to have to do is that , in the next few years , all the photographs that somewhere in the next few years , all the photographs that are going to be connected ?
BA : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is basically to find .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want to cut , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it at base to the images .
What it becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of the sea of set of information that many of these images can be .
As when you make a research on on the web , you get a sentence and the web on the web page has a lot of information about the images .
Now , what happens if that photograph is all your photograph ?
So the amount of seant interconnection and the amount of wealth that &apos;s really huge is really enormous . It &apos;s a classical effect .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible . Computers .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure , when you travel and one of the ethnographical research is the power of the people who have not forget ancient , between the past in the wind , the past in the wind , the past is in the wind , he &apos;s going to be in the foods .
Basts , the Jaguar Jaguar , still beyond the Via Lattea , or that Inuit &apos;s myths are still more meaning , or that in Himalaya , the buddists the breath of Dharma , to remember the importance of the central of the anthropy of the anthropology , and that the idea that the world we live in a living model . But it &apos;s just a model , but it &apos;s just a model ,
the consequence of a particular set of a particular set that our stirraw , well or bad , many generations ago .
And of course , we all share the essential ones .
All we all do . We all procreating .
We are subjects in the beginning .
We have to have to death the inexorability of death , so we don &apos;t surprises if we sing and balance --
We all have an art .
What it &apos;s the song is the particular rhythm of song , the dance of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that they are the Penan forests of Borneo , or the folloaces of Haiti , or the followers of the Kaisut settled Kairs , the Curset in Kaids were Ands , or a camelsewhere .
He was my journey in the desert a month ago , or a month ago , or a yak of yak in the vallees of the Everest , the Mother Everest , the world &apos;s mother .
All these populations teach us that there are other ways of thinking , more ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , and other ways of moving in the world .
And if you reflected a moment , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
So , together , the myriadies of the world create a girl nature of spiritual life and cultural life that it &apos;s important for the well-being the planet as biological as the planet as biological as a biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural girl as a nosphere , and you can call the etnosphere , the total such as a total subject , dreams , ideas , dreams , inspirations , intuitions , intuitions , to be from the human imagination from the human imagination .
etnosphere is the fantastic patrimony of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how inquisitive .
And because the biosphere was gravelly consumed as a biosphere , and unfortunately , and it very quickly .
Nobody , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species is about the extinction of the extinction of extinction because it &apos;s fallowed , or -- in the most open-up hypothesis , and not even close to the most optimistic diversity -- and that &apos;s not even the most optimistic ,
The indicate of all that is , of course , loss loss .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not just composed by a vocabulary or a series of grammatical rules .
One language is the bake of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the medium with which the animal of every culture is in the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a thought , a thought , a thought , a spiritual ecosystem of possibility .
And the 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re sitting in Monterey , at least half is not sushed in the ears of children .
They don &apos;t get to the children , which means , not not to walk , unless they &apos;re death .
What is more sad about being being being happened by the silence , to be the last to talk to a language , not having a language , not having a way to get the wisdom of the living wisdom of the kids ?
This is a phrase , it &apos;s state of somewhere in the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks , and it takes with it the tomb of a ancient language .
And I know somebody will say , &quot; In &apos;t it better ?
The world would not be a better place if we all parasked the same language ? &quot; We all talk about yoruba , then we all talk yoruba .
Let &apos;s talk .
You &apos;re going to cover a sudden thing to say .
I &apos;d like to do a journey through ethnosphere --
a little trip in the ethnosphere to give you a massive of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , &quot; different ways of existing , &quot; I really mean different ways of existing .
Let &apos;s take for example this Barasana &apos;s in Amazon , in Amazon , which believe the population of anaconda , which believe at myth of the latte of the west slatte in the sandwatch of several sacres .
It &apos;s a population that &apos;s not able to distinguished the blue color blue from the green , because the time cell of the forest , which depends the population .
They have a linguist and a marriage , called &quot; exactly &quot; , &quot; Linguistic exactly , &quot; you have to move a person that talks about a language .
All of this radical past , though the particularly , the particularly is that in these extended families , extent of the extent , they &apos;re seven or seven because of the mysts none languages .
They limited to listening and then they start to talk .
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived , the Waoran of Ecuador Eastern Eastern Eastern mind , a population that had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionary , they &apos;ve been trying to a commercial .
They &apos;ve done to make photography from the photography that reports them in a pose that this population of pleasant forest , forest that this population of the pluvial forest .
They collected the photos to the photos , they turned to the paper and , they didn &apos;t find anything , they have concled it that they were about diaby , and they killed the five missionary .
But Waorans don &apos;t only kill the stranieters .
They were killed to each other .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by them .
We &apos;re sitting on eight generations and we found two cases of death , and when we &apos;ve been insisted to know , they &apos;ve had a lot of them , they &apos;ve got a lot of them , and then they killed it . And then they killed it . Then every way , they had a very forest .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine by 40 steps and recognize species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned a very interesting tassigned when my Harvard of Harvard , he asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti in the secret societies , and Tonton the power of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutout-of-the-modered , and I imposed to the zombie .
To make sense of the miraculous , I should have to understand the Vodoun culture and that Vodoun is not magic .
It &apos;s a very much way of a measure complex of the world .
Very interesting .
If I asked you to say the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Budhism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has no religious feeling . And instead , and Voodoo is not more than the distilled of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these very profit diaspora diaspora .
What makes the voodoo is the intense is intense between life and death .
So , the vive they &apos;re getting the spirits .
The spirits can be invocated by the Great Aqua , they respond to the rhythm of the dance of the dance of the dance of the living soul in such the following .
So , the voodoohisti love to say , &quot; You go to wap to God .
We &apos;re going to give in the temple and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re possessed to you , as you can do it , as you can do you do the bad ?
So you &apos;re asking these incredible events : follow voodoo in state of trance that touches ines touches infuried a demonstration of the mind when it &apos;s catalyzed in a state of extremely exciting .
As all the populations that I lived the most extraordinary people in the Sierra Nevada Sierra Marta , in Colombia .
Trade of ancient civilization , which was a caraibic planten planns of the Colombia , the population was waiting , the population was wonderful vulcandy that &apos;s herself on the career massive planning .
In a drug continent of blood , this population never been conquered by the paper .
And so , they &apos;re governmental today , they &apos;re government to be extraordinary .
The young people followed away from the families to three or four , and they live in a world that they live in a good world , and they live in a world made of the glacier base for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years of exactly to reproduce nine months of gestation that transcorner in the user of mother , now are metaphorically in the Great Mther .
For all this time , they are acculated to the values of their society , values that predicted their prayers and only their prayers their prayers , they keep the cosmic balance -- or to say the ecological balance .
At term of this incredible initiation , they &apos;re improved to take out and for the first time in the 18 years , they see a dawn . And that &apos;s the first bag . And that &apos;s the first bag , when the sun bag , when the sun bings the values of the beautiful landscape , and it says , &quot; The precigent a step beautiful dried back and says , &quot; The prefer a step behind , and says , &quot; The prevent behind a pass a pass back and says , &quot; The predays a step beautiful time ,
&quot; As that ? Proprion ? &quot;
It &apos;s study . Now it &apos;s now protection it &apos;s . &quot;
They &apos;re called the greatest frroom and say that we , frrothers , we &apos;re the holds of the world .
This is extremely important .
When we think about Indigene populations and environment Rously , and the old story of the vage of the vage of the novel , which is a raztist of the simplicity or maybe we invoded to be , and we say that these people are more closer to the Earth of us .
Indigenes are not not not sentimental people are not indebult by nostalgets .
There is no space for these things in the Asmat Afat or in the clear , or in the winds of Tibet , but thanks to time and reputs , they created a mystic of the Earth is not about the concept of being consciously , the concept that the Earth can only live in the human consciousness .
What does it mean ?
Vuoddge that a little girl who grows up in the mountain is a spirit of Apu that &apos;s going to be a deep human being deeply different and have a very different ratives and it &apos;s going to have a very different mountain , and that place that place in a Montana growing up with a Montanana growing up with a Montanky .
which is the beautiful deal of a spirit or a mineral cave .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Britannic creating that the forests serve forests to be cut .
And that I got a human being different human being from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the forests are the dimora of Hukuk and the paradise of the paradise and the cannery that live in the world , they deal with the world , they deal with the Hamatsa ,
If you start to consider that these cultures can actually create different reality , you can start to understand some of them , you can start to understand some of them , we &apos;re going to be able to understand some sensitive .
I took this photograph in the nororoccasionally .
Mayahuge some of you have heard about the Eurring , the most powerful psychoactive of the repertoire .
What makes the eyahuge is not the pharmacological potential of suscence , but his elaboration . It &apos;s composed by two elements .
From a side , this liver lignosa series of expensive , harmins and harmine , harmins and harmful such hallucinogens .
Trying the only plants a smooth smooth that alters a little bit of consciousness , but it &apos;s mixed with the leaves of a class of the family of coffee .
This plants , the triptamines , very similar to serotonin , dimethoxyn-five , methoxydimethoxydimethoxydimethoxydimethoxydimethoxydimethoxydimethoxydimethoxydimethoxydimethods .
If you &apos;re going to see Yanomami to nose the susp of the suscity that they do from a different species , which is contains methoxydimethoxydimethoxydimethoxydimethoxydimethoxydimethods .
Tiring that policy on for the nose is a little bit like being disappear by a file of the barotherer and land on a gap of electricity . It &apos;s not a distortion of reality . It &apos;s not creates a distortion of reality .
I was often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who wrote the psychedelic was , with his discovery of the fungi &apos;s hallucinogens in the &apos; 30 in Mexico .
And the way I can &apos;t class this can &apos;t classified these triptames like hallucinogens because if you &apos;re doing you can &apos;t tell anybody to be kinated . And triptamp can &apos;t be absolutely because they &apos;re money atures . And you can &apos;t be absolutely find out in a fy-to-, deep , deal with the intestine , deed a a nice that &apos;s obsid-odd .
It &apos;s possible to the orally only if you under other chemical such chemical of the MAO .
Now it &apos;s the beautiful : the carboline that is in this lian inibitors of MAO , the same kind of necessary to be able to potentiate triptamines . The question surprines : in a 80-species , how are these people to find them are in this way , create a biochemes , and if you do in this way , creating a biochemical version that &apos;s himic .
We use the great eufemism of the providing and error , which can reveal infruit .
But if we ask Indian , they &apos;ll say , &quot; Plls are talking about . &quot;
What does it mean ?
This tribe , the Cofan , has 17 variety of the Elubris , which distinguished in the forest , and that our eyes would required in the same species .
If you ask him how they &apos;re going to say , &quot; I thought , &quot; I thought I was going to say , &quot; I thought I could do you know , &quot; I said , &quot; No .
The solution is : they take the 17 variety in a night of moon and each one will sing with a different tone .
With this is not laurea Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting to count the printing pright .
Now , &#91; in the &#93; thing is that the problem is that also the people of us who have to have the history of the people are painting in the world , but somehow reducts the margines of our real world , and pass .
In fact , the 19th century , 300 years , it &apos;s not remembered for its wars its wars or technological innovations , but rather like the was where we stop and we have abbractively or waste accepted or passively , or waste cultural destruction of the planet . Now the problem is not change .
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibility of life .
And the problem is not technology .
Indians Sioux , they didn &apos;t stand to be Sioux when they put up as they were , like recess to be American when they stop as they have been saying American when they put up and hot .
It &apos;s not the technology that threatening the integrity of ethnosphere .
The flexide of domination .
And if you look at the world , you &apos;ll discover that these are not destined cultures are not destined to disappear .
They are creatures and dynamics out of the existence of the existable forces that go beyond their ability of adaptation .
And it &apos;s a disbosing in the paths of the Penan --
a population of Sarawak , in the South Asian , a population , a population that lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to the fighting of the figures , where you can see the river , where you can see the river of the Borneo . And the way it looks like Borneo in Morneo .
It &apos;s about the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that have come with the gold .
If we move on the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing many research , you see the ward flights of political domination .
As you know the genocide , physical extinction of a population , is condamaged to universal level , but the ethnic of a population , not just convicted , but it &apos;s celebrate in in certain in the environment , because it &apos;s a part of the development of development .
And you can &apos;t understand the Tibet suffering until you &apos;re in the beginning .
I &apos;ve been putting the 6,000 miles from China in the West China in the West China , and coming to Lhasa with a young , and I &apos;ve got to Lhasn with a young , but only came to Lhasa , I &apos;ve got to understand what &apos;s statistics we &apos;re going to talk about .
6,000 thousacred sacred to drive and cening .
1.2 million people killed from the military Revolution .
The dad of this guy was ascritically at the Panches .
which means that it was killed to the time of the Chinese invasion .
Her uncle with Santity in Santity in the diaspora that has taken the people in Nepal .
His mother was imprisoned and his colpatent was a rich .
It was taken to carry in the age of two years , hiding to her age at two hunder his crop , because he couldn &apos;t have lived .
The sister , who made the same , was put it in the field of reeducation .
One day , he &apos;s made a fashion a drop , and , for this transgression , it was put forced to the force for seven years .
The Tibet of the Tibet can be insporky , but the spirit redentor of the population is from tener .
At the end , it all reduce a choice .
We want to live in the world world &apos;s world &apos;s world of the monotony or we want to accept the policromatically policycle world of diversity ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before we die said that his biggest fear was that , in our living to this vision of the world , we &apos;re not just going to see the whole whole whole ama limited limited modality of thinking , but one day we &apos;re wake up to a day we &apos;re going to have to be able .
And it &apos;s humiliating that our species is existed for 600,000 years .
The Revolution Revolution , which has given us the agriculture , which has done us to socket the sea of the sea , and replacing the poem of the slip with the next to the cler , creating the hierarchy of specialization , and we &apos;re talking about 10,000 years ago .
The industrialized world has 300 years .
That slightly history , not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we &apos;re going to have to go .
When these myriadies of the world is asked what it means to say to being human , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers we all have the possibility of being what we are : a consciously consciously , that has to make all the population , which has to make all the people and all the gardens can floor .
I took this photograph on the north of Baffin , when I went to care with Inuit , when I went to dalong with Inuit , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , he told me the wonderful story of her grandfather .
The canadvance of the Canail government was always gentile with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to stabilie our own own colonies .
The grandfather refused to go .
The family , tempting for his life , he brought him away , and all his own attractive , and all its attractive .
You have to know that Inuit doesn &apos;t feel the cold , they suspect .
The slices of the slitte in originally , they were made of paper .
The grandfather did not put on the arctic night , or from arctic night , or from the arctic night .
It &apos;s wired , you &apos;ve got the broken pulated the pinks in the foca and defecated in their hand . When I did the frozen , they work creating a model .
He spring up on the dots of this clean college , and when he was solid , he killed a dog .
He schools the dog and created a bright , with the actual cassy has created a slaughter , he gets a sleep , and it &apos;s gone on the banchisa , and it &apos;s gone on the banchisa , and it &apos;s sandwap , and he &apos;s made a slip , and he &apos;s made a broken a , and he &apos;s made a bright .
We want to talk about cavarsely ?
In 1999 , the canadvance , the canadvance has redded to Inuit the total control of a area of territory and Texas a ground of California and Texas a broader .
It &apos;s their new patria . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a territory territory . They contrict all the minerary resources .
One slands of the national slumber .
And , finally , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious to be at least who of us was in these remote zones of the planet , make remote they &apos;re not remote .
For somebody is home .
They know , they &apos;re seeping the human imagination that are rising at the days of the time . And for us , the dreams of these children , as all our children , become part of the swimming .
Finally , we are National Geographic we are convinced that politicians will never come to anything .
We believe that polemy --
&#91; Applauses &#93; are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month our site realisite realized . We &apos;re going to have 35 million of visit .
156 countries transmit our television .
Our required by millions of people .
Our work is to travel in the ethnosphere to bring our public in places of wonderful cultural and mulths , they will be hopefully , they will hopefully , they will be able to get the central revealing of the anthropology of the anthropology , and we have to find a lifestyle in the diversity of the world and multicultural world to be in a pluralist and my-mytaking style world in a pluralist and myed ,
where the wisdom of all the population can contribute to our collective well-being .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope record to another one that I &apos;ve heard and evidentiate some connection , in the case of the connection .
I &apos;d like to start with what I call &quot; the dogma officer . &quot;
The dogm uffices of what ?
The dogma officer of all the Western industrial societies . The dogma such as we want to male the well-being of our citizens &quot; &quot; The way to be to male the individual freedom . &quot;
The reason is , from a side , in the fact that freedom is in itself a value , is precious , it &apos;s essential , essential , essential , essential , essential , essential , essential , is essential , is essential , is essential , is essential , is essential , it &apos;s essential , is essential , is essential , is essential , is essential , is essential ,
At the other is that if we &apos;re free , each of us can act to do everything that massive , and we can do everything that massive , without any one that we decided to name our .
The way to massive freedom is to massive the choice .
More people have more to free , more to be free , and greater is their liberty , greater is their liberty , greater is their well-being .
I think , it &apos;s so deeply radical in the society that nobody would dream to put it in a doubt .
And it &apos;s also deeply radical in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what the progress has made possible .
This is my supermarketing . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;ll be a simple note on a simple note on .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conducts , without content , without content , and 12 acets of oil and 12 acets of oil and 12 acres that you can buy to buy a number of conments in the rest of your degree 75 , you can buy a huge number of your degree .
So that &apos;s what the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic stereo to buy a stereo : case , the CD , plastra , plasks , amplify , amplify .
And in this single electronic store , there &apos;s a great number of components .
We can make six and a half million of combinations that there are in a store .
You have to admit that there &apos;s a lot of choice .
Other camps : the world of communications .
Once I was a child , they could get all the phone services , they could get all the phone services , they were provided by mama Bell .
He was naked the phone , they didn &apos;t buy it .
One of that one consequence of that , the phone was never remarkable .
These times have gone .
We have a variety of phones , especially between cellphones .
Here &apos;s the cell phones of the future .
My favorite is in the midle , My leter , cut of the nose , and it forces to the brull critical eye .
If you don &apos;t have seen it in the store under the house , you &apos;re just looking for you to get it .
And what happens is that the end is that people get into the stops and does this question . And you know what is the answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too many things .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the acquire of the aques , you actually green the same explosion of choices .
Asitary health : Don &apos;t happen in the United States you go from the doctor and the doctor , you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , could we do it , or B , &quot; At , &quot; has these benefits , &quot; B has these benefits . &quot;
You say , &quot; Dr. &quot; What should I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; It &apos;s got these benefits , and these benefits , and they have these benefits . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebats , &quot; Dr. &quot; If she was me , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result of it called it autonomy of the malate , &quot; expression that it seems to look like a beautiful thing .
But it &apos;s actually not that one is that you can move the weight and responsibility to someone who knows something , which is the doctor , someone else that doesn &apos;t know -- and it &apos;s not in the ideal condition to make decisions that real real patient to make decisions the patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing products , directly to people like me and you , if you think about it &apos;s not a sense , because we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them them , why can they published them ?
The answer is that they want to ask to change it .
Something so fundamental as our identity is becoming a question of choice , like you see in this visual . &quot; We don &apos;t want children to force children . They &apos;re going to care their sex right now , &quot; We &apos;re going to get it . We &apos;re going to get to invent .
And we can reinvent how many times we get to get .
That means that every morning , to be able to the kind of risk , you have to decide that kind of person want to be .
I &apos;m putting at the family and marriage , a time perspective , slightly for anyone , it was that you would have the most soon as you could , and he started to get the most possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not even what to do after .
So , it &apos;s all really to play .
I teach them at very smart students , and I do the 20 percent of work in less than a time .
And not because they &apos;re not not smart , because they &apos;re not not going to be diligent .
but why I &apos;m impensive , I mean , &quot; I should go or not ? &quot;
&quot; Are I going to have to myself more ? I have to think about the kids or career ? &quot;
They are logorant .
And they &apos;re trying to answer these questions , even though this implement , not to completing the compassignment and not get a beautiful vote to my exam .
And they have to actually do that . I &apos;m important questions .
Now , the work : we are lucky , like Carl undergraduate , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from the Hotel Randolph .
I &apos;m talking about , there &apos;s a angle , and I &apos;m not going to say anybody , where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t say , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , this incredible freedom of choice we have to continually decide , we have to continually decide , and we have to continually decide , if we have to work or not .
We can go to our boy , playing the cell phone in a pocket , Blackberry in the other , and the niebook , and the niebook , task about gynocy .
And even though they &apos;re all spend , every minute that we see our son , we also see our boy , we also asking , &quot; Do I answer this called ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? I have to care this literate ? &quot;
And even when the answer is no , &quot; that makes the experience of your son experience of your son &apos;s experience of your son of a very different conditions .
So , any part of the look , small , little and big materials , and life is a living , life is a question of choices , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : Ovally , there were some possibility , but not all was a question of choice .
The world today is like this : The dilemma is : &quot; Is it a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Scial .
So we all know , so we all know about that . So I &apos;m going to talk about that negative .
All this choice is two effects of two negative effects on people .
The first one , paradoxally is that it produces paralysis that it &apos;s produced .
And many options between which choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I offer you an expensive example : a study conduct of voluntary thinking .
A college has access to the Vanguard of the Vanhead , with about a million of sources , with about a million of climents in 2000 , companies .
What she found was that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of adjail , the percentage of adjesion ,
With 50 funds of offering , there &apos;s 10 percent of adesions of them about when I &apos;m available only when I &apos;m available only .
because with 50 funds between which you choose , it &apos;s malethical to decide , and the choice is re-sent to decide , and the choice is re--up .
And to tomorrow , and again , tomorrow , domananances , of course , domanances never come .
You can &apos;t say that it means that these workers are going to eat for dogs because they &apos;re not going to have enough money , it also means that decision is so obstic that they also lose the complementary of work .
They &apos;re not participating , they &apos;re losing to five dollars a year from work , which would be disposed to be told .
So , the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think that &apos;s that it &apos;s going to make the world .
&quot; And finally , for the etchitchup , or mayonese ? &quot;
You &apos;d like to make the right decision , if it &apos;s for the eternity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and nepink the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can avoid the paralysis and to choice , we finally have less satisfy so-dealing from the result of how we would have been with less options .
And that &apos;s for different reasons .
One of these is that with many conducts between which you choose , if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , is easy to imagine that you could make a choice that you could make a better choice . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us to drive , and the remained record to the choice , and the diminises that you could have the report of the decision , and the record of the decision ,
even when it was a very good decision .
More choices are , more it &apos;s easy to displease of any details that it &apos;s insodently insodently .
And also , there is what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has clear very well practices like the value we &apos;re going to depends on what we confrontation .
Feless , when there are many options , it &apos;s easy to represent the towards of the alternative , and be less satisfied and be less satismile of opposed that is choice .
Here &apos;s one example . I &apos;m just going to be in New York .
But that &apos;s what you would probably think .
There &apos;s this copy copy .
A place of luxury .
It &apos;s all about it . It &apos;s all about them .
It &apos;s not lack . But what he thought is , &quot; Well , malediition , it &apos;s Agosto . &quot;
&quot; All my neighbors in Manhattan are away . &quot;
&quot; I could speak in front of home . &quot;
And it &apos;s going to go through two weeks that it &apos;s losing -- every day -- every day -- every day -- the possibility of to parking where it wants .
The cost-opportunity cost-opportunity for what we have , even when the choice was eccellent .
And the more of the options that we have to look at , the more actress the action of the actual characteristics .
Here &apos;s another example .
This visual gives us a lot of things .
It &apos;s about the time , and maybe it &apos;s maybe it &apos;s about .
But the most important point is that any thing you choose , you choose to not do other .
The things that we don &apos;t choose have a lot of attractive activity that we do .
Third : spiral growth of expectations .
I tried it on my skin , comparing a new jeans .
I &apos;m going to almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were one kind of a kind of bad , they were scomfortable , they were scomfortable , they were scomfortable , they were scomfortable to go well .
So I went to buy a couple new when the old one , and I said , &quot; I &apos;m going to have to do a couple of jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Lave them it wants slim , fasy fit , fit , relaxy and fit ? &quot;
Web it with the ground or with the ground ? &quot; Stonewashed , &quot; or &quot; acidwashed &quot; ? &quot;
&quot; Lave them it ? &quot;
&quot; Sow the basic news or stretched ? Bla bble bla -- &quot; He was in the way to elencing .
I was saying , &quot; I want to say , &quot; I want the guy , &quot; I want the guy that -- which was the only guy was the only guy . &quot; He had no idea what was , so for a time I had all the disease , and then I got out of the best , I &apos;m sure , with the best , with the best landscape , with the best lovers ,
It was the best . I had got the whole choice , I had got the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand that .
The reason I was worse worse is that with all that choice my expectations were altissit , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was though tiny expectations . I didn &apos;t expect anything about it was , but when there was only one of them , but when I saw 100 different , lacks , at least a kind of perfect .
What I had buy was good , but I wasn &apos;t perfect .
After the choose to the choose with what I was trying to insodently confrontation .
The advance of options in people lives don &apos;t do that to increase expectations that these have respect of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of people don &apos;t do that .
And this will produce less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing if it makes it .
because if they knew , if you know , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth of the truth of this .
&quot; It was better when you were worse when you were worse . &quot; The reason why he was better when you were worse when you were worse , it was that when you were worse , it was still possible to meet surprising .
Ogyday , in the world we live -- opulents , industrialized industrialized citizens with the perfection of perfection -- the most things are about the height of the expectations .
You never surprised because your expectations , my expectations , they &apos;re injured .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Basse expectations , &quot; Yes , you want . &quot;
I mean , little moment , a little moment , which I &apos;m really moved and my wife is really study .
I couldn &apos;t have done better , I didn &apos;t know .
But it &apos;s not always a good thing .
Finally , a consequence of the comfortable a couple of jeans is that when you &apos;re not sure , you know , you know , you know , you know , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot; The answer is clear .
The world is the responsible . What could I do you do you do ?
When there are hundreds of types , and you buy a insodle , and you ask you who are responsible , it &apos;s just as clear that the responsible responsible , it &apos;s just just clear that the responsible you .
You &apos;d have done better .
With hundreds of variety available , there &apos;s not a scuses .
So when people are decisions , even though the result is valid , they feel unsatisfying and they &apos;re going to hit .
For the last few depression is exploss in the industrialized world .
I think that a meaning factor -- not the only one , but that &apos;s important -- of this depression is that people have experiences of depression is that people have experiences .
And when they have to explain this situation they think that the colpan is them .
So the final result is that we &apos;re in general , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the officer , what we all take for good .
There is no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than it &apos;s better than it &apos;s not to come from this is not to sure a lot better of choice .
There is a critical value , magic . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m pretty sure we &apos;ve been over-free that the level that choices better .
Now , from the political point -- I have almost finished -- from political point , the nocle is the following .
What allows in the industrial society is the material wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know it &apos;s a lot of places in which the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is they have too little bit of them .
So the factory that I &apos;m talking about is a malbeing malbeing malbeing malbeing in the modern society .
And what it does depressure and arrator is this : Steve Levitt talked about how much the expensive and scomfortable scomfortable to ble-band scomfortable slaughter .
I mean , these choices , complicated and dispendent , it &apos;s not that they &apos;re just useful .
I &apos;m going to be doletery .
They &apos;re worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows a lot of choice , it would be reversed in those where people have too few possibilities , it wouldn &apos;t just be better life to be better , but also our own life .
This is what economists call a better paretian .
A redistribution of the region region it , not just to the poor people -- because of this choice in excess that comes back .
To conclude , you can become everything you want to become everything you want &quot;
You &apos;re , people of culture , you &apos;re thinking , &quot; What does that believe that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious you can &apos;t make anything in a glass . &quot;
&quot; An imagination , a limited vision of the world -- &quot;
and I interpret it , I interpret it .
But then , I realized that that fish the long time .
because the reality of the fact is that if you eat in the lie , so that , &quot; everything is possible . &quot; You can &apos;t get freedom . &quot;
If you get the broad in a way that everything become possible , you can declining .
Accentuate the paralysis , and you reduce the well-being .
They all need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too strictly , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic , and , I &apos;m afraid , for the roughly .
Thank you very much .
