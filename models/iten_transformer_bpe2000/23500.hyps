The year I showed these slide to show that the artage to show that the cotta calculus , which for almost three million years , has had the size of the U.S. continental continental , it &apos;s record-40 percent .
However , this underestimate the gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice of the ice .
The artage calculation is , in a sense , the pulsant heart of the global climate system .
It &apos;s winter and reversing ritira .
The next slide is going to be a regional carried on the last 25 years .
The ice losperensigned in red .
As you see , they expand until the wall .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter , which is retreated .
You can see that the ice cosidence , of five years , it &apos;s as the blood , it &apos;s as the blood , which is here five years from the body .
In 25 years , it was gone out of this ,
This is a problem because the interested in the entire terrain the ocean art-up , where there are enormous amount of congent carbon that , science that , science that , and they &apos;re transformed into metane from microbes .
I pull to the totality of the atmospheric inquitation , that amount could radical , that amount could radical , surgery .
In some laghi little little deep in Alasklaska methane is already from the water .
The Katey Walter Walter University of Alaska was recated team was a team of a team that I watched the winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : The question is if we &apos;re going to be .
A reason is that this term scale the term I say that this term scale the north .
This is a regime regime figures .
The carried was never reaching free .
This is Kangerlush figures , in the southwest of Greenland .
If you want to know how to the sea level of the sea switch of the ice of the ice of the sea , here is where it reaches the sea .
These rare are increasingly increasingly .
At the other part of the planet : Antartargument of the planet .
The month scientists have diclared that the ice of the ice is in negative , and the Antartis in negative , which the Antartis , which pogs on some island .
Equival 16meters of the action of the watching across , like Greenland .
Sull Himalaya , the third biggest block of ice , you see new laghi , which a few years ago , who was glacy .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population is half of the water power from that he wife .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the water power of this city .
The carried is increasingly increased .
But when it dimining , the same happens to the water .
In California , the Sierra Nevada is is deminuit of 40 percent .
The hyrices are in crisis .
The predictions , as you know , are graves .
The growth section of the world is a remarkable increase of incences .
The environmental disaster are increasing a rhythm of the normal and without precedented .
Four times more numerous than the last 30 years than the precedent 75 .
This is an unsustainable garment .
If you look at the historic context if they can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day .
Look at the East Pacific Pacific Pacific , by Americans , and on the west parts of the Indian subcontinent , where there &apos;s a radical impact of oxygen in the oceans .
Most of the global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is , 20 percent , is the use of fossil fuel .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worst .
The U.S. are one of the two countries with the world .
And it was proposed to build a lot of other central central .
But we &apos;re assisting a change of direction .
These are the annulled projects in the last few years and some of the alternative alternative .
At every way , there &apos;s a lotta political in our country .
The carbon industries and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon , which is a host host .
That picture me remember something --
Vertual Natal , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a lost of 3.8 billion floor paper scories .
You know , you &apos;ve seen it on the news .
This is the second biggest scories in America .
It happened around Natal .
The natalized nature of one of the carbon industries was this .
Video : My the carbon is a kind of allio and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and make our economy .
At the carbon is more and more and more and more and more clean .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and work and work in the style .
Al Gore : Al Gore : Al Gore &apos;s West Virginia .
The largest society in the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his ammine .
Video : Don Blankenship : Sark , Nancy Pelosy , Nancy Pelosis , Harry Reid -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Protection of the Clima Prottion has launched two campaign .
This is one of the one of them , one part .
Video : Ator : At COALergy we see climate change as a serious climate change as a serious minute .
So our priority is to invest a big amount of money in a public effort to make public strip to make public and confused the truth .
In fact , the carbon is not spores .
We think it &apos;s clean -- it also has a good profumor .
So not preocupon climate change .
Let me do .
Video : Ator : Carbone . You know -- you have you heard very much .
So let me give you a gyrate in a structure of a meeting of the carbon .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little human rumorous , but this is the sound of the car technology .
The carbon is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology , but the remarkable technology that you see that you can see everything changes .
You have a look , this is the easy technology of the carbon clean .
Al Gore : Inally , the positive alternative , the positive alternative and the security of the national security .
Video : Smove is in the crisis ; the economy , national security , national climate crisis .
The philos that the connection all of that our connections of fossil , as the paper and the oil and the oil and the oil .
Now , lost , there &apos;s a new audace for using circumstances .
Repower America : 100 percent of energy , 10 years .
A plan to repair America to make more sure , make more sure , and help to stop the global warming .
Finally , one solution that blows our problems .
Repower America . You know more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It &apos;s about reducing energy to America .
One of the fastest ways of bring up to dependence from the combustible that kills our planet .
She says the future is here . I feel , sole , a new energy network .
She talks to two : Novi investment for places of the basic places .
Since : Shot America . It &apos;s time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old old old old African says , &quot; If you want to go speed , you go to speak , you go to the sun .
If you want to go away , you go back . &quot;
We need to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
The year at TED I did a TED fecki introduction on the LHC .
And I promise to return you to go back to how machine works .
So here . And then I figure . And the other time , LHC is is the biggest experiment that was the biggest experiment -- 27 kilometers of circumstence .
Her compiece is to requires that were present less than a billion second from the beginning of the universe -- 600 million times a second .
All this is simply environment .
This is the machine under Ginevency .
We &apos;re going to pick these mini-Bang in the resevators .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLAS -- it &apos;s a large 44 feet .
This is an expectacular imagine of ATLATLAS in buildings .
10 section of the last year we have access the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was cause of immense festhegent in the control of control .
It &apos;s an image of the first phasum that had done the whole of LHC , and entering in collision , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles in the resident .
In other words , when we see that image 10 to the 10 sector , we understand that the machine worked , which is a big vitter .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to make us exulse than this , when somebody went on Google and he saw that the beginning was this .
That means we have a cultural impact that we had a cultural impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with machine , I had just to these files here -- these dorders .
These files bring 13,000 ampounds when the machine works at the very much of the power of the power .
Now , the technicians between you and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . I &apos;m sure . &quot;
And they can do that because when they &apos;re very cold the cost phils are conduct-conduct-conduct-conduct-conduct-conduct-conduct-conduct-conduct-conductable phils .
So , at least 271 degrees , at a space theme , at that the space between the stars , these files can bring that run .
In one of the juntures between the most novemile in LHC , there was a fect of fabricated .
So the philos surprising slightly , and 13,000 ampounts of suddenly ined electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressionant if you think these magnetes are more than 20 tons , and that you have been moved about 30 feet .
They &apos;re damages about 50 magnetes .
We had to take them , what we did .
We reprised them and traveled .
Now they &apos;re returning all the sub-place place .
By the end of marzo LHC is is going to be new integro .
We &apos;re going to happen , and we expect to get data of the data or light , and continuing our adventure to find what the morning to find the universe .
Now , of course , in some way , these accidents readed the dibate of science and engineering of science and engineering of the engineering .
I think the fact that the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact of the limits , I think this is the value of things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of an Inglese scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , imagine , which , imagine , in the difesa of of the experiment , his pulety , his puzzle , he said , &quot; Nothing is so pericully , the progress of human mind as the human mind as the rest of human mind as the human mind of the human mind that the ideas of the human mind that we &apos;re not going to be full .
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to rethink about when , from children , played , played cyaves .
While you know how to reach them and deal with them , take them and get them and move them and move them and move and to solve problems and to resolve problems and so they &apos;re putting and remaining and remains .
The space is deeply connected to the way we understand the way we understand part of the world around us .
So , from the information of the usual information with physics , together my consult , together my consultable . And my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started ask me , &quot; And if we use a computer , when we use a digital computer , we could have the only mouse of the mouse as a digital mouse , we could make the digital information with the way , we could make the hands , we could actually make the further fall ,
and putting it our feet ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big computer interactive computer as a biscale .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big computer interactive computer as a biscale .
You can move them with the hand , they can see between them , you can see between them , feel their movement and a radio and a radio and a radio .
But above , they &apos;re physicists , as the morning , you can move them .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as a hand that become more physicists , knowledge of other , and as they become more physicists , known about the other , how we move them , we can explore new , of the other , how we move new and fun fun .
I &apos;m going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configurated to show the video : if you incline in a direction , video gets so , if I incline from the other hand back .
These replaces are conscious .
If you go , you know , they &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re going to do .
If they come circumstates , they can act a little bit .
If they come circumstates , they can act a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclinical clinical clinical ,
And then we realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power to use of the data , for example , &quot; a color as if it was a liquid color as if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable , as a century century of the versor in the central central , where they missioned .
And I can use them to real color in the central central , where they misquiet .
And we &apos;re too much , we can actually put a little place .
They also beautiful possibility of learning , as languages , mathematics and games of logic , where people can try to try and see the results of the results of the results of the results .
Now , I &apos;m --
This is a sequence of Fibonaces that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a game of words that is half between Scarabeo and Boble .
Pratically , at all turn to a letter on a case on every Siftable , Pratically , every turn to a letter on every Siftable on every Siftable , and you try to figure out of a direct .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new set of letters and new possibility to try to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the children came to the Middia Lab , I did that they such them and turned a video .
They &apos;re very life-like placeased pleasant .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people people people education .
You just say , &quot; Compons of words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s some other people who try it to do it .
This is our younger biggest , there on the right there .
It actually wanted to implement them .
They were just morning .
Now , this is an application of an interactive cardboard .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of languages . He &apos;s Felix .
It can insert new characters in the scene , sunning Siftable them .
It can insert new characters in the scene , sunning Siftable them .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : The sun is source .
David Merrier : Now he took a treatment in the scene .
Video : The arange treatment .
By work ! Yes !
So schooling Siftable and put them neighbors can interact the person---
Video : Bau !
inventing their history .
Video : Hoo !
DM : It &apos;s a story with the opened , and it can decide him as you know , he can decide .
DM : It &apos;s a story with the opened , and it can decide him as you know , he can decide .
Video : Volice , gat .
DM : The last example that I have time to show you is a tool , realized of recently , to fight and exequiet music .
It &apos;s a tool , realized recently , to wait and exequiet music .
The Siftable here are aggering sounds like base , base and battery .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also also insert sounds in a sequence sequence to comport .
And to modify it just to touch a &quot; sound &quot; and a sequence . &quot;
These are effects that you can control from , as the reverse and the filter .
The acks to a particularly sound and then inclines to get it .
And then there are general effects as time and volume , that they applying the whole sequence .
Let &apos;s look like it works .
Video : We &apos;re going to start putting a base in two Siftable , &quot; sequence , we &apos;re doing it , we &apos;re going to add , the other base .
Now I &apos;m going to put a basis .
Video : Now , I add to the percussions --
Video : And I &apos;m going to put the philable philter , so I can control the effect of the alive .
Video : I can speak the whole sequence of the whole sequence of time by one side or another .
Video : And I &apos;m going to add the basis to give the best philable to give more expression .
Video : I can realize the sequence &quot; to the flight . &quot;
So I wouldn &apos;t have to please it before , but I can suddenly suddenly , more correct .
And now , finally , I can smooth the whole sequence inking on the left Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is built new man &apos;s faces more than a machine as much more like our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this percoral , and also some possibility that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmate is that it &apos;s coming up this new generation of project project to interact with the digital media , which will bring information in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the hour of you .
I &apos;m a written .
Bues is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also the love and the fascine of my life .
And I don &apos;t expect that it can change .
But , said this , something particularly happened in my life and in my life and in my career , which bring me to realibrate the whole relationship with this work .
The particularly thing is that I recently wrote this book called &quot; Manore , Prurule , Prudition , Ama , &quot; which , a lot of reason I use my books , for some reason it , for some reason it was a big , sensitive , sensitive , sensitive , huthler .
And the result is that everywhere in the watching people , they treat me as if I was condanned .
Davigh -- condannated , condannated !
They &apos;re all worried and they &apos;re all worried and say , &quot; You don &apos;t fear of fear ?
You have no fear of continuing to writing for all life without power without power of creating a book that makes somebody ? &quot;
What can you important to somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s rassurant , you know .
But it could go , at the part of that I remember more than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent -- I was a cent .
And I was going to meet the same as a pursue .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t I &apos;m going to get success ?
Don &apos;t you fear that the humiliation of the reversation ?
You have no fear of this mesters for all life without any of the whole life that was ever outside and die on a cumulo of dreams of infranker with the mouth of fallimb ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I have fear of all those things .
I &apos;ve always had a fear .
And I have also fear of many other things that people don &apos;t have to inate .
As the algae and other things .
But , as much about what I thought I was going to think of it and I was wonderful , because ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logic that anyone debate to be spavor to be spavor from a work that you feel to do .
But what is this particularly in the creative impressure that we have nervous health mental health mental health , in a way that other career do ?
And this guy , for example , he was a chemistry and I don &apos;t remember one in his 40 years of activity that he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he had pull to be able ?
There was never -- that block of the engineer John , how do it ?
Does no work that , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ?
Onestly , chemicals as group are not certainly , in the centuries , in the secuity of being high high high manized manized manized manized manized manipppulated .
We have enough , we have enough reputation , and not just writers , but creative of all gender , we have this reputation of being enormous instailable mentally .
And it &apos;s not going to look at the connection of the magnifies of the magnific ments that , just in the 21st century , died , they die and often to them .
And also the ones that are not suicidated to be really disfaced by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before he die , in the last interview said , &quot; Ly book has killed me a little bit more . &quot; A extraordinary de-full of the work of their life .
But we don &apos;t bate when we feel that , because we &apos;ve heard these things that we &apos;ve completely interior , and accepted the notion that creativity and accepted the notion that the creativity and the art , it &apos;s going to conduce .
And the question I want to bring all of the time is : are you agree with this idea ?
It &apos;s good . It &apos;s really -- because it looks like a distance of distance to me , not good for anything .
I think it &apos;s odiosa .
And I think it &apos;s also peragainst , and I don &apos;t want to see the perpetuate in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better encourage our big creative ments creative to live .
And of course , I know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to get to the circumstances of suppose suppose , but I &apos;m in my career .
Oval -- you look , I &apos;m rather than 40 years .
I have still about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s likely that anything about what I &apos;m going to writing is going to be judge from the world as the work that was used to be a very much time .
Sart , because we &apos;re all more or friends here -- it &apos;s probable that my greatest success is to my biggest success is to my horse .
Oh , Gesus , who think .
You know this is the kind of thinking that that brings a person to start bing in the nine of the morning and I don &apos;t want to do that .
I would stop keep doing this work that we love .
So , the question becomes , how do you ?
And so it looks like , after a lot of reflective reflective , which is to create a psychological costruck , OK ?
I have to find a distance of safe , which I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxy on what reaction is about what reaction is about reaction will get to it . And as I was trying to do this . And I was trying to start through time , trying to find other society to see if they could have ideas and more healthy and more healthy more society to see if they could have ideas and more healthy . And the best of the best ideas I &apos;m going to go to the best ideas to see if I was trying to go to look at
about how to help people to remains the emotional inerent inerent inerent inerent .
And that research took me to the ancient Grex and ancient Rome .
Seguitteme me because it gets into circle and then back .
In the ancient Grex and ancient Rome -- people don &apos;t seem to believe that creativity to men , OK ?
And it was the creativity was this beautiful divine and that came up and sell men someone distant and known , for the distant reasons and known , for distant reasons and known .
The greatest called these beyond these beyond the creativity of demons .
Sooowned , wish , creded a demon that eligger wisdom .
The Romans were the same idea , but they call that kind of spirit , but they call that a kind of spirit .
That &apos;s great , because Romans were not really thought that a genius was somebody was a particularly smart .
They believed that a genius was this kind of divine that you believe literally in the walls of a study of a study of a study of a design , a little bit like Dobby , and that came to the work of the artist and model the work of the artist and model the work of that work .
Here &apos;s eye -- here &apos;s the distance of what I talk about -- that is the distance of what you -- that protect you from your work .
And everybody knew that was so that it worked , right ?
So the anticient artists were protected by things , like , for example , the too narcism , right ?
If your work was except for you could not take it all the market , everybody knew that you had been helped by this incorporation .
If your work , if your work , it wasn &apos;t all the basic thing , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be an incapable .
And so people are food concept for a lot of time .
And then the Renasent came and everything changed , and everything changed , and we put this big idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe and no more and leaving space to creatures that write the creatures that wrote about the divinity .
This was the rational principle of human rational and people were beginning to think that creativity was completely from the shardle .
And for the first time in history , he started to refer to this or the artist as a rather than a person with genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big error .
I think that allowed someone , a simple person to believe that that it &apos;s like a recipient , the essence and the surprising people all mysteries , creative , unknown , and ethernal is a lot of a big philant philanthree-to-to-human .
It &apos;s like to ask somebody to enjoy the sun .
Deform and completely fashion and creates all of these expectations on performance .
And I think it was this pression to destroy the artists in the past 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think it &apos;s , the question is , and now ?
Can we do that different ?
Maybe back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between human and mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t sing 500 years of rational thinking about 500 years of rational thinking .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience that we were able to have a scientific scientific about the notion of the notion , you know that they follow people to sfit , and they were going to make the project .
I &apos;m not going to convince you all about this .
But the question I &apos;d like to ask is -- why no ?
Why don &apos;t I think that way ?
Because it &apos;s more sense of all other thing that has ever heard to explain the explanation of the embedded of creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever ever ever attempt to do something -- so , of course , all here -- you know , you don &apos;t have rationally comport .
And in fact , it can times seemed completely paranormal .
I &apos;ve done this met recently with the extraordinary poetched Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but that was a poetic poetry and said me that durant his his infants in the Virginia , working out of the Virginia , and feel it , when a poetry to the landscape .
He said that it was like a fragorous fragorous .
And he was coming towards her high of the landscape .
He heard it was going to be , because he was tremendous under his feet .
She knew he was to have one thing to do to that point and it was , words , &quot; run as a main . &quot;
And so it was correct to home and that was wouldn &apos;t have to make a piece of paper and a fast maybe it and a fast macher , while the translate and the page and deal it on the page .
At three times it wasn &apos;t being fast enough , so correval and correct and correct and correct them out and the poetry and the poetry and then the lost and he would continued to roll through the landscape , looking for a poet . &quot;
Then there were times -- this is not going to forget that -- there were some moments where the stark was almost losing , right ?
So he was running home and was looking for card and the poetry and card was a crazy in , and he was a crazy in the way that he was going to go , and he said , that it was like the other hand and the hand and the hand , and the hand the hand housing .
He offered the poem of the tail and remains it into his body and he was writing on the page .
And in these cases , the poem was presented on perfect page and intouches , but the early word on the early .
So when I heard it -- it &apos;s lots of -- it &apos;s exactly the real creative process .
Not my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conduction .
I &apos;m a mulo , and my way of work is ; I &apos;m wake , and I &apos;m sweat and work and go and work and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and go out .
But even I , in my test test , I restriated against that thing , sometimes .
And I &apos;m also imagine that many of you have the han done .
You know , even if the work and ideas were given me from a certain function , I couldn &apos;t be honestly known .
What is this ?
And how can we relationship us to do not make the head , but , rather , rather , what do you make us sthange ?
And I &apos;m about , the best example of me , the best example I have is the Musician musician , which I have interviewed for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life is the incarried artist &apos;s returned to contemporary , trying to control , to try to control , dominate these species of totally interiorized impulses .
But then he invected , he calculated , and one day as he was driving on a Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
He was going to go quickly and all of a sent witches , which is going to be in his head as ispiration , which is high and high , elusive , and the wants , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the head , but not knows how to take it .
It &apos;s not a piece of card , it doesn &apos;t have a cut registerator .
So he began to feel this species of old anxiety of anxioned , &quot; I &apos;m losing to lose , and I &apos;ll reveal by this charge song .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t make it . &quot;
And instead of walking , he stopped .
And it was the whole mental process and made something completely new .
And he just watching the sky and said , &quot; Scause , not see what I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; You know , &quot; Do you write a song now ?
If you really want to exist , if I can take care of you .
Some , you go to important something else today .
You know Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his process worked changed after this .
Not the work was still host .
But the process , and the anxy anxy that was reef when he was pressed when he was pressed when he was pressed to anything else and libered it back where he came from , realizing it was , realizing that it was , and realization that was realized and towards .
but he was a peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and and this external thing that it was not Tom .
And so as I felt that story about changing a little bit even the way I was working and I was working on and save me once .
This idea , he save me when I was writing , &quot; Manore , &quot; Prega , Ama , &quot; and fall in one of those of the despite cave that we all do and start thinking that we can start thinking about something and we can start thinking that it &apos;s going to think that it &apos;s a disaster , which is going to be the worst book , or the book , which is the book or book , which is going to be a displot or that we &apos;re going to go .
Not just book , just the worst book wrote .
And I started thinking about to throw this project .
But then I remember Tom who talked to the air and try to the air and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try to try to get to the air and try .
So I went up my face in the way of eoscritish and I made my comments to a huge corner of the room .
And I said to free , &quot; Sent , what , you know , you know that if this book won &apos;t be bright , it &apos;s not going to be interested in my book , no ?
Because I &apos;m seeing us all that I have , not more than that I have ,
So if you want to be better , you have to show you and make your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , you don &apos;t do .
I &apos;ll go to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to love to favor that was recorduced that I &apos;ve been presented to my part of &quot; because -- at the end is that , OK -- in the deserts of Africa , the people were gadunted to the damage of the wonderful , from the damage and hours to the hours of hours and hours .
And they were always magnific , because the banks were professionals and were fantastic .
But every once a very , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists was actually transmitted .
And I know you know what I talk to , because I know you &apos;ve all seen it , a performance that you &apos;ve seen .
It was like time , if the time , and the banker walking through a kind of portal and it wasn &apos;t doing anything about the sun , as 1,000 notes before , but it all you go .
And suddenly I don &apos;t know , just as a human human .
But it was going to go into the divince of the divinity .
And when this was going to happen , the people knew what was , they called it .
They were congiven hands and started sing , &quot; Allah , Allah , God , Allah , God , God , God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curiosa night storic -- when the Mom invasero , they were invaded this habits and was changed in the centuries from &quot; Allah , Allah , &quot; at &quot; Oklah , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; , &quot; Okay , &quot; , &quot; which you can still feel in the flow .
In Spain , when an artist has done something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , magic Allah , magnificent , &quot; I think , &quot; God .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes the day , for the balery same , when you see and it &apos;s the 11 of the morning of Martedday and the last 11 of Martedesday , God &apos;s no longer .
It &apos;s just a death with a lot of bad to ginocy , and maybe not going to make the height .
And maybe no one names of God while , so it must do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most sweeth recognizes to make a creative life .
But maybe not to be so angosciant if you can &apos;t believe , anzyutter , which is the most extraordinary expects than you are coming from you .
But created it just to believe that you have data in the unimaginable of this inimaginable squish of this squish of your life that you have to go to someone else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think that it &apos;s all changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s sure as I thought it &apos;s for different months in the book that I &apos;m going to try and public , spavailable , spaving , so that I &apos;m going to do that , expect my grains success .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel electrized from this is , not achieving .
Not beach . It &apos;s not just your work .
Continuates to presentate your part , any of whatever you can be .
If your work is balling is ball , ball .
If the wine , absurd you decide to leave you a little bit of wonderful wonderful , for a moment through your blood , for a moment through your blood , then , &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Some , you have the same dance .
And he said , &quot; Hot ! &quot;
I think I think you have to teach it .
&quot; You know , &quot; You know , even for you had the same as a human frightening and test test tape that you have to present you continue .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
You know , you know , some of these projects on human genome , on what it can meaning and discovery new set of genes .
Now we &apos;re starting a new perspective . We started digitizens and now start to go from that code is where we &apos;re going to go into a new biology , designing and synthesize life .
We always tried to ask big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; It &apos;s a lot of biologists I think they &apos;re trying to understand various late .
We tried different approach , reducing it to the minimes .
We &apos;re drawing from almost 20 years .
When we sequencencency was to go from the analogic world of biology in the digital world of the computer .
Now , let &apos;s ask we can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smaller genome that they can authorary the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome to create a more smaller .
We &apos;re able to eliminate a hundred of genes about 500 that are here .
But when we &apos;re looking at his measured map metabolic maph , it &apos;s relatively than our .
Credetails , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this can bring a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to design was to synthesis to synthesis that that chromosome in ways to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of the Pan &quot; we can synthesis ? &quot;
Can chemistry to produce these big molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create before ?
And in case , we can make a chromosome crazy ?
A chromosome is just a piece of inert material chemistry .
The speed that we &apos;re able to digitalize life is growing up to remains .
Our capacity to write the genetic code , rather literally , but it &apos;s better .
And our most recent retaining the branch to a exponential curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process has requires many past past , beginning with a bioethical reatening before the first experiments .
But we found that that synthesis to synthesis is very difficult .
There are deces of thousands of machines in the world that produce small sections of DNA , the long-floor 50 letters and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the most errors are longer .
So we had to develop a new metod to read these framments and correct to read the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , to start from the digital information of the Phi &apos;s genome of Phi &apos;s genome of the Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , actually the correction of the mistakes and get a molecule of DNA of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of inert chemistry and inert it in the bacteria , the bacteria have started to read this genetic and to produce this genetic code and to produce the viral particles .
The viral particles are then replied by the cells , and they &apos;ve been back and destruced the Even .
I &apos;ve been talking about recently members of the oil industry and say that they have certainly compress this model .
They rex more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build his hardware , in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the more in big .
We wanted to build the whole cromosome of the bacterium .
They &apos;re more than 580 to smooth code .
So we thought we &apos;ve been built the casses of the virus , so that we can change casses to understand what the components are components of a living cell .
The program is crucial , and if we start with digital information , they have to be very accurate .
When we sequencencle for the first time in 1995 , the standard accurate was a mile for every 10 mile .
We found , resequency , 30 errors . If we had the original sequence that original sequence we never would do that work .
One part of the process is designing sectity , 50 letters that you have to get very rougher with all other segments of 50 letters to build smaller sub-way sub-way way that works together .
We can see unclear elements here .
You probably have read that we read that we &apos;re going to get a phone of the physical phone .
Think about it : We have a genetic code on four letters : A , God and Take .
Three of those letters together , it code about 20 ammine , and there &apos;s a specific order of letters for every ammine ammine .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , fraction .
What we &apos;ve done is to autographic was autography .
Some of the fact that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
We designed these segments to simply help them just to be able with enzymes .
There are enzymes them and put them abstrippping them .
And we started to assembling parts , beginning with segments from five to seven to seven to form to form set of segments , unclean 24 multi-paymyself to make 72 mile .
At every step we made these segments in abundance so we can sequency them to sequency process that we &apos;re trying to create a very robbbrobbbing .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems the tabellone play-basket play-basket .
When we get these segments very long , more than 100 middle , more than 100 middle , they will not grow more directly in E.
It comes to the limit of the modern modern tools .
So we looked at other mechanisms .
We knew of another mechanism called a homology , which in biology is going to repair the DNA can can degree the segments .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinocror Deinocrans , can absorbs three million radiation .
You can see in the square superior as his chromosome as a cromosses .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s reassembled exactly as first .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can do completely .
They can live under the vacuum .
They &apos;re absolutely sure that life exists in space , and you can find new environments of water .
At the real , NASA showed that this is .
This is an image of the molecule that we &apos;ve built these processes , just using the lievidence with the appropriate design to the appropriate segments to put .
The lievil ables them assembly .
This image was not taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a totally big that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that they cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the publishment that we &apos;ve done a little time ago .
They &apos;re more than 580,000 genetic code .
It &apos;s the biggest molecule of a definitely created by man .
It has a lot of molecular spring 300 million .
If we stop it with a career 10 without spaces , they would like 142 pages to transclue this genetic code .
Now , how do we do it work ?
Obviously , you can have a virus is a game from kids .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s simpler as well as it is about the eucariote cells as our : you can just extreme the nucleo and put another , which is practically the cloning process of cloning .
In the archaea , the chromosome is integrated inside the cell , but we &apos;ve recently demonstrated that we &apos;re able to make a complete traph of a cell cell of a cell cell of a cell cell of a cell , and to activating it .
We got a crowned a microbial species .
The two are different men from topes .
We &apos;ve added some gene gene of gene that chromosome for this cromosome .
And then it slide with the encies that we kill all protein .
And when we put it in the cell was study -- and you &apos;ll open-appreciate graph -- the new cromosome , the new cromosome .
And we were beginning to think we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried anyway .
This is one of the most evolution .
We found that tantissize species have added a second or a third or a third , somewhere , adding in a second thousands of new , and the species of new species .
So who think about evolution as a just gene of a just gene of the modified has no big biology .
There are an enymmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmments call DNA .
The croms that was in the cell of it was in the cell of it .
The cell phone of the cell phone that we have inseritous cellent it has .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognizes the other cromosome as a extraneous material , and we found it with just the cell and the new cell .
it &apos;s became blue because of the genes that we &apos;ve inserted .
And in a short lassist of time , all the characteristics of a species have lost , and it turned out of the new kind of software that we put into the cell .
All the proteins are changed , membranes are changed , and when we region the genetic code of what we have transferred you .
Now , this may seem genetic altering , but altering the DNA software we can change things in a way .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that here is not talking about this -- but to make a further from three million years and a half million years and a half million years and I &apos;ve already said that maybe we &apos;re going to create new species of the explosion this .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s enough to be obvious when we think about our need .
We &apos;re going to go to six and a half of people at nine billion in the next 40 years .
Right to give you an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each other existing in 1946 , there &apos;s four years , there &apos;s four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find fresh fresh fresh water and clean , medicinal and gas , medicinal and a half of people .
It &apos;s still going to do that for nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion barriers , more than 30 billion barils .
That means millions of barils a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replaces them , it &apos;s a huge challenge .
We have to hold of the CO2 emission of CO2 from these materials that finishing in the atmosphere .
At the day of today , thanks to scientific discoveries all around the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I love to think that are the design components for the future .
The electronics industry is only a dozen about about components , and think about how many different things are come out .
Our limits here are maintained by biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have some techniques , thank you to have synthesization , able of able synthesis of creating what we call genomics genomics .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can produce a million cromosoms a day .
Think about these 20 million genes of different genes or try to get the processes to make the processes to produce or drugs , new vaccines , we can change , with a small team , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology than the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for the possibility of survival , chemistry or carbon , production of eths , production of waitc vaccines .
This is an instantly instantly instantly , a few software we &apos;re working on to be able to set and design species to the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know it necessarily , we don &apos;t know what they &apos;re going to be .
We know exactly what the genetic code .
Now we &apos;re focus on the carbons of how much generation .
You &apos;ve seen you who extract ethanol from the grain was a bad experiment .
We have carbons of second and third generation that will use enough to the high high value as the open-high or different kinds of bankilometle .
But the only way biology can have a big impact without increasingly increase the cost of food and limited the cost of the food and limited the displit of it , which we &apos;re working to design the main which we &apos;re working to design cells that can reach this , and we think we could make this purpose , and we think we could make this purpose of what we can we think of how much of 18 months .
The solar solar combined with CO2 is a methodom -- but in our discoveries in the world , we found different metodd-foot metodd .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , at about 2500 feet of depth of the water temperature of the water .
It &apos;s meaning from CO2 using hydrogen molecular as the energy source of energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can incanalt CO2 , which can easily be transported through your bes , converting that CO2 in carburn , to drive this process .
So we think we can think that we could be able to increase what the question of base , what is is life . &quot; We have the base of &quot; that what is life is Noil , we have the modest goal to replacing the oil industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can you do it ?
It would be a main the main of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working to use the same methods to create vaccines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with influence , we &apos;re always back a year and with a dollar when you &apos;re going to find the right vaccine .
I think what you can change build vaccines in anticipate vaccines .
That &apos;s how the future could start to change , now , the tree , now , the tree of evolution , accellerating the way with synthetic bacteria , and finally you know , archaiting .
We &apos;re at so much better people .
Our purpose is to make a way of live enough to try to make it . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the most quickly possible , some fundamental work , the new technology that we brought to a year ago ago , a year ago ago .
It &apos;s a environment that you can interact is at the local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data .
Here we &apos;re seeing a lot of digital photos of digital photos with a kind of costant photos , and I continue , to a slide , dispond images how we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these colracies of data or images .
Most of the digital photographs , but this is a kind of thing is a scanning of the Congress , and reentrepreneurs in the gamma of 300 megapiel .
It doesn &apos;t make a difference because the only thing that it &apos;s just the number of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any moment .
This is a whole book , example of data not images .
This is Dickens of Dickens . Every colonnaked .
To show you that it &apos;s about the text and not images , we can do something like this , to see that it &apos;s a real represent of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a little artificial book .
I don &apos;t need it to be .
This is a more realistic example . This is a number of the Guardian .
Every big imagine is the beginning of a sea .
And it really gives you the pleasure of a drugs of a daily reverse of a day or a daily drawing , which is to nature a lot of medium .
We also did something with the corner of this number of particularly in the Guardian .
We created a fasull fasull resoluonef -- much more than that you use in a normal publishment -- and we &apos;ve inserted you to the extra extra extra .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see it .
Or other models , or even specific techniques .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that this means to put the pop-up and other porcheries , and other porcheries , they should not be necessary .
Of course , map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don &apos;t want to lose time , if we don &apos;t have to say that we have contributes to this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. . NASA .
So we &apos;re going to go to what else is .
This is actually from the Web . You can go to the web ; you can go to see .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
A is Seadragging , and the other is a very interesting research from Noah Snavely , a student of Noah Seady , a student of U.S. Washington , with the UW and Rick Seady of Microsoft Research .
And it &apos;s from the Weady , gesters from Seady guy .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can spend from one picture and have this kind of experience and have this kind of experience and have this kind of experience .
But the space of images here has actually a meaning meaning .
The size of the computer visualization have recorded these images together , so that they correspond to the read the regional places that the read of the regional Montne Roccial Montne Roccial Montne Roccious . You know , you see the elements of the elements of a slide-like stable slide-shaped stable slikely , and these things are all the space level of a light-level stable .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a few more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original sections of Noahhand , this is from a prototype of Photosynth of Photosynth that we &apos;ve done to work for the first time the summer experience the first time the extent ext , the key behind this technology , the technology Photosynth of the environments that we &apos;ve set in the webody that we &apos;ve set in the website .
We had to worry about the legal aspects and so on .
This is a rebuildings of Nothththin Noththth-Dimime . Bauckr Do images . Bauckr Din Flickr and you get images of the fields of short types , and on the way . Each of these arancies a picture that you have been discovered a picture that you have been discovered to keep this model .
So , I got all images from Flickr and they were all connected to the space level of space .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this way we &apos;re simplicate .
You know , I would never have thought to end up for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratifying this kind of account here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different kinds of different kinds of focus : from those of the cellular phone to those professional graphs of the ground of those professional .
And if I can come up , I try to try to look more strange .
Many of them are blocked by faces , etc .
Some of the photographs of photographs -- etches .
This is a NoththDregistrated correctly .
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from a typties -- from the entire collective of how to appears the earth , from visual point of view -- and the data together .
All those pictures become connected , most of the parts .
You have a model of the entire emerging .
Think about this as a prold-proline proline on Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as a lot of as people use it , and the people use for the people use it .
Their pictures are married by other people .
If you &apos;re at somebody &apos;s idea to contraction all these saying the name , my picture of Noththers of Noththtrial . And I can actually use it of all those data , and I can use it as a point of inground , using point to the way of ingress to immerging photograph , using photos of anyone , and have a kind of critical choss-model of city , and have a kind of critical chosen .
Of course , a consequence of all of that are extremely elaborate , very interesting , high companies of the earth , and from satellitary images and satellitarious images and satellital images .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : What &apos;s you know ? What your software is going to contain is that at a point , in the next years , all the world , all the photographs shared by anyone in the world will be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be practical ?
BA : Yes . What &apos;s doing is right .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the base of the images .
What becomes very interesting if you think about the recognizes of simantic information that many of these images can possible .
As when you have a research of images on the web , you have a sentence and the head on the web page has a lot of information about the pictures of pictures .
Now , what happens if that pictures up all your pictures ?
So the amount of interconnection simantly and the amount of wealth that it &apos;s really huge . It &apos;s a classical classical effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really amazing .
BA : BA thank you very much .
One of the main the main the main the way , and one of the ethnography is the power of the living among who has no forget between who has gone to the wind of the wind , the past in the wind , the past of the planet , the drop of floating .
Bastes thinking that Jaguar , and also traveling the Via Lattea , or that the Milky of the Inuit are still more meaningful than the Dharm , the buddddistant , the broken respile of Dharma , to remember the importance of the central central central of anthropy , and the idea that the world that the world that we live in the world that we live not exist , but it &apos;s just a model , but it , is just a model , but it &apos;s just a model of actually a model of reality ,
the conset of a particularly set of adaptative choices that our stirles made , well , or a bad generations ago .
And of course , we all share the essential beyond the essential .
All we all do . We all procreating .
We are subjects to go .
We have to death the inexorability of death , so it doesn &apos;t surprising us if we clean and ballowing --
We all have a art .
What it &apos;s colpiece is the particularly of cancer , the rise of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that they are the Penan forests of the Borneo , or the Phouse of Haiti , or the Kaisut , or the Kaisut , the Curt seter , the Curt of the Sahara .
He was my journey in the desert month , or a month ago , or a hallevator of yak in the value of the Everest , the Moddle mother .
All of these populations teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of move in the world .
And if you reflect a moment , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
Insive cultures of the world creating a world of spiritual nature and cultural life that the planet and cultural that that the planet and it &apos;s important for the planet as biosphere as a biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural girl as a nosphere , and you can define the ethnosphere , the total of all the concepts , under ideas , inspirations , inspirations , inspirations , inspirations , from the human imagination of the consciousness .
The ethnosphere is the fantastic patriage of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how inquisitive species .
And because biosphere was a gravelly consumed ethnosphere and unfortunately , much more quickly .
Nobody biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species is about the extinction of the extinction , because it &apos;s falthy , or the most apocallow-up hypothesis -- and you don &apos;t even have neighborhood in the hypothesis -- and you don &apos;t even have that much neighborhood .
The dator of all that is , of course , the lost lost .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not only composed by a vocabulary or a series of rules .
One language is the spray of human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle with the animation of every culture is coming into the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a forest of the mind , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibility .
And those 6,000 languages , as we are here sitting at Monterey , at least half doesn &apos;t sush in the ears of the children .
They don &apos;t come more teached kids , which is , less they &apos;re die , not wonderful that you don &apos;t wondered .
What is more trists of being flown from the silence , the last one , the last one language , the last one language , of the wisdom or to anticipate the promise of the children ?
This is horing is the state of somewhere in two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks .
And I know somebody of you who &apos;s going to say , &quot; Is it &apos;s not that ?
The world wouldn &apos;t it be a better place if we &apos;re all the same language ? &quot; Well , very hard . We talk all talk about the way .
We talk to kogi .
You &apos;ll cover a tract of a tract what you want to say is not to talk about language .
I &apos;d like to do a journey through ethnosphere --
a little journey in ethnosphere to give you a surface of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forgotten of us that when I say , &quot; different ways of exists , really different ways of exists .
Let &apos;s take Barasana Barasana , in Amazon , the population of anaconda , which creans to the means of being from the fighters of being seeed by the switch of sacred sacred .
It &apos;s a population that &apos;s not able to distinguished the blue color , because the basic color is identify in the forest of the forest , which depends the population .
They have a strange language and a main a maybe , detail , detail , &quot; Lake , &quot; : you have to get a person who partnership language .
All this has radical in the mythological past , yet the particularly extent is that in these families that are talking about six or seven languages .
They can stand to stand and then start to talk .
Let &apos;s take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived the Waorani &apos;s Waorani horani , an incredible population , a incredible population that has the first contact contact in 1958 .
In 1957 five measure measure they have a connection of a factor .
They had been taken from the photographs that retraded them in poses that they had been advice , forest that this population of the forest pluvial forest had never seen nothing about bi-dimensional .
They collect photos from the ground , they turned them to the search of a shape or a shape , they have concled that they were treated on the diavol , and they killed the five .
But Waorans don &apos;t just killed the strange strange .
They killed between them .
54 percent of mortality was caused by them .
We &apos;re rising at eight generations and we found two of natural death , and when we &apos;ve insisted to know , they admit that one of them was aging , so that they died it , and then they killed it . And then they killed it . Ad all , they had a incredible forest .
The hunters were able to reveal the animal of 40 steps and recognize the species of it .
In the early 1980s , I was a very interesting compiece when my Harvard professor of Harvard professor who I wanted to go to Haiti to intruccrazy between society of Duvalier and Tonton Mououout-based , and Tonton Macoubles , and impose me of the fast engineer to make zombies .
To give a sense to miraculous , I should have to understand the Vodoun culture , and that the Vooo is not magic .
It &apos;s rather than a measuring of a measuring physics of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to ask me to tell me the big religions of the world , you would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddisslam , etchaism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has no religious feeling . And instead and the Vooo is not the other than the distilled of these very profound religious religious religious religious religious religious .
What makes interesting about the voodoo is the intense report of life and death .
So you live in the spirits .
The spirites can be invowned by the Grande Acqua , respond to the dance of dance and replace temporary to the anima way that for a short-such of the way that for a short , which is the god-to-to-day .
So , the voodooisti love say , &quot; You white you go to ask about God .
We give in the temple and we become God . &quot;
And from the moment that you &apos;re places , is the spirit that you guide , how can you do the bad ?
So you have been assistes to these amazing events : following voodoo touches that touches ines infuried a rather strong demonstration of the power of mind on the body when it &apos;s catalyes .
I was all the populations with which I lived the most extraordinary people are the Kogi in Santa Nevada Marta , in the Santa Marta , in Colombia , Colombia .
Discent of the ancivilization that once they were living on the carairs of the Colombia , the population of the conquist , the population was going to be on the massive massicro-to-to-copy planet .
In a sangue of blood , this population was never conquered by the pagners .
But I &apos;m governments today , they &apos;re government , but their formation is really extraordinary .
The young people are taken away from the families to three or four years , and they live in a world of good and bombers in a world of the basic and bombs in the basic basic and basic feet .
Two periods of nine years , proposed to reproduce the nine months of gestation that transcorn in the user of the mother , now are metaphor in the U.G.
So , this is happened to be acculated to the values of their society , values that their predict and only their predictation is that they keep the balance of the cosmic balance -- or for the balance of the balance of the ecological equilibrium .
At the term of this amazing initiation , they &apos;re suddenly brought out and for the first time , 18 years , they see a high . And that &apos;s the first bad bad . And that &apos;s the first bad bad , when the sun butt , the whole theory is confered to the teory . The precient bed , the prey days , everything that has been conferred and says , &quot; The predict a past and says ,
&quot; I &apos;m going to say , I said , &quot;
It &apos;s studies . Now , it &apos;s going to protect it . &quot;
It &apos;s called the most people and say that we , frree them , frree them , we are the broken of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think of the indiculations and environment , we invochieve Rhowever , which is the old story of the noble , which is a razy concept in its simplicity or maybe we invoded .
Indigenes are not nor sentimental nor indebols from the nostales .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the world &apos;s palures of Asto or in the gelids of Tibet , but thanks to the time and rites , they created a mystic mystics of the Earth , not on the concept of the Earth is not about a consciously , but a free of the Earth can only infused by the consciousness of human consciousness .
What does that say ?
Vuol , a little girl who grows up the mountain is a spirit of the Apu that &apos;s going to be a deep human being a deep human being a deep human being a deeply different , and it &apos;s going to have a different mountain or that place to a little bit different mountain a mountain a mountain , a mountain a mountain , which a mountain is a rocer of a mountain .
Which is the deployment of a mineral or a mineral cycle is .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defines the report of the individual and the natural world .
I grew in the forests of the Columbia credating that the forests serve forests to be cut .
That made me a human human being different from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the forests are the forests of Hukuk and the paradisite and the paradise of the world , the spirits that live in the northern Hamatory , spirites that are in the Hamatory beginning of the Hamatory , spirits that affold me the Hamatent of the world , spirits that the Hukuk of the Hukuk ,
If you start to look at that these cultures can actually actually make different reality , you can start some of them , you can start some of them , we can see this plants .
I took this pictures open up in the noroccurring in the noroccurring .
Mayahuge some of you have heard about the ayahuge suspance of the repertory of the repertory .
What makes the eyahuge , it &apos;s not the power drugs of the pharmacological pharmacological , but his elaboration . It &apos;s two elements .
It &apos;s a slight-hand , this lian huge man that contains a series of the harmful , harmful hallucinogens .
Pending the only plants is a bludge smoke that alters a little bit the consciousness , but it &apos;s mixed with the leaves of a floor of the family of the family of the caffior of the caffects of the caffects of the caffan family .
This plants are powerful triptamines , very similar to serotonin , dimethoxyl-five , method-five , methoddle .
If you ever see the Yanomami , you &apos;ll see the Yanomami , which is a different set of species , which is methoxyltrade methoddle is methoddle .
Tiring that polvice on the nose is a little bit like being disappeared by a fucies of the pink of the eyes of electricity . Really . Reath . Don &apos;t believe a distorm of reality .
I was often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who took the psychedelic wild , with his discovery of the birth fungi , the 30s in the 1930 in the &apos; 30 30 in Mexico .
And the tese triptams can &apos;t classify these triptames as hallucinogens because if you &apos;re not telling anybody who are hallucinated .
It &apos;s possible absolutely just if you abunger , with other chemicals that money money in the MAO .
Now , the beautiful thing : the hudle of MAO , the same kind of myself are inhyths of MAO , the same kind of necessary . The question question is spontaneous . The question is : in a flow of 80,000 species of plants , how these are two morphologically not , if you have the same way , but if you combine in this way , creants , creating a biochemical way that is about periores ?
We use the big euphemism of the sue and the error , which can reveal infruit .
But if we ask the Indians , they &apos;ll say , &quot; Phts talk about it . &quot;
What does that say ?
This tribes , Cofan , 17 variety of ayahuge , which distingubirth , which distinguish networks , and our eyes would come into the same species .
If we ask them how they &apos;re asking their tape , they &apos;re going to tell us , &quot; I thought I was going to think of that , you don &apos;t know it ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you get 17 variety in a note of lone night and each one will cite with a different tants .
With this is not laurea in Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than contact that contact stami .
Now , &#91; &#91; &#91; &#91; &#91; &#91; &#91; &#93; &#93; the problem is that the problem of us who have heart people who have gone hour house cue people are pitting the history of the history of the history of the history of the real world , and pass .
In fact , the 20th century , 300 years , not remember the duced 10-year-old innovations , but rather as we stop and and we have abled actively and we have abled activity , or the mass of diversity and cultural masses of the planet mass of the planet . Now the problem is not change .
All cultures through centuries were involved in a dance for new possibility of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux , they don &apos;t stop Sioux when they put it from the arc and they were alone , as well as Americans have no stopped to be Americans when they put from the horse and hot .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that threatences the integrity of ethnight . It &apos;s the power .
The wall of domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you &apos;ll discover that these are not destined cultures .
They are creatures and dynamics out of the identify existence that go beyond their ability of adaptation .
Sia that it &apos;s disbosing in the patria of the Penan --
a namadvice of Sarawak , in the Asian Asian , a population that has lived free in the forest and the next generation , and now reduced to a generation ago , and the next region the reserves of the river , where you can see the physical means that the Borneo Sor-Ciny , where the naves the Japanese Shortil the Japananananthanks of the horizonte , where you navels ,
It &apos;s going to replaces the stives with the wood wood .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that have come with the discovery of the gold .
If we move on the Tibet of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the floor of political domination .
You know , as you know the genocide , physics of a population , is condanned , but the ethnium of a population , but the ethnium of a population , not only condanted , but also celebrated in certain environments , because it &apos;s part of the development of development .
And you can &apos;t understand the soft of Tibet until until you go .
I realized 6,000 miles from Chengu , Chengu , in the West through the Tibet , when I was a West , as a young people with a young college , but only came to Lhasa I realized what &apos;s behind the statistics we feel about .
6,000 sacred monuments sacred reduces and centers .
1.2 million people killed from the military Rivolution .
The dad of this guy was absolutely ascriture in the Panches Lama .
which means that it was killed to say that was killed to the Chinese invasion .
Her was unclean with Santity in Santity in Santity , which brought the population in Nepal .
Ha mother was imprisoned and his colpage was to be reciciciplied .
It was taken of hidden in career at the age of two nasking under his gymother , because he wouldn &apos;t have to live without .
The sister , who made the same , it was put in the same , was a reeducation .
A day has inavvertitude , a fashion Mao and , for this transground , was a transground of the forced works for seven years .
The Tobet of the Tibet can be insatitaken , but the spirit of the population is from tener .
At the end , it &apos;s all reduces .
We want to live in the world world world world &apos;s world , we want to collect the polyicromatical world of diversity ?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead , before we die said that his greatest fear was that , in our greatest fear of the world , we &apos;re not just going to see the whole gama of human imagination of human imagination , but a day , a day we &apos;re wake us to a day a day day , but a day day we &apos;re wake us to the way that were other possibility .
And it &apos;s humiliant that our species is existed for 600,000 years .
The Neolitics Rivolution , which gives us agriculture , which has us to socket to the cult of the sees of the sees of the sea poem of the mine , creating the gerarchy of the special clero , creating the gerarchy of specialization , and we &apos;re talking about 10,000 years ago .
The industrialized modern world has 300 years .
That squares history not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we &apos;re going to go to the millenny .
When these myriades of the world is asked what you say to be human , they say , human voice , they respond to 10,000 voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all retain the possibility of being what we are : a consciousness , which has to make that all the population and all the people and garden . And there are big times .
I took this picture on the north of the north of the island of Baffin , when I went to the hunt hunt with the Inuit , and this man , and this man , he told me the wonderful story of his non-grandfather .
The canadvice government was always gentile with the Inuit and in the 1950s to stabilier our premision , we have them in colonies .
The nonless of this man refused to go .
The family , templaces for his life , he brought all the arms , and all his attracted .
You have to know that Inuit doesn &apos;t theme the cold , they sweat it .
The slites of the slites were made of the basic skin fish of caribs .
The nonless of this man is not a man who was a non-means or the blizard or the blizard that was suffippulled .
It &apos;s gap away , it &apos;s hot the pin of foca and defecated in their hand . When the focus on their hand . When I made them up , they work a model .
He was sprayed on the points of this cail cacces and when it became solid , he killed a dog .
He schooled the dog and created a bridge , with the At cassa , he created a slitta , he gave a slate , and it &apos;s gone on the banchisa , and it &apos;s gone .
We want to talk about havarsela with nothing ?
In 1999 , the canadvice of the canadvice of the Inuit &apos;s the total control of a larger of a territorum of the California and Texmen together .
It &apos;s their new patric . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a territory territory . They all Controls all the minerary resources .
One of the splendiging example of how a national national state can reach with his population .
And finish , I think it &apos;s rather obvious to the high of us is in these snone remote of the planet , make it is not remote .
For somebody &apos;s home .
They are represented human imagination that rises at the time . And for us all the time . And for us all of these children , as the dreams of these children , as the dreams of of geography .
For finish , we are National Geographic , we are convinced that politicians ever .
We believe that polemy --
&#91; Ausi &#93; , &#93; they are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month to tell us the world . Every month . Every month 35 million living .
156 countries our canal television .
Our revists are slowed millions of people .
Our work is to travel in the ethnosphere to bring our public public market from what will go out and hopefully as they saw and hopefully , hopefully , they will absolutely de-floating reveal of anthropology : the world of exists , and we need to find a style of lifestyle and mouth style , must have to find a style of multicultural life to a focus .
where the wisdom of all the people can contribute to our collective well-being .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope recall anything more that you &apos;ve heard and I &apos;m going to evidence some of the colleages , in case .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the official dogma official . &quot;
The official dogma offices what ?
The official official dogma of all of the Western industrial society . The official official official well-being of our citizens &quot; . &quot;
The reason is , from a side , in fact that liberty is in the fact that freedom is in the value , is precious , for human beings .
At the other is that if we are free , each of us can act for all of us can act for all that massive our benefit , no one that decided to our well-being , no one that decided to names our well-being .
The way to male the freedom is to move choice .
More people are the people have , more libers , and greater is their liberty , greater is their liberty , greater is their well-being .
This , I think , is so deeply radicated in the society that nobody would dream to put it into the doubt .
And it &apos;s also deeply radicated in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I lost a simple note of conditions for insalt .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , no contact , no contact of the extreme oil . And the 12 acet acets of the balses that you can buy to buy a huge number of conditions in the restaurant results that nobody of the 175 prones is to your degree .
That &apos;s the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronics of electronics to buy a stereo : case , letters , leter .
And in this single negotial neighborhood , there &apos;s a big number of audio .
We can make six and a half million combinations that there are a store of components that there are a negotious .
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice .
Some of the communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the services of the desire , the path that they were fornes from mama Bell .
He was born the phone , it was not buy it .
One of that , the other one of that , the phone was never hard .
These are time .
Now we have a variety of phones , especially with cellular phones .
Here &apos;s the cellular cellular .
My favorite is that in the middle , MP3 , cut of the naxes , and the basic cut me critical .
If you don &apos;t have you seen in the house under the house , you &apos;re certain that you will get to the back .
And what &apos;s going on is that the people come into the gozes and does this question . And you know what is the answer ? The answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell that doesn &apos;t make too much things .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the buy of the buy , you green the same explosion of choices .
Asanitarian health : not happen in the United States that you go from the doctor and doctor doctor what you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we can do , or you know , &quot; A , &quot; At these benefits . &quot; At these benefits . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Dr. &quot; You know , what should I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A has these benefits and these risks , and B has these benefits and these risks . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebroke , &quot; Doctor she was me , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result of the malate called the &quot; autonomy of malseem , expression that makes it looks like a beautiful thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not that one to spose the responsibility of taking decisions from someone who knows something , which is the doctor , someone else that you don &apos;t know -- and almost certainly , it &apos;s not the patient .
There &apos;s a huge marketing products of drugs , direct to people like me and you , who if you think about it doesn &apos;t have any sense , given you can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why do we publiicize ?
The answer is that they want to dominate that we call the doctor to ask to change the recise .
Something that is fundamental identity as our hythical identity is , as you see in this jump , as you see in this jump . &quot; We &apos;re not going to force the children . &quot; We &apos;re not going to be an identity : we need to invent .
And we can reinvent us how many times we get us .
That means that every morning , to the risk , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I repect the family and mathemselves , a time time the common .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not even when , and not even what to do after .
Ogyday , it &apos;s really to play .
I teach in a very smart students , and I think about 20 percent in less than a time .
And because they &apos;re not not smart , because they are less diligence .
Because I &apos;m impensieritites , I mean , &quot; I should go to ask me or not ? &quot;
&quot; Do I should move more later ? &quot; I have to think about the children or career ? &quot;
They &apos;re interrogorant .
And they &apos;re trying to answer these questions , even if this implement doesn &apos;t completely work that asseats and not get a beautiful vity to my exame .
And they have to do that . They have to do that .
Now , the work is , we are lucky , as Carl was , because technology allowed us to work every minute , every day , from Hotel Randolph .
In the parentesespecially , there &apos;s a angulous angulous , where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , this amazing freedom of choice that we have to continue , and that we have to continue , if we need to work or not .
We can go to the switch , with the cell phone in a task , the Blackberry in the other , and the night , typically , on the ginocy .
And even though they &apos;re all spended , every minute that we see our son , we &apos;re also asking , we &apos;re also asking , we &apos;re asking this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , &quot; that makes the experience of your son &apos;s partnership of your son who would be in other conditions .
So , from any of the look , small things , small things and big , materials and things , life is a choice of choices .
Once the world was this : Over , there were some possibility , but not a question of choice .
The world today looks like this : The dilemma is , &quot; Is it a positive , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Shorry .
The positive layers we all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about that negative .
All this choice is two negative effects negative effects on people .
The first , paradoxally , is that it produces that liberation .
With many of them , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I offer an example meaning : a study of volunteer , a study of volunteer .
A colleague has access to the Vanlook , the gigantic society of the source of the depension , with about a million of employees .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that for every 10 solutions that are offered , the percentage of adesion is two percent .
With 50 source of offerts , there &apos;s 10 percent of adesions that are available to when they &apos;re available to five . Why ?
Because with 50 source between which choose , is malelightly difficult to decide , and the choose is remandy to the indomants .
And domances , domances , domanances , domances , domangs , domances never get .
You can &apos;t have to say that these workers are going to eat the food for canes because they don &apos;t have enough money , it also , it &apos;s so hospith the decision is so host that they also lose the complementary of the work .
Not participating , they &apos;re allowing , and they &apos;re allowing up to figure out of the work , which would be willing to be .
So the paralise is a consequence of having too much choices .
And I think that &apos;s going to make the world .
&quot; And finish , for the eternity : ketchup , or mayonism ? &quot;
You would like to take the right decision , if it &apos;s for ethernity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and neppurchoose the wrong .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can avoid paralysis , and we &apos;re less satisfying on the result of how we would be with less options .
And that &apos;s a different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of conditions that you choose them , if you buy a and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have a better choose that you could have a better choose . And what &apos;s going on is that the alternative imagined us , and the remains the choice of choice , and the satisfy satisfacilation of the choice , and the satisfy of the decision ,
even when it was a good decision .
More choice , there are , more easy than any detail of whatever detail that is insodent of choice .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call cost-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert asked a lot of stamatus as the value that we &apos;re going to depend with what we &apos;re going to confront .
In the rest , when there are so many options , it &apos;s easy to repress the equal alternative characteristics and be less software of the option that you have choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I wrote a lot of those who are not New York .
But that &apos;s what you probably think you &apos;d probably think .
There &apos;s this coppia copy copy .
A place of lussize .
Spilllled . Otyma days . It &apos;s all for them .
Nothing . But what he thought is , &quot; Well , maledition , is , Agost . &quot;
&quot; All my neighbors are away . &quot;
&quot; I could talk about home . &quot;
And he past two weeks and assilate from the idea that &apos;s losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The cost-opportunity is declining the sod-on what we have , even when choice was a choice .
And the more are the options that we have to consider , more the characteristics of the expensive characteristics will return to how a cost-opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This jects us lots of things .
We talk about the living time , and maybe of living slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you choose , you choose the other .
The things that we don &apos;t choose have a tant tactivity that we do .
Tirst point : spiral growth of expectations .
I tried it on my skin compracticing a new jeans .
I &apos;m almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were just a kind of bought , compraved them and wonderful , they were dissimen them , only after they took them a life and worked a lot of times , began to go right .
So I went to buy a couple of a couple when those old old old old old , and said , &quot; I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
The committed to me , &quot; Lave them the slim , relaxy and fit ? &quot;
She wants to do you , or with the broken sons ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; acidwashed &quot; ?
&quot; Lave them straight ? &quot;
&quot; Sow the basic narrow or stretches ? &quot;
I was bord , and after a little bit of jeans I was able to say , &quot; I want the guy that was the only guy that was the only guy who was , so I tried to give me the best stands , then I tried to get out of the best jeans , then I was going to use me .
It was the big . I had the whole choice I had taken the best .
But I was feel worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worst that I was worse is that with the whole choice , the jeans were altissim , the jeans had to be perfect .
And I was the beginning I had minime . I didn &apos;t expect anything when there was only one of it , but when there was a lot of 100 different , lacky , at least a kind of perfect .
What I had buy was good , but not perfect .
And after the spring that choose the choose to what I was trying to be insodently in the expectations .
The addition of options in life of people don &apos;t make the expectations that these have respect to the eccellence of options that are .
And this will produce less satisfying , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing .
Because if they were , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more like this .
&quot; It was better when you were worse , &quot; The reason why it was better when you were worse when you were worse when you were worse is that when you were worse , it was still possible to meet surprised .
Ogyday , in the world that we live -- opulent , industrialized citizens with the perfection of perfection -- the most of the most of the things that we can hope is that the things are the heighbors .
You never surprised pleased pleasant because your expectations , they &apos;re ingiganten .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Basse waitative , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , you want . &quot;
I mean , little autobiographic time -- which I &apos;m really sposed and my wife is really studies .
I wouldn &apos;t have to do better , I &apos;m not agree .
But it &apos;s not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of buy a couple of jeans scomod-type jeans is that when you &apos;re not satisfacts , and ask you say , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot; And who is responsible ? &quot;
The world is responsible . What could I do you do you do it ?
When there are hundreds of types of jeans , and you buy a insodenter , and you ask you who is responsible , it &apos;s the responsible , it &apos;s the responsible to you .
You &apos;d have better better .
With hundreds of variety , there are no there are for the insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even though the result is valid , they feel income , they feel income and they give the hard .
In the last years , depression is exploss in the industrialized world .
I think a meaning factor -- not the only one , but the important -- of this depression is that people have experiences of depression is that people have experiences of the standard .
And when they have to explain this situation thought that the color is they think that the color is them .
So the final result is that we &apos;re in general , objectively , but we feel worst .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely false .
There &apos;s no doubt doubt that a little choice is better than they don &apos;t have it . It &apos;s not going to make that much choice is better than a little bit .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure that we &apos;ve been surely surely surface the level where the choices better our life .
Now , from political point of political view -- I &apos;ve almost finished -- the nocle is the following .
What allows of this choice in industrial society is the material .
There are many places in the world , and you know about the people , where the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too poca lot of them .
So the facility of modern I &apos;m talking is a malesclusive of modern , recivic society .
And what it makes it to do is this : Steve Levitt has talked about hyesterday of those costable and seats for bibs . It &apos;s a lot of money . It &apos;s a spread of money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and dispendent , it &apos;s not that they &apos;re just useful .
They &apos;re addicting of deleteries .
They do stay worst .
If a little bit of what in society allows , it &apos;s been reversated in those where people have too few possibilities , it wouldn &apos;t just their improvement , it wouldn &apos;t just their improve , but our better life .
This is what economists call is a partnership .
A region of the reduction of reduction is good at all -- not just to the poor -- because of this choice that it &apos;s going to go hold .
To conclude : &quot; For , you can become everything you want to be --
You , people of culture , you think , &quot; What does that create that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t make anything nothing in a glass of glass . &quot;
&quot; An inside , a limited vision of the world -- &quot;
And I interpret it , I interpret that , at the beginning .
But then , thinking about it , I realized that that fish the long knowledge .
Because the reality of the facts is that if you eat the bucks , so that , &quot; you can &apos;t get the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you rometworks , if you can dimining the sod-fying sodisphation .
You know , you &apos;re going to go , and reduced the well-being .
All they need a sfood .
This is almost certainly too strictly , maybe even for us .
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic symbolic and , I &apos;m in the roughly rhythellow .
Thank you .
