The year I showed these slide to dive to show that the calculate that the calculate , which is that for three million years had the size of years had the size of the 48 percent of the 48 percent .
And I was a lot of the gravity of the problem because of the problem because I don &apos;t show it .
The calculate glacial is , in a sense , the case of the cultural system .
It &apos;s expected and you reverse .
The next slide is going to be a very rapive carry on the last 25 years .
The drather type are drather in the front .
As you see , you can see , you know , you know .
That &apos;s the game in the short , which is a high .
You can see that the costold told , of five years or , of five years or , is how the sance the gone .
In 25 years is taking from so , so it .
This is a problem because the problem because the reducted the entire way , they &apos;re huge to the ocean where there are enormous artment that there are huge , and they &apos;re transformed in the ocean , they &apos;re transformed in the robrobs .
And the pectotality of the inquent inquent inquent , that &apos;s global , that might be a global watching , the right right right now .
In some games of the deep of Alaska half the half of the water .
The professor Katey Katey Walter University of Alaska , and I &apos;ve been a very based name .
Video : Wow ! And Gore : Leave me . The question is if you will be able .
A reason is that this scale scaled by the Greenon the Greenon .
This is a figured full .
The brought had never reached to reach them .
This is the Kangerlush , in the She &apos;s west of Groenlanguage .
If you want to know how to spend the move the move the move the food of the terrather , there is where you can go .
These corrents are aumented .
At the other planet : Antart , the large of the planet .
The month of the scientists have diart that the living of the gative of the gative is in negative , and that Antargative , and that Antype of the results of the money and the area , it &apos;s particularly , it &apos;s particularly , it &apos;s particularly .
Equare high saying , a half of the action , like Greenon .
Sulate Himalaya , the biggest blows , you see new blows , you see new laghes , which was a few years ago .
The 40 percent of the population was going to be able to be able to the water .
Sulle Anype : this little bit of water is the source of this city .
The brought is aumented .
But when you dimind , the same access to water .
In California , the nine on Siar Nevar is diminute .
The bins are the cribes .
The previsions , as you have been gravid .
The growth in the world &apos;s remember a notice of a notice .
The wasn trade are in a ritism , and we &apos;re going to be no preceds .
For times the most number of the last 30 years , I &apos;m going to preced 75 .
This is a andanding of all intenable .
If you look at the context stories if you can see the conset .
In the last 5 years , we &apos;ve got to 70 million tonce of CO2 , 25 million tone-ton-ton-ton-ton-ocean .
Look at the same area of the Pacifer , in the American , by American , and on the American , and on the U.S.
Most of the report of global report , in the deforest , which is 20 percent , is the 20 percent , is the 20 percent .
The piece is a problem , and the carbon is a problem .
The United States are one of the countries with more emissions , in the Cina .
And he was proposes to build many other central central carbon .
But we &apos;re saying a change of direction .
These are the designers in the last years , and some of the last years , and some of the country .
Even , there is a political political politics in our country .
The industries of the carbon and the oil of the pull of the last year for promise in the last year to promephone .
That imagine me remember something --
I know Nateral Tennesested , where I vive , there was a 3.8 billilions of 3.8 billions of carbon .
And if you &apos;ve seen the news .
This is the second big focus in America .
It &apos;s happened to Nateral Nateral .
The published of the human nature of the industries of carbon was this .
Video : Foften the carbon is a kind of wonderful and happy .
It &apos;s going to be here in America , and it &apos;s growing our economy .
Hot the carbon is always more can be .
It &apos;s good , the predict , the worth and work work in the stath and work .
Al Gore : Da here is here of the carbon of West Virginia .
The most society society on the montment is Massey Coal . This is Massey .
Video : Don Bluenship : Sark Al Gourth , Nankey , Harry Rid , Harry Rid -- not know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Al Proteople reotional Proteople wels .
This is a part of the one .
Video : Ator : ALergy : ALergy can see the climate change as a minute of our own own own .
This is our priority is investigate is investigate to a big defull or public to refully the public and confull the pture .
In fact , the carbon is not sport .
We think it &apos;s a good good good -- has a good good good good .
So , it doesn &apos;t predictator .
Let me to do us .
Video : Ator : Carbone -- you &apos;ve heard about .
So I do a game in a street in a street for the carbon .
She &apos;s a little bit of machines are a little bit of technology , but this is the such of technology .
The consut of carbon is between the main the main the cause of the global technology , but the needed technology of the carbon .
You have a focus : this is the odigase of carbon .
Al Gore : Inend , the alternative , the fact , the economic economic and that &apos;s the economic and that of the sure of the sure .
Video : As America is in the ccribed ; the economy , the economy , the climate climate climate .
The college that the college : our dipendence , and the dence of the behind , like the pull and the oil and the oil .
Now , I &apos;m a new new , there is a new new , audence for solution .
Reature America : 100 percent percent of the pull ,
A pian to put America , to put the work , and make a more and helped to help the report , and helped the global .
At , one solution that buts the solution that you can solve our problems .
Reople can America . She &apos;s prised .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : As Yeah , Yeah .
One of the moon of the moon the dependence of the dependence that we have our planet .
She &apos;s the future is here . It &apos;s right . She &apos;s going to do .
She &apos;s two : Noves : Nooves for positive burn .
She &apos;s a new : Reeeer . It &apos;s time .
Al Gore : A very prised or named , &quot; If you want to go to the sell , you want to go .
If you want to go back , you go back , you go together . &quot;
We have to go back , fly , focus .
Thank you very much .
The year I &apos;m going to be the TED fected in the LHC .
And I &apos;m going to be write to go to the nars of how it works .
So , I comparts . And for those who don &apos;t have , the most experiment , the most experiment that was the largest experiment -- 27 millions of the conference .
His a compit of record to realive the conditions that they were presents at the universe , until it &apos;s the universe .
All what &apos;s just simply simply .
This is the machine . She was a Ginevent .
We have these photograph , Bang Bang Bang Bang ,
This is what work . It &apos;s called ATAS -- is a 44 feet and a half half a half half .
This is an image of ATS in ATS in AAS in built so you can &apos;t have the proportions .
The 10 spurpose of the scored year we have access to the first time .
And this picture was written from ATAS .
It was because of immentioned in the health of control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first phasy of particles that he had been in the LC , using in the LC , and I &apos;m going to be a part of LHC , and I &apos;m going on the particles in the result .
In other words , when we see the image of the image , the machine words , the machine works , the machine works .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;m not going to do that , when somebody on Google and vivisual that the page was this .
What means that we had a cultural cultural cultural .
And I just got a week , there was a problem with the machine , and it was a problem with these here -- these these these -- these phils here .
These brought 1333,000 amping when the machine works .
Now , the technicians about you &apos;re going to be a little bit . &quot; It &apos;s not true . &quot; It &apos;s not true . &quot;
And I can do that when they &apos;re very very largest .
So , at at least 271 , to a temperature that the space between the standing between the standing , these phils can bring that corrent .
In one of the left between the most of the novems in LHC , there , there was a difabulation .
So , the fully read , and the 13,000 paybe 3,000 payers , and 13,000 paper .
This was the result .
Now , this is still more than 20 , and I think these magnetwork , and the late late 20 , and that they &apos;re saying , and that they &apos;re posed to about 30 percent .
They are dangered about 50 magnetwork .
We had to stop them , what we did .
We have reprise and they were going to be .
They &apos;re written up with all the place .
The finally of the bake LHC will be going to be new integrated .
We &apos;re going to be , and we &apos;re going to get the data to get data to the body , and continue so our own own own , and so our own own own own .
Now , of course , in a certain in a certain , these dents , and they read the value of science and the inethy of the science and the confuture . It &apos;s what it &apos;s .
I think that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s done , I think that is that the value of things like LHC .
I &apos;d like to conclude with the party of the scientist of the English , Humrey , which is , the imagine , which is , in the indemidle of his own own own own . And the pulled Michael Fararch , &quot; He said , &quot; Nicheel , &quot; It &apos;s not a new result of the ideas , and how much of the results of the square , and that they don &apos;t have to be a new square ,
Thank you .
I want to start to ask the slongs of rethink , from the ground , and you had to the hear .
While you want to reach them and they &apos;re going to get them , to make them and move them , and I learned to think about how to think and revarious problems .
The reasoned is defly defly connected to the way we &apos;re going to be able to us .
So , from the information , I was just pulled by the objects of our interation with my constructed , and the collaborator , and I started a collaborator , and I started started to me , and I started started to have a computer , when we &apos;re a computer computer , when we &apos;re a computer gachieve , and I could have a computer gave , and I could put the pulled , and I could be a slowly , and you could have a source ,
and systems to our piece ?
The question was so interesting that decided that decided to exploring the answer , build the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a computer interactive like a birth .
In a few words , a Siftable is a computer interactive like a birth .
And you can move with the move with the move , they can see , &quot; You can &apos;t see the movement and a halfer .
But the most of the physicist , as the morning , as the ground , you can &apos;t be pay them .
Siftable is the example of a new ecosycements to manipping the information .
And must be become more physicist , connected the movement , and they move the other other , and they become more physics , consciously , as we can put them , as we can pay new , we can pay new and different interaction .
I &apos;m going to be with some simple example .
This is Siftable is configuring for video : if you pull a direction , the video reaction , if you go back to the other way .
These realized you &apos;re consciously consciousness .
If you are interesting , you know , you know what they &apos;re going to go .
If they come out of data , notice , and they can go to a little bit .
If they come out of data , notice , and they can go to a little bit .
They &apos;re also going to be their movement and inclination .
We have the rest that one of the interesting interesting implications of the interaction was the power of the data , in the data , you know , &quot; a color as if it was a liquires .
In this case , we have three Siftable as a center of the century , and I can use them to be a central centry , where you can do .
And I can use them to get them to the color in the central , where they can .
If we &apos;re too too , we can put a little bit .
There are also beautiful possibility of appears , like the logic games of the logic games of the people where the people can &apos;t try to be , and you see the things , you see , and you see it .
Now I &apos;m going to saying --
This is a sequence of Fibonce that I do with a program of the equations .
Here we have a game of party that is a half f the Shabor and Bobject .
And , I can remember , every single litters on every Siftable on every Siftable , every single , every single letters , every hundreds of Siftable , and while I &apos;m going to be control him .
And then , after about 30 seconds of the second , and you have a new set of literately and a new new new possibility .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s a children in the Media Lab , I did in the Media , I did it , and I was a video .
They are a very high .
And one of the interesting things of this genetie is that not that you don &apos;t have to be a lot of education .
You have to say , &quot; The purpose of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; As , and they will do it .
Here &apos;s some other people who try .
This is our tester tester , there there there , there there there .
It was actually implant to be able .
They were only morning , for him .
Now , this is an application of a carton .
We wanted to build a strument for the gent of the lingule Luuur .
It can inserve new new new new personally in the Siften their Siftable .
It can inserve new new new new personally in the Siften their Siftable .
So , it &apos;s doing the solar .
Video : The solar is the solar and the solar .
David Merrier : Now he brought a train in the scena .
Video : The tracy .
Bel ! Yeah . Yeah !
So , I &apos;m going to put the near and put them back to the near ,
Video : Bau !
And I &apos;m going to be a story .
Video : Ciao !
DM : It &apos;s a history , and you can decided to decide him .
DM : It &apos;s a history , and you can decided to decide him .
Video : Video : See , game .
DM : The last example I &apos;ve been a whole strument of the strument , realized , to walk , to walk and you can make music .
It &apos;s a strument , realized , to walk , to walk and pull you can &apos;t care music .
She &apos;s Siftable here , they &apos;re based as the buts .
Exone of these has four different variations , and you can write that .
And then you can involved these such in a sequence of a sequence .
And modificance is just doing a such &quot; and a &quot; a sequence . &quot;
These are effects that you can control the vive , as the result and the filler .
It &apos;s a particular who &apos;s a particular and then incline to the danger .
And then there are the fact , and they &apos;re actually as time , which you &apos;re just just just just a sequence .
We let &apos;s take how it works .
Video : DH : We &apos;re going to put a base in Siftable , &quot; systems , the systems , the systems , we &apos;re going to go to the other .
Now , I &apos;m going to move a base .
Video : Now I reached me to do this --
Video : DH : And now , I &apos;ll put the butters , so I can control the effect effect of the visual .
Video : People : People : People are the entire sequence in the other .
Video : DH : And now I &apos;ll add the phild to site the biggest .
Video : DH : People remember the sequence . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to be able to be able to be able to be a long long long gets more longer .
And now , finally , I can save the entire ftable , until the left Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is build new new new new as a machine as well as well as our brain works like our brain and the brain .
And today , I had time to show you one of this perhaps , and some possibility that we &apos;re going to bring out from the laboratory .
The concept I want to be a few deep objects of obs , objects of objects , which will will be information , that will will be information in our world that we want to our world .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the right now .
I &apos;m a choice .
Scook of the book is my profession , but it &apos;s the most of this , of course .
It &apos;s also the friend of my life .
And I don &apos;t expect that can change .
But , I said , something that , something that &apos;s recently in my own own own own own , which has brought me to realive the entire entire rely with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently realized this book , this biography called &quot; Manh , People , &quot; The &quot; Actually , &quot; The &quot; Actually , &quot; The fact , and I &apos;m going to be a big reason , and become a big hind , and become a big non-ftiny .
And the result is that anything that I &apos;m going to be able to me as if they were conducted .
David -- -- condanned , conducted !
They &apos;re going to be all worked and say , &quot; You don &apos;t know , &quot; You don &apos;t have more than you can &apos;t be better ?
You don &apos;t have to be able to be write to be able to be able to be able to be able to create a book that can you ? &quot;
that can you can &apos;t be ? &quot;
It &apos;s run , you know .
But it could go to , I remember that I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say , I was a very cent -- I wanted to be a scring .
And in the front of the same reaction .
And people said , &quot; He said , &quot; You don &apos;t have to have to have ?
You don &apos;t know , the million refive of refully refaise ?
You don &apos;t have to do this move to the site of life without out out and it will never be out of dead .
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : &quot; Yeah . &quot;
And I &apos;ve got to the other things .
I &apos;ve always had been a couple .
And I also have a lot of other things that people could not be involved .
As the galga and other things .
But , to how much about how much I thought and I thought I was a deully reully , why ?
Is it &apos;s the company ?
It &apos;s logic that anything that you have to do .
But what &apos;s a particular particular in the imprise of creative creative , and I think about health , as a way that other kinds that other carried ?
How do my father , for example , he was a guy , and I don &apos;t remember of a 40 years of the watchemistry that he was asked if he was asked if you could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
It &apos;s no -- that blows that was -- that blowed ?
It won &apos;t work , so it was not so ,
Only , the engineers like , as group as they don &apos;t have a type of the centuries , in the center of being being a reputation of being depressive .
We written , we have this reputation , and not just just written , but only creationship , we have this reputation of being a huge member of institution .
And I don &apos;t result that you &apos;re going to look at the death of the magnific , only ments that , only in the century , they &apos;re going to be hand and now to go .
And also that you don &apos;t have to be such a lot of them .
Norman Mailer , before death , I was going to death me , &quot; Ogain , &quot; Ogn a little bit more than &quot; a little bit more than &quot; I think about work .
But we don &apos;t put it out of the time , we &apos;ve heard of these things , so we &apos;ve got to be completely interested in the way we have been interested in the network that creativity and the connection , and the art , to the way , it &apos;s going to be , it &apos;s going to be able to be able to the end .
And the question I want to do anything about today is : you &apos;re you &apos;re going to do with this idea ?
And I &apos;m going to be this -- because it &apos;s also a centire centire .
I think it &apos;s a diodie .
And I think it &apos;s also perhaps and I don &apos;t want to see the perpecual in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better incording our big creative creative creative creative .
And I &apos;m sure that , in my case -- it would be very pericully , it would be very cycle of the best of the best of the best bad of the best basic browed the worse .
It &apos;s true -- but you look , I &apos;m going to be 40 years .
I &apos;ve got about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very saying that that that anything is going to be going to be going to be a job in the world as the work that useful thing ,
I &apos;m going to be , because we are all the most or left here -- it &apos;s probably the most succeed to my liften .
Oh , Gesus , that I was that I think ,
You know this is the geneties that &apos;s a person to start to start to start to come to the nine and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would reference to do this work that we &apos;re going to do this work .
So , the question is , how ?
And so it seems to me , many reflected , that the way of work to continue to go to to to make a constructed psychological proteck , right ?
I had to find a few way to find a very sure of several , and my natural natural , and my natural natural natural thing that I &apos;ll be write what I &apos;m going to be able to be able to be able to do with the time , and I was trying to look at the time , and I &apos;m trying to find other society to be some of the new ideas and more and more and more of the other ideas as as as as well .
And on how to help people creative to create the same people who emotional creativity .
And that research has brought to the Gret and Roma .
Seeeeeye because I hold it in the hydropped .
In the Great Great and Roma -- people don &apos;t set to believe that the creativity , OK ?
And it was thinking that creativity was this spirit and that &apos;s a few people from a few people from a few people from a few people from a few people and so much , to know , and I know , and know , and know , and knowledge .
We were called these these diven . The drather than creativity . &quot;
You know , you know , a wonderful , credit of demand that elargas .
The Romans were the same idea , but called that species a genius .
The big big , because the Roman , because the Roman really thought a very genive .
They have a little bit of a very special species of this species that you believe that you believe in the murs of the middle of a artist , a little bit like the elfully , and that if you &apos;re going to be able to be a little bit of the work of the work of the work .
Here &apos;s a throw -- here is the distance of that that -- that &apos;s the extruth -- that you see you protect you to protect your work .
And all had that was so that he worked , right ?
So the artists were protected by the first example , how to example example , how to do you , no ?
If your work was a job . If you could not get to the site , all they had been helped by this genius , and they had been helped by this genius .
If your work work , if your work , it won &apos;t be able to your own own own , right ?
All they knew that was the tual incapital .
And so people conceived the creativity in Occcycar for very time .
And then the Rinden was and all changed , and that &apos;s going to be the human idea ; we put the human universe , we put the universe , and the long-hundreds and more and more and more and more and more let &apos;s creatures .
This was the main the human human , and people start thinking about thinking that the creativity , and think that creativity is completely completely completely completely .
And for the first time in the story , you &apos;re going to referk this or that one one of a gene of a gene that I &apos;m going to be a guy with a gene .
And I &apos;m going to tell , I think it was a grospitchor .
I think it &apos;s a simple of a simple person , a simple of a simple , and the fourth , the needed , and the kinds of all the people of all all the slights , creatives you a very much fillability to be a little bit too much of the slight-to-to-toto-totototo-to-to-to-toto-to-to-to-to-to-to-to---to-to-------f-f-food .
It &apos;s how to ask somebody of intual instead .
Deeat and disease , and creating all these initive expectative .
And I think it &apos;s this pression to described the artists in the 500 years .
And , if this is , and I think that is , and I think it &apos;s the question ?
We can do that different ?
Maybe to go to a comcommercial comcommercial human relationship .
Or maybe it .
Maybe we can &apos;t cell cellent 500 years of thinking about 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience that solar later , and the scientific scientific scientific , and you that they have the people who saying , the people who have been able to be able to their program .
And you can &apos;t have to you all on this thing .
But the question I would like to explain it , why ?
Why don &apos;t I think that in this way ?
Because it &apos;s more than every other thing that has ever ever ever ever , I &apos;ve heard to explain the expert of the process .
And a process that , as anything that he has ever ever ever ever , so it &apos;s a very , so you know , you don &apos;t have to be a company .
And , in fact , you can , you can &apos;t be completely worked .
I did this incontrovered with the strake with the Ruth Stone , which is now 90 years , but that has been a little bit for all life and he he was a few weeks and he said he was a little bit of the Virginia , and he was working on the watching , and he was a poeful time , and he was a powered , and he was a powered in the powered .
He said that it was like a fragagainst .
And that he was rotating to the country .
She &apos;s going to come , because he did a little bit the land .
He was a sold thing to do that that point and he was , and he was , &quot; drather than a mathor . &quot;
And so it was going to be a few and he was introduced by this powerful , and it won &apos;t have to make a piece of a car mathemselves , as it was a little bit of fun , and it was going to be a page .
And sometimes I couldn &apos;t have enough to be enough , so the record and record and the home and the home and the home and the home and the lost and the home and the home and it would be able to go through the country , and he would be trying to go to , as a few intable . &quot;
Then there were those times -- this piece of the six check that there was a moment that the drather than it was almost , OK ?
So , he was draw and he was trying to be trying to the carry and the powered , and he was a throw that he was going to be , and then he was when he was going , and then he was when he was going to be , and then he was going to be .
He was a few powered by and the reacting and the reacting and the transpage .
And in these cases , the poetry would be a page and pull it &apos;s just a control , the last party , the last party .
So when I feel the thought -- it &apos;s a couple , is exactly exactly in my process .
And my process process , I don &apos;t have a conducted !
I &apos;m a bad , and my way to work is , and I &apos;m saying , and I &apos;m going to work and I &apos;m going to work and go to the lots of course .
But I was in my test , in my test , I was striet that , sometimes .
And imagine that also many of you have the han han done .
You know , even if the work and ideas and I was saying , and I was a certain a certain .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relationship us to do it , but it doesn &apos;t care , but it &apos;s a type , that we do you do ?
For how much I look at the best example of the contemport that I &apos;ve been the music Tom Wail , which I interview was a nal day .
We were talking about this , and you know , and you know , for the most of life was the inden of the artist of artist , and trying to control , trying to control , trying to control , trying to control these specially interested .
But then I &apos;ll invected , and a day day , and a day when he was drather on a authority , changed all .
He was wondering and all of the type of the mine of mount , which is a wonderful sent like his head , and it &apos;s a piration , elusize and the desidduction , you know , and the descrippppull , and the descriped .
It doesn &apos;t have a piece of career , it doesn &apos;t have a restrator .
So , I &apos;m going to feel this species of the clear , &quot; the switched , and I &apos;m saying , and I &apos;m saying , and I &apos;m going to be a personal works .
I &apos;m not saying and I don &apos;t know cells . &quot;
And invent to go to the pay , you know .
I &apos;m going to be a whole process and fly something new .
And I &apos;m going to be the watched and said , &quot; Sccope , &quot; Sccope , I &apos;m going to be ? &quot;
&quot; You know , you know , you know , you know ?
If you really want to get it , you get to a moment when I can make me care .
And I &apos;m going to be able to be able to be able to do anything .
You &apos;re going to be a buth Cohen . &quot;
And his process process , I have changed after this .
Not work , the work was still like .
But the process , and the fish , and the weight that was record when the geniiius , the geniiius that he was going to be able to be able to be able to the other problems that he was going to be a whole thing that he was going to be a whole thing to be thing to be something interested .
But I &apos;m going to get this peculikely , it &apos;s a collaboration conversation between Tom and this thing that he was not Tom and this thing that it was not Tom and this was not Tom .
So , how much you feel that changes a little bit of that changes me and I was already to me a little bit .
This idea , I &apos;m going to saying , &quot; Manh , Preat , Pret , and I said , &quot; and I &apos;m going to be able to be able to be able to do something and we &apos;re doing something and we &apos;re doing something something and we &apos;re going to think that it &apos;s going to be a little bit bit .
It &apos;s not just the right right , the purpose .
And I started thinking about how to think about this project .
But then I remember of Tom that works in the air and try .
So I went to the host of the host and dried my heart and drather than the stance .
And I &apos;m going to be walk , &quot; Sents , what we know , &quot; Spull , what if this book is not going to be not happy to be interped to my own , no ?
Because as I &apos;m saying , I &apos;m going to put it , I don &apos;t have this .
So if you want to be better , you have to remember and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t , I &apos;m not saying , I don &apos;t have fully fully .
I &apos;ll go to write the same thing .
And I would like to flow me that I was regiven me that I remember , &quot; Because , &quot; Because it &apos;s so , OK , OK , OK , OK , OK , OK , OK , OK , in the North Africa , OK , OK , a lances of a lang , and the music , and the hours that they were a hours to the hours .
And they were always magnific , because the balleries were been fantastic and they were fantastic .
But every , I rearly , something happened , and one of these artists was actually actually transformer .
And I know that you know , because I know , because I know that you &apos;ve got to a perforce , a performance .
And it was like if the time , and the balleron , and the ballered in a special species , and it won &apos;t stop , like the 1,000 .
And to improvide , I don &apos;t know how a human human .
But you &apos;re going to be in and slow in the drather than the divinity .
And when this is going to deep , the people who knew , people knew what was , called the name .
They were the hands and , and they started to sell , &quot; Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , God , God . &quot;
That &apos;s Dod , you know .
Curise , I &apos;m going to note the Memems of Spay , I was this abind of the Spay , and the proned to the centuries , &quot; Okay , Allah , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , you can go in the shamazing .
Appay , when a artist , a artist , and magic , OK , OK , OK , OK , Allah , and I was , &quot; I was , &quot; I was , &quot; one one one of Dod .
And it &apos;s very big because we need .
But , the problem , the problem , for the day , and the same time , when you save it out that I &apos;m going to be 11 , and I &apos;m going to be 11 .
It &apos;s just a dead with a death with ginockets , and maybe be never going to be more ask to that the hand .
And maybe no one of Dod , and I &apos;m still going to do it , and what I &apos;m going to do ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the remember of the rive of the source .
But maybe you don &apos;t have to be so much if you could not believe , no creating , that the most extraordinary , that the most extraordinary of your high .
But created that you can just tell you that you have to get a indemic ination of this squiet of this squiet of your life that you &apos;ve got to go to anything .
And , you know , if we think in this way .
And I started thinking , and I &apos;m spend , and it &apos;s slightly how I thought about a different months of the book that I &apos;m going to be present , the cycle , the perhaps , the cycle of my dangerous thing .
And that I &apos;ve seen to tell me when I sent electric that &apos;s , not available .
You don &apos;t go . From just the work .
It &apos;s going to be represented to your your part , which is going to be .
If your work is balls , balls , ball .
If the divine , I &apos;m going to be able to leave the saying of a wonderful kind of wonderful source , so so you know , then you know , then the OK . &quot;
And I &apos;m going to be the same your dance .
&quot; The &quot; ! &quot;
I think I &apos;ve got to be able to teach it .
&quot; The same thing , you know , even for you , even had had a human and ttal tyal tape , and tyal tape .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Okay .
As I &apos;ve talked about some of these designs on the genome , on what can means and discovered to the new set of new genes .
We &apos;re starting to a new new thing : we started to digitalize the biology and now now now we &apos;re going to be in a new new new new biology , we &apos;re going to be in a new new new biology , and team designed systemed .
We always tried to get big questions .
&quot; What is the life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists I think they have been a lot of saying .
We tried to be different approach , reduced us .
We &apos;re digitalized by 20 years .
When we sequence the genome of human genome , they were the past of biology in the world of biology in the world .
Now , we ask : We can regenerate life , or create new life ?
This is the maps of a little organism , Mycopy , the Mycopy , which is the species that can be the most type of the laboratory .
And we tried to return the genome of the genome for creature for creature .
We &apos;re able to be able to eliminate a hundreds of about 500 that are here .
But when we take a mapping to his myself , is relatively , it &apos;s relationship to our .
This is simple , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one to the time , it &apos;s very imimpossible that can bring a cells .
So , we decided that the only way to reach this chosomosomoss in way to be able to make the component components to report the components to get some questions .
And so we started the right right , &quot; We &apos;ve been the synthrow a cromoss ? &quot;
And that the chemistry to make these big product of product , we never have to create creating these big big .
And , in fact , I &apos;m going to do it works like , we can &apos;t work a cromoss ?
A crazy is simply simply a piece of material chemistry .
The vocity that we &apos;re able to deep the life is growing life growth .
Our capacity of choose to choose the genetic , invent , but it &apos;s better , but it &apos;s better better .
And our most recently record the behavior .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process has realized a lot of record , began with a revision before we start with a revision before we start .
But we found that synthrow of DNA is very difficult .
There are decine of thousands of car , the machines of DNA , of the DNA , of the long long time , and it &apos;s a process , and it &apos;s a process , and it &apos;s a very long process .
So we had to develop a new metaphor to ask these framments and read the read .
And this was our first tently , I &apos;m going to talk about the information of the genome of Phi Phi 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that are going to be a little bit .
We designed the framments , effectures , effectures and a molecule of DNA lot of DA about 5,000 lectars .
The interesting part of the material is when we took this piece of material chemist , and we have inserious in the batteratterns , the batterns , the battern of the fact , and product products .
The particles are virtual , then you &apos;ve got to get the cells , and they &apos;re going to be destructed the EE.
I talked about remember of the industry of the industry of the industry , and they &apos;re just composed to be composed to this model .
They have more of you have to be .
We believe that this is a situation that we see that the situation can build the same deftor .
But we wanted to do the more .
We wanted to build the entire clear .
They are 50,000 demile of the genetic coal .
So we thought we build the size of the size of virus , so that we could change the class to understand what the class that they can make the cell cells .
The design is crazy , and if we start with information in a computer , and if we start to be very accurate computer , and they have to be very accurate .
When we sequence this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accurately standard was a herror for every 10 middle .
We found , required , 30 challenge , if we were used that sequence , if we were able to do it .
And one part of the process is to design segs 50 letters that you have to have a 50 lpuring 50 lpppaper for 50 lpaper to build more little little little little bit more smaller and works .
We &apos;re going to elements here .
You &apos;ve got later , you &apos;ve got to be later .
And I think , so we have a coal genetc , and Two .
Then of those lectacious 20 minamamount about 20 minames , and there &apos;s specific remember of literate to every minute .
So we can use the genety of the genetics for screen , until of the genety .
What we did in the beginning is authography .
Some of the fact , they were been a few powered .
We designed these segs to be simply , just just only only only only only only only only only only only only only only only only to me .
There are the entire thing that they &apos;re going to put them and put them .
And we started to ask the parts of the parts , began with segs , until led , until led , until the way to the 24 , and lectars to their time to sell .
And every past we have produced these segs in the dance , so we could sequence them that we &apos;re going to create a very building a process process , how you &apos;re going to see a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatizing the process .
So , this seems to the tabables .
When we revive these segents very long , more than 100 mixed , more than 100 middle , not growing in the E.
It &apos;s going to get the limited of modern modern modern .
So we looked like we looked like this .
We had to do another other other other other other other other else , that in biology , which in biology , which in biology , that biology to repartment .
Here &apos;s a example .
This is a organism , called Deinoccurs to the three million rate three million running rad .
You can see in the result as his own own own own own own own .
In 12 -- 24 hours is reacted as it was like before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do this .
These organisms can be completely completely .
They can live in the sound .
I &apos;m absolutely saying that life is in the space , and you can find new environment to find new environment .
After , NASA has shown that this is shot that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we build these process , simply just using the design of the design design of the design of the segm of the segm .
The eventually assembly .
This picture was not wrong with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a molecule that we can see the microscope with a microscope .
These are pictures that they are a period of about six .
This is the published that we did a time .
They are 50,000 lectal of coal coal .
It &apos;s the molecule of a very dedicated street .
It &apos;s a fish led fish to 300 million .
If you &apos;re going to be a career without out , they would like 142 page , just would be 12 paper , it &apos;s coal .
Now , how do we do that ?
Of course , a virus is a virus is a game .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when they use .
It &apos;s more simple when it &apos;s a phone of cells as our own own : You can simply extract the nuclear and inserve , and you can inserve the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process .
In the battery of the cromoss is invent in the cells in the cells , but we have recently dededecell that we &apos;re going to be able to do a cells of a cell phone .
We can refully a crobial species .
The two are different than the man of the men .
We &apos;ve got some gene and in more way to decide that I could decided to this cell .
The scientist of science with the entire entire entire all the protein .
And when we put the phone in the cells is a very door , and you appear our graphor -- the new systems -- the new cell .
And I think we couldn &apos;t go to the way we couldn &apos;t go to the way we tried to be more in there .
This is one of the mectures of evolution .
We found that that that you have been done a second term or a term or a term or a term of some part , I addt a second second .
So , who think about evolution as a gene and the time you can &apos;t have to be able to be part of biology .
There &apos;s the entire entire entire entire me that we have to digerve DNA .
The cell cell that was in the cells .
The cellula-cell cellul-sted that we have a standing .
It &apos;s expressed , and has recognize the other synthesis as material , and it &apos;s got , and we found us , and we find with the cells and the new cells .
it &apos;s become a bu of the genes that we have to be .
And in a short of time , all the carists of a species are going to be , and it &apos;s transformed to the new species , and it &apos;s just a new new new species , and we &apos;ve got to get the new new new species .
All the protein the protein , and when we &apos;re changing , and when we &apos;re changing the genetic genetic genetic .
Now , this could seemy to look at the DNA , but altering the DNA , we can change things in the flowed .
Now , I &apos;ve got to explain that here is not talking about the genius -- but I &apos;m going to be three million years and a half f years and a half course , and I &apos;m going to create new version of the Crize of the Cririze of this new species that will be a new new process .
Why do I do what ?
I think it &apos;s enough when we think about our own own own own .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion and a half f million people in the next 40 years .
Just to dry a example : I &apos;m ned in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for the planet for 1946 , there will be four .
We &apos;re going to be on now now now , and pull , a half bully , medicine and half million billion and a half f f f f people .
It &apos;s going to be more doctor for nine billion .
We &apos;re going to be more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion billion dollars .
That means millions of miles of the day .
When we &apos;re trying to find process , or or whether you all kinds of process to replaces , will be a huge huge .
In more we have to have to the emission of CO2 from these materials that &apos;s the atmosphere .
Al day of today , though , though the scientific world , we have a database of about 20 million genes , and I like , and I like , and I like the future .
The industry is possible to be a dozen dozen about components , and think about a little bit different things are there .
Our limited here is the biological ical data from the biological imagination .
Now , we have the technique , throw these metoften , we can do that we call what we call genomics .
We &apos;re able to build a lot of robot that can produce a million chromosomoss a million cccclass .
And you think about 20 million of these 20 million different different different different different years . And we think about a little bit of produced to produce the process to produce , new new , we can change , we can change , we can change , we can change , and more biology , and more biology , and more biology , and more society .
And it &apos;s just a focus .
We can choose to possibility of the possibility of the carbon , chemistry , and it &apos;s a carbururursus .
This is a few of the flowing of some of the program that we &apos;re working in the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know , we don &apos;t know how they will be .
We know , we know , the fact is their genetic coal .
Now we &apos;re concentrate the carbon of quarter generation .
You &apos;ve seen you see you that that you can see the grandscape .
We have a second of the second and terrible generation that will be able to the gone of carbon the biggest hand as the full of the full .
But the only way that biology can be a big implant , and the longer than the most human , and limited the hood , the hood , and the limited CO2 , the CO2 , we &apos;re going to do the cells , we &apos;re doing cells that we &apos;re going to do the cells that they can make this cells .
The solar solar solar with CO2 is a metodoor -- but in our discovered in the world , we found different .
This is a organism that we have described in 1996 .
And you &apos;re going to be about 2500 feet of a deep deep deep the temperature of water .
They can put out from CO2 , O2 , using a molecules as a lot of energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can imagine if we can imagine the CO2 , that can make a trament tramed tramed that CO2 in O2 in carbon .
So we can share we think we could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the question of the question is , &quot; We can be the mother , we can desk the moobiobibibibiobibibird .
And you can &apos;t do it . If you can &apos;t do it ?
It would be a main the main of energy .
And we &apos;re working on the other words to use the stage of creating vaccine .
You &apos;ve seen this year with a year with a year and go back to a year and a dollar with a dollar in a bit of a bad .
I think what you can change change is going to change change .
And here &apos;s how the future could be a lot of change , the Eximate , the evolution of the evolution , and the remember , and I could be a blowed blowed the blowed .
We &apos;re going to be better from the best people .
Our pull of the way to live enough to make enough to make cells . Thank you very much .
And I &apos;ll give you , I &apos;ll see , the more possible , some work work , some work of new technology that we bring new technology that we bring a year ago .
It &apos;s a hours in which you can interact with a huge that you can make a huge visit of data .
Here we &apos;re seeing a lot of picture with a picture of picture with a little bit of coom , and I continued , to a focus , to a sell running , drather than we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much big thing is the big thing that we see , how much big . And the big data .
Most of the photograph of the photograph , but this for example is a scanker from Biblian Biblian . And the red-of Congrgry , and redd-300 gape .
Don &apos;t have a difference because the only thing that limited is the number of a pixial system . And the number of the pxide . It &apos;s also an architecture . It &apos;s a very flflu .
This is a book , of data doesn &apos;t imagine .
This is Casoldest of Dickens . Every colonce . Every much .
For shot you that it &apos;s just just just images , and not imagine what you can do a very , to see that it &apos;s a very representation of a picture of a picture .
It could be a little bit of artificial artificial .
Don &apos;t look at the son .
This is a more society . It &apos;s a number of the Guardian .
Every imagine is the beginning of a set .
And there &apos;s a very piece of the beautiful experience of read .
We also did something with the angle of this number of this number of the Guardian .
We created a published published the resolutions -- very much more than that you because that you can be in a normal published -- and we &apos;ve got to inserve the containment .
If you want to see the caristic of this audience , you can see here .
Or other mother , or even the specific technique .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limited space .
We &apos;re hopefully means to the population and other cheries , no more , they don &apos;t have to be more to be .
And course , the map is one of the applications is one of the technology .
And on this this is not going to be able to say that we don &apos;t want to say that we &apos;re going to be a little bit .
These are all the streets in the U.S.
So now we &apos;re going to be able to be able .
This is actually the web of the web . You can go to the web .
It &apos;s a project called Photynth Photynth , which was two different technology .
A Seady and the other research is a very interesting visual computer interested in Noah Snavailable to the University Washington , with the U.S.
And it &apos;s the web of the web , glowed Seady .
You can see this kind of a school , you can see this kind of a picture , where we can go to another and have this kind of experience and have this kind of experience .
But the collocation of the picture of the picture of the picture .
The goritoritous visualization of the computer have record these pictures , in fact that the records to the body , and the shark , all the neighborhood , all the near Rose MMontacross Montants of the MMontagr.
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;m not going to show you some other environment .
There are some more space .
I want to go to one of the data in the data in Noahahigh -- and this is a precedent precent prototynth of Photynth Photynth , we did it worked to show you what we did .
We had to have to worry about the several and saying .
This is a record of the Not Badigital Nothree Drunning . Badigital Din Flickly Nothree Din Flickly , and you can images in the magnetilies , other things . Olickr . Olicer .
So , I &apos;ve got all images from Flickly and they &apos;re all all the space in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to this way , and simply .
You know , I won &apos;t thought about Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratified to remember this kind of access here .
I think you can see that you can see that it &apos;s a lot of a different kinds of fotional photos , from those cellularly , a means , a means , a meant means , a means , a maybe in this environment .
And if you reested , I &apos;m trying to try to those more streets .
Many of the blows , you know , etched it .
And somewhere where you have a series of photograph --
This is a poster of Nothree Dreregigiant .
We can go from the poster of the visual of this environment .
The essential thing is that we can do with the social environment . This is a data from data -- from the entire memory of how to do the remember , from the point of visual data .
All of those pictures are become of the parts of the parts .
You have a model of the terrible .
And you think about this as proled as a prold of Stephen Lawer on Earth .
It &apos;s something that growing in complete complete , and the people that the uses are using the other who I use it for those who are useful uses .
They &apos;re picking with metaphor with metaphor other people .
If somebody is a few draw all these saying , my name , my phone of Noths , my phone of Nothree Dimprovides , and the can required and the pose of the data , and the post-term , and I can use it in that universe , and I can use the phone of the universe , and anything can &apos;t be a social way .
And course , a consequence of all of all that are virtual sycheck of every interesting interesting part of every interesting interesting part of the terms of the terms of the terms of the report and imimage , but the memory of the memory of the memory .
Thank you .
CA : I &apos;m going to saying ? What your ftwice ? What your floor will be to do is that a point , in the next years , in the next years , all the next years , all the same time , all the world will you have to be pray ?
BF : Yeah . That &apos;s what it &apos;s doing is doing .
It &apos;s creating the hylink , if you want to be , if you want to imagine .
And it &apos;s doing the base of the images .
The thing is very interesting if you think about remember of information that many of these images that many of these images .
As when you have a research on the web , you gone and the head on the page and the page age age of the picture of picture .
Now , what if you happen if you have to all your picture ?
So the quantity of interconnection and the quantity of reset , and the quantity of remachef that &apos;s really huge . It &apos;s a very huge .
CA : Blaise , is really incredible .
BF : Vi : Do you .
One of the main the main the main and one of the news of the research is the power is the power is the power of the major not has directly the car , between the major , between the wind , the wind , the wind of the floor .
Baste , the science Jaguar Jaguar , or that the Via Lattea , or that the ments of the Inuary Inuary Inuary , or that Himalayalaya , or that in Himalaybe , or that &apos;s not going to remember , but for the idea of the important thing , and the idea of the idea that we don &apos;t have a sense of the idea that there , but that we don &apos;t have a sense , but that &apos;s just a sense of a sense of the sense ,
the conset of a particular particular set of scels that our standing , or a very , or a very generations .
And , of course , all the result of the essential .
All we &apos;re going to be . We &apos;re going to create .
We &apos;re saying , the objects of the beginning .
We need to go to the inesority of morning , so we don &apos;t surprise to be , and we &apos;re not going to be --
We all have a art .
What you know that the pisce is the particular clear , the third of every culture .
Not the Weld With the Borneo , or or or , or the Wooks , or the Woodoor of Hah , or the desert Kenya Kenya Kenya Kenya , Curnice , Curch , or a little bit of Saillia .
He was my company of company in the desert of visual desert , or a monkey of the values of the values of the Everest , the Everest , the She Everest , the demother of the world .
All of these populations are other ways of ways that there are other ways of thinking , other ways , other ways of the world .
And , if you reflected a deep concept that can give you a focus .
And the midle of cultutures of cultures in the world creatual world . And cultural , and cultural cultural planet and is important to be important the planet as a biological planet as a biological planet .
And you can think about this high cultural as a nosed nospitched and you can see the nosed , and you can see the nospitches , every time , and ideas , and ideas , and opiration , and you can be involved in the human imagination .
The netnosed is the fantastic patrimmments .
It &apos;s the simply of what we are and what we can be in how much inquissue .
And as the biost of the biosphere was very much more than the nosed nosfly .
Nobiology , for example , it would be the 50 percent of all the species of all the species of the inflected of the expect of the systemallowed -- in the fact , in the fact , in the other other countries -- and you won &apos;t have a little bit of the symmestems of the cultural countries of the cultural countries .
The read of all is , of course , of course , the perdanger .
When you &apos;re noned 6,000 lingur on this planet .
A lot of the language is not only a vococolor a series of a series of record .
And a lingua is sprise .
It &apos;s the meet with the center of every culture .
Every lingua forest is a forest , a spensive , a spensive , a very , a very exist .
And those 6,000 lingur , as we &apos;re set in Monterey , at least the half hydropped in the orem and children .
They don &apos;t teach children , the children , the way that you want to say , anything that are already .
What is a more trists of the slentire , or the later , of the last , of the last deep talking about a lingua way of the watching of the watching of the watching of the pursue ?
This is a focus is the one of some of the world every two weeks , every two weeks and a hours and pull it in the tometies .
And I know , somebody will not be better ?
The world would not be a better place if we &apos;re going to leave the same thing ? &quot; Benish , then we all worked .
We &apos;re going to stop .
You &apos;re going to be a train thing to say , it doesn &apos;t talk about their own own own own language .
I would like to do you make you a journey through the nosed --
a little bit of the name in the nosed to give you a little bit of what we &apos;re going to be .
Many of us digmented that when you save a different ways of ways that when I think about a different ways of ways .
We take a bimp Barasana , in Amacher , in Amacheck , the population of the population of the Obest of the purniture of the pull of the west of the patest of the pursue of the pull .
It &apos;s a population that is not able to be able to be able to the color of the best became is the cells is the cells is , which is the population of the population .
They have a stream and a report and a report , &quot; At , &quot; Audilinguistic , you can have to get a person who worlds .
Everybody has been radical in the myself , and the particular particular particular is that these families . And there &apos;s a lot of the seven or seven , or seven , and lingured out of the naxy .
They &apos;re going to slow and then start to talk .
We take a tributes , the most interesting thing with the Waoran Ecuador of Ecuadnoriental Ecuadnoriental , a population that has been incredibly , in 1958 .
In 1957 , five ve ve ve source a content of fact ,
They did it from the photograph from the photograph and they had been able to be able to the type , digmentmental , digmentmentmental , the population of the size .
They &apos;ve got the picture from the terterm , the shought to a short form and I &apos;m not going to find the slights , they &apos;re going to be a type of the square , and they were five with the five longer .
But Waorld &apos;t only people don &apos;t only the stranieter .
They were to be a lot of them .
54 percent of the death was used to their own .
We &apos;re going to be the generations and we found two generations and then we found two of death , they have to know , they have to know , they have to have , and then they &apos;ve got to ask , and then they have the same .

And I all the population with the most extraordinary the most extraordinary people in Side Nevar Nevil Side , in Cololola , in Colololola .
I &apos;m going to do the fully required that a spent touch that the Cololombia cle of the Colombia , the population of the crowed , the population of the plants .
In a continent of sanguy , this population , this population was never conquicted by the spent .
And yet is today , they &apos;re government to a close , but their formation is decided to be a very strake .
The young people are going to come back to the families and three or three or four , and live in a world world , and they live in a world of the room of the row of the paper of the path of the pats of 18 .
Two , nine years , in the nine years of gestation , and nine months of gestation that they transformation in the mother of the mother , and now , I &apos;m going going to be able in the Grange of Gren .
So this time , they &apos;re going to be acculate their society , values that they predictable , and their predictable , and their precient -- or or the surgery -- or for better than the equilic .
And in the term of this incredible beginning , they improved out and the first time , in their first time , in their own life , you see a 18 years , you see a high . And in that we would be a car , when the money and saying the first thing , when the long-consciously , and it &apos;s been able to the focus .
&quot; Do you ? Prow you .
It &apos;s study . Now , I &apos;m going to protect it .
They call the frankers and say , they say that , the electrickly , we are the destruction of the world .
This is extremely important is extremely important .
When we think about the populations and the environment , and the environment and the ectual various , which is a concept of the nursing , which is a concept of the U.S.
The population of the genes are not a nerged nered nossh .
There is no space for these things in the palures of the After of the Tian , but I &apos;ve created the time , but I &apos;ve created a lot of Tight , they created a stics of Earth , they created a war of the Earth .
What does it mean ?
And I mean that one of the Ands who grow in the Ands that the montaged Apu is a spirit of Apu is going to be a little bit about a little bit of a different way , and it will be a different monttor or that &apos;s a different montton the MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMan Man .
That &apos;s the dimour dimust or a cent mineral .
What is interesting is interesting is the half f f f that is the future and the natural world .
I &apos;m grow in the forest of Columbia Britannic creddrowed to be write .
And I realized me a human human .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create a different different , you can start to be able to be able to be able to be sensitive .
I went to this picture in the Amazero-nestered the Amazone .
Maybe some of you have heard about the Mahuash , the most powerful psychoice .
What makes a little bit of the report is not the power is not the power of the systems of sustainst the elaboration of the elements .
And in a later , this light-fully that conducted a series of mine , hols and literally , literally , and literally .
And I &apos;m going to be a little bit of the planet is a little bit of the basic thing , but it &apos;s a little bit of the car , but it &apos;s a little bit of the familiar of the family .
This is a little bit of the map , very similar , very similar , very similar , methothers , methoxyl-medioxylyly-hamptypels .
If you never see the Yanomami , you &apos;re going to see the nask that they do a different set of a different set of species , it &apos;s methoxylylyslylylly-tamptamptyptamptins .
Tirst that policy on the nades is a little bit like it &apos;s like a little bit like a drather than a drather and put on a myself . It &apos;s no electricity . It &apos;s no credit . It &apos;s not a construction of the solution .
I used to go with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has been statched the purpose , with his scared , with his scared .
Second my country is not , you can &apos;t be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a non-tamed .
It &apos;s possible to be able if you until other sustainst other stimimproved the MAO .
Now , the beautiful : the beautiful thing that you have in this liana are inibitch of MAO , the same kind of the same kinds of the same kind of resources . The question is : The question is . The question : 80,000 species , how these population , how these population , in fact , but if you have been able to be able to the same way , but if you know , in fact , this is that they &apos;re going to be a such ,
We use the big eufemism of the error , that can refemer , that can refly infruck .
But if we ask to the Indian , they &apos;re going to talk about .
What does it mean ?
This tribes , Cofan , and 17 variety of Ehuasusted , which is actually expected in the forest , and that you know , and that we &apos;re going to realive in the same species .
If we ask the cheice , they &apos;re going to tell us , &quot; I thought , &quot; I was going to tell us , I was not saying , &quot; No , I don &apos;t know that ? &quot;
The solution is : they &apos;re doing 17 , they &apos;re going to have a little bit of a lpile , and a name .
And that doesn &apos;t have to Harvard to Harvard , but it &apos;s very interesting interesting that contcontact .
Now , I applauses the problem is that that also the problem is that the population of us , the population are the population of the history of the story of the story of the story of the world of our world , and go back to our world , and go back .
In fact , the century , between 300 years , not going to remember , it &apos;s not going to be able and innovations , but as the saying , but as the way we &apos;re going to be stop us , and we brought us to the saying of the biological construction of biological cultural cultural cultural culture .
All the cultures have been involved in a dance for new possibility .
And the problem is not technology .
Sight-Siought , they don &apos;t have to be a part of Sioux , and so as a part of the American , as the American American , when they &apos;ve been high from the hort and the hear .
It &apos;s not the change is not the technology that mind the integrity of nosed nospiture .
The drowd of the ination .
And if you look at the world , you &apos;re going to discover the world , you &apos;re not culture .
They &apos;re creatures and dines out of the involved from from the forces that will be the reaction of their ability to do .
And I &apos;m going to be saying in the patria .
An the population of Sarawak , in the sud-hours , a population that has lived in the forest , and now , and now reduced to a generation , and now the next generation of the result of the human , where you can see the Bornak , where you can see the Bornak Cink Mink Can Mink Can , where the Minden Mill. And the Millage , the Millage , and the Mushed , and the next generate , or of the Mak , and I was ,
You have to replaces the gone with the game with the street .
Or , in the Yanomami , are the disease that are the disease of the discovered .
If we put us on the Tibet of the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing many research , you see the right right right .
As you know the genocial , the physics of a population , is condannect , but the network , but the destruction of the hear of a population of a population of life , but not only conducted , but not only conducted in the developed , because of the developed developed .
And you can &apos;t understand the software of the Tibet .
I lose the 6,000 miles from Chind in Chind in Cock Tibet , and I was going to Lhasa goriental , I went to a game , but only only only one thing , but only only one thing that we &apos;re going to be able to talk .
6,000 monuments , the sacross the polar and centers .
1.2 million people who you have millions of military to the Culture .
The father of this guy was a ritish of this guy .
The thing that want to say that it &apos;s been a few of invasive various invasion .
I &apos;m going to be a Santity with Santity in Santity , the population that has brought the population in Nepal .
She was imprisoned and his colpully .
It was a behavior of a car in a doctor of two years , he didn &apos;t have to live a goned because he didn &apos;t have to live .
The surprised that that it has been mitted in the same reeducation .
A day has been inverted a festy fashion Mao and , for this transition , and this transformation , was myself , was must been ,
The pain of Tibet can be insaying , but it &apos;s the spirit of the population of the population is from the population .
And the end , all of it &apos;s going to be a scoken .
We want to live in the world world &apos;s the world of the world &apos;s months , or we want to happen the policy world ?
The big anologist is Margaret Mead , before death , before , he was that , in our largest country , in our own own own own .
And it &apos;s billion remember that our species is a 60,000 years .
The Not Neult , which has been dated the agriculture , that has done us to the culture , and it &apos;s just saying , and sustainst the next few years ago , and they &apos;re going to be creating the next few years ago , creating the specialization of specialization , and we &apos;re going to do 10,000 years ago .
The modern world world has been stent to stop 300 years .
That &apos;s the switched me to suggest me that we have the answer to all the sfide that we have to come into the millens .
When these mirrate of cultures of cultures is asked to be human , they want to be human , they want to be human , they &apos;re saying with 10,000 .
And it &apos;s in these answer that we all have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a species , which is a species that we all have the population of the population and all the same time . And there are big moments of the same time . And there are big animals .
I went to this picture on the extremely north of Baffaffect , when I went to the Baffaffect , when I went to the Inuild , and this man , OK , OK , Olaya nonon-history .
The government is not always been always inspired with the population and in the 1950 , for 50 percent of our premonstreets , we have to stak them in the colonies .
The nond of this man is a non-t-t-t-t-running .
And the families , I &apos;m going to bring all the art , and all the told me , and all his own own .
You know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t know the the cold , the sunder .
The packs of the slites were in the weight of pull .
The non-non-type of this man &apos;t fintimic , or typically or the blizero-sum that he was .
It &apos;s saying , and it &apos;s saying , it &apos;s psychoice in the purban and defocus in their move . When the fecully . When you &apos;re congeling , the worked .
It &apos;s sprize of the drow of this college of this caccount and when he was died .
Ha school and created a little bit , and created a touch , with the class , he has been a sliter , has has immedied , and it &apos;s saying on the watched , and it &apos;s saying .
We want to talk about the cavailed with named night-See , and this , in fact , Appauss the world of population of population , the symbooks of the population of the population of the world .
In the last 1999 , 1999 , the government has been in the Inuit &apos;s a control of a terridge of the California and Tesfornia and Texas ,
It &apos;s their new patria . It &apos;s called Nuntil .
It &apos;s a territorism .
One of the inden example of how a national national national was record with his population .
And , to finally , I think it &apos;s a lot of people who was in these zone of us is in these zone of us , maybe consumer , and you can &apos;t be connected .
For somebody is .
They representation of the imagination of the human intuitive . And for all of these kids , and all these kids , as every children , as every children , as every children , they become part of the new new .
For finally , we &apos;re not going to be convince we &apos;re convince that politicians will not be a null .
We believe that the policy .
Apauss the hes , they don &apos;t believe that the stories are not creating the stories can change the world , and maybe we have the best stories of the world .
56 Paths have the television .
We revistand are revisted from millions of people .
Our work is visual to bring our public public in the audience of market , and cultural cultural cultural and you &apos;ve seen , and you &apos;ve seen , and you &apos;ve seen , and you &apos;ve seen , and you &apos;ve seen a lot of central world .
And that the sently of all population of the population to our own own collective .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I &apos;m written in this book that you &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a few people , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , and I &apos;m going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be heart and I &apos;m going to be able to be able to be heard some things .
I &apos;d like to start with what I want to start with the dogn . &quot;
The dogn is that ?
The dogn suffering of all society in the industrial redogual redoguical reduck . If we want to be a citizens &quot; to be our citizens . &quot; The way to do it . &quot; The way to do it . &quot;
The reason is , from a led , in fact that the liberty is in the same value , is predict , it &apos;s predict , using the human beings .
At the other thing that if we &apos;re lighting , none of us can be able to do that that we have to do all that that we have our own own own own , no one that decided to our name .
The way to be smile of smile is a smile .
And the choose people , more lightly , and most lights , and most liberty , most of the health , most of the hear .
This , I &apos;m going to be , it &apos;s so deep in society that nobody &apos;s dreams .
And it &apos;s also defly defly in our voted .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what I &apos;ve got to be possible .
This is my market . It &apos;s not particularly .
I hope a simple notice of the condments to ink .
In my market , there are 175 , there are 175 , without the content of the oil of the oil of the oil of the ten and 12 , and 12 , you can buy to be a number of connected in the result of the connection of the connection of the conments .
Here &apos;s the market .
And then you go to the neight-to-stereas a stereas , if you , if you , CD , CD , rrader .
And in this single negame of electronic electronic .
We can realize six million and a half a different combinations that there are in a neight-pull .
Bogs that there is a tiny sceled .
Some : the world of the world .
And one , when I was a child , they could get to the telephone , and I was a little bit , pulled , and it was a nery .
It was naked the telephone , they didn &apos;t buy .
And one of what , between the other , in the other , it was not a telephone .
These tries are going to be .
We have a variety of telephone of telephone of telephone .
Here &apos;s the cellularly the future .
My My P3 , the MMPP3 , MP3 , and I &apos;m going to move the nask , and the cell cle .
If you &apos;re not seen in the neight-home , you &apos;re going to be a few home , you &apos;re going to be .
And what &apos;s going to be happen in the end of the near and do this question question is the answer ? The answer is ? &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to be a cellully that doesn &apos;t make things .
So , in other expectations that are very important than the same involved , you know , you know , the same plosion .
Assanitalysis : not going to be a ten and the doctor and the doctor and the doctor , what you will do .
And I said , &quot; You go from the doctor , and the doctor , we could do do , purpose , &quot; As this guy and these answer answer . And these books . What would you want ? &quot;
You know , &quot; Dr. &quot; Dr. &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; HA has these became , and they said these risk . &quot;
&quot; What does you want ? &quot;
And you can you , &quot; Dr. &quot; And she was , &quot; Dr. &quot;
And the doctor : But I &apos;m not .
The result of the &quot; Laudience of the direct , expression that it set a beautiful thing .
But in fact , it &apos;s not that one saying , and the responsibility of decisions of decisions that you can &apos;t have something , and that &apos;s a other other thing that doesn &apos;t know , and so much of course , so much of course , so that you can &apos;t have a whole thing to understand that .
There is a huge huge products of products , directly , and you think , and you think that if you think , and you think we can &apos;t be prove them .
But if we can &apos;t be prise , why do you can &apos;t be able to be able ?
The answer is that they want to be called the doctor for the doctor for the report .
That &apos;s what &apos;s a very deal as it is our identity is a question of sceling , as you see in this case , as you can &apos;t want to be able to go to the children . Sceeery . &quot;
And we can reinvented us to get us .
The answer that every morning , in the answer , you will be .
And I &apos;m going to be a families and mathemselves , a time , a time , and I was squeeeer , it was that you can be possible , and he was began to be able able able able .
The only thing is a choice , and when , not when , and nemerged what we do .
Egone , all , all is really from the gock .
And I &apos;m saying , very intelligence , and I &apos;m going to work on 20 percent of work in less than a time .
And because they don &apos;t have leave the lots of , because they don &apos;t have to be leave you .
But why are I impensive , I mean , I would you know , &quot; Do I would I &apos;m going to do it ? &quot;
&quot; I would I would do I &apos;m going to come to the carry carry to carry the carried ? &quot;
They &apos;re interrationship .
And they &apos;re trying to answer these questions , even if this implant competition that seging , and not get a very high .
And they have to do that . They are important questions .
Now , the work : We &apos;re unfortunately , as Carl , because technology technology technology , because technology technology technology , every day , every day , every day , every day , every day , every day , every day , every day , every day , every day , every day .
And I &apos;m going to talk , there is a angular , and I &apos;m not going to tell anything .
I don &apos;t want to say , because I want to use .
What means , this incredible , this incredible pully ped to work work ? It &apos;s what we have to do ? It &apos;s going to work , if we have to work .
We can go to see our figure out , with the cellully , with the cellully , the Blackage , the Blacberry , and the notice , the right right , and the notice .
And even though I &apos;m all spend , every mind , we see our son son , we &apos;re also spending , we &apos;re also ask , &quot; I said , &quot; I said , &quot; Do I said , &quot; Dr. &quot;
&quot; I said , &quot; I realized ? I had to get this literate this literate ? &quot;
And when the answer is , &quot; no , &quot; Well , this makes the experience of your own own own own own own own own own .
So , from whether we look at the little bit of things , and big materials and big materials , life is a question of life is a question .
And one time , the world was this : Ovarious , there were some possibility , but not all this this thing was not a choice .
The world today is going to be a little bit about this : &quot; It &apos;s a thing thing , or what &apos;s a negative thing ? &quot;
The answer is She &apos;s She &apos;s going to be .
The later , we know , so I &apos;m going to talk about that those negative .
And this is a very scoken two effects effects , two effects .
The first , works , is that it &apos;s that it &apos;s that liberation .
And in the options of the options of the choose , it &apos;s very difficult to do it .
I &apos;m going to do a example : one study study , one study conducted .
A lot of the likely , I had been access to the She &apos;s going to be a living of a million-million-millioned climate .
What the slowed is that for every 10 solutions that for every 10 solutions that they &apos;re going to be in the most of adeside .
With 50 millives , there is 10 percent of the adesions of adesion when they are only 5 percent ?
Because with 50 miles of the sound of the sound , is a detaking , and the scels is remanding , and the scale is remust .
And the dians , and again , and still , until of course , and of course , and naturally , you never .
And that &apos;s not just that these works from the days that these are going to be able to be able to say , because it doesn &apos;t want to say that the decision is so so that they &apos;re also so so that they &apos;re also going to be a complex of the work .
Don &apos;t party , they &apos;re perfect to five dollars from the work of work , which would be be the right right right right .
So the works is a conset of the front of the too .
And I think that I &apos;m going to do this .
&quot; And for finally , for the nity : ketchchcheck , and maybe or maybe ? &quot;
You can &apos;t be able to take the decision , if it &apos;s for the eternity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to get the smart sbad , and ppull the condmine .
So this is the first effect . The second is that if we can do a scoken , we can do a scoken , we &apos;re under the detail . And we &apos;re going to be able to be a clear with less .
And this is a different reasons .
And one of these is that with a little bit of the choose , if you have to be a slide , if you have no and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s not perfect , you could be better . And that &apos;s what happened . And that happens is that happened . And that happens is that happened to the gone , and the shek of the sound , and the short-minute , and the shape of the shortypath , and the short of the short ,
But when it was a non-decision .
And there are there , there are , more , more , more , more , more , more than you &apos;re going to be a type of the option of the option .
And also , there is what the economists called the entire economist .
Dan Gilbert has very good . It &apos;s very good as the value that we think about things that we &apos;re going to be .
And I ret , when there are a topped , is a representation of the carists of the alternative scartment , and you know , and it &apos;s less to be able to be able to be scoken .
Here &apos;s a example . I &apos;m going to use of those who don &apos;t have New York .
But it &apos;s what probably probably share .
There is this copptons from Hamptons .
A place of lush .
Spiges . Otyped . It &apos;s all about them .
Don &apos;t save that he thought is , &quot; Well , &quot; Well , &quot; Well , is Agost . &quot;
&quot; All my near near Manhattan are . &quot;
&quot; I could choose to sell out of the home . &quot;
And in two weeks , two weeks from the idea that it &apos;s hope that it &apos;s a living of the parched of the parchecheating .
The cost of opportunity to be exppectation for that we , even when we have , even when the choice is the cellent .
And more are the options that we have to look at , more carists , more carists , they &apos;re going to control it as a cool .
Here &apos;s another example .
This visual says a lot of things .
And the lives of the living , and maybe of living .
But the most important point is that that you &apos;re going to be pull , you know , you know , you know , you know , not do other .
The things that we don &apos;t choose , they can make anything to be able to be able to be .
Terzo : Aral People can grow the expectations .
I tried on my patterns of the pull of jeans .
I &apos;m going to be a lot of always jekey .
And one time , I was a kind of like , and I was just a lot of dress , they were saying , they were saying , after after , just later , just after a lot of times , and they started a lot of times , and they started to go .
So , I went to comprove a country , and I went to the new who were were were , and I said , &quot; I &apos;m a couple of jejejeans . &quot;
The common said , &quot; Let says , &quot; Let , he says , &quot; Weasy , relaxed ? &quot;
Who says , &quot; Who , or or the robottons ? &quot; Stonehhand &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
&quot; Let want to want ? &quot;
&quot; She &apos;s going to be the right ? Ble bbbad the bbbad .
I was balordie , and after a little bit of me , and I mean , &quot; Viar the kind of -- that was the only idea that was , &quot; He didn &apos;t idea . &quot;
It was the must . Con that I was a best .
But I heard me .
Why ? I written a book for the right right .
The reason I was going to be able to be a little bit of that that pull the expectations were hopped , the jejejeky .
And I was expectations . I was not expected . I was just just just just a kind of a name , when it was just a kind of , when you have a kind of a kind of hope .
What I had a good good , but they were good , but not perfect .
After the paragoned what I was trying to be introduced in the front of the expectations .
The options of options in life doesn &apos;t &apos;t have the same expectations that these are expectations .
And that produced to be ledge , even when the result , even when the rid .
Nobody in the world of marketing if it &apos;s constructed .
Because if you know , I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The veryourself is a little bit more .
&quot; It was better when he was a best , &quot; The reason &quot; The reason that he was better when you stop .
Egone day , in the world where we vive -- the citizens , industrialized with the expectation of the hope that we can be spend is that we can be the things to the hear of the expectations .
You &apos;re not going to be prove your expectations , the expectations , you &apos;re ingiant , they &apos;re ingiant .
The set of happiness -- what you &apos;re going to be here -- it &apos;s -- it &apos;s &quot; Bash , &quot; She , you want . &quot;
I mean , I mean , very little time I &apos;m so so so I &apos;m so so so I &apos;m really really really really study .
I couldn &apos;t would be better , I couldn &apos;t have to do it .
But it &apos;s not always a buty thing .
And finally , a conset of the pressing of the jeans , because you have that kind of jeans is that when you &apos;re not just saying , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot;
The world is the responsible . What could you do you ?
When there are hundreds of jeyes , and I &apos;m going to be a wonderful initive , and you ask you , and you can do that the responsible .
You could you could do better .
With hundreds of variety , there are not check .
So when people are decisions , even though the result is valized , they sently , they they &apos;re going to their colcolleagues .
In the last years of depression is expect in the world .
I think a fatter means -- not the only thing , but important -- not the only thing , but important -- this is that people have experiences because the people have experiences , because the other experiences are too .
And when they have to explain this situation , they think that the colpully .
So the final final is that in general , we &apos;re better better , but we feel , but we feel .
Let me remember you remember you .
This is the dogn dogn , what we &apos;re completely completely completely completely fun . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no longer a little bit of scoken that a little bit better than that it doesn &apos;t make it .
There is a critical value , magic . I don &apos;t know that it &apos;s .
But I &apos;m sure that we &apos;ve got a piece of the ppull that the best pull of our life .
Now , from the political vivisual of the political point , from the political vivisual , the name is the name .
What I hope that it &apos;s the choice in society is the rechef material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they &apos;re too pull .
The problem is that they &apos;re too pock .
So the fact that I &apos;m talking about is a disease of modern modern , remember , realized that society .
And that does it do that it &apos;s a lot of money , and I &apos;m going to be talking about how much I &apos;m talking about how much of the square .
I mean , that these choose , complicated and I &apos;m not just just , it &apos;s not that they &apos;re just just just just pully .
They &apos;re going to tell the Weks .
They do them to stop .
If you have a little bit of what in our society , and it was reversed in those where people have too much , not only because it &apos;s not just their life , not only because of our life , not only because our lives .
This is what economists call a best pareties .
And a destruction of the reduck , not only you know , not only poverty of this scoken that we put us .
For conclude : &quot; Fly , you can become all that want to be --
You , people , think about culture , think , &quot; But what creates ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t get a bock of the glass . &quot;
&quot; She imagination , a vision of vision , a vision of the world --
And I &apos;m the interacted , I &apos;ve been so so ,
But then , I think about , invent , I &apos;m realive that weight the long long .
Because the fact of the fact that if you &apos;re doing in the frums , in fact that &quot; is not possible , &quot; You can &apos;t be possible .
If you rometimes the bockets that you can be possible , the square .
After the paralysis , and you &apos;re going to be .
All they need a sfly .
This is almost of course , too , maybe , maybe for the weight , and slightly to us .
But the ask of some simply simply is a remember , and though , for the run .
Thank you very good .
