I &apos;ve shown these slidemonstrate to demonstrate that the calculus to show that the calculus of the 48 dimensions of the United States had the size of 48 percent .
But this is , that you can see the gravity of the problem because it &apos;s not showing the ice of the ice .
The arctic glacial is , in a sense , the heart heart heart of the global climate system .
You &apos;re going to be expanded and return .
The next next slide is going to be a remarkable reen to the last 25 years .
The ice loss are signed in red .
You can see , you know , they &apos;re going to blue .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter , which is the glasses .
You can see that the ice cosid--year-old , or more , it &apos;s as the blood , it &apos;s like the blood , which is where you have to get out of the body .
In 25 years , it was slippping .
This is a problem because the interested in the interests , the landscape around the ocean arctic amount of conglasses that , science that , science that , science that , are transformed in the sea .
I &apos;m going to be a totality of the atmospheric inquitoes , that quantity could rads , surrounded , supersupersuper-hythrow .
In some laghi shares in Alaska , the methane is already re-bed from the water .
The professority Katey Walter of the University of Alaska is , with a team in a team , and a team best lay lay later .
Video : Wow Gore : You know . She &apos;s good .
A reason is that this termal termal scale the Greenland from the northermal .
This is a regime to the glacial .
The carported was never reached free .
This is the Kangerlush , in southwest of Greenland .
If you want to know how the level of the sea of sea chapter to the watch of the ice of the sea .
These running are increasingly .
At the other part of the planet : Antarctars , the greatest block of the planet .
The month the scientists have died that the ice ice is in negative , and the Antarctica , and that the Antarctica , which is particularly on some issole , which is particularly realized in the short .
Equive six feet of the watching , like Greenland .
Sull Himalaya , the third greatest block , you know , they &apos;re seeing new laghi , which a few years ago , who was gone .
40 percent of the world population is going to be able able water from the powerful water from that shake .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the water power of this city .
The carcartoon is increasingly .
But when you dimind , the same accept water .
In California , the snow on the Sierra is diminus of 40 percent .
The backy-hydropped .
The predictions , as you have read , are favorable .
The growing growing safety in the world &apos;s door to a remarkable .
The environmental disasters are increasingly increasingly outside and without precedent .
Four times more numerous in the last 30 years , I realized for 75 .
This is a whole thing that is sustainable .
If you look at the historic context if you can see the consequences .
For the last five years , we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day .
Look at the area of the area of the Pacific , from American , and on both the American , and on both parts of the Indian injection of the Indian inherent impoverments .
Most of global warming , together to the global deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of the fossil of fossil .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with more emissions , together at China .
And it was proposed to build a lot of other central central .
But we &apos;re assisting in a direction of direction .
These are the projects in the last years and some of the other years and some of alternative alternative .
At every way , there &apos;s a lotta politics in our country .
The carbon industries and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon , which is a host , which is a host .
That image I remember something --
Verery Natal , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion lbodies of paper .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen it on the news .
This is the second biggest flow of scories in America .
It &apos;s happened to Natal .
The nature of one of the industries of one of the carbon was this .
Video : My the carbon is a kind of alleo and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it &apos;s growing our economy .
Frosealty the carbon is increasingly .
It &apos;s good precenters , adorable and the work are holding .
Al Gore : For here is a big part of the West Virginia .
The largest society on the mountain is Massey Coal . This is his amministr&apos;t have a little bit of administr&apos;t .
Video : Don Blankenship -- I &apos;m going to be asked -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosis , Harry Reid -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Protection of Clima has two campaign .
This is one of them , one .
Video : Ator : At COALergy see the climate change as a serious minute of our business .
So our priority is invest a great amount of money in a great amount of money in a public stream and confuses the truth .
In fact , the carbon is not spores .
We think it &apos;s clean -- it &apos;s also a good profuman .
So you don &apos;t preocattached climate change .
Let me do .
Video : Ator : Carbone -- you &apos;ve heard of it .
So let &apos;s do a job in a structure at a clear .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little human rumor , but this is the sound of the paper of the paper .
The carbon of carbon is between the major cause global warming , but the night technology of the paper is that you see all change .
Date a look at this : this is the odirect technology .
At Gore : Inally , the positive positive to the economic issue and at the national security and at that security of the national security .
Video : Let &apos;s move in the national economy ; the national security , niture crisis .
The phils that the colleages : our dependence from the combustible , like the health and oil .
Now , perhaps there is a new , audace solution for using circle .
Really America : 100 percent of energy , in 10 years .
A plan to repect America to make more sure , and to help us to stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that &apos;s solution to solve our problems .
Really America . You &apos;re reading more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : I feel about energy .
One of the fastest ways of bring up to the dependence from the combustible that kill our planet .
Comparsa : The future is here . I feel , sole , a new energy .
Two : Noves investments for places of work in retributing .
I feel : After America . It &apos;s time to be realistic .
At Gore : A old old old proverwhelming is , &quot; If you want to go fast , you go .
If you want to go back , you go together . &quot;
We must go away , we have to go away ,
Thank you very much .
The year at TED I did a TED . I did an introduce .
And I promise to get back to the car .
So here . And so I realized , the LHC is , the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment , ever tented -- 27 kilometers of circle .
His compit is to required the conditions that were present less than a billion second from the beginning of the universe -- 600 million times a second .
All that &apos;s just environment .
This is the machine under Ginevening .
We are going to find these mini-Bang Bang inside the respect .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- it &apos;s 44 feet and it has a 222 feet .
This is a spectacular images of ATLAS in built so you can see the proportions .
Ten the 10 section of the last year we have accested the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was because of immense of the festegments in control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first particle phasm that had done all around the LHC , walking in collision , with a part of the LHC , and diffon-set particles in the resiberately , and particles in the respursue .
In other words , when we see that image 10 secember , we know that the machine worked , and we could have the car vitter .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to make us exultar more opened , when somebody went on Google and videal that the page was this .
That means we &apos;ve had a cultural impact on the scientific impact .
And it &apos;s a week later , there was a problem with the car , and it had to these films here -- these dored .
These films are going to make 13,000 ampounds when the car works at the the maker works at the the machine works at the the machine works at the machine works to the makes the makes it work at the makes it work in the machine works at the machine works at the machine works at the makes it 13,000 ampers , and they &apos;re going to make the machine work work work at the top of the power works in the machine .
Now , the technical technical is . They &apos;re not true . I &apos;m not true . I &apos;m too much too much . &quot;
And instead can do it because when they &apos;re very cold to become the cost phils .
So at least 271 degrees , at a perature at the space of the space between the stars , these phils can bring that race .
In one of the youngest youngest novemila in LHC , there was a fabric difect of fabric .
So the phils sat least , and the 13,000 ampers , and the 13,000 ampursue of electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magnetiles fishing more than 20 tons .
They are damage about 50 magnegggets .
We had to touch them , what we did .
We returned them and traveled .
Now they &apos;re going to go back to their place submit .
By the end of marzo the LHC is is going to be new integrate .
We &apos;re going to happen , and we &apos;re waiting data to get right or light , and continue our adventure to discover what we &apos;re going to be able able to discover what the morning .
Now , of course , in a way of these , the accidents return out the dibate on the value of science and engineering in frontier .
I think that the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that we go beyond the value of things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of a Inglese scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , I &apos;m going to be able to be able in the difesa cylle of his ppiler , his bleael , he said , &quot; Not is so dangerous for the progress of the human mind that the ideas of science as of human mind that the ideas of science that the ideas of science that the ideas of our own . &quot; And that are not going to be able to be typelling . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start to ask the rethink of when children , as children , please play .
As you know how to get them and get them , and they &apos;re going to get them and muoverwhelming them and to be able and solve problems and solve problems .
The reasoning reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand the most of the world around us .
So , by the information from the usual usuity of our interaction with physics , together at my consult , and in my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asked me , &quot; And if we use a computer , when we use a computer , we could have the only wator of the digital poller that you can digital , we could have a desktop with the information , we could have a desktop with the hands ,
and systems to our plowers ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , and built the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a whole big computer interactive , like a biscale .
In a few words , a Siftable is a whole big computer interactive , like a biscale .
You can die with them , they can be moving with them , they can see , &quot; between them , feel their movement and they have a radio and a radio and a radio .
But above , they &apos;re physical objects , like the morning , you can move it just fashion .
The Siftable is example of a new ecosystems of a new ecosystems to manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physical , consciousness of the movement , and as they become more physical , and as they become more physical , of other , as we can explore new and different signs of interaction .
I &apos;m going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show video : if you incline in a direction , video will rotery that , if you incline from the other hand back .
These replaces are consciousness of other .
If you &apos;re at the same time , they &apos;re interested in .
If they come circle , they see it and they can act a little bit .
If they come circle , they see it and they can act a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power to use communicate gests on data , &quot; one of the liquid , &quot; a color like a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable , as a century of the versor in the central center in that central , where they missed .
And I can use them to true the color in the central , where they missing .
We can be too much , we can reply a place .
You also are beautiful possibility of learning , like the languages , mathematics and jewels of logic where people can try to try to try and see the results of the results of the results .
I &apos;m going to do --
This is a sequence of Fibonacross I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a game of words that is half between Scarabeum and Boble .
Pratically , you know , you get a letter in a letter in case on every Siftable , in every watch turn , in every winter required a letter to be on every Siftable on , and while certain words .
And then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new letters of letters and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s what the children came to the Media Lab , I did in a way that I tried them and I turned out a video .
They &apos;re very living fted .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people many education .
You just say , &quot; Let &apos;s combine , and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s what other people who try it .
This is our younger younger , there on the right .
It actually wanted to implement them .
They were only morning .
Now , this is an interactive application of a interactive carton .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of languages , Lui is Felix .
It can be able to put new characters in the scene , solve the Siftable .
It can be able to put new characters in the scene , solve the Siftable .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : Sunsorry .
David Merrill : Now he took a treator in the scene .
Video : The arange tree .
So , you know , you know , you know .
So schooling Siftable and put them neighbor can interact the character --
Video : Bau !
And by inventing their story .
Video : I &apos;m going to be .
DM : It &apos;s a story with final open-final story , and it can decide it as you get .
DM : It &apos;s a story with final open-final story , and it can decide it as you get .
Video : Voly , gat .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a time to show you is a tool , to watch and exequiet music .
It &apos;s a tool , realized by recently , to walk and exequish music .
The Siftable here are agissues like base , based and battery .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose to be .
You can also start to put sound in a sequence of comport to your piacement .
And it &apos;s just to do it by doing a sound , &quot; and a sequence . &quot;
These are actually that you can control from the vive , like the reverse and the filter .
And it &apos;s a particular sound and then incloses to the way .
And then there are the general effects like time and volume , that they are applicate to internal sequence .
Let &apos;s look at how .
Video : We &apos;re going to start in two , we &apos;re going to start in two Siftable , we can systems in a series , we add the extensive , we add the other base .
I &apos;m going to put a basis line .
Video : I add the percussions --
Video : And I &apos;m going to put the bacteria , so I can control the effect from the view .
Video : DM : I can speak the whole sequence from one side or the other side .
Video : And I &apos;m going to add the philer to the base for the best to date more expression .
Video : I can realize the sequence . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to plane it before , but I can try to make it more longer or the more coral or the coral .
And now , finally , I can smoke the whole sequence in the left Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is built new man &apos;s building new man and more more more more than the brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this percoral , and some possibilities that we try to take out of the lab .
The concept that I want to transmit is that we &apos;re going to get this new generation of projects to interact with digital media , that will will will port information in our world that we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time to talk to all of you .
I &apos;m a writer .
Books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the fashion of my life .
And I don &apos;t expect that it can change .
But , said , this , something that &apos;s happened in my life and in my career , and in my career , who took me to realibing the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called Mangia , Prua , Prua , which , different from my precedented books , for some reason , for some reason , for some reason , and it become a great , huthler , besthesize , besideas .
And the result is that everywhere where the wall , people treat me as if they were condannect .
Davigh -- condanned , condanned !
They &apos;re going to be worried and they &apos;re going to be saying , &quot; You don &apos;t fear a little bit more ?
You don &apos;t have to keep going to writing for all life without able able to create a book that can important to somebody ? &quot;
What can you important to somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s rassurant , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a cool cool -- I wanted to be a critical .
I was met at the same based by the pure .
And people said , &quot; I don &apos;t do you can &apos;t get successful ?
You don &apos;t have the humiliation of the refuse of ?
You have no watching the whole life without any living in all life without any lifetime and die on a cumulo of dreams with the bought ble-free falloor of lovers ?
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yeah , I have a couple of all those things .
I &apos;ve had always been pure .
And I also have many other things that people could not involve .
As the algaxis and other things .
But , as I was about to write what I thought and I was asked and I ask , and I ask it &apos;s because ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logic that anything has been walked out of a job that you feel high to do .
But what is there is to be in the pressed to make us nervous about the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind is that other career do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don &apos;t remember one time in its 40 years of activity where he was asked if you pay in the wonderful ?
There was never -- that block of the engineer John , how it goes ?
Don &apos;t it worked , you know ?
Onestly , chemical engineers like group are not certain , in the centuries , in the centuries , you have to be alcolized .
We were writers , we have enough this reputation , and not only writers , but creative of all genes , we have this reputation of being enormously instasible .
And it &apos;s not going to be able to look at the contain of the death of the magnificent people who are only in the 20th century , they die young people die and often for hand .
And the ones that are not suicidated to be suicidated by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before we die , in the last interview said , &quot; Every book killed me a little more . &quot; A extraordinary extraordinary affermation about the work of their life .
But we don &apos;t bad at the child when we heard these things so we &apos;ve heard these things that we &apos;ve been completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and the suffering and the art , and that the art , at the end .
And the question I want to take all of the time is : are you agree with this idea ?
You know , that &apos;s good for me , because it looks at a distance of a distance of the none of the distance of this suppose .
I think it &apos;s odiosa .
And I think it &apos;s periculous and I don &apos;t want to see the perpetuate in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our big makes ,
And I know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start figing to that hear host of the host host of the surroundary of circumstances in which I &apos;m in my career .
Oually -- you look , I &apos;m pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I have about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything I &apos;m going to writing in the work that I &apos;m going to be judle from the world as the work that I &apos;ve been given by my last book .
I &apos;m going to be hard , because we &apos;re all the most friends here -- is likely that my greatest success is to my high high .
Oh , Gesus , which I think !
You know , this is the gender of thinking that that leads to start to be a person starting to start to the nine morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would like to keep doing this work we love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it seems to me , after many reflection , which the way to keep write is to create a protective psychological construct , oken ?
I have a few way to find a distance of safety between me , that I &apos;m writing , and my natural natural anximum on what reaction can get . And as I was trying to do it , as I was trying to do this , I started looking through the time , trying to find other societies to see if they could have better ideas and more more and more and more and more and more and more sane .
about how to help people create the inerent inrisks of the emotions of creativity .
And that research me to the ancient Grex and ancient Roma .
Let me go back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity was from men , OK ?
It was thinking that creativity was about divine , and they were about divine and that people come from a few distant and unknown , for distant reasons and healthy and healthy .
The greatest called these beyond the beritual divines of creativity .
Sowever , wonderly , he created a demon that we had a demon that wisdom .
The Romans were the same idea , but they call that kind of spirit without a genius .
which is great , because Romans , Romans didn &apos;t really think that a genius was someone .
They have to have a genius of this entity divine that has been created literally lived in the walls of a artist , a little bit like the Dobby , and that came out of the work of the work of the work of the work of the artist and model out of the work of the artist and model the work of the work .
Here &apos;s ey--- that &apos;s the distance of which I talk about -- that is the distance of the psychological construct that you protect from your work .
And they all knew that was that it worked , right ?
So , the anticient artists were protected by certain things , like for example , not ?
If your work was etc , you could not take it all you could take it all , and all know that you could help the market , everybody knew that helped by this genius .
If your work work , it was not all all colpocket , it was it ?
All they knew that was your genius to be a inable .
And so people , they concept the creativity in the West for a long time .
And then the Rind came and all changed , and all changed , and we put this great idea of the universe of the universe surface of all of the and the mistery and without more space to leaving creatures that they write from divinity .
This was the principle of human human maintain and people started to think that creativity was completely from ishared .
And for the first time in history , you started to reference this or the artist as a genius , rather than a person with genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big herror .
I think that it allowed someone , a simple person to believe that of being like a deep source , the essence and the surprising and the surprising and the sisters , creative and the sistences and the responsibility to be a great philty to the best wonderful philty , and you know , a great responsibility to the human beings .
It &apos;s like to ask somebody to get the sun .
Deform and completely the ego and creates all these engaging expectations on performance .
And I think it was this pression to destroy the artists in the past 500 years .
And , if that &apos;s true , and I think that is , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe to get back to a understanding more than the relationship of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship between human relationship and means .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t sing 500 years of rational thinking about a rational pursue of 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience that we had a solleverage scientific scientific , and you know that they follow people follow the things that following people are seeing success or their projects .
I &apos;m not going to convince you all about this .
But the question I would like to ask is -- why not ?
Why don &apos;t you think about this way ?
Because it &apos;s more sense of all other thing that has ever heard to explain the exasperant exasperant predicbility of the process of creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever ever ever ever been excited to do something -- so , you know , you know , you don &apos;t have a rationally .
And , in fact , it can be completely paranormal .
I did this met recently met with the extraordinary poetched by Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but it was a poetic for all life and said that durher childhood in the Virginia , and he was feel it , in the wish Virginia , and he was feel it , in if a powered the landscape .
He said that it was like a fragorous slate .
And that was coming toward to her from the landscape .
And he was going to be able to be , because he was tremendous under his feet .
He knew to have one thing to do with that point and it was , and he was , words , &quot; run as a matta . &quot;
And so it would be able to go to home and , and he was walked up with this poetry , and it wouldn &apos;t have to be able to take a piece of paper and a faster , and it would be in the page , and it would be in the page .
Sometimes you couldn &apos;t be fast enough , so correct and correct and correct and correct and the poetry and the poetry and then the lost and she would keep roll through the landscape , trying to , as she said , &quot; one other poetry , as he said , &quot; one poet . &quot;
And then there were times -- this piece I &apos;m going to forget -- there were the moments where they were almost perdying , OK ?
So , he was running home and was trying to card and the poetry was trying to card and the poetry was going to go through , and he was going , and then he said , that it was like it home with the other hand and the hand the hundred .
He was going to cut the poetry and repage in his body and he had the page and he was page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be presented on the perfect page and intately , but the last word at the first word .
So when I heard it -- it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s exactly the same thing .
Not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conducture .
I &apos;m a die , and my way to work is ; it &apos;s my way to work is ; and you can see me at the same time and go on and go on and go on and go on on and go on on the well-hand .
But even I was in my test test , I &apos;ve been test against that thing , sometimes .
And I &apos;m going to imagine that many of you ,
You know , if the work and ideas came up with a certain source , you know , I could not be able to know .
What is this ?
And how can we relationate to do it in a way to make us to make the head , but rather , rather , that do you get healthy ?
For how much about , the best example I have is the best example I have is musician musicians , which I have been different years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life has been the incartoon the artist of the artist of the artist , trying to control , to control , to tom-in-interested .
But then he investiged , and one day as he was driving on a &apos; aughway to Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
He was going to be walking up and all of a little bit of a little bit of melodia , which is wonderful , elusive and hallping , elusive and hallpurt , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the desiderve , and the desidery , but it doesn &apos;t know how to take it .
It &apos;s not a piece of card , it has no machine , it has no record .
So it starts to hear this species of old anxished in him , &quot; I &apos;m going to spend , and I &apos;m going to remark obsessed by this character .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can do it . &quot;
And instead of going to the panic , he stopped .
I &apos;m going to move the whole process and did something completely new .
I &apos;m going to look at the sky and said , &quot; Scause , I &apos;m not seeing that I &apos;m drive ? &quot;
&quot; You know , you know , that can you write a song now ?
If you really want to exist , I go back to a more huge moment when I can take care of you .
Altrimments , you go to important something else today .
You know , Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his process , his process , he changed after this .
Not work , the work was still hoscure as always .
But the process , and the anximage was repuring it was reduced when the genius , the genius that was going to be able to return back from where it came out of , and she came out of , and he came out of , and it was going to realize that it didn &apos;t have to be an interiorized and tomind-minded .
but it was this peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration of a conversation between Tom and this external thing that it was not Tom .
So how much you feel that story about changing a little bit of the way I was working and I was already and saved me once .
This idea , he saved when I was writing , &quot; Mang , Prega , Ama , and fall in one of those disperation of the disperation where we &apos;re working on something and we can &apos;t start to think that it &apos;s a disaster , that the worst book is the worst book , that &apos;s the worst book .
Not just bad , right , right , the worst book .
And I started to think about about this project .
But then I remember of Tom who talked to the air and I tried .
So I went up to my face in the manoscritis , and I &apos;ve got to a huge corner of the room .
And I said to the walk , &quot; Senent , what , we &apos;re going to both , we &apos;re not going to be brilliant not be bright , not be bright ?
Because as I &apos;m seeing up what I have , I have , not more than that .
So if you want to be better , you have to show you and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , you don &apos;t do it .
I &apos;m going to go to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I would like to do , I would like to do today , I recorded to do my part , &quot; because -- at the end is , OK -- in the end of the North people were in North Africa , the people were gadvance for the wonderful of the wonderful of the wonderful and hourselves hours hours that were going to be hours and hours hours hours at the top and hours at the top hours .
And they were always magnific , because the balleres were professionals and were fantastic .
But every long , I mean , something happened , and one of these artists were actually transcending it .
And I know you know what I know you talk , because I know you &apos;ve lived , a performance that you &apos;ve lived .
It was like the time you stop , and the ballery walked through a kind of lportal and it wasn &apos;t doing anything different from the usual , as the 1,000 nights before , but it was all all .
And I know , I don &apos;t apparent as a human .
But it happened from the divince and under illlights in the divinity .
And when this happened , to the time , people know what it was , people know what was called it .
They were hands and started to dogen , and they started to cing , &quot; Allah , God , God , God , God , &quot; .
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curious storic -- when the Mom invass the south of Spain , I took this habitude with them and pronounced in the centurious centuries of the house , Allah , &quot; to , &quot; Okay , &quot; , &quot; which you can still hear in the flamen .
In Spain , when a artist has done something that impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , broads , and I was , I &apos;m going to be , &quot; incomprehensible , etched , etching God .
And it &apos;s great because we need .
But , the problem is coming from the day , for the ballery same , when you woke up and discovered that are the 11 of Martedesday , and I &apos;m going to discover it .
It &apos;s simply a death with a high with the ginockyping , and maybe not going to be able to ascending that .
And maybe nobody &apos;s name God , while you have to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most porous recognizes to make in a creative life .
But maybe not to be so angosciating , if you can &apos;t believe , anzyutt , that the most extraordinary expect of your own being come from yourself .
But it &apos;s just to create that you have data in the present from a inimaginable inable to the source of this squish of your life you have to go to someone else when you finished .
And you know , if we think about this way , we think about this .
And so I started thinking about , and it &apos;s because I thought , and it &apos;s sure as I thought for different months in the book that I &apos;m going to huge up , the performance , spavently , spavently , expected , so I was going to be able , expected , expected , expected , expected , expected , and it &apos;s really , expected , and I was just going to think about it for different months in the book , and I &apos;m going to
And what I have to keep me when I feel electrized by this is , not having fear .
You don &apos;t get to walk .
It &apos;s going to be in your part , any part of any , any of whatever it can be .
If your work is ball is ball , ball .
If the divine , aburd genius , assigned to leave some kind of wonderful , for a moment through your stream , then you go , &quot; then ! &quot;
Altrimments , you &apos;re the same dance .
And &quot; OO. &quot;
I think you have to teach it .
&quot; You know , you know , only for you had human and test love and test you have human and test tape to be able to be able to keep you keep in the tape .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : World !
You know , I &apos;ve been talked about some of these projects on human genome , what it can meaning and on the discovery of new genes .
We &apos;re starting to a new percoral . We started digitalize biology and now to speak from that digital code we &apos;re in a new biology , designing and synthesize and synthesize .
We &apos;ve always been trying to door big questions .
&quot; What &apos;s life ? &quot; It &apos;s life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists I think I have a various livels .
We tried different approaches , we &apos;ve been trying to minimes .
We &apos;re digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was to go from the analogic world of the digital world of the digital world .
Now , let &apos;s ask , we can regenerate life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the small gene genitself between those who can authoreum in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome to create one more smaller .
We &apos;re able to eliminate a hundred of genes about 500 that are here .
But when we have a look at his map , it &apos;s relatively simple of the way to our .
I remember , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this can take to a living .
So we decided that the only way to design was synthesis to synthesis to be able to modify some of these questions of fundamental questions .
So , we started the adventure of the &quot; Pan , we can synthesis ?
Can chemistry to produce these big molecule that we never ever ever ever ever to create before .
And in case , we can make a car crowd , we can make a cromosoma ?
A chromosome is simply a piece of chemical material chemical material .
The speed that we can be able to digitalize life is growing up to the life is growing up .
Our capacity to write the genetic code , instead , rather lently , but it &apos;s better better .
And our most recent returned on a exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process has required many past , beginning with a bioethic reats before the first experiments .
But we found that DNA is very difficult .
There are deces of thousands of machines in the world that produces small segments of DNA , of 30 to 50 letters and it &apos;s a process , the most herrors are there .
So we had to develop a new metod to assembling these fragments and read the herrors .
And that was our first attempt , to talk about the digital information of the genome of Phi &apos;s genome of Phi &apos;s 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills .
We designed the fragments , actually , the return the correction of the herrors and get a molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The part of interesting is when we took this piece of chemical material chemical material chemical material , the bacteria have started to read this genetic code and producing the particles .
The viral particles are then you required by cells , they &apos;re back and they were destroyed to the E.
I &apos;ve talked about recently with the members of oil industry and say that they have certainly compress this model .
They have repeated more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build its same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the most larger .
We wanted to build the whole cromosome of the bacteria .
They &apos;re more than 580 myths of genetic code .
So we thought we built it in the size of viruses , so that we could change the casses to understand what the casses of a living cells .
The progress is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accurateful standard was of a herror for every 10 mile .
We found out , we had a 30 herrors . If we had been used that original sequence , we &apos;ve been able to do that work .
One part of the process is to design sit 50 letters that are going to be running with all other segments of 50 lecting to build a smaller subtounded smaller and working together .
We &apos;re going to try at the only one .
You probably have read that we read to us from the ground .
And we think that we have a genetic genetic code on four letters : As , C , and T.
Three of those letters together , they code together about 20 amminoes , and there &apos;s a specific order to every letters of letters .
So we can use genetic code to write words , frassit , switches .
What we did at the beginning was autographs .
Some of them have been of the fact that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
We designed these segments to simply help them together with the enymes .
There are enzymes that they are and put them up .
And we started to assemble parts , beginning with segments from five to seven mile , unendurishing up to the 24 ments a letter to make a sit of 24 myla .
We have produced these segments in the segments in abundance , so we can sequenced by making a very robbrobust -- as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automator the process .
So , this seems to be a basket of a basket .
When we get to these very long segments , more than 100 mile , the more than 100 mile , they will not grow more directly in E.
You get to the limit of the modern tools of molecular biology .
So we looked at other mechanisms .
We knew of a mechanism called homology , which in biology is homology to repect DNA to repair DNA to can see the segments .
Here &apos;s an example .
This organism , called Deinocus radiod-double Deinocus three million rad rad rad .
You can see in the superior as his cromosoma cromosoma destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly as before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be completely completely .
They can live under the vacuum .
They &apos;re absolutely sure that life exists in space , and you can find new environments of water .
At the real , NASA showed that this is .
This is an image of the molecule that we built these processes , just using the landscape with design appropriate design to inserve .
The lievening them , ables them .
This image is not taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that they have a period of six seconds .
This is the publishment we did a little time ago .
They &apos;re more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the biggest molecule of a defined structure .
It has a molecular spot to 300 million .
If we stamming it with a career 10 without spacecraft , it would like 142 pages to transcare this genetic code .
Now , how do we do it ?
Of course , you can have virus is a game from kids .
It &apos;s a little more complicated when they use bacteria .
It &apos;s simplest when it &apos;s cells as well cells as it is about how our : you can just extract the nucleo and inserious another , which is practically the clonely clonely the process of clonely clonely clonely .
In the bacteria , the cromosoma is instead of inside the cells , but we recently demonstrate that we &apos;re able to do a complete transapion of a cell of a croma from one cells from one cells from one cells from one cells from one cells and to activity it .
We can stand a partnership from a microbial species .
The two are different than men from the topes .
We added some gene gene gene gene some gene gene to decide what it for this croma .
It &apos;s slide with the funny in a way to kill all protein .
And when we put it in the cells was studied -- and you &apos;ll opened our graphics soops -- the new cromosoma -- the new cromosoma has gone in the cells .
And we were really thinking that we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried anyway in the weller .
This is one of the most most most mechanisms .
We found that many species have added a second or a second or a third or a third or a third thousands of new new ones of new new ones of the species .
So who &apos;s about evolution as a gene gene at the time that you have not understanding most of the biology .
There are a scientist of the restrial restrial restrial that address digerises the DNA .
The cromosome that was in the cells that was in the cell .
The cellula-the-cromosome cellulath-hand .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other croma , as a standing material , and we found it with only cells and the new cromous chromosoma and the new croma .
it has become blue because of the genes we &apos;ve inserious .
And in a short lassive , all the characteristics of one species are going to be lost , and it transformed all in a new species , based on the new software that we in the cell .
All the protein is changed , membranches are changed , and when we realized the genetic code on what we &apos;ve transfer .
Now , this could seem genetic alchemy , but altering the software DNA software we can change things in a pretty much enough .
Now , I &apos;ve been explained that here is not talking about genesius -- but to do progress from three million years and a half years of evolution , and I &apos;ve been told that maybe we &apos;re going to create new species on this .
Why do it ?
I think that &apos;s enough obvious when we think of our need .
We &apos;re going to go from six and a half billion people at the next 40 years .
Right to give you an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each other existing in 1946 , there will be four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find fresh fresh fresh , medicinal and pulity and a half of people .
It &apos;s still going to be more dare for nine billion .
We &apos;re going to start to five billion carbon , more than 30 billion bars , more than 30 billion barrasses .
That means a millions of barils a day .
When we try to get it , or whatever you can get it , or whatever you can process to replaced them , it &apos;s a huge challenge .
We have to keep all the CO2 emission of CO2 from these materials that you end in the atmosphere .
At the day of today , thanks to discoveries all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the design components for the future .
The electronics can only one dozen a dozen dozen , and you think about how many different things are come out .
Our limits here are major data here are basically from biological reality and our imagination .
We have to techniques , because of these metods of synthetization , able to create what we call combinatory combinatory .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can make a big robot that can make a million cromosomes a day .
Think about this 20 million genes or to try to make different genes or to make a typical processes , new vaccines , we can change , we can change , thank , we can change , and we can change , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology , and in biology , and create more biology and more biology , and create more biology .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for possibility of surviving , chemistry or carbon , chemistry or carbon , production of vaccines .
This is an instantly instantly of some software program that we &apos;re working for being able to be able to seeing and design species on the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t necessarily know how they &apos;re going to be .
We know what they &apos;re exactly their genetic code .
We &apos;re now focus on the carbon of how quarter generation .
You &apos;ve also seen you have to extract ethanol from the grain was a finished finished .
We have a second generation of second generation that will use enough to be preserved by the biggest value as the open-fairly value as the open-f-full or different types of butaneous butaneous butaneous and a fun of the second generation of the biggest and a second generation that will use of the birth of the biggest value as the open or different types of buts of butants of butants and third butes of the highest value ,
But the only way biology can have a big impact without increasingly increasingly the cost of food and limiting the availability would be transforming CO2 in machine , so we &apos;re working to design cells that can make this purpose , and we think of could make this purpose , and we think we could think of the first carbon about 18 months .
The solar solar combined with CO2 is a methodom -- but in our discoveries in all the world , we found different metodds .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , at about 2500 feet deep-feet deep-foot temperature of water .
It &apos;s going to put out from CO2 by using molecular idrogen molecular energy .
We &apos;re trying to figure out if we can int the CO2 , which can be transported through the toubt , converting that CO2 in carbon , to drive this process .
So we think we can be able to be able to increase what the question is , &quot; that the base question that &apos;s life is Not , we have the modest , we have the modest to replacing the oil industry to replacing the oil industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can you do it ?
It would be a main the main of energy .
And we &apos;re working on the same metods to use the same methods to create vaccines .
You saw this year with influence , we are always behind a year and with a dollar when it &apos;s going to find the right wine .
I think that what you can change in a vaccines in a bunable binable .
That &apos;s how the future could start to change , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria , I would , and you can , you know , and you can , you know , eucarily cells .
We &apos;re so much like that we can get people .
Our purpose is to make a long enough to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to make it .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the most quickly possible , some fundamental work , in the new technology that we took to Microsoft in a following at a year ago .
It &apos;s a environment where you can interact is at the local level that remote with an enormous amount of visual data .
Here we &apos;re seeing moltissigns of digital picture of digital photos with a kind of expensive , and for a bread , dispon-by-speed , dispond images like we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these these column of data or images .
Most of digital photographs , but this is a scanning , but this is a scanning from Bibliotected from the Biliotected of 300 megapixel .
It &apos;s not a difference because the only thing that it &apos;s the one thing that &apos;s the number of a system like this is the number of paper on your screen in any time . It &apos;s also an architecture .
This is a whole book , you know , you don &apos;t images .
This is the Casolate of Dickens . Every colonny is a capital .
To show you that it &apos;s about the head and not images , and you can do something that you can do something that is really about a real representation of the heads , not a picture of a text .
It could be a little artificial way to read a book to read a book .
It &apos;s not going to be advice .
This is a more realistic example . This is a number of the Guardian .
Every big images is the beginning of a setion .
And it really gives you the pleasure of a read and beauty experience of a reverse of a newspaper , which is for a lot of a half a lot of medium .
We also did something with the angle of this number of this particular number of the Guardian .
We created a fasull of the higher solutic soluitely -- much more higher than the publishment -- and we &apos;ve inserious about the extra extra .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see it here .
Or other models , or the specific , or the specific specific .
And that really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate space on the screen .
We hope that this means to put the pop-up and other nursing porcheries , they should not be able .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don &apos;t want to lose time , if we don &apos;t mean that we have contributed to give this field .
These are all the roads in the U.S. , you can get a geospatial image of NASA .
So , we go to something else .
This is now , it &apos;s actually from the Web ; you can see it .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which is two different technologies .
A is Seadragoning , and the other is a very interesting search for the very interesting computer in Noah Snavely , a student of the University of Washington , with the help of Steve Seitz of the UW and Rick Seliski Microsoft Rick Seliski Microsoft Rick Seliski .
And it &apos;s from the view of the Web , Seady ,
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from a picture of the other and have this kind of experience in the other , and have this kind of experience .
But the space of images here here has actually a meaning .
The algorithms of computers have recorded these images together , so that they &apos;re taking together , so that the imaging place in which imaginion -- all the next laghot Grasks on the Montne Roccial Montne Roccial Montne Roccial Rockcise -- are you &apos;re taking . And so you see the elements of a slide-shape , and these things are all the space .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some much more space .
I want to go to the directly at one of the original data from a Noahand -- this is from a Photosynth prototynth prototynth that we did work for the first time , the first time the first time the extent -- to show you what I think is really the key . And it &apos;s not necessarily the key , the technology , Photosynth . And it &apos;s not necessarily evidence in the website .
We had to worry about the legal aspects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of Noth-Dimimage of Noth-Din Flickr . Bast Din Flickr and you get images of types and you get images of types and out of saying . Each one of these arrange arrange arrange arrange , and on the wind is a picture that &apos;s discovered .
So I &apos;m all images from Flickr and they &apos;ve been connected to space in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this simplicish .
You know , I would never thought to end up to work for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratiffy to realize this kind of account here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of different types of fote , from those of the cellular cellular cellular phone , a number of significant , homeless , it together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to try to look at the most strange .
Many are blocked out of faces , except .
Somewhere there is a series of photographs -- it .
This is a Noththers of Drecorded correct .
We can go from the poster to the vist of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the whole memory of how to apply the land , from the collective point of view -- and it colleages together .
All those pictures become connected , greater than the parts .
You have a ground model land model that emerge .
Think about this as the prolence of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as well as people use it , and the advantages that are using using using using .
Their pictures are marced by other people .
If someone comes to contrast all these saying the name , my picture of the name , my picture of Noththers of Noththers of all those data , and I can use as a point of all those data , and I can use as a point of ingress to immerge me in that space , using the picture of anyone , and having a social experience of cross-moil .
Of course , a consequence of all that are extremely elaborated , extremely elaborated with any part of the land , and by satellite and satellite images and satellite and similar images , but from the collective memory .
Thank you .
CA : I understood that ? What your software ? What your software will contained to do is that at a certain point in the next years , all the photographs are going to be ready in the whole world will be ready to be ready in the whole world will be reading together ?
BA : Yeah . What &apos;s doing in practice is to find .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the recurity of the recheeness of these images are possible .
As when you do a research of images on the web , you get a sentence and the head on the web page has a lot of information about the picture of the picture .
Now , what happens if that picture is connected to all your picture ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of interconnects that it &apos;s really huge is really enormous . It &apos;s a classical effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible .
BA : You &apos;re very much .
One of the main please when you travels and one of the research and the research is the power of the power of the living in the wind , between who have the anti-traditions , in the wind , the wind , the wind is in the wind , the wind is in the floor of the flying .
Bastes to think that Jaguar Jaguar , and still beyond the Lattea , or mythis still more meaning , or that in Himalaya , or that in Himalaya , the good ddisti , the buddisti , to remember the central importance of the central anthropy , and that the idea that the world where we live in which we live in the living , but it &apos;s just a reality of fact , it &apos;s just a model , but it &apos;s just a reality , is of fact , it &apos;s just a model of the idea of the world ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stirs made , well or a lot of generations ago .
And of course , we all share about the essential .
We all naked . We all project .
We are subjects in the beginning .
We have to death the inexorability of death , so it doesn &apos;t surprising us and ballie --
We have an art .
What collit is the particular is the particular rate of cannot , the rhythm of every culture .
It &apos;s not import that the thought of Borneo , or the following Voodoo of Haiti , or the Wooks of Haiti , or the Kenya , or the Curt , or the Curander , or a cameleras , or a cameler , or a cameleras the Sahara .
He was my own journey in the desert a month ago , or a mth ago , or a hallevator of yak in the values of the world .
All of these people teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of dies in the world .
And , if you reflection , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
And in the cultures of the world create a spiritual girl and cultural life that has been spiritual and cultural and it &apos;s important for the planet as a while as a biosphere as a night as a biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural girl as a cultural girl as a nosphere and you can define the ethnosphere of all the concepts of all the concepts , hispirations , intuitions , intuitiitions , intuitions , intuitions brought to be from the human inhouse .
The ethnosphere is the fantastic patrimonum .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we can be in how inquisitive species .
And because the biosphere was faveled to the etheless , and it was so much more quickly successful .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species has been on the horrip of the extinction , because it &apos;s falthough -- in the higher hypothesis -- in the most apocalyptic diversity -- and you don &apos;t even nearly have a little ypothesis of the most oweren .
The inindice of all that is , of course , the lost language .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only composed by a voice or a series of rules , or a series of rules .
A language is the way of human spirit .
It &apos;s the midle of every culture of every culture is coming in in the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a backin , a thought , a thought , a thought , a pursue of spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re sitting at Monterey , at least the half of the children .
They don &apos;t come to teach children , which means that it means , unless you watching something , they &apos;re dead .
What is there &apos;s more triste of being lived from the silence , of being the last to talk a language , the aren &apos;t being able to transmyself a , of the wisdom or to anticipate the promise of the children ?
This is horring was someone in the world of somewhere in two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks and it brings with it in the tomba tomba .
And I know that somebody who &apos;s not better ?
The world would not be a better place if we talk all the same language ? &quot; We &apos;re all going to talk about yoruba . We &apos;re all going to go .
We &apos;re going to talk .
You &apos;ll be a tract thing you want to say , not to talk about their language .
Today I would like to do you make a journey through ethnosphere --
a little journey in the ethnosphere to give you a little journey of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , &quot; different ways of existing , &quot; I really mean different ways of existing .
We take for example , this Barasana , in Amazon , in Amazon , the population of anaconda , which makes to come from the latest of the latest of the latest makes you sacred .
It &apos;s a population that &apos;s not able to distinguished the blue color blue from the green because the cell is in the time of the forest , where the population .
They have a linguistic and a rule , and a regle , degree , &quot; you have to spose a person who talks about a person who talks about a person who party language .
All this has been room in the mythological past , and yet the particularly is that in these families are talking or seven lens or seven lens , because of the mathemselves of the mathemselves of a language .
They &apos;re limited to listen and then they start to talk .
We take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived , the Waorans of Ecuador , an incredible people , an incredible people who had the first contattached the first contatts in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionaries have touched a commercial contact .
They have been to make it from the photographs that they were in posing poses that they had been advice , forest that this people of the forest pluvial forest pluvial forest .
They &apos;ve been told by the land , they &apos;ve turned to the research of a shape or a figure , they have concled that they were conclosed diables , and they killed the five missionaries with the lance .
But Waorans don &apos;t just killed the straniests .
They kill they kill them .
54 percent of death mortality was caused by them .
We &apos;re saying eight generations and we found two of houses of natural death and when we insisted to know , they have a bunch of them , and then they were invecting it , and then they killed it .
The hunters were able to requires of 40 step and re-ron-passionate and re-re-like the species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was assigned a very interesting compiece when my Harvard professor of Harvard asked if I wanted to go to Haiti to be in the based in the Sorth of Dualier and Tonton Macououououver and Tonton Macross the Rewish I used to use to the zombie .
To give a sense of the myraculous , I should have to understand the Vodoun and that Voodoo is not magic .
It &apos;s pretty much more of a complex meetings of the world .
Many interesting .
If I asked you to tell me about the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , except .
A continent is always left out , and thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa is not religious fefeelings . And it &apos;s not the distilled and Vooo is not other distilled by the distilled of these very deeply religious religious ,
What &apos;s interesting about the voodoo is the intense report is the intense report between life and death .
So the vive is holding the spirits .
The spirits can be invoded by the Great Aca , they respond to the ritical ritual and replaced thpores at the anima way that we would have the followed the followest .
So , this voodooisti love to say , &quot; You white you go to wait to talk about God .
We &apos;re going to start in the temple and become God . &quot;
And from the moment you can say , is the spirit that you guide , how can you do the mal ?
So you have to these incredible events : I &apos;m going to do voodoo in the state of trance that touches impoemered in the power of the power of the power of the mind of the power of the body &apos;s mind when it &apos;s been catalyzed in a state of extremely exciting .
I was all the people with which I lived the most extraordinary people are the Kogi of Sierra Nevada Marta , in Colombia , in Colombia .
Discendments of the ancivilization that once was lived on the carcarcarairs of Colombia , the population of the conquietly populated on the washert planture .
In a continent of blood , this population has never been conquered by the pagners .
And yet , I &apos;m government from a cler-construction , but their formation is really extraordinary .
The young people are taking up from the families and three or four years , and they live secrets in a world of good and hombers in a buns and bombers in the bag of the glacier for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years choose to reproduce the nine months of gestation that transcorn in the user of the mother , now are metaphor in the user of the Great Mther .
So this time , they are acculated to their society , values that are acculate that they are pregnant that their pregnant , and only their pregnant equilibrium -- or for the best best balance .
At the term of this incredible initiation , they &apos;re suddenly taking up and the first time in their age of 18 years , and they see a alba . And in that actional consciousness of the first bad bad , when the sun the sun values , everything that they learned in theory is conferred in all the submit is conferred .
&quot; I &apos;m going to say , I &apos;m like you .
It &apos;s studies . Now it &apos;s to protect it . &quot;
They &apos;re called the greatest fractor and say that we , frathers , we are the basic brothers of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think of Indigene and the environment , we invowers and the old story of the old story , which is a razy concept in his seeing or perhaps , or perhaps invosuch , and we say that these people are closer to the Earth of us .
The Indigenes are not nor nor indebolites from the nostaly .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the Abat or diaric disease in the wind gelids of the Tibet , but thanks and ritues , they created a mystic of the Earth is not on the concept of the maintain of the most subtle , the concept that the Earth can only live in the concept that the Earth can live in the consciousness .
What does it mean ?
Vuod-boy guy who &apos;s growing up in the mountain is a deeply spirit of the Apu that will be a deeply different human being a deeply different human being a deeply different and will have a very different tape and it will have a tape of a Montana who grow up with a Montana of Montana that grow up in a Montana of Montana , which is a mountain .
Which is the dimour of a spirit or a mineral car is irrifying .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that is the metaphor that is the relationship between individual and natural world .
I grew up in the Columbia credrop of creating British , and they were seeing to be cut .
That &apos;s a different human being being different from my friends to my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the dimour of Hukuk and the cancer &apos;s history and the cancer beyond the history of the world , spirits that are in the Norrimp , and the canner-initiation that are in Hamatsa .
If you start to look at that these cultures can actually actually actually make different different , you can start to understand some of them , you can start to understand some of them sensational sensational .
I took this picture to open up in the West Amazon .
Mayahuge some of you have heard about the Eahuge susceful substance of the repertorium of the repertorium .
What makes the eye eyahuge is not the potential drug is not the potential drug of substance , but it &apos;s two elements .
From a side , this lian lian lian lian lady of a heal-carbon , harmins and harmers , and harming , and harmed , hallucinogene .
Prending the sola plants , you have a bluaser that alterms a little bit of the consciousness , but it &apos;s myself with the leaves of a house of the family of the family of the house of the virid-told broad .
This plants powerful plants , very similar to serotonin the serotonin the demithod-five , methowever , methoxygen .
If you ever see Yanomami to reach the Yanomami that make from a different species of species , which is methoxygen methoxyltryltryltryltryltryltrylthlew .
Tirate that polar on the no is a little bit like being disappeared by a fight of the pind distores and landscape on a mess of electricity . You don &apos;t believe a distortion of reality .
I was often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who took the psychedelic , with her discovered , with her discovered , with her discovered in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in Mexico .
I think , I can &apos;t be able to classify these triptames like hallucinogens because if you can &apos;t tell anybody who are being killed .
It &apos;s possible to assume , if you assumption with other chemicals that money are the MAO .
Now , the beauty : the carbon is , the charcoal is inbitors of MAO , the same kind of necessary guys to be able to powerful triptams . The expensive question : in a flow of 80,000 species of plants , like these are the people who are two dies of dies , but if you &apos;re in the same way , they create a little bit of the same way , they create a typical chemical , but of the parts ?
We use the great euphemism of the herror , that can be infruit .
But if we ask in the Indians , they &apos;ll say , &quot; We &apos;re talking . &quot;
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of Ehuge , who distinguished in the forest , and that our eyes would be in the same species .
If we ask them how they stabilish their task us , &quot; I thought I was going to say , &quot; I didn &apos;t know ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you get 17 variety in a night of llandscape and each one will cannot be with a different tone .
With this is not laureauction to Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting that count the press .
Now , &#91; opped &#93; the problem is that also the ones of us who have the heart people who have the heart people who have the writing history , but somehow reduces to our real world , and past over .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it &apos;s not remember for his wars or technological innovations , but rather as we stop and technological innovations , but rather as we stop and we were active , and we were active , we were able and we were active , the problem of the world &apos;s cultural and cultural isn &apos;t changing .
All of the cultures have been involved in a dance for new possibility of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux don &apos;t have to be Sioux when they put up in the arrow and fashion and full they have been horse by the horse and head .
It &apos;s not change or the technology that mines the integrity of ethnosphere . It &apos;s the power .
The wall of the domination of the domination .
And if you look at the world , you &apos;ll discover that these are not cultures are not cultures to be able to disappear .
They &apos;re creatures and dynamics out of the identify existence that go out of identify .
And what &apos;s about disbospites in the patria of the Penan --
a population of Sarawak , in Sarawak , a population that lived free free in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to a generation ago , and the next titution on the restrumes of the rives , where you can see the river Bornewspaper from the lighting Merishort Merional Mundiger Cince Merionte , where the naves the Japanese , where the naves the Japaniszonizons , where the naves the named Borable names the
and you have to replaced the stive with the wood wood .
Or , in Yanomami , are the diseases that are the disease of those .
If we move on the mountains of the Tibet , where I &apos;m doing many researching research , you &apos;ll see the politics of the political domination .
You know , the genocide , the physics of a population , is condanned to the universal level , but the ethnium , the distraction of a population of a population , not only condannect , but it &apos;s celebrated in certain environments , because it makes part of the development .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of the Tibet , until you get in the beginning .
I realized 6,000 miles from Chengaged in the West in the West through the West , by the Western Tibet , and I just got to Lhasa with young colleaged , but only came to Lhasa , I realized what &apos;s behind .
6,000 degrees inhert reducts and cens .
1.2 million people killed from the military the Cultural Revolution .
The dumped of this guy was ascrited to Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed to the time of the Chinese invasion .
I &apos;m unclear with Santity in Santity in Santity in the deasport .
She was myself imprised and her colpage was recipes .
It was taken of holding to carry on the age of two years , high-year-old ner-old because he wouldn &apos;t live without .
The sister , which has been done the same , it was put in in result of reeducation .
A day has been inavverted a day , a fassemble , and in this transground , and in this transgression , was mitted to the workers for seven years .
The Tibet of the Tibet can be insophistory , but it &apos;s region .
And it &apos;s the end , it &apos;s all of the choice .
We want to live in the world world of the world of the world or we want to collect the policromatic world of diversity ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before we die said that her biggest is that , in our living amorous of the world , we &apos;ll just see the whole gama of human imagination is going to a modality of the human imagination is going to a modality of thinking , but a day we &apos;re going to wait from a day , we &apos;re going to be able able able .
And it &apos;s humiliating that our species is existed for 60,000 years .
The Rivolution Neols , who gave us the agriculture , which made us to be able to be able to the cult of the sea poem of the sea poem of the slide of the species of the species of the species of specialization , and we &apos;re talking about 10,000 years ago .
The industrialized world industrialized has been on a 300 years .
That square history not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenge that we should be at in the millennia to come .
When these myriades of cultures of the world is asked what to say to be human , they respond with 10,000 different voyn-different voyn-different voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all return the possibility of being what we are : one species of the consciousness , that it has to be able to make all the people and all the garden , and there are great moments of owers .
I took this picture on the north of the island of the island of Baffin , when I went to the hunt with Inuit , and this man , and this man , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya history of the island of the island of the island of the is
The canadvice government was always gentile with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to stabilie our prematises , we have them in colonies .
The non-man of this man refused to go .
The family , theming , I took him up all the arms , and all of her , and all of her attractional attractional .
You have to know that Inuit is not the cold , they &apos;re not the cold , they &apos;re going to be .
The pactins of slites were made of fish were made of fish skin fishing skin .
The non-hand , you don &apos;t have to say from the artypically , or by the blizing artypically .
It &apos;s healthy , you &apos;ve got the paper in the skin of focus and defecated in their hand . When the fecks are conged , and they &apos;re congeled , and they &apos;re creating a lama .
It &apos;s spring up on the points of this crowd of this crowd , and when it came up , he killed a dog .
He schools schools and created a bria , with the house , and he &apos;s made a slandscape , he &apos;s bright . And it &apos;s a little bit of a banchisa , and it &apos;s banchisa crow-up .
We want to talk about cavarsely with nothing ? &#91; Raish , and that , in different ways , &#91; Applauses &#93; is the symbol of the resilience of the Inuit and all the Indigenes of all the world .
In the open 1999 , the canads has reducted to Inuit &apos;s the total control of a territorum of the California and Texas the most larger of California and Texmen together .
It &apos;s their new patric . It &apos;s Nunavut .
It &apos;s a territory territory . They &apos;re all the resources .
One of the splendium of how a national national state can reach with his population .
And , finish , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least at least at least who are in these watching zones of the planet , make it remote .
For somebody &apos;s house .
They represented the human imagination that are the same time to the alba time . And for all these children , as the dreams of these children , as the dreams of these children , as the dreams of geography .
Finally , we are National Geographic , we &apos;re convince that politicians will never arrive .
We believe that polemies --
&#91; Applauses are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month to tell stories about our site remains 35 million lived .
156 countries transmit .
Our reviews are seven miling from millions of people .
Our work is to travel in the ethnosphere to bring our public in the audience of wonderful cultural and hopes from how much they saw and , hopefully , they will will get a central reveation of anthrology : the marketing of anthrology of living in the diversity , and we have to find a style in a world and multicultural world of high living in a world of well-living in a world and muralthough , and multicultural reats of myticulticultural lives .
where the wisdom of all the people can contribute to our collective wealth .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote about this book , I &apos;m going to be able to evidence some of the colleages , in case , in case not note .
I want to start with what I call the dogma dogma dogma . &quot;
The dogma dogma dogma dogma ?
The officer of all the Western society of all the Western industrial . The dogma officer : &quot; If we want to male the benefit of our citizens &quot; The way to do it is to be to maximize the individual freedom . &quot;
The reason , from a side , in the fact that freedom is in the fact that freedom is precious , useful , for human beings .
As the other is that if we &apos;re libers , each of us can act for all of us can act it to do everything that makes our benefit , without no one that decided in name .
The way to male the freedom is to be to be able to be able to be able to be able to male the choice .
More choices people have , the more libers are libers , and greater is their liberty , greater is their well-being .
This , I think , it &apos;s so deeply radicated in society that nobody would be able to put in the back .
And it &apos;s also deeply deeply deeply in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what the progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I lost a simple note on conditions .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without contact 10 variety of oil extreme and 12 acetes that you can buy to buy a huge number of conditions that you can buy a huge number of condent in the research of your degrees .
That &apos;s the supermarket .
And then you go to the electronics to buy a stereo : case , the CD , radio , radio , radio , radio , radio , radio , radio , radio , plator , plastra .
And in this single negotion of electronents , there &apos;s a big number of components .
We can do six and a half million different combinations using the components that there are in a only negotiate .
You have to admit that there &apos;s a lot of choice .
Other the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all the services , you could get all the services , at the best that they were forned by mama Bell .
It was born the phone , it was not buy it .
A consequence of that , in the other , was that the phone was never going to be .
These themes are gone .
We have a variety variety of telephones , especially between cellular cellular .
Here &apos;s cellular cellular cellular .
My favorite is in the midle , MP3 , MP3 , cut up , and shapels for the eymas .
If you don &apos;t have seen in the store under the house , you &apos;re going to be in the house .
And what &apos;s the end is that people are in the news and does this question . And you know what the answer is ? The answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cellular thing that &apos;s not too much much things .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the acquired , you can be the same explosion of choices .
Asanitarian health of health , the United States that you go from the doctor and doctor what you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do it , or B , &quot; As , &quot; has these benefits . &quot; And these well-history and these . &quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Dr. &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; You have these benefits , and B has these benefits , and B has these well-hand-hand . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebats , you know , she was me , what would you do ? &quot;
And the doctor , I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result of the disease of the disease of the disease , &quot; expression that it seems to be a beautiful thing .
But in fact , it &apos;s not that one to move the weight and responsibility to make decisions of somebody who knows something , which is the doctor , and almost certainly it -- and so it doesn &apos;t know -- and so not in the ideal condition to take decisions .
There &apos;s a huge marketing products , drug to people like me and , that if you think about it , and that if you think about it doesn &apos;t be able to buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why do we get them to the hell ?
The answer is that they want to domaction . We call the doctor to ask them to change .
Something that is the fundamental identity is a question of choice , as you see in this jet . We don &apos;t want to force children . We don &apos;t want to force children . Scear their hair . &quot; We don &apos;t want to be an identity .
And we can reinvented us .
which means that every morning , to the risk , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I &apos;m standing at the family and maybe , a time the common , a time , slikely to anyone , it was that you can get the most possible , and it started to make the most possible .
The only choice was choice , when you don &apos;t even when , and not even , and unless what to do after .
Everyday , it &apos;s really to play .
I &apos;m seeing students very intelligent students , and I do do 20 percent in the work of a time .
And they don &apos;t because they &apos;re not brilliant , because they &apos;re not not because they &apos;re less diligences .
but because I &apos;m impensierites , I mean , I &apos;m going to spose me , &quot; I should be doing it now ? &quot;
&quot; I should I must spose ? I have to think before the children or the career or the career ? &quot;
They &apos;re saying logorant .
And they &apos;re trying to answer these questions , even though this implement is not completely the companies that are not not to get a bel vacuum at my exame .
And they have to do it . They have to do it .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , as Carl Sot , because the technology allowed us to work every minute , from Hotel Randolph .
It &apos;s parently , there &apos;s a angle , and I &apos;m not going to tell anybody , where WiFi works .
I don &apos;t say , because I want to use it .
What does it mean , this incredible freedom of choice that we have to continuously , we have to continuously on every moment , if we have to work or not .
We can go to the jump , with the cellular board , with the cellular mobile phone , the Blackberry in the other , and the night , on the ginocket .
And even though they &apos;re all spended , every minute that we see our son , we &apos;re also wondering , we &apos;re also asking , we &apos;re going to answer this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? &quot; I have to go to the letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , &quot; it makes the experience of partners , very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , as we look at , small things , small and big things , and big materials and style of life , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : Over , there were some possibility , but it was not a question of choice .
The world today is this : The dilemma is , &quot; Is it is , &quot; Is it . &quot;
The answer is Short .
We know , we all know , we all know , I &apos;m going to talk about that negative .
All this choice is two negative effects negative effects on people .
The first , paradoximum is that produced to be paralysis that liberation .
And many options that you can choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I office an example , meaning , a study conducted in the plans of volunteer .
A colleages had access to the data of Vanks , the gigantic society of the source of the deep sources in 2,000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in the most , the percentage of adesion is two percent .
With 50 sources , there &apos;s 10 percent of the adesions of adesions that are available only five . Why ?
Because with 50 sourth sourcycle , is diem of course , is hard difficult to decide , and the choice is remanding .
And by domorders , and still domorders , domorders , domorous , and of course , domorous domorant domorous , and of course , domorous domorant , domorders , and of course , domorant domorant , domorant , and of course domorant domories , and of course domorders and naturally domorders .
You can &apos;t just mean that these are working from echeches are going to eat because they &apos;re not going to be enough money , because they &apos;re not going to say that the decision is so obstic that the decision is so obstic that they also have the complex of work .
Not to the work , they &apos;re losing , they &apos;re losing , and it would be willing to be trouble to be .
So the paralized is a consequence of having too much choices .
And I think that &apos;s makes the world .
&quot; And to finish , for the eternity : ketchup , or maybe it ? &quot;
You would like to be right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and neppurpure the wrong .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can avoid and do a choice , we &apos;re less satisfacts from the result of how we would be with less options that we were with less options that we were with less options .
And that &apos;s for different reasons .
One of these is that with many of these are conducts of which choose , if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect , is to imagine that you could have a different choice that you could make a different choice that would be better . And what &apos;s happened is that alternative imagined us to get up the choice , and the repit defense remains the soon , and the soon on the decision , and the soon as the source of the decision , and the soon ,
even when it was a very good decision .
More choices there are , more easy displeasy than any detail of the option of the option of choice .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert ask , very well , as the value that we have to the things that we depend with things that we &apos;re going to do .
In the rest , when there are many options , it &apos;s easy to be able to be the elected owers of the alternative of the option of the option that is choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I write with all of those who are not in New York .
But that &apos;s what you would probably think .
There &apos;s this coppia coppia .
A place of lussive place .
It spiece of splendida . Otyma days . It &apos;s all for them .
Not . But what he thought is , &quot; Well , malite . &quot;
&quot; All my nearest Manhattan are so on . &quot;
&quot; I could talk about home . &quot;
And it turns out two weeks on the idea that &apos;s losing -- every day -- every day -- the possibility to talk where it wants .
The cost-opportunity is decade , you know , the soon is that we have , even when the choice was eccellent .
And the most options that we have to look at , the most actual characteristics will come to the way cos-opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
We talk about the living time , and maybe of the living .
But the most important point is that any thing you choose , you &apos;re going to choices , you &apos;re not doing the other .
The things we don &apos;t choose to be active activity that can make less attractive more attractive what we do .
Tirst point : the raising growth of wait .
I tried it on my skin buying a new jeans .
I &apos;m going to almost always ,
Once the jeans were one , I bought them and wress wrespect , they were dissions , only after they took a life and they were working and washes a lot of time , and they started to go .
So I went to buy a couple when the old old people were going , and I said , &quot; I need a couple jeans , and I said , &quot; I need a couple jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
The committed me , &quot; Who wants to me , fit , fit , relaxy and fails ? &quot;
Washed them with the certain your button ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; acidwashed ?
&quot; Would you have a stream ? &quot;
&quot; Sight the nurse or street ? Bl bla bla -- &quot; Continy was at elency .
I was hordit , and after a little bit , and after a little bit of , I was able to say , &quot; I want the only guys , &quot; I had no idea what was , so for a hour , I tried all the sti sticks , and then used by using the best , I was going to use from the best , with the best powered , with the best powerful , with the best guilty , I was going to do .
It was the maximum . I had got the best .
But I was worse .
Why ? I wrote a book at the hair .
The reason I was worse for worse is that with all the expectations were altissit , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was wonderful waiting . I didn &apos;t wait for anything , when there was only one , but when there was a different different , you can be , but when it &apos;s a lot of holding , at least a kind of perfect .
What I had buy was good , but not perfect .
And after I had talked to the choice with what I was trying to insoon in the expectations .
The addition of options in life of the people don &apos;t make the expectations that these have respect to the eccellence of options .
And that will product sodle , even when the results are good .
No one in the world of marketing if you get it .
Because if they knew what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more about this .
&quot; It was better when it was worse , &quot; The reason it was better when it was better when it was worse , it was better when it was worse , you know , you were still able to meet the surprised .
Egyday , in the world where we live -- opulent , industrialized industrialized , the maximum that we can hope is that the things are at the height of the things are at the height of the things are at the heith of the wait of the things are at the height of the high of the world we can be
You never have surprised places because your waiting , my expectations , they &apos;re ingigantic .
The secret of happiness -- what you are here -- is , &quot; Basse waiting , &quot; Yes , you want . &quot;
I mean , little autobiographic moment -- that I &apos;m actually moved and my wife is really studies .
I wouldn &apos;t have to do better , I didn &apos;t have an accomplished .
But it &apos;s not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of buying a couple of jeans scomfortable when there &apos;s only that jeans are the kind of jeans is that when you don &apos;t spend , and you say , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot; The answer is to .
The world is responsible . What could I do you do ?
When there are hundreds of types of jeans , and you buy a disaster , and you ask you who is the responsible , is otherwise you .
You could have better .
With hundreds of dispaiting , there are no scale .
So when people are decisions , even though the result is valid , they feel insoon , they &apos;re insoon and they have the colpurn to them .
In the last years , the depression is exploss in the industrialized world .
I think that a meaning full meaningful -- not the only one , but the important one -- of this wonderful depression of the people are too much high experiences .
And when they have to explain this situation think that the colpurn is .
So the final result is that we &apos;re better , we &apos;re better better , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the officer , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely falong . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than it &apos;s not about it , but that &apos;s not to be better than a lot better .
There &apos;s a critical value , I know what it is .
But I &apos;m pretty sure we &apos;ve been surrounded by a piece where the choices are better .
Now , from the political point of political point -- I &apos;ve almost finished -- from the political point , the nocle is the following .
What it allows of this choice in the industrial society is the material rechoice .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too much pocket .
So the faces I &apos;m talking about is a disease of modern is a disease of modern , recise society .
And what it makes it be to be able to be this : Steve Levitt talked about yesterday , and comfortable seat seat , and comfortable seat myself . It &apos;s a well-shared money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and dispendious , is not that they &apos;re just useful .
They &apos;re going to be addict of the .
They &apos;re going to stop worse .
If a little bit of what we have is in our society allows , it &apos;s been revered in those people where people have too much more possibility , not just their life better life , but also the better life .
This is what economists call a partnership .
A redistribution of the reduction is good at all -- not only to the poor -- not only to the poor the poor that &apos;s going to be holding .
To conclude , you can become all you want to become everything you want . &quot;
You , people of culture , you think , &quot; But what does it create that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t make anything in a glass . &quot;
&quot; A case , a limited vision of the world -- &quot;
I &apos;ve interpretation it , I interpretation .
But then , you think about , instead , I realized that that fish the long-city knowledge .
Because the fact of the fact of the fact is that if you &apos;re manda in the way that , &quot; everything you can &apos;t be able . &quot; You get the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you can get the drive in a way that everything dimining as possible as you can dimind the soon .
You &apos;re going to get the paralises , and you reduck the well-being .
All they need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too much , perhaps even though , perhaps even for us .
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic symbols and , I theme , for roll .
Thank you very much heart .
