Last year I showed these slides to show that the cotta climbing glacial glacial , which almost three million years has had the size of 48 United States . The last year was 40 percent .
However this is the gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the spexpected of the ice .
The arcles is a kind of arctic clear is , in a sense , the heart heart of global climate system .
It expants inverter and it &apos;s taken .
The next slide will be a quick carled on the advice of the last 25 years .
The ice perensigned in red .
How you see , they expand until blue .
That &apos;s the ice in inverter , which is the summer of summer .
You can see that the cosidly dle , of five years or , it &apos;s like the blood , which five years or it &apos;s like the blood , which five years from the body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been so .
This is a problem because the interested in the ocean , which is the crows around the ocean arctic where there are enormous amount of congeration that , shoulders , and they turn into metane from the microbes .
Rist to the totality of the atmospheric inquent , global amount of global warming , that amount could rads , super-hand , this point of not .
In some laghi lages in Alaska , the methane is already rebolling from the water .
The professority Katey Walter of the University of Alaska has been recked with a team pressed to a team broken .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : She &apos;s good . The question is if we &apos;re going to be .
A reason is that this term scale the Greenland from the north .
This is a figum to glacial .
The brought didn &apos;t reach to the similar .
This is the Kangerlush , the Kanger-west , the west Greenland .
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea level of the sea sharp of the ice on terrain on terrain .
These runents are increasing up .
At the other part of the planet : Antarctica , the biggest block of the planet .
The month of the scientists have declared that the balance of the ice is in negative , and the Antarctica , which is on some of the western islands , which is particularly recorded in the short shape .
Equival 16,000 feet of the watching across , like Greenland .
Sull Himalayas , the third largest block of ice , you see new lagholds , who were glagherent .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population is half the water from that slide .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the city of the water of this city .
The led is increased .
But when it diminishes , the same happens to be potachievement water .
In California , the snow , the nevada is diminished 40 percent .
The hydrops are in the crisis .
The predictions , as you read , as you read , they &apos;re graveating .
The growth of the world &apos;s door to a remarkable increase in the incendes .
The environmental disaster is increasing a rhythm from the normal and without precedented .
Four times more numerous numerous in the last 30 years from the precedented 75 .
This is a whole thing that &apos;s a whole thing .
If you look at it in the historical context , if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day .
Look at the East Pacific , the American Pacific , to the west , and on both the west parts of Indian subcontinent , where there is a radical impoverments of oxygen in the ocean .
Most of the global warming , together at the deforestation , which is the 20 percent , is the use of fossil combuster .
The oil is a problem , and the charcoal is even worse .
The United States are one of the two of most emissions with China .
And he was proposed to build a lot of other central central .
But we &apos;re going to be wonderful change .
These are the projects in the last few years and some of the other verse alternative verse .
Every way , there &apos;s a politician in our country .
The carbon industries and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon , which is a hosyming , which is a hosym .
That picture I remember something --
Natal Very , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a lost of 3.8 billion lbodies of carbon .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the second largest flow of scories in America .
It happened around Natal .
The published of one of the carbon industries was this .
Video : I mean , the carbon is a kind of a happy and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it &apos;s going to grow our economy .
I &apos;m going to be clean and more and more clean .
It &apos;s good price , adorable and work machor work .
Al Gore : West Virginia carbon of the West Virginia .
The biggest society about mountaining mountains is Massey Coal . This is his amministrator .
Doon Blankenship : I &apos;m going to be clared -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelososis , Harry Reid -- don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Protection of Clim has launched two campaign .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : At COALergy : ALergy see the climate change as a serious threat our business .
So that &apos;s why we have to invest a great amount of money in a public effort in a public effort to make public and confused the truth on .
In fact , the carbon isn &apos;t spork .
We think it &apos;s clean -- it &apos;s also a good profuman .
So , not preoctation of climate change .
Let me do .
Video : Ator : Carbone -- you &apos;ve heard a lot of you heard .
So let &apos;s take a turn into a class of a clean to the clean .
Strtraordinary ! Maches are a little bit of noise , but this is the sound of the clean technology of clean .
The carbon consumption is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable charcoal remarkable , but the remarkable charcoal remarkable that you see changes everything .
Do a look at this : this is the hate hate technology of clean .
Al Gore : Inally , the positive alternative positive to economic issues and the national security and the national security .
Video : Shot America is in crises ; the economy , national security , national security , climate crisis .
The files that the lines all of this : our dependence from fossil beautiful fossil carbon and oil .
Now , it &apos;s a new audace , audace solution for using circumstances .
Repower : 100 percent of the clean energy , 10 years .
A plan to put America to make sure more safe , and help to stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that &apos;s solving our problems .
Repower . Scoh of America .
Al Gore : That &apos;s the last .
Video : It &apos;s about reduck energy .
One of the faster ways to get to the combustible dependence from the combustable to kill our planet .
Comparsian : The future is here . Vink , sole , a new energy .
Something : Noves investment for places of the babies .
Comming : I &apos;m going to be realists .
Al Gore : A afraid of the aframework says , &quot; If you want to go fast , go to the fast .
If you want to go away , go together . &quot;
We need to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED I did a feckles on LHC .
And I promise to return to get you about how the car works .
So here I figure . And for those who was not , the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever ever ever ever tried -- -- 27 kilometers of circumference .
His compiece is to recreate the conditions that were less than a billion-second from the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times the second .
All of this is simply environment .
This is the car under Ginevra .
We pick these mini-Big Bang inside the relevators .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- is a 44 feet and it has a 22 feet .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS spectacular picture .
10 section of the last year we move the car year , we accessed the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was causing of immense festegs in control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first particles of the particles who had done the whole thing of LHC , entering in collision , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles inside the rest .
In other words , when we see that picture of the picture , we understood that picture , we understood that the car worked , which is a great vicker .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to exultate more or this , when he went to Google and saw the page page was this .
That means we had a cultural impact to the scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , just had to these phils here -- these dored phils .
These files are going to 13,000 amping when the car works in the most power .
Now , the technicians will look at the files and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . They &apos;re too unfortunately . &quot;
And instead can do it because when they &apos;re very cold , they get the superconductor .
So at less 271 degrees , at a inferior temperature in the space between the stars , these phils can bring that running that rent .
In one of the young of the younger novemisle in LHC , there was a fect of fabrication .
So the files surprising , and the 13,000 amping , and the 13,000 amping amping electric resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressionant if you think these magnets are more than 20 tons .
They are damaged about 50 magnets .
We had to take them , what we did .
We resisted them and travel .
They &apos;re now returning all the sub-place place .
Entertainment of the LHC is going to be new integrated .
We &apos;re going to happy it , and we expect data to get right or switching the right , and continue our adventure to discover what the people are brought in the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain a way , these accidents return the debate of science and engineering engineering . It &apos;s easy to confuture .
I think the fact that &apos;s so hard , the fact of going to go beyond the boundation of things like LHC .
I &apos;d like to end with the words of a Inglese scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , images , in the inuseful experiments of his pupillo , his pupillo , his pupillo , he said , &quot; Nothing is so dangerous for the progress of human mind that the ideas of science as the human mind that the ideas of science , which our triumph that are not mistakes in nature , which our triumping to the words , and that are tune .
Thank you .
I want to start wondering when , from children , played , played with children , played up with the morning .
As you get them and go to the herring them and get them , take them and get them , learning , and get them , learning , and to figure out and manipping relationships .
The space is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , by information , by the uslity of our interaction with physical objects , together my consultopping Patu , and my home collaborator , I started to ask , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of having the only paper of the mouse as a digital polel that moving on a desktop , we could run the information with entrepreneur , we could run the hands , we could run the hands ,
and systems to our plot ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , by built the answer , by built the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a whole active computer as a biscoom .
In a few words , a Siftable is a whole active computer as a biscoom .
You can move them with the hand , can see , &quot; you can see &quot; between them , &quot; you can see &quot; between them , and they have a screwireless .
But above , I &apos;m physical objects , like morning , can just move just up .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystems of tools to manippulate the digital information .
And as they become more physical , consciousness of the movement , and as they become more physical , and as they become more physical , of the other people , how we can explore new and fun fun fun fun .
I &apos;m going to start with some simple example .
This is Siftable is configured to show the video : if you just incline in a direction , the video , it will rott that , if I close to the other hand back .
These are interactive of other other people .
If you go out , they &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re going to do .
If they come circumstand , they can get a little bit .
If they come circumstand , they can get a little bit .
They &apos;re going to spending their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power to use communicate gestures , &quot; a color as if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable , as a center of the versor , I can use them to versing color in the central , where they missing .
and I can use them to versing color in that central , where they missing .
If we &apos;re too much going to be able to put a little place .
There are also beautiful possibility of learning , like the languages , math and logic and games where people can try to try the best things , and see the results of things , and see the results of the immediately .
I &apos;m going to --
This is a sequence of Fibonaccomplishes .
Here we have a game of words that is half between Scarabeo and Boggle .
Pratically , at every turn to every turn to the case on every Siftable , to every turn to every turn to the turn on every Siftable on every Siftable , and while certainly he controls a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new set of letters and new possibility to try to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s what the children came up to the Media Lab , I did so that they would try them and turned a video .
They &apos;re very like that .
And one of the interesting things of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
You just say , &quot; Compons of words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s what other people who are trying to do it .
This is our younger tester , there &apos;s the most of the young .
It was actually just to cheat them .
They were just morning .
Now , this is an interactive application of an interactive chardboard .
We wanted to build a tool for learning languages , Lui is Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , sunclear , by the Siftable .
It can put new characters in the scene , sunclear , by the Siftable .
Here , it &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : The sun is surprising .
David Merrill : Now he brought a treator in the scene .
Video : The arange treator .
Bel work ! Yes !
So schooling the Siftable and put them neighborhood , can make the characters --
Video : Bau !
and by inventing their story .
Video : Have !
DM : It &apos;s a story with final open , and it can decide him as it &apos;s going to be .
DM : It &apos;s a story with final open , and it can decide him as it &apos;s going to be .
Volice : Get away .
DM : The last example I have the time to show you is a tool , realized of recently , to sample and to watch .
it &apos;s a tool , realized recently , to watch and exeded music .
The Siftable here are agenda , based and battery .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose what you use .
You can also put these sound in a sequence of behavior sequence to behave .
And modificate it just making a sound &quot; and a sequence . &quot;
These are actually you can control from the vive , as the reverse and the philter .
The attacks at a particular sound and then inclines to fix it .
And then there are the general effects as time and volume , and that are applying on the sequence .
Let &apos;s look like this .
Video : DM : We &apos;re going to start by putting a base in two Siftable , we can systems , we can get it in a series , add base .
Now I put a basis line .
Video : DM : Now I add of percussions --
Video : And I &apos;m going to put the filter , so I can control the effect of the battery .
Video : DM : I can speak the entire sequence inating time from one hand ,
Video : And I &apos;m going to add the basis to give more expression .
Video : DM : I can reach the sequence . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to plan it first , but I can suddenly sudden , and I can make it longer or more cording .
And now , finally , I can smooth the whole sequence inking on the left Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new man &apos;s interfaces and more like this to work in our brain and body body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the results of this percoral , and some possibility that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to transmit is that it &apos;s coming from this new generation of designed objects to interact with digital media , that will lead information in our world in the way that we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the hour of talking to all of you .
I &apos;m a written .
Books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also the love and the fascrows of my life .
And I don &apos;t look like that change .
But , said , this particular thing happened to my life and in my career , and in my career , who bring me to the entire entire rely with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called &quot; Manat , Prega , Ama , &quot; which is different from my books , for some reason that I had the world and become a big , sensitive , for some reason it has been a great sensitive , sensitive .
And the result is that everywhere goes now , people treat me as if they were condanted .
Davoid -- condanned , condanned .
They &apos;re all worried and they say , &quot; Don &apos;t you fear of the fear of having not to be able to do ?
Don &apos;t you fear to keep writing for all life without being able to create a book that can important one ? &quot;
What can you get to somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s rassure , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember that I remember more than 20 years ago , when I was going to say to people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a written .
I was in the same reaction by the same reaction .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t get successful ?
Don &apos;t you fear that the humiliation of the refull you kill you ?
Don &apos;t you fear to do this all of life without any life without any income come out and die on a cumule of infrants with the mouse of infrants ? &quot;
Cose , so , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I have afraid of all those things .
I &apos;ve had always been afraid .
And I have a lot of other things that people could not inate .
As the food and other things are going to be .
But , as much about the writing what I thought and I was wonderful , and I ask is why ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logic that anyone has to waiting for being spavented by a job that you feel to do .
But what is there so particular in the creative creative to make us nervous about the mental health of mental health , in a way that other chareter &apos;t ?
And as my father , for example , he was a chemist and I don &apos;t remember one once in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if he had to be able to engineer ?
Not was never -- that block of John engineer , how it &apos;s it ?
It didn &apos;t work that , you know ?
Onestly , chemical engineers as group have no , in the centuries , glad the reputation of being alcolized manized manized manized .
We have enough this reputation , we have enough this reputation , and not only writers , but creative of all kinds of things , we have this reputation of being enormous instabsolutation .
And it doesn &apos;t rest more that you look at the contegrated trists of the magnific dead of the minds that , just in the 20th century , died young people died .
And even the ones who have no suicidated to be really displaced by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before I died , in the last interview said , &quot; Every book killed me a little bit more . &quot; As a little bit more . &quot; An an extraordinary affirmation about the work of their life .
But not bad at the child when we heard these things that are so long that we &apos;ve heard these things that we have completely interior and the notized the notion that creativity and suffering and suffering , and the art , and the art , it will always conducive to the host .
And the question I want to take all over here is : are you going to agree with this idea ?
I &apos;m going to do this -- because it &apos;s also going to go from a centimeter of distance to me , not well for anything this suppose .
I think it &apos;s odiosa .
And I think it &apos;s also dangerous and I don &apos;t want to see the perpetuate in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better encourage our great minds of creative living .
And of course , I know , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start figing out the circumstances that I &apos;m going to be in my career .
So , really -- look at , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;ve about 40 years .
I have still about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything I &apos;m going to writing now , it will be judged by the world as the work that was used to be done in my last book .
I &apos;m going to be holding , because we &apos;re all more or friends here -- is likely that my biggest successes is to my biggest successful is .
Oh , Gesus , who think .
You know this is the kind of thinking that &apos;s going to get a person to start broads in the nine and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would stop doing this work that we do .
So , the question becomes , how do you ?
And so it seems to me , after a lot of reflective reflective , to try to keep a psychological construct , okay ?
I have to find a distance of security between me , who I &apos;m writing , and my natural anxy about what reaction is going to get the reaction , and I was looking for the year last last year on how to do it , and I was looking at the time , trying to find other societies to see if they could have better ideas and more more more more unlike that could have better ideas and more more more more horse ideas and more unlike better . And as a lot of the most of the improvement and more than than it was going to get some better ideas and more than that I
how to help people to manage the emotional inerent risks of creativity .
And that research has brought me to the ancient Greetness and ancient Rome .
I saw me because he gets into circle and then back .
Nelantica Great and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity was from men , OK ?
It was thinking that creativity was this spirit of divine , and who came to a few slights and known to a few source and known for reasons , and sliterally .
The Grees were called these divines of the beyond the behind .
Socrate , wonderful , believed to have a demon that was wisdom from away .
Romans were the same idea , but they called the sort of spirit without a genius .
which is great , because Romans didn &apos;t think that a particularly intelligent .
And they thought that a genius was this kind of entity divine that was created literally in the walls of a study , a little bit like the Dobby , and that was like Dobby , and he came out to hidden the work of the artist and model the result of that work .
Here &apos;s what it &apos;s going to be -- that &apos;s the distance of which is the distance of psychological that protected from from the results of your work .
And everybody knew that was so that it was , right ?
So the antic artists were protected by certain things , like the too much narcism , no ?
If your work was excetional , you couldn &apos;t take all the way , they all knew that was helped by this genius .
If your job , it wasn &apos;t all care all crazy , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be an incapable .
And so people han concept creativity in the West for a long time .
And then Rinaaxy came and all changed , and nacize this great idea ; we put the human being at the middle of the universe on the misterring and and no longer and leaving to the creatures that wrote from divinity .
This was the principle of human principle and people began to think that creativity was completely from the hydle .
And for the first time in history , he started to referring this or that is like to a kind of rather than a person with genius .
And I have to say , I think it was a big error .
I think that allowed someone , a simple person to believe that as a recipient , as a source , and the source of all the divine , creative , unknown and ethernal and ethernal responsibility to give the psychc fragile human .
It &apos;s how to ask someone to enjoy the sun .
Deform and completely draw the ego and create all these expectable to the performance .
And I think it was this pression to destroy the artists in the past 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think it &apos;s , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and creative mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t sing 500 years of rational thinking about a 18 minutes .
And there is probably people between the audience that there was a scientific legitimate , income of the known , and they follow people to turn the following people by by putting successful .
Probably not to convince you all on this thing .
But the question I would like to ask is -- why not ?
Why don &apos;t you think that way ?
Because it has more sense of all the other thing that I &apos;ve ever heard to explain the exasperant impredicbility of creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever ever have been trying to do something -- so , basically , all here -- knows , you know , you don &apos;t behave .
And in fact , it can be completely paranormal .
I &apos;ve done this recently , with the extraordinary poeted Ruth Stone , who now now now 90 years , but it was a poetic to the lives and said to me that during his childhood in the Virginia , working out in the field , and he heard it , in the country was from the landscape .
She told me that it was like a train of air .
And that was rolating towards the landscape .
He heard him to be able to be under his feet under the land under his feet .
She knew he had one to do that point and it was to do that point and he was , he running like a math . &quot;
And so he was walking up to home and then he was walking up to this poem , and it wouldn &apos;t have to get a piece of paper and a faster , and it would take it and shirt it on the page .
Somce of three times he couldn &apos;t be fast , so correct and correct and correct her and roled through the home and the poetry was going to get into the house and she would keep through the landscape , and she would keep through the landscape , and he would keep roll the landscape , and he would keep it up up to the landscape and the poet it would keep it back to the landscape and poetry and then the poet out and then the poetry and then the poetry
Then there were times -- this won &apos;t never size it -- I won &apos;t never size -- there were moments where they were almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and it was looking for the paper and the poem past through , and he would go through , and he was going to be spending , and he said , that as if he hallunglad and the hunt .
He had the poem from the tail and put it in his body and put it in the page and he had page to the page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be presented to the perfect page and intatta , but the contrary to the first one .
So when I heard it -- I was crazy , it &apos;s exactly the same thing to my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conducture .
I &apos;m a mulo , and my way of working is ; I woke up to the same horarian every day and work and go on and work and go on it and go on it .
But even I had a testardaggin , I stripped against that thing , sometimes .
And I imagine that many of you in the han done .
You know , even though the work and ideas came to me , and ideas were given by a certain source I won &apos;t know it .
What is this ?
And how can we relate to it in a way that we don &apos;t make us lose heads ?
And as I was about , the best example , the best example I have is the musician that I have been a lot of time ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of the life was the incarbon of the artist toward , and trying to control , to try to control , tomorrow these species of totally interiorbed .
But then he was invented , and one day as he was driving on a pallowing in Los Angeles , changed all for him .
He was going to fast and all of a seventually a little bit of melody , which comes to his head in his head as the inspiration , and the hall-high , and the wants , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the desider , but not knows how to take it .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , has no matter , it doesn &apos;t have a recorer .
So he starts to feel this species of old anxiety of anxy grow in him , and I &apos;ll remarried by this charge song .
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of going to the panic , he stopped .
He went to the whole process and did something completely new .
And he just watched the sky and said , &quot; Scause , not see that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Do you look like that writing a song now ?
If you really want to be able to a more than a time when I can take care of you .
Otherefore , you go to important something else today .
You know , Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his process has been working after this .
Not the work , it was still hoscure as always .
But the process , and the anxy anxy that was regioned when he took the genius , the genius that was out of him caused to nothing else and liberything else and liberry it back from the way , and I walked back to where he came , and returned out .
but it was a powered this peculiar , wonderful collaboration between Tom and this strange thing that was not Tom .
So , I heard that story started changing a little bit of how I was working , and he saved to me once .
This idea , he saved when I was writing , &quot; Manat , and falling in one of those car of the disperation where we &apos;re working on something and we &apos;re working on something and we &apos;re working on something and we can &apos;t start thinking that that will be the worst book , which is going to be the worst book , which is going to be the worst book .
Not just burn , just the worst book wrote .
And I started thinking about themselves to throw this project .
But then I remember Tom talked about the air and I tried to the air and try .
So I went up my face in the hoscritt and I gave my comments to a corner of the room .
And I said to a high voices , &quot; Sent , what , we know that if this book won &apos;t be brilliant to be not really short my , no ?
Because as I can see me I &apos;m going to put all I have , not more than that .
So if you want to be better , you have to show you and make your part .
Okay . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , you don &apos;t do it .
I &apos;m going to writing the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to do for my havor and hours of my part , &quot; because of the way , &quot; because it &apos;s so , OK -- it &apos;s secrecorded to the Africa of North ? People were dancing for the people would have been danced to the dancing of hours , and until the damage of hours to the alstuff .
And they were always magnific , because the balerini were professionals and they were great .
But every time , I rarely , something happened , and one of these artists were actually transcendent .
And I know what I talk , because I know you &apos;ve all seen it , at a certain point , a performance so .
It was like if the time he stopped , and the dancer walking through a kind of brought and wasn &apos;t doing anything from the usual , as 1,000 notes before , but all the time , it was going to be walking .
And suddenly , as a human .
But it happened from the divinside and under the divinity .
And when this happened to , to the time , people knew what was , called him with her name .
They were conged to the hands and started to dogo , &quot; Allah , Allah , God , Allah , God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Curious night -- when the Momorororic Momorororic Spain , took this habits and pronounded it changed in the centuries from &quot; Allah , Allah , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; the words , &quot; you can still hear in the flow .
In Spain , when an artist did something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , , the Alah , magnific , Allah , magnific , etches , etchches , etching God .
And it &apos;s great because we need it .
But , the problem comes the day after , to the dancer , when you wake up and discovered that are the 11 of Martedesday and the last day , and I &apos;ll score it from the morning of God is no longer .
It &apos;s just a death with a lot of bad to the ginocky , and maybe not to be able to get the height .
And maybe no one nambody &apos;s name God as well as it &apos;s a road , and what does with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most sweeter recognciliations to make a creative life .
But maybe not to be so angoscil you can &apos;t believe , though you can &apos;t believe , ancutt , that the most expected things of your own being come from you .
But it just believed that you get data data in a unimaginable , from the inimaginable to this square part of your life that you have to go to something else when you &apos;re finished .
And , you know , if we think it &apos;s all changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s certainly how I thought it for a lot of months in the book that public book that public , dangerous , spavoid , so I was a very successful , spective , I was a very successful succeed .
And what I have to keep me when I hear , I fear electrized by this is , not going to be fear .
Don &apos;t travel . It just just your work .
Continuates to presented you for your part , any one can be .
If your job is baling , bat .
If the wine , absurd , assigned to leave some kind of wonderful kind of wonderful wonderful , for one moment through your efforts , then &quot; Ole ! &quot;
Although , you &apos;re the same dance .
And &quot; Ole it ! &quot; You know .
I think , and I think you have to teach it .
&quot; You go . &quot; She , just for the same as well as well as a human and testardagges that you &apos;re going to present you keep in the pattern .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : June Cohen !
How you know I talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what it can mean and discovery new genes of genes .
Now we &apos;re starting a new perspective : we started to digitalize biology and now to start from that digital code we &apos;re going to a new biologist , designing and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing .
We always tried to ask big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists , I think they &apos;ve been trying to figure out of the levels .
We tried a different approaches , reducing it to mines .
We &apos;re digitizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was going to go from the analog world of the digital world of the digital world .
Now , we can regenerate life , or create a new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome of the smallest genome of the smallest genome .
And we tried to reduce the genome of them to create a little bit more smaller .
We &apos;re able to eliminate a hundred genes about 500 of the 500 that are here .
But when we take a look at his metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple than our .
Cretemes , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this can bring to a living cell .
So we decided that the only way that the only way to synthesize this croms in a way that we could modify the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of the adventure of the crowd ? &quot;
Can the chemistry to produce these great molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create before now ?
And in case , we can make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of inert chemical material chemical material .
The speed that we can digitize life is growing to be exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , rather lently , but it &apos;s better .
And our most recent recent retakents bring it to a exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process process has requires , starting with a bioethical review before the first experiments .
But we discovered that DNA is very difficult .
There are thousands of thousands of thousands of machines in the world producing little DNA , of 30 to 50 letters and it &apos;s a process , the most errors is longer , the most errors there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these fragments and correcting the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , to start to start from digital information of the genome of Phi &apos;s genome of Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , actually , the correction of the mistakes and optened a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material chemical material chemical material and insert it in the bacteria , the bacteria have started to read this genetic and producurn the viral particles .
The viral particles have been region from the cells , they &apos;re back and destroying the Eleci . There are .
I talked about recently with members of oil industry and say that they have certainly compress this model .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build his hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the biggest things .
We wanted to build the entire battery of the bacteria .
They &apos;re more than 580 thousetc code .
So we thought we could build it in the size of the viruses , so that we could change the cassette to understand what the casses are components of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accuracy standard was a mile for every 10 thousand basic .
We found out , requency , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence , we would never be able to do that work .
One part of the process is to design segments in 50 letters that have been to design in all the other size of 50 letters to build smaller sub-letters to build smaller sub-up .
We &apos;re going to get unexactly until here .
You probably read that we put the floor of the grains .
Think about it : we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , GG and T.
Three of those letters together , about 20 ammines , and there &apos;s a specific order of letters for every ammind .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frasuit , frasues .
What we did is that we &apos;ve done is to do it .
Some have been deluses from the fact that it wasn &apos;t poem .
We designed these segments to simply join to just join them .
There are enzymes that are repair .
And we started to assembly , starting with the segments from five to seven thousand letters , unclear segments of 24 thousand letters to get to 72 thouseter-up to 72 thoughts .
Every step , we made these segments in abundance , so that we can sequenced by making a date process that we &apos;re trying to create a very robb-stof-stof-like , you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems the tabellon of a basketer playoff .
When we get to these very long segments , more than 100 middle , more than 100 middle , they will not grow in E. coli .
It comes to the limit of modern tools of molecular biology .
So we &apos;ve considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called the Mechanism , which in biology has to go to repair the DNA to can get the segments .
Here &apos;s an example .
This is organism , called Deinococcus , can make three million rad rad .
You can see in the high record as his croms come destroying .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s reassembly , as before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can completely get .
They can live under vacuum .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life exists in space , and you move to new environment crows .
Actually , NASA showed that this happens .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built by using these processes , simply using the design appropriate segments to inserious segments to inserious .
The lievil absembly .
This is not taken to a electronic microscope , but with a microscope of a regular cope .
It &apos;s a very big molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that cover a six seconds .
This is the advertising we did a little bit ago .
They &apos;re more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It &apos;s the biggest molecule of a defined structure that &apos;s ever created by man .
It has a weight molecular hours at 300 million .
If we stammed it with a career 10 without spaces , it would just take 142 pages to just transmitting this genetic code .
Now , how do we do it work ? How can we active it ?
Of course , you know , you can have a virus is a game from kids .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when you use battery .
It &apos;s more simplest when it &apos;s cells as well as it is as the nucleus , you can just extract the nucleo and put it out of the nucleo and put another , which is practically the process of cloning .
In the bacteria , the harchaea is integrated integrated inside the cell , but we just showed that we can do a traphic trape of a croma from a cell to one and activate it .
We got a crowd chromosome from a microbial species .
The two are different as the men from the topes .
We &apos;ve added some gene in more way that we decide what he would choose for this croms .
The class then with the full full full the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was study -- and you &apos;ll opening our graphic graphic -- the new croma -- the new croma , went into the cell .
And we began to think we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried anyway in the later there .
This is one of the most evolution .
We found that many new species have added a second or a third or a third or a third of new , adding in a second thousands of new , the species of that .
So who think about evolution as a gene at the time , it has no matter of the biology .
There are enzymes called &quot; &quot; restrial &quot; that addiction that they digerize DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell .
The cellula-chromosome that we have inserito-her-has .
It &apos;s expressed , and recognized the other croms like the extraneous material , and has masticated it , and we found it with just the cell and the new croms .
it has become blue because of the genes that we &apos;ve inserious .
And in a short llassified , all the characteristics of a species have gone up to a new species , based on the new software that we put in the cell .
All proteins have changed , membranes have changed , and when we read the genetic code that is exactly what we transfer .
Now , this might look like genetic altering , but altering DNA software , we can change things in a way .
Now , I &apos;ve been explained that here is not talking about genesis -- but of progress to go from three million years and a half years of evolution , and I &apos;ve already said that we &apos;re going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty obvious when we think about our need .
We &apos;re going to pass six and a half billion people to nine billion in the next 40 years .
Just to give you an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one existing in 1946 , there will be four .
We &apos;re having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medicinal and gas for six and a half billion people .
It &apos;s still going to be more given to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion barrasses , more than 30 billion barrasses .
That means a half million barrasses a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of processes to replaced them , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to convey of the entire emission of CO2 from these materials that ends up in the atmosphere .
At the day , because of the scientific discoveries all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the design components for the future .
The electric industry only has a dozen about a dozen about the components , and how many different things come out .
Our limits here are mainly data from biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , by these these synthesids of synthesization , that we call combined genomics .
We can build a big robot that can make a big robot that can produce a million crobot .
Think about these 20 million genes or try to try to make the processes of to try to produce the processes to produce optimize the processes to produce optimize , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biological biology , and create more biology .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemistry or carbon , chemistry or charcoal , production vaccines .
This is an instantly of some of the software program about being able to sit us and design species to the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know necessarily how they will be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
Now we &apos;re focusing on the charcoal of how quarter generation .
You &apos;ve seen that you extract ethanol from the grain was a bad finished finished .
We have carbon of second and third generation that will use enough from the sugar to the carbon of the highest value as the opan or different types of butanol .
But the only way that biology can have a great impact without more more than food and limited the cost of food and limiting the food and the availability would be to transform CO2 in matter , and we think of the cell that they can reach this scale , and we think we could have the first carbon , and we think we could have the first carbon of the food generation in about 18 months .
The solar solar combined with CO2 is a methodownload -- but in our discoveries all over the world , we found different metodd .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It &apos;s in the deep ocean , about 2500 feet of deep at the temperature of the water temperature of the water .
It &apos;s methane from CO2 by CO2 by using hydrogen as a source of energy .
We &apos;re trying to figure out if we can incanalt CO2 , which can be transported through the CO2 in carbon , converting that CO2 in carbon , to drive this process .
So we can short think that we could be able to increase what the question of the basis that what the basis that life is Not , we have the modest modesk to replaced the whole obian industry to replate the whole oil industry .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can you do that ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working on to use the same methods to create vaccines .
You saw this year with influence , we &apos;re always forever about a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s going to find the right vaccine .
I think that &apos;s changing combinable vaccines in anticipated vaccines .
Here &apos;s how the future could start seeing , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria , and finally , archail , and eventually cells .
We &apos;re so much from better .
Our purpose is to make a long enough to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to make it . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show , the most of the most of work , some fundamental work , of the new technology that we brought to Microsoft in the followed to a nearly year ago . This is Seadragon .
It &apos;s a environment where you can interact is at the local level that remote with a tremendous amount of visual data .
Here we &apos;re seeing a lot of digital pictures of digital pictures with a kind of digital zoom , and I continue , to a panoramic speed , and I &apos;m going to images as we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these collections are all these collections or images .
Most of these are common pictures , but this is a scanning of the Congress , but this is a scanning of the Congress , and reentrepreneurs in the gamma of 300 megapixel .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that you can limit the presents of a system like this is the number of floating in your screen in any moment . It &apos;s a very flexible architecture .
This is a whole book , you don &apos;t have a book of images .
This is the Dickens . Every colonnine , the column is a capital .
To show you that it &apos;s just about the textbooks and not images , we can make something like that , to see that it &apos;s really a real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a book electric book .
I don &apos;t have to advice it .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s a number of the Guardian .
Every big picture is the beginning of a seition .
And it really gives you the pleasure and beautiful experience of reading the version of a magazine or a day or a day , which is for nature a lot of median .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the Guardian .
We created a high-resolures fashion -- much higher than what uses usually is usually in a published -- and we put you on the extra contain .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even specific specific .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that means to put the pop-up and other cheries and other challenge , no more like , they should not be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not , I want to lose time , if we don &apos;t say that we have contribute to this field .
These are all the streets in the United States , on the NASA , on the NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually actually from the website on the web ; you can see it .
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research on , very interesting computer that was a very interesting computer that was a student in Washington , with the help of the University of Washington , with the help of Steve Seitz Microsoft Research . It &apos;s a very high collaboration .
And it &apos;s from the view on the web , clothing from Seadragon .
You can see that when we do this kind of pattern , where we can go from a picture to the other picture and have this kind of experience to multiple solution .
But the space of images here has actually a significance .
The high of computing have recorded these images together , so that they &apos;re recorded to the real place to the real place where the imaging of the real basic . And all the close to the Great Montagne Roccioes on Montagne Roccious Montagne Roccious -- they &apos;re scacross . So this drillages of a slide sten stable level .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more space .
I want to go to one of the original set of Noahes -- and this is from a precedent prise of Photosynth prototype of Photosynth prototype of Photosynth , which is what I think is really the key behind the technology , Photosynth . And it &apos;s necessarily not so much high-watching environments that we have put in the website .
We had to worry about the legal aspects and so on .
This is a rebuild of Nothers of Nothers from Flickr . Bast &apos;s digitating Nothers , and you get images of types and you get images of types and so on . Each one of these cones a phony that &apos;s discovered . Each one of these arancion a picture that &apos;s discovery appearing .
So , they &apos;re all images from Flickr , and they were all connected to space in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this very simple way .
You know , I wouldn &apos;t have thought to finish working for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratificant to receive this kind of account here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of different types of focused on the phone , from those of the professional phone to the professional , put together in this environment .
And if I can try to try to look at the strange .
Most of it , etc .
Somewhere there is a series of photographs -- eccules .
This is a Nothers of Nothers , right now .
We can go from the poster to the view of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social social environment . This is taking data from a hot memory of how the Earth , from the whole collective vision -- and connection , and connected all those data together .
All of those pictures have been connected , more than the parts of the parts .
You have a model of the entire land .
Think about this as a prolungation of the Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as people use it , and the people use it , and the advantages to increase it .
Their pictures are married by other people .
If someone comes to the idea of contrassigning all of these saying the name , my picture of Nothers of Nothers of Nothers of the data , and I can use as a point of inground , and I can use as a point of ingravef to the space , and I use the picture of the kind of cross-like class , and have a social experience of the kind of cross-cycle .
Of course , a consequence of all of this virtual models of all the interesting thing that is that we have been able to the planet , not only from from the airplanes and from satellitarian images and from the himself , but the collective memory .
Thank you very much .
CA : What you can do ? What you understand ? What your software will have to do is that somewhere in the next few years , all the photographs shared by the next few years , all the photographs shared ?
BA : Yes . What &apos;s actually doing is what it &apos;s doing is actually going to find .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of images .
What becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of seeing information that many of these images .
As when you have a research of images on the web , you get a phrase and the head page has a lot of information about the picture .
Now , what if that picture is going to all your picture ?
So , the amount of interconnection and the amount of wealth of wealth that is really enormous . It &apos;s a classical effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really incredible . Computers .
BA : I thank you very much .
One of the main pleasers when you travel and one of the ethnographic research is the power to live between who have not forgotten the past of the wind , the past the past in the wind , the past the past in the wind .
Bastes thinking that the Jaguar &apos;s still beyond the Maday , or that the Make , or that the Milky of Inuit are still still connected , or that in Himalaya , the buddget of the Dharm , to remember the central importance of the central central of the anthropology , and the world that the world that we live in the world which we live in the world that we live in the world which we live not exist , but it &apos;s just a very much ,
the consequence of a particular choices of adaptative choices that our stirles has done , well .
And of course , we all share the essential .
Everybody . Everybody is .
We are subjects at the beginning of initiation .
We need to death the inexorability of death , so it doesn &apos;t surprising us if we stop and ballisten .
We all have an art .
What it &apos;s the particular is the rhythm of the song , the rhythm of all culture .
Not matter that they are the Penan forests of Borneo , or the followed the followed of the Haiti , or the warriers of Kaisut , or the Kairs , the Ande , or a cameleras in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my journey in the desert a month ago , or a hallevator of yak in the valley of the Everest , on the Everest , the My My My Man , the My My My My .
All of these people teach us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And if you reflect a second , it &apos;s a concept that it can give you hope .
Insit , the cultures of the world create a spiritual life and cultural life and cultural life that has the planet and it &apos;s important for the planet , and it &apos;s important for the planet as a biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural girl as a nosphere , and you can define ethnosphere , the sum , dreams , history , , under , inspirations , inspirations , inspirations , inspirations , from the human imagination from the human imagination from the human imagination from the human imagination .
Ethnosphere is the fantastic patrimony of humanity .
It &apos;s the symbol of what we can be in and what we can be in how inquisitive .
And because the biosphere was graved by the way , as well has happened to the ethnosphere and unfortunately .
Nobody biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all the species was on the summit of simply because it &apos;s false , or the most -- in the most apocalytic diversity -- and in the field of biological diversity -- and you don &apos;t have a little bit of hypothesis the most of the hypothesis .
The index of all that is , of course , the lost language .
When you were born there 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only composed by a vocabulary or from a series of rules .
A language is the basic of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the medium of every culture is coming in in the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a thought , a thought , an ecosystems of spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re here at Monterey , at least the half is not sussurrounded in the ears of children .
They don &apos;t come from the children , the means , which means , not to wonder that you won &apos;t wonderful something , which are already dead .
What is there more sad than being happened by the silence , of being the last to talk to a language , the last to talk to a language , not to transmit the wisdom or to anticipate the promise ?
This is a phery of somewhere in the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks , and he brings with it in the tomb of the last few weeks of a ancient language .
And I know somebody who will say , &quot; Isn &apos;t that better ?
The world wouldn &apos;t be a better place if we &apos;re all talking about the same language ? &quot; We all talk all the same way . We talk all the same way .
Let &apos;s talk .
You &apos;ll take a trat what it means is not to talk to your language .
I &apos;d like to do you a journey through eded ethnosphere --
a little journey in the ethnosphere to give you a massive of what we &apos;re losing .
Most of us forgotten that when I say , &quot; I really mean , &quot; I mean , I mean , &quot; I really mean , I mean ,
Take for example this Barasana &apos;s bimmbo in the centrion , the population of anaconda , which believe the people of the high latt of the latte of the latte of the walk of the slatt saces .
It &apos;s a population that &apos;s not able to distinguish the blue color because the blue color because the time of the forest , which depends the population that it depends the population .
They have a strange language and a major regle , deterrible , determine , &quot; , you have to move a person who talk to a person who talk about a different language .
All of this has gone in the mythological past , yet the particularity is that in these extbasic matrimons , in seven or languages to be talking about or seven languages no languages .
They just just listing to listen and start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived , the Waoran Ecuador of Ecuador Eastern Ecuador , an incredible people who had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five measuring a connection that was a commersting in a convenient connection .
They &apos;ve done from the high-scending photographs that retrading them in a poses who had gone , forgotten that this population had never seen anything that has never seen anything in the bi-dimensional .
They &apos;ve collected the pictures of the land , they turned them to the research of a form or a figure , and not find anything , and they killed the fell , and killed the five missionaries with the lance .
But Waorans not just killed the stranieters .
They were killed to them .
54 percent of mortality was caused by them .
We &apos;re sitting at eight generations and found two cases of death , and when we insisted to know , they have seen that one of them was aging , and then they kill him the same . And then they kill it out . And then they kill it out .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine from 40 steps and recognizes the species .
In the first &apos; 80s , I was assigned a very interesting tassigned when my professor of Harvard , asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to Haiti to introduce in the basis of the power of Dualier and Tonton Macououched , and imposed me to do the bome of Dualier and Tonton Maces , and I was used to use to do the bome zome .
To give a sense of miraculous , I should have to understand the Vodoun culture and that Vodoun &apos;t nermagic .
It &apos;s a pretty good thing about a complex meth-to-physical vision of the world .
Very interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesime , Islam , Buddddged , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that Africa has no religious feeling has no religious feelings . And he did it , and the Voodoo is not the distilled of these religious concepts of the naked in the tragic driving tragic driving tragic diaspora .
What makes interesting is the intense is the intense between life and death .
So , the people are born .
And the spirits can be invoded by the Great Aqua , they answer the dance of the dance and replaced themselves to the animates of the living in a short actile that is the goes .
So , the voodoohisti love to say , &quot; white you go to wonder to talk about God .
We &apos;re going to start in the temple and become God . &quot;
And from the moment that you &apos;re going to sitting , is the spirit that you , how can you do the bad ?
So you have to these incredible events : followed voodoo in state of the trance of trance that touches infugee in the state of mind , when it &apos;s catalyzed in the body state of the mind when it catalyzed it &apos;s catched in a state of extremely exciting .
The people with the most amazing people who lived the most extraordinary Kogi of the Sierra Nevada Marta , in the Sierra Nevada Marta , in the sectors .
Discendming of the ancient civity , who was lived on the carairs of the Colombia in the conquist , the population was going to be on the massicro-vulcle .
In a drug continent of blood , this population has never been conquered by the spagners .
And that &apos;s now now , I &apos;m governed by clering , but their formation is really amazing .
The young people who are brought away from the families to three or four years , and they live secret in a world made of a good hombers and shombers in the basic .
Two periods of nine years of proposed to reproduce the nine months of gestation that transmit into the user of mother , now are metaphor of the Great Mther .
And so this time , they are acculated to the values of their societies , values that predicting their prayers and just their prayers the cosmic balance -- or for the balance -- or for the balance .
At the term of this incredible initiation , they &apos;re improvising brought out and for the first time , 18 years , they see a health of the first basic basic evolences of the first basic blowers , when the sun the buts of the beauty , and the beautiful ads , all that they have learned in the theoretical prize . The pret passionate a step behind and says , &quot; The pret passionate the forth and says ,
&quot; Go you ? Proprize how I said .
It &apos;s just a study . Now it &apos;s going to protect it .
They &apos;re called the most of them and say that we , the miners , the miners of the world .
This is an intuition is extremely important .
When we think of indeed populations and the environment of Rousseau and the old story of the knowledge of the non-known history , and it &apos;s a razy concept of the things are closer to the Earth .
Indigenes are not not sentimental sentimental sentimal .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the Apaludium , or in the winds of the Tibet , but because of the time and the rhythank you , created a mystic intuition of the Earth , not on the concept of the concept of the world &apos;s untotal intuition .
What does that mean ?
Voice , that a guy of Ande who grows up to create that mountain is a spirit of Apu is a spirit of a human being depped and it will have a very different rationship with the mountain or that place , and it will have a different mountain , or that place that place that place that place that is going to be screplied .
which is the dimora of a spirit or a mineral cave is irrelevant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Britannica Columbia creding forests to be cut .
And that made me a different human being different from my friends from Kwakiutl who believe that forests are the forests of Huk &apos;s dimora of the paradise and the history of the paradise and the cannibs that live in the world , and the cannibs that are in the Hamatsa .
If you start to consider that these cultures can create reality different realities , you can start to understand some of them discoveries .
I took this picture to open up in the noroccidest noroccid-care .
Mayahuge of you have heard about the Eahubash , the most powerful suspity of the repertory .
What makes the fascinating the Ehubasn &apos;t the potential pharmacological potential pharmacological potential of the sustaining .
From a hand , this lian league of a carboline , harming and harming , harming and harming , slightly .
Taking the only plants , you have a little bit of a blux-to-up , and it conscience , but it &apos;s myself with the leaves of the coffee family of coffee family of coffee family of the coffee .
This is a little triptamines , very similar to the serotonin the serotonin the serotonin , methoxydimethoxyltryptamine-five , methods .
If you ever see Yanomami to tyrare on for the sushance of sushance , which is methods are methoxyltryptams .
Tiring that watching on the nose is a little bit like being dispared by a fixed fuel dippit and land on a move of electricity . Don &apos;t believe a distorsion of reality .
I was often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who took the craft was psychedelic , with his discovery of the covered fungi in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s in the &apos; 30s .
And the tese tripptese can &apos;t class these tripptamines because if you &apos;re doing not telling any of being killed . You can &apos;t tell anybody to be absoluted . Don &apos;t allowed . And the triptampes can &apos;t be abuntil of the enhouse , because they are actually inossidasis , of course , as a mythoxy-aminoxygen .
It &apos;s possible absolutely possible to be abuntil other chemicals that denaturing MAO .
Now it &apos;s the beautiful : the carboline , that are inhibitors of MAO , the same kind of needs to be able to potentile triptames . The question of a spontaneous , in a 80,000 species of plants , as they make these people find died dies of them , and how these are these people who are deaf died , but that if you combined in this way , create a little version of the parts ?
We use the great eufemism of the prova and the mistake , which can reveal ins .
But if we ask the Indians will say , &quot; The plants are talking about it . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 varieties of Ehubase , which is network of our eyes would return into the same species .
If we ask him how they &apos;re going to say , &quot; I said , &quot; I thought I would say , &quot; I thought understood plants , you don &apos;t know everything ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you get 17 varieties in a notice of the moon and each one &apos;s going to get with a different .
With this is not a lot of Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than to count than to contact press .
Now , &#91; applauses &#93; the problem is that also that the people who have to have the heart people who have the history of the history of the history of the history of the history of the history of our real world , and it beyond .
In fact , the 20th century , 300 years , it will not remember for his wars or innovations , but rather as the age where we stop and and abuntil the thing we stop and actively actively or accepted , or accepted the masses of biological diversity and cultural distriction of the planet . Now the problem is not change .
All cultures through centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibility of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians have no stopped to be Sioux when they put up , and they have been horse and received as Americans have no stopped to be Americans when they put from the horse and health .
It &apos;s not the change or the technology that threatening the integrity of eetnosphere .
The wall of the domination .
And if you look at the world , you &apos;ll discover that these are not destined cultures .
They are living and dynamics out of the identifiable forces from the identifiable forces to their adaptation of adaptation .
And it &apos;s what it is to the wind in the patria of Penan --
a population of Sarawak , in the Sarawak , the population of the Asian Poast to a generation ago , and now reduced to a generation ago , and now reduced to the region the region of the region the region of the region the record , where you can see the physician to the Malasian Cinese Morbir. where the hdigonte horizoom , where the Japan , the horizonte horizonte , where you can see the
you take the staff stives with the wood .
Or in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that have come with the discovery of the gold .
If we move on the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the flight of the political domination .
As you know the genocide , the physics of a population , is condanted at the universal level , but the ethnininininic of a population , not only is condanced , but cell of the development in certain environment , because it &apos;s part of the development .
And you can &apos;t understand the suffering of Tibet until you get from the beginning .
I spent the 6,000 miles from Chenger in the Western China in the Western Tibet , and came to Lhasa with a young college , but only came to Lhasa , I understand what &apos;s behind the statistics that behind the statistics that we &apos;re hearing .
6,000 feet sacred monuments in policy and centers .
1.2 million people killed from the military military during the Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was absolutely crited to the Panchoice Lama .
which means that it was killed to the time of the Chinese invasion .
Huncle was sitting with Sua Santity during the deaths that brought the people in Nepal .
His mother was imprisoned and his colpa was to be reciciles .
It was brought to hidden in the age of two nervous years of hidden , because it wouldn &apos;t have lived without .
The sister , who did the same , was put it in the field of reeducation .
A day has inavverted a day , a Mao coffign Mao and , for this transgression , was put forced to work for seven years .
The Tibet can be insationship , but the redeship of the people are taking taking .
At the end , all of the things that &apos;s going to a choice .
We want to live in the world &apos;s world , or we want to take the policycroomatic world or we want to take the policycle of diversity ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he said that his biggest fear was that in our largest fear was that in our lives of the world , not just see the whole whole whole ama limited limited of the human imagination , but a day a day we wake up to a modality of thinking , but a day we &apos;ll wake up to the whole day that there were other possibility .
And it &apos;s humiliating our species is there for 600,000 years .
The Revolution , which has given us the agriculture , which has done us to sock the cult of the seed , and by the way , and by the poem poetry with the next to the clerarchy of the species , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The industrialized world has about 300 years .
That shark history is not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we will have to go .
When these things at the world is asked what it &apos;s like to be human , they say what it wants to be human , responding with 10,000 voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all return the chance of being what we are : a consciousness , that has to be what we are , and all the people and all the gardens can fiord . And there are great moments of optimism .
I took this picture on the north of Baffin , when I went to the island of Baffin , when I went to dalene with the Inuit , and this man , and this man , and this man , and this man , told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The canadvice was not always gentile with the Inuit and in the &apos; 50s to stabilie our source , we rhink them in colonies .
The nonake this man was going to go .
The family , templting him to his life , brought him away , and all of his attracties .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn &apos;t feel the cold , they stand .
The bats of the origins were made of fish were made of fish .
The non-grandfather had no arcles from the arctic note or the blizard that was suffering .
It &apos;s gathered , it &apos;s cooked the basic patterns in the skin and defecated in its hand . When the fecks were conged , it has taken them , it &apos;s working on a mode .
He was sprurized on the points of this crows and when he became solid , and when I solid solid , he killed a dog .
He schools and created a bridge , with the actual cassa , with the actual cassa created , and he gets a sled other dog and it &apos;s short on the banchisa , and it &apos;s short on the banchises .
We want to talk about hell with nothing ?
In the 1999 , the canadvice of the Does the Green Inuit , the total control of California and Texas a sive of California and Texas put together .
It &apos;s their new paths . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s a independent territory . They contrict all the minerary resources .
One splendid example of how a national state can recognize with his people .
And , finally , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious at least at least at least at least to the planet , make it not remote .
Poyone is home .
They know the setions of human imagination that are up to the head of the human imagination . And for us all these children , as the dreams of the children , become part of the geography .
For finally , we are National Geographic convinced that politicians will never come to anything .
We believe that polemy --
&#91; Auses &#93; are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and perhaps we have the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month to tell stories of the world . Every month our site is that we &apos;ve been going to be 35 million visit .
156 countries have our television canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal canal .
Our reviews are seven millions from millions of people .
Our work is to travel in the ethnosphere to bring our public to wonders of wonders that they &apos;re going to get away from how they saw and , hope , hope , they will hope for the central reveal of anthropology : the world of anthropology , and we need to find a lives in a pluralists of life in a pluralistic world and multicultural world and multicultural world in a pluralist and my-life world in a world and my-ming world and melt world &apos;s lives .
where the wisdom of all the people can contribute to our collective benefit .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote about this book that I hope is going to be heard of the other things that you &apos;ve heard and I &apos;ll try to avoid some connection .
I &apos;d like to start with what I call the &quot; official dogma .
The dogm ures of what ?
The official dogm of all the Western societies . The dogma such , &quot; If we want to male the benefit of our citizens &quot; The way to do it is to male the individual liberty . &quot;
The reason is , from a side , in the fact that freedom is in itself a value , is precious , useful , for human beings .
On the other is that if we are free , each of us can act to do all the myself to do all that that maximizes our benefit , without any deciding to our benefit .
The way to mass-up freedom is to massy choice .
More people have , more choices , more free , and most of their freedom , most of their liberty , most of them is their well-being .
This is so deeply radically radicated in the society that no one would be going to be able to put it in the doubt .
And it &apos;s also deeply radical in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible possible .
This is my supermarketing . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;ve allowed a simple note on conditions .
In my supermarketing there are 175 conditions , without contying the 10 variety of oil olive oil and 12 acetes that you can buy to make you a enormous conditional conditions in the rescirecovery of the circumstance that nobody of the 175 pronce of your dediment .
Here &apos;s the supermarketing .
Then you go to the electrionic store to buy a stereo : case , the CD , the CD , radio , radio , radio , floating , amplifier .
And in this single negotial negotiate , there &apos;s a great number of audio .
We can make six and a half million different combinations of combinations using components that there are in a negotiate .
You have to admit that there &apos;s a lot of choice .
Other fields : the world of communications .
Once I was a child , you could get all the time , you could get all the services , to cut up , at the mama Bell .
It was born , it was not compressed .
A consequence of that , by the phone , was that telephone was never shomped .
These themes have gone .
Now we have a variety of phones , especially with phones , especially between the cellular .
Here &apos;s the cell phone of the future .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , cut up , cut up of the nose , and it forts for the cross .
If you don &apos;t have seen it in the store under the house , you &apos;re certain that soon will be .
And what happens is that people get into the stops and make this question . And you know what the answer is ? The answer is &quot; No .
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cellular things that doesn &apos;t do too many things .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the aquarters of choices , and it would be the same explosion of choices .
Assistence : Assistence : not happens in the United States that you go from the doctor and doctor doctor what you have to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; OK , we could do , or B , &quot; To has these benefits , and these goods . &quot;
You said , &quot; Doctor , what should I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; At these benefits and these risks , and these often benefits and these risks . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebats , &quot; Doctor she was , what would it do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result that we call it &quot; autonomy of the malseem , &quot; expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not that a weight and responsibility to make decisions from someone who knows something , which is the doctor , someone else who doesn &apos;t know -- and almost certainly , and then in the condition to the patient condition to the patient patient .
There &apos;s a great drug of drug products , direct to people like me and you , that if you think about it doesn &apos;t sense , because we can &apos;t buy them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why are they public ?
The answer is that they want to say that we call the doctor to change the recipe to change it .
Something that is how our horever is our horever is a question of choice , as you see in this junk . &quot; We don &apos;t want to provide children . Scear their sex . They will herited their sex .
And we can reinvented how many times we get us .
which means that every morning , to the risve-up , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I spoke to family and marriage , and the maybe a common , seven-conversation , almost for anyone , was that you could have the most soon as possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , not even when , not even what to do after .
Ogyday , it &apos;s really to play .
I teach to a very intelligence , and I do the 20 percent of work in less than a time .
And not because they &apos;re not smart , because they &apos;re not not smart diligent .
but why are I impensiery , intents to ask , &quot; I would like to move or not ? &quot;
&quot; Do I must go more later ? I have to think before kids or career ? &quot;
They are logorant .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this implica not to completely get the companies and not get a good vote to my exor .
And they have to do it . They have to do it . They &apos;re important .
Now , the work : we &apos;re lucky , as Carl underolineating , because technology allows us to work every day , every day , from Hotel Randolph .
For the parentesis , there &apos;s a angolin , and I &apos;m not going to say anybody , where where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t say that , because I want to use it .
What does it mean , this incredible freedom of choice that we have about the work ? It &apos;s that we have to keep on on the work ? It &apos;s going to be not .
We can go to our son play , and the cell phone in a pocket , Blackberry in a pocket , Blackberry , on the ginockny .
And even though they &apos;re all spending , every minute that we see our son , we also see our son , we also ask , &quot; Do I answer to this called ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? I have to get this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is no , it makes the experience of the partite of your son &apos;s partite of your son &apos;s partank of the partners .
So , from any of the little thing we look at , small and great , and big things , and life is a choices , life is a choices .
Once the world was this : Over , there were some possibility , but it wasn &apos;t a choice of choice .
The world today is a dilemma is , &quot; Is it is , &quot; Is it &apos;s a positive thing ? &quot;
The answer is Shot .
The positive lacs all of them , so I &apos;m going to talk about that negative ones .
All this choice is two effects of two effects of the people .
The first paralysis that produced paralysis that it &apos;s a liberation .
And many of the options that choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I &apos;m offered you an example , a study conduct on the plans of volunteer .
A colleague has access to the data of Vanhead , the giant societies of the sourcing companies in 2,000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of adesion , the percentage of two percent .
With 50 funding to offering , there &apos;s 10 percent unless than the adesions of it as they are available to only five . Why ?
Because with 50 funding between which choose , is sick , it &apos;s sick to decide , and the choice is returned to the indomorders .
And domorders , domorders , domorders , domorders , and of course , domorders , and of course not come .
You know , not just that means that these workers are going to eat food because they &apos;re going to hand-hand because they &apos;re not going to say that the decision is so obstic that they also lose the complaining fundamental femental .
Not to participating , they &apos;re losing until five dollars per year from the work , which would be willing to be going to be going to be going to be .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think that makes the world so .
&quot; And finally , for the eternity : ketchup , or mayonese ? &quot;
Would you like to take the just decision , if it &apos;s about eternity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the bottom , and neppure the wrong conditioned .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even though we can avoid paralysis and make a choice , we ended up with less options of how we would be with less options that they would be with less options .
And that &apos;s a different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of condents , which is that you choose one and it &apos;s not perfect , and it &apos;s not perfect , is easy to imagine that you could have a better choice that would be better . And what happened is that alternative imagined us to get a little bit better . And what happened is that the alternative imagined us , and the replant replant , and the replant defens from the decision , and the replant ground , and the sweetness of the decision ,
even when it was a very good decision .
More choices are more easy to displeasy of any detail of choice that is insodenting of choice .
And also , there &apos;s what economists call cost-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has asked a lot of stamateues like the value that we depend on .
In the rest , when there are so many possible , it &apos;s easy to represent the characters of alternative alternative scared and be less satives of the option that is choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m just sure with all of the New York .
But that &apos;s what you would probably think .
There &apos;s this copy of the Hamptons .
A place of lussive .
It &apos;s beavy bad . Otype of the day . It &apos;s all for them .
Nothing . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , maledition , is Agost . &quot;
&quot; All my neighbors are away . &quot;
&quot; I could talk about home . &quot;
And he passes two weeks broads from the idea that &apos;s losing -- every day -- the possibility of walking where it wants .
The construction is the constitution of the connection that we have , even when choice was eccellent .
And the more of the options that we have to consider , the more equivalent characteristics will return up against as a contain .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
It &apos;s about the time , and maybe the living slowly .
But the most important point is that any thing you choose , you choose to do other .
The things that we don &apos;t choose have a lot of attractivity that can make less attractive what we do .
Tirst point : the spiral growing of the expectations .
I tried it on my skin buy a new jeans .
I &apos;m going to almost always jeans .
Once jeans were one of a one , buy them and bought them and dress , they were dissionate , just after they brought them a lot of times , they were washed to go well .
So I went to buy a couple again when that old people were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cutting . &quot; I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . &quot;
And he said to me , &quot; Who wants to fit , fit , relaxphit , relaxphit ? &quot;
He wants to the name or with non-accompnion ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; acishashed ?
&quot; Who wants ? &quot;
&quot; Sow the basic black huge or strets ? &quot; He was the bla -- &quot; Continuate to elency .
I was bordit , and after a little bit of the best , I was able to say , &quot; I want the guys that was the only guy that was , so I had all the die-sts sticks , and then I came out of the jeans , and then I went out of the best jeans I ever had .
It was the most of choice . I got the whole choice I had the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse for the whole thing is that with all of the expectations were alties , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was waiting , I wasn &apos;t wait to me . I wait to it when there was only a kind of thing , but when I saw 100 different , lacross , at least a kind of perfect .
What I was busted , but not perfect .
After I talked about that choice with what I was trying to insodently insodently in the expectations .
The addition of options in life doesn &apos;t make the expectations that have respect to the expect of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options that are .
And this will producing less satisfied , even when results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing if it makes it .
Because if they knew , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth looks like this .
&quot; It was better when it was worse when it was worse , &quot; The reason it was better when it was worse , it was even worse , you know , when it was worse you could have pressed .
Ogn the world that we live -- opulents , opulents , industrialized industrialized , the industrialized that we can hope is that the things are the height .
You never surprised to have surprised because your expectations , my expectations , they &apos;re injected .
The secret of happiness -- what you are here -- is , &quot; Basse expectation . &quot;
I mean , little self-authophic moment -- which is really moved and my wife is really stupend .
I wasn &apos;t done better , I didn &apos;t have to do .
But , not always is a bad thing is a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of buy a couple of jeans smooth , when you &apos;re just that jeans , and you say , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot; And the answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What could I do ?
When there are hundreds of types , and buy a insod-disaster , and you ask who is responsible , is the responsible , is just as clear that you .
You might have done better .
With hundreds of variety variety , there are no screen for the insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even though the result is valid , they feel unfull they &apos;re insodenting and they give them .
In the last depression is exploss in the industrialized world .
I think that a significant factor -- not the only one of the only one of this depression is just that people have experiences of depression is too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that the color is their own .
So the final result is that in general , we &apos;re better , but we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely false . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than it doesn &apos;t have it . But from this doesn &apos;t have that much better than it is better than a little bit .
There &apos;s a critical value , I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure that we have supered by a piece of the level that choices better than our life .
Now , from the politician , I &apos;ve almost finished -- from the politician , the nocle is the following .
What allows of all of this choice in the industrial societies is the material wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know about it , and you know the problem is not they have too much choice .
The problem is they have too little bit of it .
So the facility that I &apos;m talking about is a malbeing a directly disease of modern , the Western societies .
And what it does deprove and arrand is this : Steve Levitt talked about how much those expensive and seats of the car seats for wheel . It &apos;s a waste of money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and dispendependent , it &apos;s not that they are simply unuseful .
I &apos;m going to be deletered .
They &apos;re going to stay worse .
If a little bit of what our societies is reversing to the choice was reversed in those where people have too little possibility , not just their better life to better , but our life better .
This is what economists call a better paretian partian .
A redistribution of the income , and not only the poor -- not only of the poor -- because of this choice that &apos;s going to us .
And to conclude , &quot; You can become all you want to become all you want to be --
You , people , think , &quot; What does that think about the fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious that you can &apos;t get anything in a glass of glass . &quot;
&quot; A castrated imagination , a limited vision of the world -- &quot;
and I interpret it , and I interpret .
But then , I think , instead , I realized that that fish the head of the long .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you eat in the broke , so that you can &apos;t get the freedom . You can &apos;t get the freedom .
If you cut the broke so that all divent possible as possible decrease .
Accentuate the paralysis , and you reduck the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too stricken , perhaps even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the axy of some of the Sphere is a recipes of happiness and , I &apos;m teme , for the rhotter .
Thank you very much .
