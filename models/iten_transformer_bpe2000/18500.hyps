The year I showed these slide to show that the arten glaciacial glacial , which for almost three million years has had the size of the United States of the United States , it &apos;s record 40 percent .
It &apos;s a gravity of the gravity of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice of the ice .
The arten is arclearly artic is , in a sense , the pulsant cuer of global climate .
It &apos;s expanded and you &apos;re putting up .
The next slide is going to be a remarkable free of the last 25 years .
The ice lloss are signed in red .
You see , they expanding the way .
That &apos;s the ice in the winter , which rities extent .
You can see that the ice cosid-said , perenne , five years or , it &apos;s like the blood , which is how the blood , which is five years from body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been so .
This is a problem because the interested in the entire ice the latest ice of the artage of the arcycle of congent carbon congent , which , science , and they turn it into the middle of the microbes .
It &apos;s even about the totality of the atmospheric inquent ination , that quantity could radical , surgery , supersupersupersupersupersuper-hitting , supersupersuper-hythrow , super-hythrow , super-hythrow , the amount of the totality of the totality of the totality .
In some shark laghi in Alaska , the metan is already rebecting from water .
The professority Katey Walter of the University of Alaska team that was a team that was a team that latest .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : The question is well . The question is if we &apos;re going to be .
A reason is that this term scale from the north .
This is a glacial quickly .
The brought didn &apos;t reach free .
This is the Kangerlusual &apos;s Kangerlush , in the south of Greenland .
If you want to know how to be the level of the sea of the ice of the ice ice , here is where you reach the sea .
These rratic are increasing quickly .
Another part of the planet : Antarctars , the largest block of the planet .
The month scientists have diclosed that the ice of ice is in negative , and that the ice Antarctica , and the Antartica , which pographs on some islands , which pogs on some islands , is particularly quarly in the science .
Equiventers at the level of action , like in Greenland .
Sull Himalaya , the third largest block , you see new lagues , and they see new lagues were glaciers .
40 percent of the world population has been half-water of potable to the leaving water .
Sulle Anavaary : this ice is the source of the water power of this city .
The led is increased .
But when you diminishes , the same accountable to water .
In California , the snow on Sierra Nevada is diminished 40 percent .
The dries are in the crises .
The predictions , as you have license , I &apos;m favorable .
The growth of the growth in the world &apos;s download .
The environment disasters are increasing to a rhythm out of the normal and without previous .
Four times more numerous in the last 30 years of the previous 75 .
This is a whole thing about all of the sustainable .
If you look at the storytellers can see the consequences .
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 tons of CO2 , every 25 million tons -- 25 million tons of tons in the oceans every day .
Look at the area of the Indian Pacific Pacific , to the American , and on the American parts of the subcontinent , where there &apos;s a radical pattern in the oceans .
Most of global warming , together to deforestation , and it &apos;s the 20 percent , is the sile of the fossil of them .
The oil is a problem , and the charbon is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with the most emissions , together at China .
And it was proponed to build a lot of other central central central .
But we &apos;re seeing a change .
These are the annarrow in the last few years and some of alternative high-green .
And every way , there &apos;s a lotta political in our country .
The carbon of carbon and oil , they spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon , which is a hoss-clean .
And that picture me , I remember something --
Natal is Natal , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion pounds of paper scores .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the second largest flow of scories in America .
It happened around Natal .
The published published of one of the carbon was this .
I mean , &quot; Yeah , the carbon is a kind of food and happy .
It &apos;s abundant here in America , and it makes our economy .
Maybe the carbon is more and more and more lightly .
It &apos;s good precenters , adorable and work work , and they do it .
Al Gore : From here is a big part of the West Virginia .
The largest society in the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his amministrator .
Video : Don Blankenhship : I &apos;m going to be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosis , Harry Reid -- don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima Protection of Clima has two campaign .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Ator : At COALergy see the climate change as a serious mine as a serious serious mine change as a serious mine .
So , this is our priority is to invest a big amount of money in a public effort to make public and confuse the verity on the carbon .
In fact , the carbon isn &apos;t .
We think it &apos;s a good profumb .
So , not preocattens of climate change .
Let me do .
Video : Ator : Ator : Carbone -- you &apos;ve heard a lot of talk .
So let me give a gyrunning in a structure of a structure of the basic carbon .
Strads ! The machines are a little bit , but this is the sound of the technology .
The carbon of carbon is between the main causals of global warming , but the noticons of the charbasic technology .
You have a look , this is the hate technology of the carbon clean .
Al Gore : Inally , the high-up positive to the economic issue , and the national security .
Video : Commment : America is in the U.S. . The security , the national security climate crisis .
The philos that the garbage all of our dependence from fossil beautiful , as the heads and the important oil .
Now , perhaps there &apos;s a new , audace solution for using circles .
Really , 100 percent of energy , in 10 years .
A plan to repair America to make a longer than safety , and help to stop the global warming .
Finally , one solution that blows our problems .
You know , America . You know more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Commment : It &apos;s about to reduck energy .
One of the fastest ways of bring up to get up to dependence from the combustable .
Comparsa : The future is here . I feel , a new energy .
Two : Noves investment for places of ballow-retributed butters .
I feel : Rear America . It &apos;s time to be realists .
At Gore : A old proverbian old proverbian said , &quot; If you go speak , you go to speak .
If you want to go away , you go together . &quot;
We have to go away , very quickly .
Thank you very much .
The year at TED I did a feckle on the LHC .
And I promise to go back to the way to get you on how it works .
So , I five . And for those that the other time , there were no , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment , ever tented -- 27 miles of circonference .
His compit is to refer the conditions that were less than a billion second from the universe of the universe -- to 600 million times the second .
And that &apos;s just environment .
This is the machine underneath Ginevening .
We have these mini-Big Bang &apos;s inside the results .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called ATLAS -- is a 44 feet and has a 22 feet .
This is a spectacular images of ATLAS in building so you can notice the proportion .
Ten of the last time . We have accested the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was because of immense phestegs in control of control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first particle phasm that he had done all the way of LHC , and it &apos;s in collision , with a part of the LHC , and very diffon-handing in the result .
In other words , when we see that 10 secember , the picture of 10 secember , that the machine was a great vitter .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to exulse more opped this , when somebody went on Google and saw that the beginning was this .
That means we &apos;ve had a cultural impact cultural impact on that scientific .
And it was a week later , there was a problem with machine , just just to these phils here -- these dored dored .
These phils bring 13,000 ads when the machine works at the massive of power .
Now , the technical technical of you will look at the phils and say , &quot; It &apos;s not true . &quot; I &apos;m a very good . &quot;
And they can do it because when they are very cold the superconconducts become superconducts .
So , at less 271 degrees , at a perature at the way of space , these phils can bring that running .
In one of the players of the novemile of novemian magneti in LHC , there was a fest phabrication .
So the phils surprising , and 13,000 advanced , and 13,000 advanced a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think these magnets more than 20 tons , and that &apos;s got been moved by about about 30 feet , and that &apos;s moved about 30 feet .
They are damnegglets about 50 magneti .
We had to take them , what we did .
We repristints and traveled .
They &apos;re now going to go back to their sub-place .
By the end of marzo the LHC will will be again .
We &apos;re going to happen , and we expect to get the data of the data or light , and continuing so our adventure to discover what the morning to discover what the morning are universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these initions reaccounts the debate on the value of science and engineering in the frontier of the frontier of the frontier .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that we go beyond the value of things like LHC .
I &apos;d like to end with the words of an Inglese Inglese , Humphrey Davy , which , imagine , the imagine , the imagine , his pupillllo was Michael Faraday , he said , &quot; Nothing is so perangle for the progress of the human mind as the rienthemselves as the riends of the human mind as the science of the human mind that the science of the human minds , which our new months of the new tric . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start to start to rethink about when , from children , please , you play cut morning .
While you reach them and reach them , and you can get them and get them , and get them , learned to think and solve problems and solve problems to figure out of space and manipulating relationship .
The space is deeply connected to be connected to the way we understand ,
So , by information , by the usual usuity of our interaction with physics , together with my consultops , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to ask me , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of the digital , we could have just a computer , we could have a digital death with digital , could be a desktop with physically a information , we could focus a a computer with the managed physically food ,
and systemate it to our placement ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , and built the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a great computer interactive , like a biscale .
In a few words , a Siftable is a great computer interactive , like a biscale .
You can move them with the hand , they can see &quot; you can see &quot; between them , and they &apos;re a putting and a radio and a radio .
But above , I &apos;m physical objects , as the morning , you can move just further fashion .
The Siften is the example of a new ecosystem to manipulate the digital information .
And as a hand that become more physical , and the other other people , and as a move that become more physical , and they become more physical , of the other other people , how we can explore the new and fun .
I &apos;m going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configurated to show you , if incline it in a direction , the video , the video , the video , the video , the way , it will rotate out of the back .
These are interactive of interactive , are conscious .
If I call them , you &apos;re interested in what they &apos;re around .
If they come circondition , they notice it and they can agitate a little bit .
If they come circondition , they notice it and they can agitate a little bit .
They also living their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the poter to use communities , &quot; to be a liquid gestures like a liquid color as if it was a free .
In this case , we have three Siftable of the vernice , and I can use them to grew up to versation of color in that entral , where they missing .
and I can use them for greatest color in that central , where they misk .
We &apos;re going to be too , we can put a little place .
I also beautiful possibility of appresses , as the languages , mathematics and games where people can try and seeing things that are going to try and see the results of the results of immediately .
Now , I &apos;m going to do --
This is a sequence of Fibonacines that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a words of words that &apos;s half between Spabeo and Boggle .
Pratically , every turn on every Sift-literally , in any Siftable , Pratically , to every turn on every Siftable to case on every Siftable , and while you can comport it on a dionteaching .
Then , after about 30 seconds of remissing , and you have a new letters of letters and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s children came to the Lab in Media Lab , I did it and turned a video .
They &apos;re very placeased .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of education .
You just say , &quot; Compons of words , and they know what to do .
Here &apos;s what other people are trying to do .
This is our biggest biggest mountain there on the right .
It was really really really to implement them .
They were only morning .
Now , this is an application of a interactive cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of Lui &apos;s languages .
It can inserate new characters in the scene , sold the Siftable their associated associated .
It can inserate new characters in the scene , sold the Siftable their associated associated .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
Video : The sun is surprising .
David Merriled : Now he took a treator in the scene .
Video : The aranium aranm .
By work ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah !
So schooling Siftable and put closer can interact the character --
Video : Bau !
And by inventing their story .
Video : I mean , I &apos;m going to be .
DM : It &apos;s a story with the open , and it can decide him as you hear .
DM : It &apos;s a story with the open , and it can decide him as you hear .
Video : Golden , gat .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a time to show you is a recent , to wait , to wait and exeguess .
It &apos;s a recent , realized of recent , to wait and exequieting musical .
The Siftable here is against sounds like base , based and bacteria .
Every one of these has four different variations , and you can choose .
You can also also inserate these sounds in a sequence to comport your placement .
And it just to do it just putting a &quot; suit of sound and a sequence . &quot;
These are effects you can control from vive , as the reversation and the philer .
The dunclean in a particular sound and then clines to get it .
And then there are the general effects as time and volume , which they just applicate to intersequence .
We look at how it works .
Video : We &apos;re going to start with a base in two Siftable , &quot; sequence , we &apos;re doing the sequence , we add to the other base .
Now , I put a basis of the basket .
Video : Now , I add to the percussions --
Video : And I &apos;m going to put the philtery to bacteria , so I can control the effect of the view .
Video : I can speak the entire sequence inclining the entire sequence on one side or another .
Video : And I &apos;m going to add the philer to the full flower .
Video : I can remember the sequence &quot; at the sequence &quot; at the flight . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to do it , but I can try and suddenly , it makes it longer .
And now , finally , I can sfly the entire sequence inclining to the left Siftable . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new man &apos;s interface and more like , they work in how our brain are going to work and how our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the result of this perspective , and also some possibility that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmate is that &apos;s coming up this new generation of design objects to interact with digital media , that will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the hour to talk to all of you .
I &apos;m a written .
Books is my profession is , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also the love and the phrasc of my life .
And I don &apos;t expect that you can change .
But , said , this particular , something happened to my life and in my career , who bring me to recently realibrating the entire relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called &quot; Manon , &quot; which , &quot; As , &quot; which , &quot; which , different from my falls , for some reason I use cool , for some reason I use crazy , a great sensational sensational sensitionally .
And the result is that everywhere now , people treat me , people treat me as if I was condanned .
Desestern -- condanned , condanned !
They &apos;re all going to be worried and they say , &quot; Don &apos;t you can &apos;t do more to do you can &apos;t do more to do you do better ?
You don &apos;t have to continue to continue for all of life without power of being able to create a book that can important to create a book that can important to somebody ? &quot;
What can you important to somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s a rassurant , you know .
But it could go worse , part of that I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say , people -- I was a adolescent -- I was a very written .
I was going to met the same based by the purpose .
And people said , &quot; I don &apos;t themes to me to have success ?
You don &apos;t you fear that the billion you killed you ?
You don &apos;t you do this to make this all of life without any of nothing came out and dead on a cumulation of all of them out and dead on a cumulation of all the infrankers of the food ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
Yeah , I have fear of all those things .
I always had a fear .
And I also have a lot of other things that people may not inate .
As the algae and other things .
But , as I was about to write what I thought and I was , and I was saying , because ?
Is it rational ?
It &apos;s logic that anyone debate to be spavented by a job that you feel unknown to do .
But what is so particular in the way , in the way to make us nervous about the health health is the other way that other career &apos;t they do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don &apos;t remember one time in his 40 years of activity in his 40 years of activity in the 40 years of the actual to be able ?
There was never -- that block of the engineer John , how do it ?
Don &apos;t that , you know ?
Only , chemical engineers like group have not certainly , in the centuries , dated the reputation of being alcolized manized manivers .
We have this reputation , we have this reputation , and not just writers but creative of every gender , we have this reputation of being an instable instable .
And it &apos;s not a rest of the trists conteains of the magnific ments of the magnific ments , just in the last century , they died young people and often for them .
And even those who are not suicidated to be really seems to be really discise by their dones .
Norman Mailer , before I died , in the last interview said , &quot; Every book , I &apos;ve killed a little bit more . &quot; A extraordinary affirmation about work .
But we don &apos;t bad , when we heard these things because we heard these things so much that we &apos;ve completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and sufferent the creativity and the sufferent , and the art , it &apos;s going to conduce the corost .
And the question I want to take all of all about today is : are you agree with this idea ?
I want to do that , because even look at a food centimeter from a centimeter of distance , I don &apos;t really really for anything .
I think it &apos;s odiosa .
And I think it &apos;s also pericolous and I don &apos;t want to see perpetuate in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to encourage our great minds of creative minds .
And of course , I know , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start figting that hoscure to that hoscure of the circles that I &apos;m in my own own .
I mean , I &apos;m a look , I &apos;m a pleased young , I got about 40 years .
I still have about four decades of work in me .
And it &apos;s very likely that anything write about this is going to be judated by the world as the work that was used after the world that I had a very successful success .
I &apos;m going to be slavery , because we all are all the biggest friends here -- is probable that my biggest success is to my birth .
Oh , Gesus , who think .
You know this is the gender I think that brings a person to start a person to start besides in the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would keep kept to do this work we do this work .
So , the question becomes , how do you do ?
And so it seems to me , after a lot of reflecting to continue is to create a psychological costruck , right ?
I had somehow to find a distance of security , which I &apos;m going to write , and my natural anxial what reaction is going to get out . And as I was trying to get up and I was trying to do it , and I started looking at through time , trying to see through time , trying to see if they could have been looking at other society and more and more and more and more and more and more and more healthy than than it could have ideas and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more than it .
how to help people create creative to report the inerent inrisk of creativity .
And that research led me to the ancient Greef and ancient Rome .
I saw me because he gets into circle and then back .
In the ancient Greef and ancient Rome -- people didn &apos;t seem to believe that creativity was from men , OK ?
They thought that creativity was this beautiful , and that was about divine and sell men from a few sources and known , for reasons and known , for reasons and knowledge .
The greatest of the greatest beyond the greatest of creativity . &quot;
You know , wonderful , it was created to have a demon a demon that wisdom .
Romans were the same idea , but they called the spirit of the spirit of a genius .
which is great , because Romans didn &apos;t really think a genius was a particularly intelligent .
They had a genius was this kind of themselves , that has created living in the walls of a artist , a little bit of a artist , a little bit like Dobby , and that was going to be an elected Dobby , and that was going to be hidden the result of that job .
Here &apos;s ethical -- that &apos;s the distance of which I talking about -- that psychological costruck you from your work .
And everybody knew that was so it worked , right ?
So , ancient artists were protected by some things , like the narcism , right ?
If your work was exciting was exciting , you could not take all the market , everybody knew that you had helped by this genius .
If your fallief work , it was not all all of your fallives , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a incapable .
And so people , so people who concept the creativity in Occidest for a long time .
And then the Rind came and all changed , and all changed , and nac5 this great idea ; we put the human universe and the mistake up to the mistake of the universe and without more and leaving to creatures from the divinity .
This was the principle of the rational human human eximum , and people started to think that creativity was completely from ishardle .
And for the first time in history , you started to referred this or the artist as a rather as a rather than a person with genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big herror .
I think that allow somebody , a simple person to believe that it &apos;s like a recipient of the fundamental , the essence and the surprising of all mysteries , creatives , and inknown a philty of human .
It &apos;s like somebody to income the sun .
Deape and completely fully the ego and creates all of these expectations .
And I think it was this pression to destroy artists in the past 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think it &apos;s , and I think it &apos;s going to be , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
I &apos;m going to go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between human relationship .
Or perhaps no .
Maybe we can &apos;t sing 500 years of rational thinking of rational thinking about 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people between the audience that solleverage scientific solights on the notion of the notion , you know that people seem to do the next people who are going to be successful or their projects .
I &apos;m not going to have all about this thing .
But the question I &apos;d like to take is -- because no ?
Why don &apos;t I think about this way ?
Because it has more sense of all the other thing that has ever heard to explain the exasperant exasperant of creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever attempt to do something -- so fundamentally , everybody here -- knows , you don &apos;t have a rationally .
And , in fact , it can be completely paranormal .
I did this meet recently met with a poetry and a few years , but it was a few years , but it was a few years , but it was a few life in his life and said , I was a few few life and said , I was working out in the Virginia , and he heard , in the wait was in the wonderful time .
He said that he was like a train of air .
And she was coming towards of her landscape .
And he was going to feel that was going to be under the earth under his feet .
He knew to have one thing to do to that point and it was of , words , &quot; runlike a matta . &quot;
And so it was realizing home and he was involved by this poetry , and it would not have to take a piece of card and a fast faster , and a faster , and it was a faster , and it rate it on the page .
Sometimes he could not be fast , so she was recorreceived and correverse it was going to get in home and the poetry and the lost of the landscape and it would continued to rolate through the landscape , and he would continue to rolate through the landscape , like &quot; another poet . &quot;
Then there were the way -- this is not going to be -- there were some moments that was almost perdying , OK ?
So , he was running home and was trying to be looking for the card and poetry and the spent poetry and he was a math in the way that he was slowed with the other hand , and then he said , that was like the hand and the offer .
He was the poetry from the tail and put it in his body and put it in his body and turned on the page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be presented on the perfect page , but at the last word on the last word .
So when I heard it -- it &apos;s a very good , it &apos;s exactly the same thing to my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I &apos;m not a conducture .
I &apos;m a mad , and my way to work is ; I &apos;m woke , and I &apos;m going to see and work and work and work and to work and go on and on the wonderful .
But even I , in my dages , I &apos;ve strippulated against that thing , sometimes .
And I imagine that many of you have the han done .
You know , even if the job and ideas were given by a certain fun , I could not know it .
And what is this ?
And how do we relationship us to do it , but , rather , rather , but , rather , rather , what do you remain ?
For how much about , the best example of the contemporary example I have is the musician musician , which I &apos;ve interview of different years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of the life is the incartoon of the artist of the artist of the artist , trying to control , to try to control , to dining these species of creative impulses .
But then he invected , and a day as he was driving on a &quot; layer in Los Angeles , changed everything .
He was going to go quickly and all of a sent , this little meal melodia , which is wonderful in his head , how it does the inspiration , and the literally , and the literally , and the worldwide , and the wonderful , and the wonderful .
It &apos;s not a piece of card , it doesn &apos;t have a mathemselves .
So , he starts to feel this species of old anxietchany to be in him , and I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;ll remarried by this person-.
I &apos;m not good enough and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of walking in the panic , he stopped .
I &apos;m going to move the mental process and did something completely new .
I &apos;m going to watch the sky and said , &quot; Scususes , I &apos;m not going to drive ? &quot;
&quot; Do you know , what could you write a song now ?
If you really want to exist , you go back to a more and you get care of a care of you .
And you go to important something about it today .
You know about Leonard Cohen . &quot;
And his process has worked after this .
Not work , the job was still like always .
But the process , and the anxiety that was remarkable to report when the genius , the genius that was nothing else and liberated it was liberated to the back where it was coming back to where , realized that he was not a whole thing to be interiorized and forged .
but it was a little bit of a bunch of a conversation , a conversation between Tom and and this is a conversation between Tom and external thing that was not Tom .
So as I heard that story about changing a little bit , and I was working on , and I was saved .
This idea , he saved when I was written when I was written , &quot; and I was going to go on one of those key crowd of the disperation that we all do in something and we &apos;re working on something and we &apos;re going to think that it &apos;s a disaster , which is the worst the worst .
Not just book , just the worst book .
And I started to think about to think about this project .
But then I remember Tom who talked about the air and I tried to get it .
So I &apos;m going to go on from my face and I got my face and I got my broads to a room .
And I said to go on voices , &quot; You know , what we &apos;re going to be , if this book is not going to be interested in my own , no longer ?
Because as I see I &apos;m going to get all that I have no more than I have , I don &apos;t have this .
So if you want to be better , you have to do your part .
Okay . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what I don &apos;t do .
I &apos;m going to go to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to favor that was recorded that I was presented to do my part of &quot; because -- at the end is so , OK -- in the end of North Africa &apos;s deserts in the deserts of Africa , and they were going to get on for the wonderful landscape of luntil and hours to hours .
And they were always magnific , because the balleres were professionals and were fantastic .
But every almost every along , it was , and one of these artists was actually transcendent .
And I know you know what I do , because I know you &apos;ve all vision , a performance .
It was like time you stop , and the dancer walked through a special species of laptop and it was not doing anything about different from the sun , like 1,000 nights before , but all it was all halls .
And sudden doesn &apos;t just like a human .
But it happened by the diditive inside and under illuminate in the divinity .
And when this happened , the people know what was , people know what was , they called it with her name .
They were congiven the hands and started to sing , &quot; Allah , Allah , God , Allah , God , God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
He reosa historical -- when Maybe I was the south of Spain , I was this habits with their and pronounced in the centuries from &quot; Allah , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; Okay , &quot; , &quot; Okay , &quot; , &quot; which you still feel in the flow .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , workers , the magnification , &quot; I realize , &quot; I realize , etc , etcolor -- a scorm of God .
And it &apos;s great because we need .
But , the problem is coming the day , for the day , for the dancer , when you woke and discovered that are the 11 of Martedesday , and I &apos;m going to go on , there &apos;s no longer .
It &apos;s just a bunch with a graduate ginockyyia , and maybe never going to get to the tree .
And perhaps no one of God , while she &apos;s going to do with rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most sweetly of creative life .
But perhaps it doesn &apos;t have to be so angled if you can &apos;t believe , anzythemselves , which is the most extraordinary extraordinary extraordinary extraordinary extraordinary to be from you .
But credest simply that you come up from a unimaginable to be in the present squisite of this squisite part of your life you have to go to something else when you &apos;re finished .
And , you know , if we think that all changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it &apos;s certainly as I thought I was a different message in the work of the book that I &apos;m going to try , the periculous , the periculous , I was very successful .
And what I have to keep me when I feel electrized is , not going to be able .
You don &apos;t go to go . It &apos;s just your work .
It &apos;s going to inua present-you for your part , whatever you can be .
If your work is to ball , ball .
If the divine , I assigned you assigned to leave some kind of wonderful , for a moment , for a moment , for a moment with your foreign , &quot; Ole ! &quot;
You &apos;re going to do the same dance .
And &quot; Oh ! &quot;
I think I think you have to teach it .
&quot; You know , you know , even for you , even had to be a human love and test tape test tape to you &apos;re going to be presenting you to represent you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Okay !
You know , I &apos;ve already talked about some of these projects on the human genoma , what can meaning and discovery of new genes .
Now we &apos;re starting a new paper : we started to digitalize biology and now to go from that code we &apos;re both in a new biology , designing and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing life .
We always tried to take big questions .
&quot; What is the life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many biologists I think they &apos;re going to be a various livels .
We tried different approach , reducing the mines .
We &apos;re digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequency genome of human genome has been treated to go from the analogic world world world &apos;s digital world .
Now , we can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome of the smallest genoma .
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome for creating a more smaller .
We are degree to eliminate a hundred of genes about 500 that are here .
But when we have a played at its metabolic maps , it &apos;s relatively to our .
Temes , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one of the time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this can bring to a living .
So we decided that the only way to design was to synthize this cromosoma in way to be able to make some of the components for bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of the &quot; Planding the crazy ? &quot;
Can the chemistry to produce these big molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create before now ?
And in case , in case , can we make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of inert material chemical material .
The speakers that we are able to digitalize life is growing up to the exponential .
Our capacity of genetics , instead , instead , instead , but it &apos;s getting better .
And our more recent returns the landscape on a exponential curve .
We &apos;ve started more than 15 years ago .
The process has required many pass , began with a biothic review of a biothic ree-experiments .
But we discovered that DNA is very difficult .
There are deces of thousands of machines in the world that produced little DNA , long long letters of 30 to 50 letters and it &apos;s a degenerative process : the segment is a long way , the slonger , there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments and read the herrors .
And that was our first attempt to , to department from the genoma of Phi X 174 .
It &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , actually , the correction of the errors and you get a molecule of DNA of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is , we &apos;ve been taken this piece of inert material , and we &apos;ve insert in the bacteria , bacteria have started to read this genetic and producurniture .
The viral particle particles are then you sted by cells , they &apos;re back and destruced the Ecoli .
I talked about recent with recent of the oil industry , and they said , they have certainly compress this model .
They have more than you .
We believe this is a situation where the software can really build his software in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the biggest things in largest .
We wanted to build the whole cromosome of the bacteria .
They are more than 580 mountain of genetics .
So we thought we &apos;ve been building it in the size of virus , so that we could change the casses of a living components of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequency this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accurately was a standard for every 10 mile .
We found it , 30 errors . If we had a 30 errors . If we used that original sequence that original sequence we &apos;ve ever been able to do it .
One part of the process is designing is designing switches that they are going to be relationships with all other segments of 50 letters to build smaller sub-to-to-to-working .
We can see unique elements here .
You probably have lad that we put a broads of the grain .
Think about it . We have a genetic genetics based on four letters : A , C , and T.
Three of those letters together , and they &apos;re going to cover , and there &apos;s a specific order to letters for every letters .
So we can use genetic code to write words , switch .
What we &apos;ve done is at began to be autographs .
Some of them have been deluses from the fact that it was not poetry .
We designed these segments to simply them just to get them with full .
There are fenties that repair them and put them up and put them .
And we started to assemble parts , starting with the drawings , and seven to seven a letters of the letters of 24 mmeans to make 24 multis to get to 7,000 letters to them to get to 7,000 letters .
And every step we have produced these segments in abundance so we can sequency them to create a whole process of creating a whole process of a robustot .
We &apos;re looking for to automatize the process .
So , this seems to be the tabellon of a basket .
When we get to these very long segments , more than 100 mila , more than 100 mila , they &apos;re not going to be more directly in E.
It comes to the limits of modern modern biology .
So we &apos;ve considered other mechanisms .
We knew of another mechanism called a remarkable romology , which in biology has been using to repull DNA degree to relate the DNA degree to get the segments .
Here &apos;s an example .
This is called the organism Deinoccurs , can make three million rad rad rad .
You can see in the square superior as his cromosomosome as his cromosome is destroy .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s been a very first .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can get completely .
They can live under a various .
I &apos;m absolutely sure life in space , and you get moved to find new environment of water .
Actually , NASA showed that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule we built these processes , just using these processes , with the lievevening of the segments to inserve .
The free abulous authomatically .
This is not been taken with a electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It &apos;s a very big molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that they cohold a period of about six seconds .
This is the published we did a little time ago .
They are more than 580,000 letters of genetics .
It &apos;s the biggest molecule of a definitely definitely created by the man .
It &apos;s a fish molecular sent about 300 million .
If we spring it with a 10 without spaces , they would like 142 page only to write this genetic code .
Now , how do we do it work ? How do we activity ?
Of course , you know , you &apos;re a virus is a little girls .
It &apos;s a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria .
It &apos;s simplest when it &apos;s about clonto the eucarian cell of the nucleo , and you can just extrate the nucleo and inserious one , which is practically the process of clonation .
In the archaea , the cromosoma is integrated integrated by the cells , but we recently demonstrated that we &apos;re able to do a complete trape of a chromosomosome from one cell of a cell of a cell of a cell of a cell of a cell of a cell of a cell of a chromosomosomous chromosomosoma .
We can get a chromosome from a microbial species .
The two are different as men from the topes .
We added some gene gene in a way to decide that chromosoma .
He then has a science with the entire entives in a way to kill all proteins .
And when we put it in the cells has been study -- and you appreciate our software graph -- the new cromosoma -- the new cromosoma .
And it was really thinking that we could not go beyond , but we tried to spin the longer .
This is one of the major mechanisms .
We found that tants species have added a second or a third or a third of a few part , added in a thousands of new new ones of new ones of the species .
So who think about evolution as a just gene at the time that you have no graphical part of the biology .
They are the full of the fulfulfully required the DNA .
The cromosome that he was in the cells doesn &apos;t have a cell .
The cellula-cromosoma that we &apos;ve inseritous .
It &apos;s expressed , and he recognized the other cromosoma , has master , and we found it with just the cell , and we found it just out with just cell and the new chromosoma .
It became blue because of the genes we &apos;ve inserted .
And in a short lass of time , all the characteristics of a species , and it turned out of all in a new species , based on the new software we inserted in the cell .
Everything is changed , membranes are changed , and when we regiven the genetic code , exactly what we transferred you .
Now , this may seem as genetics , but altering the software DNA software we can change things in a way .
Now , I &apos;ve already explained that here is not talking about three million years and a half million years of evolution , and I &apos;ve already said that we &apos;re going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of this .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s enough to be as we think about our necessity .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion and a half billion people to 9 billion in the next 40 years .
Right to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now , there are three people on the planet for each of the planet for 1946 , there &apos;s four .
We &apos;re going to be on food on food , fresh water and fresh , medicinal medicinal and a half of a half billion people .
It &apos;s going to be more dare to do that nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion pounds , more than 30 billion barils .
That means millions of barils a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or whatever we have to replaces to replaces them , it &apos;s a huge challenge .
We have more connected of all the way of CO2 , these materials that finishes in the atmosphere .
At the day of the world , thank you in scientific discovery all the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they are the design design for the future .
The electronic industry just a dozen dozen about components , and think about how many different things are out .
Our limits here are mainly from the biological reality of our imagination .
Now we have technical , because of these synthesids of synthesization , able to create what we call the combinatory .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can produce a million cromosoms a day .
Think of these 20 million genes or try to get these different genes or to try to get the processure of the processes to make a little lot of things , new vaccines , we can change , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology .
And it &apos;s just a standard selection .
We can choose for possibility of survival , chemical production or papers , and a vaccination of wins .
This is an instantly instantly some software program that we &apos;re working for being able to be able to be able to sit computers .
Well , we don &apos;t know how they are going to be .
We know exactly what we know is their genetic code .
Now we &apos;re focused on the carbons of how much generation .
You &apos;ve seen you see that that extract from grain was a very finished a mal experiment .
We have a second and third generation that will use enough press that are going to use enough by the sugar , as a full-f-value , as the open-fun .
But the only way biology can have a big impact without increasing a big impact without increasing the conducting of food and the availity would be transforming CO2 in the first , for which we &apos;re working to design cells that can be transformed this scale , and we think of could make this scale , and we think of the earlier generation in about 18 months .
The solar solar combined with CO2 is a metodowntoward -- but in our discovery all over the world , we found different different metods .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It &apos;s going to see deep , at about 2500 feet of deep deeply on the temperature of water .
They &apos;re going to put from CO2 by using a molecular molecular how the source of energy .
We &apos;re looking for us to understand if we can incanalate CO2 , which can make it easily being transported on your bons , conversation , to drive that CO2 , to drive this process .
So we think we could be able to be able to increase what we could be able to increase what the question is , &quot; We have life , &quot; We have the foot of the full-trolchemical industrolchemical industrolchemical .
Exactly . If you can &apos;t do that TED , where do you do ?
It was a main the main of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working on to use the same metods to create vaccines .
You saw this year with influence , we are always back of a year and with a dollar when it &apos;s about to find the right vaccine .
I think that what you can change , we can change become combinable in anticipate .
That &apos;s how the future could start to change , now , the tree of evolution , accounerating the evolution with synthics , and the evolution with synthics , and finally cells .
We &apos;re at so much from the impressing people .
Our purpose is to live enough to be long enough to try to try to make it . Thank you very much .
First of all , I &apos;ll show you , the most quickly possible , some fundamental work , the new technology we brought to a 10-year-old . This is Seadon . This is Seadon . This is Seadon .
It &apos;s a environment that you can interact with local level of a visual amount of visual data .
Here we &apos;re seeing a lot of digital photograph with a kind of sugital zoom , for a speaking , for a speak , and I continue , to sponing images as we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these colraces of data or images .
Most of the digital photographs , but this is a scanning of the Biblioteful from the Bibliotef of Congress , and reentrepreneur .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that limits the presents of a system like this is the number of plxel on your screen in any moment . It &apos;s also an architecture .
This is a whole book , you don &apos;t have a whole thing .
This is the Casa desolate of Dickens . Overy colonny is a capitable .
To show you that it &apos;s about the text and not images , we can do something like that , to see it &apos;s really a real representation of a real representation of a real representation of the text .
It could be a little artificial way to read a little artificial book .
I don &apos;t have the board .
This is a more realistic example . It &apos;s a number of the Guardian .
Every big picture is the beginning of a seeing .
And it really gives you the please and beauty experience of a review of a revision or a daily revision of a date , which is for nature a lot of a median .
We also did something with the corner of this number of particular , the way of the Guardian .
We created a fasulp-solutions -- much more than the way -- much higher than the usual published in a normal published you in a normal contained you .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see it .
Or other model , or even the techniques .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that this means to put pop-up , and other door and other door , they should not be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not going to lose time , if we don &apos;t have contributed to date that .
These are all the streets in the U.S. . She &apos;s got a geospatial imagination of NASA .
So now we &apos;re going to go to something else .
This is actually actually from the Web ; you can go to the website ;
It &apos;s a project called Photosynth , which is two different technologies .
One is Seady and the other is a very interesting research on the computer very interesting computer very interesting computer . It &apos;s a very interesting computer in Noah Snavely , a student of the U.S. and Rick Seading of UW and Rick Seliski .
And it &apos;s from the web , I grew from Seady .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from a picture of a picture of the other and have this kind of experience in the multiply solution .
But the space of images here has actually a significant meaning .
The signs of the computer visualization of the computer have recorded these imaging imaging , so that they corresponds to the recordate the records that the records of the records to the late Montne Rocadveside Montne Rocadadeside -- are scacross the elements of a de-stable . And the elements of slif-de-stenable things , and these things have been all the level of the space .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a few more space .
I want to go to go directly to one of the original data set of Noahs -- and this is from a Photosynth of Photosynth that we &apos;ve done it works for the first time the Sadirectly the same extent . And it &apos;s not necessarily the lic extent . And it &apos;s not necessarily as well as a technology .
We had to concerned about legal and so on .
This is a rebuilt of Nothers Dothers . Flickr . Bauckr . Bauckr , we digitate Noththree Din Flickr and you get images of types , others and drop . Overy , one of these arancies an an image that you have discovered a picture that you have discovered to keep this model .
So , I &apos;m all all Flickr and you &apos;ve been all been all of the space .
And it &apos;s possible to navigate this way simplication .
You know , I would never have thought to end for Microsoft .
It &apos;s very gratiffy to have this kind of accounts here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different kinds of different kinds of different kinds of photocams of cellphones to the SLR , a number of significant phones , a number significant , in this environment .
And if I can , I try to try to look at the most strange .
Many of you &apos;re blocked by faces , etc .
Somewhere you are a series of photographs -- etc .
This is a Noththree Destricky recorrectly .
We can go from the poster to the view of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do with social environment . This is now taking data -- from the inters of the collective memory of how to apply the earth , from visual point of visual view -- and all those data together .
All those pictures become connected , greater than the parts .
You have a land model of the earth that emerge .
Think about this as a prolation of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It &apos;s something that grows in complexity as a hand that people use , and the advantages that are used to use to use use .
Their pictures are married with other people .
If someone comes to the idea of contrast to all these sances say , my picture of the name , my picture of Noththree Dimprovising Dimprovement . And I can use as a point of indeed with all those data , and I can use as a point of introfucing , and I can use the photographs of the cheaper , and to have a social experience of the cross-moke choss-the-model .
Of course , a consequence of all of that are extremely elaborated virtual mos of every interesting part of the earth , and from satellitariariarians and images and from satellitariariarily , but from memory of the collective memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What your software going to convenient us is that at a certain point , in the next years , all the photographs of all the world are going to be practed with the world ?
BAA : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is to discover .
It &apos;s creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the base of images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the reccheeness of information , which many of these images have .
As when you do a research on on the web , you get a sentence and the head on the web page has a lot of information about the images of picture .
Now , what happens if that picture is connected to all your picture ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amantity of recheeness that it was really enormous . It &apos;s a classical classic . It &apos;s a classical effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it &apos;s really amazing .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the main pleases when you travels and one of the research for the machines , is the power between who didn &apos;t mented antic antic means , between who had the wind , the draw in the wind floor , the way , the draw in in the floating plant .
Basts , and the Jaguar Jaguar , and still still the Lattea , or that the Lattea , or that the Inuit &apos;s still connected by meaning , or in Himalaya , or that in Himalaya , and that the idea that the world that we live not in the world that we live not in the world in which we live not in sense of the world that vision , but it &apos;s just a model of the world , but it &apos;s just a model of reality , but it &apos;s just a , but it &apos;s just a true ,
the consequence of a particular choices that our stirs has done , well or mal , a bad , a lot of generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of essential .
Everybody . We all procreating .
We are subjects at the beginning of beginning .
We have to dead the inexorability of death , so it doesn &apos;t surprising and ballie --
We all have an art .
What the piscrapes is the particular rator , the ritm of all culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that they are the thinking of Borneo , or the following Voodoo of Haiti , or the Wait of Haiti , or the desert Kenya , or a camellier , or a camelmellier in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my own travel in the desert a month ago , or a mth ago , or a mth ago , or a balloads in the values of the world .
All these populations teachers teachers that are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , and other ways of thinking ,
And if you reflected a moment , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
And we are , the cultures of cultures of the world are a spiritual life and cultural life that has been given the planet and it &apos;s important for the planet , and it &apos;s important for the planet as a biosphere as a biosphere .
And you can think about this , as a cultural girls as an ethnosphere and you can define the ethnosphere , the whole thing , all , the myths , intuitiitions , intuitiitions , intuitions , intuitiitions , intuitions , intuitions .
The ethnosphere is the fantastic patrimony .
It &apos;s the simple symbol of what we are and what we can be in how inquisitive .
And because biosphere was graved by the biosphere is happened to the ethnosphere and much more quidly .
None biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species is on the extinction of the extinction of the extinction of the most apocallowed , or in the most apocalitty -- and you don &apos;t even even even even even near the most poweresis -- that the different different cultural of the different cultural class .
The indicate of all that is , of course , the lost language .
When you were born there were 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not just a graduate from a vocabulary or a series of grammad .
One language is the way of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the medium with which which animum of every culture of all culture in the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a bine , a thought , a thought , a thought , a kind of spiritual possibility .
And those 6,000 languages , as we are here sitting at Monterey , at least half the meters of children .
They don &apos;t come to teach children , which means , the means not wonderful that won &apos;t wonderful .
What is more trists of being taken from the silence of being the last one , to be the last speak , the last saving gezy of the wisdom of the wisdom of the children ?
This is a focused in some of the world , every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks . And a sunclean and door and door and door with the linguous language .
And I know somebody who say , &quot; Isn &apos;t that ?
The world would be not a better place if we &apos;re going to be all the same language ? &quot; Benish , then we all talk all the same way . We &apos;re all going to sing .
We &apos;re going to be .
You &apos;ll buy a tract thing to say , not to tell their language .
I &apos;d like to do a journey through the ethnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a little journey of what we &apos;re losing .
Many of us of dimented that when I say , &quot; I really mean , &quot; I really mean , I mean , a different ways of exists .
We take for example this Barasana , in Amazony , in Amazony , the population of anaconda , which creates at the midle of the latest west sacrate from the latest sacross the latest sacrates .
It &apos;s a population that &apos;s not able to distinguish the blue color from the green color because the celests is the dums of the forest , which depends the population .
They have a strange language and a mathemselves , degree , &quot; exogamia language , &quot; to move a person that party language .
Everything has gone in the mythological past , yet the particularly families that are talking about six or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven linguious .
They limiting to listening and then start to talk .
We take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived , the Waoran of Ecuador Ecuador , an incredible population , an incredible population that has had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionary mesionary connecting a committing .
They &apos;ve done from the photographs that retraditional photographs that reverded them in pose that this population of the forest pluvial forest pluvial forests .
They have been telling the land , they have the research of a shape or a figure , and they &apos;re not in the null-up , they reconcluses that they treat the diled , and they killed the five missionary .
But Waorans don &apos;t just killed the strange .
They kill them .
54 percent of mortality was caused by their own .
We &apos;re saving eight generations and we found two of natural morning and when we insisted to know , they have that one of them was invecting to do , they have a totally invecting it , and then they killed it . And then they killed it .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps of 40 steps of reonto the species .
In the early &apos; 80s , I was a very interesting compiece when my professor of Harvard professor was I wanted to go to Harvard to go to Haiti and intruly intrucrazy between society and the secret of Duvalier and Tonton Macross Macross , and imposed to use to use zome zombies .
To give a sense of the methree-, I should have to understand the Vodoun and Vodoun &apos;s not magnera .
It &apos;s a rather than a physics of a world &apos;s physics .
It &apos;s interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has no religious feelings . And he was not the other way that the distilled of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of napproach in the tragic tragic aditional religious ,
What makes interesting is the voodoo is the relationship between life and death .
So the vive are going to get the spirits .
The spirits can be invocused by the Great Aca , they answer the back of the dance and replaced temporary temporary the way that for a short of the way that for a short we use the following becomes the Great .
So , this is the voodooists say , &quot; You go to wondered God .
We dancient in temple and become God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re posting , is the spirit that drives you , how do you do you do the bad ?
So you &apos;re seeing these incredible events : following voodoo in the state of trance that touches ines infugees infugee of the power of the power of the power of the power of the mind when it is cataling in a state of extremitation .
The people with the most extraordinary I lived the most extraordinary , the most extraordinary Kogi in Nevada Santa Marta , in the Colombia .
It &apos;s going to make tyrannics that once was a living on the carbon cars of Colombia , the population of the conquist , the population of the vulation of the vultimate planation .
In a continent of a blood , this population never been conquered by the spagners .
But it &apos;s actually a clero today , I &apos;m government , but their formation is really extraordinary .
The young people are brought away from families to three or four years , and they live secret in a world , and they live secret of the bathers of the room for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years of the nine years of the country of gestation that transcornine months of gestation that transnation in the mother , now are metaphor metaphor in the Great Mther .
For all of this time , they are acculated to the values of their society , values that their pregns and only their pregns to the cosmic equilibrium -- or to say the cosmic balance .
At the terin this incredible initiation , they &apos;re improvising out and for the first time , 18 years , at the age of 18 years , they see a full-year-old . And in that actional bore of the first best best , when the sun best best values of beauty . The best valley is conmed in all his theory is confered in his headly , and he says , &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m going to say , I &apos;m going to say .
It &apos;s really study . Now , it &apos;s going to protect it . &quot;
They call the greatest frree , and they say that we , frree them , we are the papevolution of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the Indigene and environment , we invoke Rseseau and the old story of the old story , which is a concept in his simplicity or perhaps we &apos;re going to be Thoreau and we say that these people are are more closer to us .
The advanced population are not not unsentimal sentiments from the nostales .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the paludium of the Abon , or in the winds of Tibet , but thank you for time and rhyths , created a mistic of Earth is not about the concept of the Earth , but on a major intuition , but on a consciousness , the concept that Earth can live only because it &apos;s infected from the human consciousness .
What does it mean ?
He mean , a little bit of the Ande who grows in the mountain is a spirit of a Prito a spirit of the Apu that will be a very different human being a very different human . And it will be a fast food , or that &apos;s a full full of a Montana that grows a mountain a mountain in a mass-faircraft of a rocket of rocyours to be scaved .
which is the demonstration of one , or a mineral cef is irrievant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that &apos;s interesting relationship between individuals and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia creduns of British Columbia , and they were going to be cut .
That has a different human beings from my friends Kwakiutl &apos;s Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the Hukuk and the song of the paradiments and the cans of the paradiments that live in the north of the world , the spirits that are living in the world , the spirits that are in the Hamatory began to the Hamak began to go .
If you start to consider that these cultures can actually actually actually actually , you can start to understand some of them , you can start some of understood some of them .
I took this picture to open this picture to open in the Western Norockcideship .
Mayahuash some of you heard about the Eahuask , the most powerful sushed of the repertorium .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuasuk is not the potential pharmacological pharmacological of sustaining , but it &apos;s two elements .
It &apos;s a lady , this lian lian lian lagainst of myself , and harming , harming and harmful , and slowly , sallucinogene .
It &apos;s a blud-plant broken a bluaster that altery , but it &apos;s mysceled with the leaves of a frozen of the family of the family of the family of the caffolding of the caffolding of the caffolding of the family of the family of the caffolding of the family of the caffecting of the family of the family of the cocience , but it &apos;s mmeant .
This is powerful plants , very similar to serotonin , dimethods , dimethoxyltryltryltryltril-five , method-methodyltryltrictaminy .
If you ever see the Yanomami tyllate on for the susceful sushed by a different species , anched it is contain it , it was contain it .
Tiring that policy for the nose is a little bit like being spared by a fire of a fire of a fire of baks and lots of electricity . Research a distorsion of reality .
I was often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who took the psychedelical . And he took the psychedelical fungi in the &apos; 30 in Mexico .
And second , my tese tants can &apos;t classifly these triptaminogens like , because if you &apos;re doing you can &apos;t tell anyone of being kinated .
It &apos;s possible to be abunseen with other chemical chemical chemical and the MAOOO .
Now , it &apos;s the beautiful : the carbs that are inibitors are inhydrinkers of MAO , the same kind of the same kind of thing that we could do with triptams . The spontaneous question : in 80,000 species of plants , how do these people are in the way , they do this , they create a way , they create a way , crean biochemical version that is such a way , crean arbiochemical version that is on the places ?
We use the big euphemism of the herror , which can revealed infruction .
But if we ask the Indians , they &apos;ll say , &quot; People talk about it . &quot;
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of Ehuasask , which distinguish networks , and that our eyes would be in the same species .
If we ask them how they are the sonomy , they &apos;re not going to tell us , &quot; I thought I was able to tell you how many , you don &apos;t know ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you get 17 variety in a notice of llloth and each will each cancers with a different different .
With this is not lauread to Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than contact the stami .
Now , &#91; applauses &#93; the problem is that also the ones that have the heart population are pitting people are pathers , but in some way to the history of the history world &apos;s the real world , and the way to our real world , and the way to our real world .
In fact , the 19th century , 300 years , it &apos;s not going to be remember for his wonderful innovations , but rather as the one was where we stopped and we broadly bractively and we abulous , and we abled active , the problem is not going to be changing the planet .
Everybody cultures have been involved in a dance for new possibility .
And the problem is not the technology .
The Indians don &apos;t have to be Sioux when they put up to be Sioux when they put up and they &apos;re not going to stop to be American American when they put out of horse and hot .
It &apos;s not the technology , or technology that mines the integrity of ethnosphere .
I wall about domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you &apos;ll discover that these are not cultures to be destinate to disappear .
They are creatures and dynamics out of the identificable forces that go over the ability to beyond their adaptation .
And it &apos;s disbospatria of thinking .
a names of Sarawak , in the south asiatician , a population that has lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to a generation , and now reduced the ress of the human physical physics , where you can see the physical method that seems to be branches from the lighting Borneed-theast Mardionte , where the naves the Naves the Japanese , where the naves the horizonic naves the horizonic names the
It &apos;s a bunch of the stives with the sottract to forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that are coming with the discovery of those .
If we move on the Tibet of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the dall of the political domination .
You know the genocide , the physics of a population , is condannated to universal level , but the ethnium of life , destruction of a population , but the literatory of a population , but it &apos;s not just condanted , because it &apos;s a part of the development .
And you can &apos;t understand the sufferent of Tibet until you get from the beginning .
I run the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in the Western China in Western China with a Lhasa with a young , and I just got to Lhasa with a young college , but just came to Lhasa I realized what we &apos;re going to be .
6,000 worlds of walking rolls and centers .
1.2 million people kills from military military during the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was abried to Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed to be killed to the time of Chinese invasion .
I &apos;m unclean with Sanity in Santity during the dear that has taken the population in Nepal .
She was imprisoned and his color was to be recivil .
It was taken to carry in careffort of two years , hidden , because he could not have living without her .
The ella , which has done the same , it was put in the same time .
A day has indeed , a day , a day , a drop of Mao and , for this transgression , was put on the seven years .
The pain of the Tbet can be insopy , but the reduck of the population is from the taken .
And the end , it all reduces to a choice .
We want to live in the world world world &apos;s world &apos;s a monotony or we want to account the policycle world of different different policycle ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before we &apos;re going to die said that his largest fear was that , in our lightly the world , we &apos;re not just going to see the whole gama modality of the human imagination ination , but one day we &apos;re going to wake up to a day , but one day we &apos;re seeing from a day , we &apos;re going to wake up to be able other possibility .
And it &apos;s a liant to remember that our species is existed for 60,000 years .
The Neolitic Rivolution , which has given us the agriculture , which has done us to the cult of the sees of the sees of the sea poetry with the next clero , and we &apos;re talking about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world industrialized has about 300 years .
And that squeered history not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we &apos;re going to come up in .
When these cultures of the world is asked what it is to say to be human , they say , &quot; I mean with 10,000 different voices .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all rescaled the possibility of being what we are : a species that we are -- a kind of consciousness , that we all have to fall . And there are great moments .
I took this picture on the north of Baffin , when I went to the Baffin , when I went to the date of the balene with Inuit , and this guy , and this man , and this man , and he told me the story of his non-non-history .
The government has not been gency with the Inuit and in the &apos; 500s to stabililighting our supremistake , we have them in colonies .
The non-this man was refused to go .
The family , themselves , themselves , and all his drives , and all his days , and all his attractive .
You have to know that Inuit doesn &apos;t temtemate the cold , they don &apos;t feel .
The basic paces were made of origins were made of fish flights .
The non-this man doesn &apos;t get a non-intimiddle , or the blizard , or the blizard .
It &apos;s slums , it &apos;s hot the banaled balloons and defecated in their hand . When I did them , they &apos;re conged , it , he &apos;s working with a lama .
He was spring up on the points of this cluster , and when he came up , he was killed a dog .
He was high schools and created a brilliant , with the high hot , has a sliter , has imbriled another dog and it &apos;s sproud on the bancha , and it &apos;s slums in rest .
We want to talk about cavarsela with nest ? &#91; Rauns &#93; and this , in different ways , &#91; Applauss &#93; is the symbol of the resilience of the world .
In 1999 , the 1999 , the government has reded to the total control of a larger territory of the largest territory of California and Texas I put together .
It &apos;s their new patries . It &apos;s called Nunavoid .
It &apos;s a territory territory . They &apos;re all going to be returned all mineraries .
One splendes of as a national national national state can recognize with his population .
And , finish , I think it &apos;s a pretty obvious less than us is in these argets of the planet , make it consumption that they don &apos;t have remote that they don &apos;t remote remote .
For somebody &apos;s home .
They look like the seats of human imagination that risallow the time of the time . And for us all these children , as all of these children , as all of these children , as all of geography .
Finally , we are convints that political are convints that political will never arrive to anything to anything .
We believe that policy --
&#91; Applauses are not persuasive , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and perhaps we are the best institution to tell stories of the world . Overy month of our site . Our the mouse 35 million living .
156 countries our television .
our revists are slions from millions of people .
Our work is to travel in the ethnosphere to bring our public in the places of wonderful cultural and how they saw and they &apos;re hoping , and hope , they &apos;re going to get a central revealed for the world of anthology , and we have to find a lifestyle of life in a world , and multicultural world to find a world of life in a world , and multicultural world to be in a world and multicultural world to be in a world .
where the geess wisdom of all the population can contribute to our collective benefits .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things I wrote about this book that I wrote about the other people who already heard and I &apos;m going to evidence some connections , in cash not notice to them .
I want to start with what I call the dogm dogma officer . &quot;
The dogm dogma dogma .
The dogm of all of all of all of all of the Western society . The dogma officer : &quot; If we want to male the benefit of our citizens &quot; The way to do it is to be seeing individual liberation . &quot;
The reason is , from a side , in fact that freedom is in the fact that freedom is precious , is precious , for human beings .
Another is in fact that if we are free , each of us can act for the other thing that we can agree to do everything that massive our benefit , no one that decided in names .
The way to male freedom is to be to be choice .
More choices people are , the more liberation , and most of the freedom , most liberty is their well-being .
This , I think , it &apos;s so deep in society that nobody would dream of a dream would be realize .
And it &apos;s also deeply radicated in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I just lost a simple note on condents .
In my supermarket , there are 175 condents , without the 10 variety of oil . And the 12 acetes of the 12 acets that you can buy to buy you a number of condents that you can buy to get a number of constantly circance that nobody &apos;s already of your degrees .
That &apos;s the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic of electronic to buy a stereo : By , CD , Leter , CD , plify , leter .
And in this single negotial negotial , there &apos;s a big number of audio .
We can realize six and a half million different combinations that there are in a only nice .
You have to admit that there is a very much choice .
Other fishes : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all the serve serve phone of the phone , the packed mama Bell .
It was born the phone , they didn &apos;t buy it .
One consequence of that , the phone was that the phone was that the phone was never going to be .
These themes are gone .
We &apos;ve now a variety of phones , almost illimitation between cellphones .
Here &apos;s the cellphones of the future .
My favorite is that in the middle , MP3 , wrong , and shapels for me .
If you don &apos;t even see you in the midle , you &apos;re going to be a certain that I &apos;m going to be .
And what happens is that the people are in the news and it does this question . And you know what the answer is the answer ? &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell that doesn &apos;t do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the busters , it &apos;s true the same explosion of choices .
As health health : Don &apos;t happen in the United States that you go from the doctor and doctor what you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , &quot; Okay , &quot; Build , &quot; BBy , &quot; has these benefits . &quot; And these benefits . &quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Deep , what should I do ? &quot;
And the doctor says , &quot; A have these benefits , and B has these benefits , and these lyes . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you rebed , &quot; Dear you , what would they do ? &quot;
And the doctor , &quot; I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result of the disease , &quot; the path of malite , &quot; expression that makes a beautiful thing .
But it &apos;s not a lot of a fish and responsibility to take decisions of taking decisions that something , which is the doctor , which is the doctor , and so it &apos;s not about -- and so it &apos;s not in the ideal condition to take decision .
There &apos;s a huge marketing of drugs , direct to people like me and you , who if you think about it doesn &apos;t understand them .
But if we can &apos;t buy them , why do they published them ?
The answer is that they want to be that dominate called the doctor to ask them to change the recipe .
Something that is the fundamental identity is an identity is a question of choice , as you see in this gathering . &quot; We don &apos;t want to force their switch . &quot; We don &apos;t herited the moment . &quot;
And we can reinvented how many times we get it .
which means that every morning , at the risis , you have to decide that kind of person want to be .
I was spot to the family and mathemselves , a time time the common perspective , untouched almost anyone , was that you could have the most present possible , and he started to get the most of possible .
The only choice was with who , you know , when you don &apos;t even , and nothing to do after .
Egyday , it &apos;s really to play .
I teach in a very smart students , and I think about 20 percent of work in less than a time .
And it &apos;s not because they &apos;re not going to be because they &apos;re not going to be less diligences .
Because I &apos;m impensierititites , I mean , I should I get to ask , &quot; I should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; I should move more tards ? I have to think about the kids or career to the career or the career to the career ? &quot;
They are interrogogorant .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this implement doesn &apos;t get the compititors and not to get a bel vote to my exame .
And they have to do it . I &apos;m important questions .
Now , the job : we &apos;re lucky , as Carl we have to work every day , every day , every day , every day , every day , every day , from Hotel Randolph .
I &apos;m talking about parentespecially , and I &apos;m not going to tell anybody , where the WiFi works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use me .
What means , this incredible freedom of choice that we have to continuously decide , we have to continuously , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son &apos;s son to play , with the cellphone in a task , Blackberry in the other , and the nibly notebook , and the night , the notebook , on the ginockynicky .
And even though they &apos;re all spended , every minute that we see our son , we &apos;re also asking , we &apos;re also asking , we &apos;re also asking this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this email ? I have to go this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , &quot; that makes the experience of your son &apos;s son , very different than the one that would be in other conditions .
So , as we look at all , little things and large , and big materials and the life is a choices of choices , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : Over , there were some possibility , but it was not a choice .
The world today is , the world &apos;s dilemma is , &quot; Is it &apos;s a positive thing , or negative ? &quot;
The answer is Short .
We all know , we all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about negative .
Everything about two effects negative effects of negative effects of people .
The first , paradoxide , is that it &apos;s produced to free .
And many options that choose to choose , becomes very difficult to do it .
I &apos;m going to give you an example : a study conduct of the workers of the volunteer .
A college has had access to the data of Vantues , the giant society of the deep worth of thinking , with about a million companies in 2,000 companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in the more , percentage adesion of two percent .
With 50 sources , there &apos;s 10 percent of adesions , it &apos;s the one percent of adesions only five . Why ?
Because with 50 sourds of framed , it &apos;s directly difficult to decide , and the choice is remanded to the indomances .
And domorange , and the domorange , domorange , domorange , and of course , tomorrow , and of course never arrive .
You know , that you don &apos;t mean , these workers will eat for song because they don &apos;t have enough money , because they don &apos;t have enough money , they also want to say that the decision is so obstic that they also lost the complementary of the job .
Not teparty , they &apos;re losing to five dollars from work , which would be ben be going to be .
So the paralysis a consequence of the scowever .
And I think that makes the world so .
&quot; And finish , for the eternity : ketchup , or mayonese ? &quot;
You &apos;d like to take right right to the right decision , if it &apos;s for ethernity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and the wrong , and the wrong condent condent condent .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can avoid the paralysis and to do a choice , we &apos;re less satisfacts from the result of how we would have been with less options that chooose .
And that &apos;s a different reasons .
One of these is that with many of the condents that you would choose , if you buy a one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could make a different choice that you could make a different choice that you would have been better . And that &apos;s that the alternative imagined us of the choice , and the replaces of the slide , and the squeet defation of the decision , and the sationally replaced by the decision ,
even when it was a very good decision .
More choice are , more easy than the full detail of whatever details that it is insod-up .
But also , there &apos;s what economists call costo-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has closed very well as the value we have to the things that we &apos;re confronted with things that we confront .
In rest , when there are many options , it &apos;s easy to represent the career of alternative alternative patterns and being less software of the option of option that is choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m going to use all that I &apos;m not about New York .
But it &apos;s what you would probably think .
There &apos;s this coppie of Hamptons .
A place of lussian .
It &apos;s splendic . Otym day . It &apos;s all for them .
Nothing . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , what he thinks , is Agost . &quot;
&quot; Everybody my near near Manhattan are so on . &quot;
&quot; I could tell them about the front of home . &quot;
And he spent two weeks abstract from the idea that &apos;s dying -- every day -- every day -- every day -- the possibility of parking .
The costo-opportunity is the soon of the sofation for what we have been , even when the choice was eccellent .
And the more options we have to consider , the more characteristics of the expensive decade , we will return out how cos-opportunity .
Here &apos;s another example .
This is a lot of things .
We have to live the time , and perhaps of living , and perhaps of living .
But the most important point is that anything you &apos;re choices , you &apos;re going to choices you don &apos;t do the other .
The things that we don &apos;t choose to have a lot of attractive things that we do .
Tirst point : spiral growing up the growth of expectations .
I tried it on my skin comprining a new jeans .
almost always , almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were a kind of one , I bought them and western from the dress , only after they had a life and wonderful life and washing a lot of times , began to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple of them , when those old old old , and I said , &quot; I &apos;m going to buy a couple of jeans , this is my wrong . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Who wants to me , &quot; Who wants ? &quot;
He wants with the certain nice or broken ? &quot;
&quot; Who wants ? &quot;
&quot; Sder the blink , or stretches ? Bla bla bla -- &quot; Continuate to elcare .
I was sought , and after a little bit , and after a little bit , I had been able to say , &quot; I want the only kind of , &quot; he didn &apos;t have the only kind of thing that was , so for a little jeans , then I came out of the stake , then I came out of the stake , I was the best feeling , and then I had .
It was the massive . I had all that choice the best .
But I felt about I was worse .
Why ? I wrote a book for the whole book .
The reason I was worst , the jewage , with all that choice , the jeans had to be perfect , the jeans had to be perfect .
I had expectations . I didn &apos;t expectations of exceptioned when there were only one kind of a kind of , but when it was a 100 different different , hundred different , at least a one guy was perfect .
What I had buy was good , but not perfect .
After the choices that choices , I was trying to insoon .
The advanced of the people don &apos;t do that to increase the expectations that these have respect to the ectcell of the options of options .
And this product less sod-f-focused , even when the results are good .
No one in the world of marketing if it makes it .
Because if they knew it , you wouldn &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more to this .
&quot; It was better when you were worse , &quot; The reason why he was better when you were worst when you were worst , it was that when he was worse , it was that when you were worse .
Egyday , in the world we live -- opulent , industrializes with the perfection of perfection -- the massive that we can sope is that the things are in the heighborhood .
You never have surprised pleased because your expectations , the expectations , they &apos;re ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; Basse expectations . &quot;
I mean , little autobiographic moment , and I &apos;m really posed and my wife is really study .
I won &apos;t have to do better , I &apos;m not going to do .
But it &apos;s not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of a couple of jeans scomod-s-like jeans is that when there &apos;s just that when you &apos;re not satisfacts , and you say , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is responsible ? &quot;
The world is responsible . What could I do you make me ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a insodent initiitional insod-you who is the responsible , it &apos;s otherwise , it &apos;s otherwise you .
You could have to do better .
With hundreds of variety , there are no choices for insuccess .
So when people are decisions , even though the result is I go , they feel initiitional , they feel initiated and they give them column .
In the last few years , depression is exploss in the industrialized world .
I think a meaning fatter -- not the only one , but important -- this is the only one of depression of depression is just that people have experiences of depress are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think the color is their color .
So the final result is that we &apos;re better better , objective , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the dogm , what we all all take for good good and it &apos;s completely falong . It &apos;s not truly .
There &apos;s no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than it has no matter , but it doesn &apos;t look at that it &apos;s better than a lot of choice is better than a little bit .
There &apos;s a critical value , magic . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m pretty sure we have supersuper-level that the experience that choices improve our life .
Now , from political point of political view -- I almost finished -- from political point , the following is the following .
What allows all of this choice in the industrial society is the material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , which is not they have too much choice .
The problem is they have too much little .
So the factory I &apos;m talking about is a diesclusive of modern modern , remember society .
And what it does it make it spring is this : Steve Levitt talked about how those cost-cost-to-constantly , and they &apos;re going to be inuseful . It &apos;s a spread of money .
I mean , these choices , complicated and dispendioxipulated , it &apos;s not just inuseful .
I &apos;m going to address .
They do worse .
If a little bit of what our society allows has been revered in those where people have too much much possibility , it would not just be the life , it would not just be the life to be better , but also .
This is what economists call a best paretian argent improvement .
A redesibution of the reduction is good at all -- not just the poor -- because of this choice in the eckey that comes back .
To conclude , &quot; you can become all that you want to be , &quot;
You , people of culture , you think , &quot; What does that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s obvious you can &apos;t make anything in a glass . &quot;
&quot; A castrated imagination , a limited vision of the world -- &quot;
and I &apos;m interpret that , I &apos;m interpret in the beginning .
But then , I think about , I realized that that weight the long knowledge .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you eat in the bock , so that &quot; everything is possible . &quot; You can &apos;t get your freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you rompet the gap that all diminiite possible diminiite slighting satisfaction .
You feel the paralysis , and you reduck the benefit .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too much , perhaps even for fish , and it &apos;s security for us .
But the axis of some symbolic symbolic symbolic for the rovine .
Thank you very cuer .
