<unk> year I showed these <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is almost three million years of the United States has had the size of the United States <unk> , is <unk> of 40 percent .
I &apos;m going to <unk> this <unk> <unk> , because it doesn &apos;t show the ice <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a certain sense , <unk> of the global system .
They <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
You see , you <unk> to the blue <unk> .
That &apos;s the ice in <unk> , which is <unk> in the summer .
You can see that the <unk> ice , of five years or more , it &apos;s like a blood , which is <unk> from the body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been <unk> by so .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> around the ocean , where there are enormous amount of <unk> that there are enormous amount of <unk> that , <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , that may be <unk> , that <unk> could <unk> , this point of not <unk> .
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> is already <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : She &apos;s good . <unk> : She &apos;s good . The question is if we <unk> .
A reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> has never <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> the sea on <unk> , here is where the sea <unk> .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
And the other part of the planet , the largest <unk> of the ice on the planet .
<unk> month , the <unk> scientists have <unk> that the <unk> of the ice is in <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> feet of the <unk> level , like in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the third big <unk> of ice , you see , that a few years ago , that a few years ago ,
<unk> percent of the world &apos;s population <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : This is the source of water <unk> .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when we <unk> it , the same happens to the water .
In California , <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> of 40 percent .
<unk> <unk> are in crisis .
<unk> , as you have read , they &apos;re <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the world , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> out of a normal <unk> and without <unk> .
I &apos;m going to be <unk> over the last 30 years than the <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> .
If you look at the <unk> context , you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years we have <unk> millions of <unk> <unk> of CO2 , every day -- 25 million <unk> in the ocean every day .
Look at the <unk> area , from <unk> , <unk> , and both the parts of the <unk> , and both the parts of the <unk> <unk> , where there is a <unk> <unk> <unk> of oxygen .
The largest <unk> of global <unk> , together to <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
The oil is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with the <unk> , together .
And you &apos;re going to build a lot of <unk> .
But we &apos;re <unk> to a <unk> direction .
These are the projects over the last years and some <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a way , there &apos;s a <unk> politics in our country .
<unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year for <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I <unk> <unk> something --
<unk> <unk> , where I live in <unk> , where you live , there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen it on the <unk> .
This is the largest <unk> <unk> in America .
It &apos;s happened around <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> of the <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> , is a <unk> , and happy .
It &apos;s <unk> here in America , and it &apos;s going to grow our economy .
<unk> the <unk> is <unk> .
It &apos;s about price , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> here is great <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
The largest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- <unk> -- <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- not know what they &apos;re talking about .
<unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> <unk> has two <unk> .
This is a part of them , a part .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> , we see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> to our business .
So , we have <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> , to make <unk> and <unk> the truth on the <unk> .
But actually , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it &apos;s <unk> -- it &apos;s also a good <unk> .
So we don &apos;t <unk> to climate change .
We can do it .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you &apos;ve heard about a lot of them .
So I &apos;m going to <unk> a <unk> , and it &apos;s about <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> are a little <unk> , but this is the sound of the sound of <unk> technology .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> between the <unk> <unk> , but the <unk> technology that &apos;s <unk> technology , but the technology <unk> that you see all .
And I &apos;m going to look at this , is the <unk> technology .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of the economic security .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> America is in the crisis , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that <unk> all : our <unk> <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> and oil <unk> .
Now , there &apos;s a new <unk> , <unk> solution for <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A <unk> for <unk> America , <unk> <unk> , and help to help <unk> the global <unk> .
<unk> , a solution that we &apos;re going to solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
At the <unk> <unk> : This is the last .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> energy in America .
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , <unk> , a new network .
<unk> <unk> <unk> : <unk> for places for places of work .
<unk> : <unk> America . It &apos;s time to be <unk> .
At the <unk> , he &apos;s a <unk> <unk> says , &quot; If you want to go , you go from the only .
If you want to go back , you go back , you go back , you go back , &quot;
We have to go back , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED I did a <unk> on <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to <unk> <unk> on how the car works .
So we &apos;re going to do it . And for the ones that the other time , it &apos;s the largest experiment that &apos;s largest experiment -- <unk> miles of <unk> .
<unk> is about <unk> the conditions that were <unk> in the universe -- to <unk> million in the beginning of the universe -- to <unk> million times to the second .
All that &apos;s just <unk> .
This is the <unk> car .
I &apos;m going to be <unk> in the <unk> .
This is what work . It &apos;s called <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> feet , and he <unk> <unk> feet .
This is an <unk> picture of <unk> in building , so you can see the <unk> .
<unk> 10 <unk> <unk> year we &apos;ve <unk> the car for the first time .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was because of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of control .
It &apos;s a <unk> image of the first <unk> of particles that had done all the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles in <unk> .
In other words , when we <unk> that picture the <unk> , <unk> that the <unk> , which is a big <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to us about the <unk> of the most of Google and <unk> that the page was this .
That means we &apos;ve had a <unk> impact over the <unk> .
I was a week after , we had a problem with the car , to be right here -- these <unk> <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> of <unk> .
Now , the <unk> of you <unk> the <unk> and <unk> , &quot; is not true . I &apos;m too <unk> . &quot;
And instead they can do that because when they &apos;re very <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , at least <unk> degrees , at a temperature , at that <unk> of space between stars , these <unk> can bring that .
In one of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , there was a <unk> of <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is more <unk> <unk> if you think these <unk> <unk> <unk> , and that you &apos;re <unk> about 30 <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We &apos;ve <unk> them and <unk> .
Now they &apos;re <unk> all at their place .
I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> <unk> , it will be again .
We <unk> it , and we <unk> data to get <unk> or <unk> , and so our our <unk> to find out what we &apos;re <unk> the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these <unk> <unk> the value of science and engineering <unk> . It &apos;s easy to <unk> .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s the value , I think is that value of the value of things like <unk> .
I &apos;d like to <unk> with the words of a <unk> <unk> , <unk> , which , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , said , &quot; No <unk> to <unk> the human mind that are not <unk> for the human mind that ideas of human mind that are not <unk> , which our <unk> , <unk> , which our <unk> of our <unk> , and our new <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> to <unk> when , we &apos;re <unk> , <unk> with <unk> .
<unk> <unk> like <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , and we &apos;re actually going to think and <unk> problems .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way we &apos;re going to <unk> the way to us .
So , from <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> , I started to <unk> , I started to <unk> , &quot; and if we use a computer , instead of the computer <unk> as a digital <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , with <unk> , <unk> , with <unk> <unk> , with <unk> , <unk> , with <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
and we &apos;re going to <unk> our <unk> ?
The question was that <unk> to explore the answer , building the <unk> ,
In a few words , a <unk> computer is a computer .
In a few words , a <unk> computer is a computer .
You can <unk> them with the hand , they can <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , and they have a <unk> and a radio <unk> .
But <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> .
The <unk> is the example of a new <unk> of tools for <unk> the digital information .
And they &apos;re going to be more <unk> , <unk> , of the other , and you get more <unk> , and they become more <unk> , <unk> , as we can <unk> , we can <unk> new <unk> and <unk> of <unk> .
I &apos;m going to be simple example with a simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show the video , and I &apos;m going to show the video , and if you <unk> on the other side , and if you <unk> on the other side .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
If you <unk> them , you &apos;re <unk> to what they &apos;re going around .
If they &apos;re <unk> , you can <unk> it , and they can <unk> a little .
If they &apos;re <unk> , you can <unk> it , and they can <unk> a little .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We &apos;ve got <unk> that one of the <unk> of the <unk> was the <unk> that we can use common <unk> on data , for example , like if it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as <unk> of <unk> and I can <unk> for <unk> color , where you get .
And I can <unk> for <unk> color in the <unk> , where you get .
If you &apos;re going to do it too , we can <unk> a little bit .
I &apos;m also <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , the mathematics and games where people can try things things .
Now I &apos;m --
This is a <unk> <unk> that I do with a <unk> program .
Here we have a game of words that is <unk> between <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at every <unk> <unk> a letter to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , every <unk> <unk> , <unk> a letter to <unk> , and as <unk> of <unk> , and as <unk> <unk> on a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds you <unk> , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new <unk> .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the children <unk> in <unk> <unk> , I &apos;ve done in <unk> <unk> , I &apos;ve done a video .
They &apos;re <unk> very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things of this <unk> is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of <unk> .
I just say , &quot; <unk> of the words , and they know exactly what do .
Here &apos;s other people who <unk> .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> .
It was actually just <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is an <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m going to build a tool for the <unk> of the <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the <unk> , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the <unk> , <unk> their <unk> .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
<unk> : The <unk> is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now , he took a <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> .
<unk> work !
So they <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> !
-- <unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide him as you <unk> .
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide him as you <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have the last example of show you is a <unk> , and <unk> music .
It &apos;s a <unk> tool , <unk> <unk> and <unk> music .
<unk> <unk> here from <unk> <unk> as <unk> , and the <unk> .
I &apos;m <unk> of these four <unk> <unk> , and you can use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a <unk> <unk> .
And I just <unk> you &apos;re doing <unk> , &quot; and a <unk> . &quot;
These are actually , you can control from live , like the <unk> and the <unk> .
You know , it &apos;s a particular sound and then <unk> for <unk> .
And then there are the <unk> , which is <unk> and <unk> , which you <unk> to the whole sequence .
It &apos;s like it works .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> , <unk> a <unk> in two <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the other <unk> .
Now , I &apos;m going to <unk> a <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : Now , <unk> of <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> the <unk> <unk> , so I can control the <unk> , so I can control the effect from live .
<unk> : <unk> , I can <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the side or another .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> the <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , I can <unk> the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to <unk> , but I can <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ,
And now , I can <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> on the left <unk> , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
Thank you .
So , you can see , my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> , and more <unk> <unk> to how our brain work and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the results of this <unk> , and some of the <unk> .
The concept I want to <unk> is that we &apos;re going to <unk> this new generation of <unk> <unk> , which we want to <unk> with the media <unk> , which we want .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;m not seeing the now of you .
I &apos;m a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it &apos;s more than this , of course .
It &apos;s also the love and the <unk> of my life .
And I don &apos;t know what it can change .
But , said , this is something particular happened in my life and my career , and my career , that <unk> me to <unk> the whole thing .
The particular thing is I wrote this book , this <unk> book , this <unk> called &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; which was <unk> to be <unk> in the world and <unk> a great <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that everywhere you have now , people like me .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
I &apos;m going to tell you all <unk> and say , &quot; You don &apos;t know more <unk> than do ?
You don &apos;t have any <unk> to write a whole life without able to create a book that can make a book that can <unk> ? &quot;
What could you get to someone ? &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> , you know .
But it could go , to the part of the <unk> I remember that I remember , when I was <unk> to say people -- I was a <unk> .
I &apos;m going to <unk> the same <unk> .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t say , &quot; Do you know , I don &apos;t have to have success ?
You don &apos;t have fear that <unk> you have <unk> you ?
You have no <unk> to do this <unk> for all the way of life without any <unk> , and you know , <unk> <unk> <unk> , with the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
So you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; You know . &quot;
You know , I &apos;m <unk> of all those things .
I always <unk> .
And I also <unk> of many other things that people can &apos;t <unk> .
And as the <unk> and other things .
But , for how about it &apos;s going to write what I thought and <unk> is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It &apos;s <unk> that anyone who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you could do .
But what &apos;s so particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> , in a way that other <unk> do ?
How do my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> , and I don &apos;t remember one time in his 40 years of <unk> that was asked if they were asked to be <unk> <unk> ?
You never had -- that <unk> of the <unk> , and how do it ?
<unk> &apos;t <unk> so , <unk> ?
<unk> , the engineers like not have been <unk> , in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve <unk> , we have enough , and not just <unk> , but we have this <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
And I &apos;m not going to look at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in <unk> century , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and often for them .
And the ones that are not <unk> to be really <unk> from their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before , in the last <unk> <unk> said , &quot; Every my book <unk> <unk> , I <unk> a little bit more <unk> than in your work .
But I don &apos;t <unk> when we &apos;ve heard these things so much about it because we &apos;ve got all sorts of <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are <unk> in some way , and <unk> are in the end , and <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> you to all here today is : you &apos;re <unk> with this idea ?
You &apos;re good at this thing -- because it &apos;s also going to be <unk> from a <unk> <unk> ,
I think it &apos;s <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s also <unk> and I don &apos;t want to <unk> <unk> in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better <unk> our big <unk> to live .
And I &apos;m sure that , in my case -- it would be very <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in my career .
<unk> -- <unk> , I &apos;m pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I &apos;ve got about four <unk> <unk> of work in me .
And it &apos;s very <unk> that any <unk> of the world as the work that will be <unk> from the world as the work that <unk> after the last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we &apos;re all <unk> friends here -- it &apos;s <unk> that my largest <unk> is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , who thought !
You know , this is the kind of <unk> that brings a person to start <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> at nine morning and I don &apos;t want to do that .
I love to do this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it seems to me , after many <unk> , that the way to work on the <unk> is to create a <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to have a few <unk> of <unk> between me , which I &apos;m <unk> , and my natural <unk> on what we do . And as we <unk> for all the year , as we &apos;re going to look at the time , to try to look at the time , to be better ideas , and I &apos;m going to see more ideas .
like to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research <unk> me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
I &apos;m going to be <unk> , and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> -- people don &apos;t believe that creativity is <unk> <unk> <unk> , OK ?
It <unk> that creativity was this spirit <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men from a few <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for reasons to <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity . &quot;
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of having a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
The <unk> were of the same idea , but we <unk> that kind of spirit without a <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> , because the <unk> <unk> <unk> that a <unk> was particularly <unk> .
I thought that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> literally in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> the result of the <unk> , and <unk> out of the <unk> of the artist and <unk> the result of the artist and <unk> the result of that work .
<unk> <unk> here is , that &apos;s the <unk> of which I talk -- that <unk> you <unk> from the results of your work .
And all <unk> that was so that we were <unk> , right ?
So the artists were <unk> from <unk> things , like to do the too <unk> , no <unk> , right ?
If your work was <unk> <unk> , they were <unk> , all <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> from this <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it was not all <unk> , right ?
All I was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so the people <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time .
Then the <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> , and we put this big idea ; we put the human being in the universe , and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> without <unk> to leave the <unk> .
This was the principle of the <unk> <unk> and people who think that <unk> creativity is completely <unk> .
And for the first time in the history , you get to <unk> this or that as a <unk> <unk> , rather than a person with <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think that was a big <unk> .
I think I &apos;m going to tell you about some <unk> , a <unk> person to believe that you can believe that the source , <unk> and <unk> of all the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> <unk> to <unk> human <unk> .
It &apos;s like to ask someone to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> <unk> the <unk> and <unk> all these <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s been this <unk> to <unk> artists in <unk> .
And , if this is true , and I think it &apos;s , the question is , and now ?
Can we do it ?
I &apos;m going to go back to a more understanding of human beings and <unk> .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can &apos;t <unk> 500 years of thinking about <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience that <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you do people <unk> on their projects .
It &apos;s probably not going to tell you all about this thing .
But the question I &apos;d like to <unk> is -- why don &apos;t ?
Why don &apos;t we <unk> it ?
Because it &apos;s more sense of every other thing that ever ever heard of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A process that &apos;s <unk> , as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so , it &apos;s all here -- you know , you know , you know , you don &apos;t <unk> .
And , in fact , it can be completely <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> , who has now been <unk> , but it &apos;s been a <unk> for all life and said that they were a <unk> for all life and said that they were a <unk> in his <unk> , and <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
He said that it was like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
You know , because it was <unk> the land under its own feet .
I &apos;m going to have one thing to do that point and was of , his words , &quot; <unk> as a <unk> . &quot;
And so I &apos;m going to get home and he was <unk> from this <unk> , and they didn &apos;t have to make another piece of paper and a pretty quickly , as the <unk> , and <unk> on the page .
I &apos;m not going to be <unk> , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without able to get it in the house and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and he would <unk> the <unk> , trying to <unk> , and he would <unk> it to <unk> , how she said , &quot; There &apos;s another <unk> . &quot;
Then there were those times -- this piece of piece of the piece that I never <unk> -- there were almost <unk> , right ?
So he was <unk> at home and he was trying to <unk> and the <unk> <unk> through , and <unk> a <unk> , and he was a <unk> in the <unk> , and he said , that it was like if you <unk> with the other hand and <unk> .
I <unk> the <unk> from the tail and the <unk> on his body and the page on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> <unk> , it would be <unk> on the page and <unk> , but the last word .
So when I <unk> <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
It &apos;s not all my <unk> process -- I &apos;m not a <unk> !
I &apos;m a <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> is ; we <unk> the same <unk> every day and <unk> and work on <unk> .
But even I <unk> up against my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I &apos;m going to be a lot of you the <unk> .
You know , even though the work and the ideas of <unk> <unk> to a certain source , I can &apos;t <unk> <unk> .
And what &apos;s this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it to it in a way to do not do it , but rather , it &apos;s pretty , that we do <unk> ?
So , I &apos;m going to me , the best example I have the <unk> <unk> , which I &apos;ve <unk> different years ago for a <unk> .
I &apos;m talking about this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> <unk> artist , trying to control , <unk> , trying to control , <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> .
But then <unk> , you <unk> , and a day , and a day , and a day , he was <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> everything .
I was going to <unk> and all of a <unk> , you know , that &apos;s in his head as <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , you know , it &apos;s great , and the <unk> , you know , but not how <unk> it .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , not a <unk> , has no <unk> .
So it starts to hear this kind of old <unk> , in him , &quot; I &apos;m going to get it , and <unk> from this song .
I &apos;m not <unk> and I can &apos;t <unk> . &quot;
And instead of going to go in <unk> , you know .
I <unk> the entire process and he did something completely new .
<unk> simply the sky and said , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , you know , I &apos;m <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Do you think you can write a song ?
If you really want to <unk> , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> to <unk> the other today .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And his process <unk> <unk> after this .
It &apos;s not the work , the work was still <unk> as always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when we <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> , and <unk> <unk> back to where it was <unk> , that it was <unk> , that it doesn &apos;t have to be a <unk> thing .
But I &apos;m going to <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> , and this <unk> thing that <unk> and <unk> that , but it was not <unk> .
So how we &apos;re going to change a little bit of a little bit of the way I <unk> and I &apos;ve been <unk> .
This idea , I was <unk> when I was <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and you know , we &apos;re going to be a <unk> , which we &apos;re not going to think that &apos;s going to be a <unk> , which will be the <unk> book .
Not just <unk> , just the <unk> book .
And I started thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I &apos;m <unk> <unk> that <unk> to the air and <unk> .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> .
And I said , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; What if this is not going to be <unk> <unk> , not ?
Because you know , I &apos;m <unk> all I have to do that , I don &apos;t have more than this .
So if you want to <unk> you to do and do your <unk> .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s not .
I &apos;m going to write my work because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to <unk> that I &apos;m <unk> to do my <unk> for <unk> to do my <unk> , because -- it &apos;s so -- <unk> -- <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> that <unk> to <unk> hours and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and hours to hours to <unk> hours .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and <unk> .
But every <unk> , <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk> .
And I know you know what I talk about , because I know that you &apos;ve all <unk> , at a point , you know , a <unk> .
It was like if you <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and he was doing anything different from the <unk> , as the <unk> <unk> , but it all <unk> .
And a <unk> , not just like a human human .
But you get <unk> from <unk> and under the <unk> of <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people who were <unk> what it was , I <unk> it with his name .
I &apos;m going to <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , God , &quot; God , &quot; God , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> this <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> with their and <unk> <unk> in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; which you can feel in <unk> or in <unk> .
In <unk> , when a artist has done something impossible and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- one of God .
And it &apos;s <unk> because we need .
But , the problem is the day , for the <unk> , when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 <unk> of <unk> and <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> God is no longer .
It &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> with great <unk> , and perhaps never <unk> to <unk> that .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God , and what &apos;s going to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe you can &apos;t have to be so <unk> if you can &apos;t believe , <unk> , which is the most <unk> of your own being .
But I just <unk> you &apos;re data in <unk> from a <unk> of this <unk> , you have to go to the other <unk> .
And , you know , if we think about this way , it &apos;s all the changes .
And so I started <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> like I <unk> for different months in the <unk> of the book that <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ,
And what I have to go to <unk> when I feel like this is , I &apos;m not <unk> .
They &apos;re not going to be your work .
You can get to <unk> your <unk> , any of it can be .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If the <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> to you <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> <unk> , for a <unk> , for a <unk> , for a <unk> , then , &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
<unk> , you do the same <unk> .
And I said , &quot; You know , &quot; you know .
I think , and I think , and I think you <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot; <unk> , &quot; You know , it &apos;s just for <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
So , you know , I &apos;ve talked about some of the projects on the human genome on what we can <unk> and discovery of the <unk> of new genes .
Now we &apos;re <unk> a new <unk> , we started <unk> the biology and now now to <unk> this digital <unk> . We &apos;re going to start from that digital <unk> , <unk> and <unk> life .
We &apos;ve always tried to <unk> <unk> questions .
&quot; <unk> is life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many <unk> , I think they have <unk> to understand <unk> .
We tried different <unk> , <unk> to <unk> terms .
We &apos;re <unk> from almost 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome is we <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> of biology in the digital world .
Now we <unk> the life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small <unk> , which is the species from the <unk> genome , which is the species from the <unk> that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to <unk> <unk> the genome for <unk> to <unk> a little bit more small .
We &apos;re able to <unk> a <unk> of the genes that are here .
But when we give it a look at the map , it &apos;s simple than our .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one , is very <unk> that can bring it to a <unk> cell .
So I &apos;m going to <unk> that the only <unk> to <unk> this <unk> in a way to <unk> <unk> the <unk> for some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of the <unk> , &quot; Can we <unk> a <unk> ? &quot;
Can the <unk> of produce these big molecules that we have never been doing before ?
And , in <unk> , we can make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So the speed with which we can <unk> the life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the code , instead of <unk> , instead of <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> .
And our <unk> <unk> <unk> on a <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve been <unk> over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> many <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before <unk> .
But we found that DNA <unk> <unk> is very difficult .
There are <unk> of thousands of machines in the world that <unk> small <unk> of DNA , <unk> <unk> of DNA , <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> process : the most <unk> process is <unk> , the <unk> is <unk> ,
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> .
And this was the first <unk> , at the digital information from the digital information of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a small virus that bacteria <unk> .
We &apos;ve <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA <unk> .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> , and we &apos;ve <unk> it in bacteria , the bacteria , the bacteria , and we <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> particles are <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> back and <unk> <unk> .
I talked about the <unk> of the <unk> industry that they have been <unk> this model .
They have more <unk> than you .
I think that &apos;s a situation where the software can actually build its own same <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we do the bigger things in big .
I &apos;m going to build the entire <unk> of the <unk> .
They &apos;re more <unk> <unk> of the code of <unk> code .
So we thought about <unk> in <unk> of the size of the <unk> , so that we can change the <unk> to understand what they &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is <unk> , and if we <unk> with information in a computer , these <unk> , these have to be very <unk> .
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> the <unk> , it was a <unk> for 10 <unk> <unk> .
We found , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If we used that <unk> that <unk> <unk> ever ever could do it .
One of the process is design <unk> <unk> that you <unk> with all the other <unk> of the other <unk> for <unk> to build more small <unk> that .
<unk> elements here .
You can probably read that <unk> <unk> .
So we have a <unk> code <unk> on four <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
I &apos;m going to <unk> of those <unk> <unk> , and there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> for every <unk> .
So we can use the code for write words , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did at the beginning was <unk> .
Some of the <unk> were <unk> from the fact that it was <unk> .
We &apos;ve <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them .
And we started <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
At every step , we &apos;ve been <unk> in <unk> so that we &apos;re <unk> to create a very <unk> <unk> , as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to <unk> the process .
So , this seems the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
When I was <unk> at these very <unk> , more than 100 <unk> , they &apos;re not going to <unk> up in the <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> tools of biology .
So we &apos;ve <unk> <unk> other <unk> .
I &apos;m going to be another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> DNA <unk> .
Here &apos;s a example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> <unk> .
In 12 hours , it &apos;s <unk> , as it was before .
And they &apos;re going to have thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can <unk> .
They &apos;re going to live in <unk> .
I &apos;m absolutely absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and you get to find new <unk> <unk> of water .
And it &apos;s true , NASA has showed that this is .
This is an image of the <unk> that we &apos;ve built these <unk> , just using the <unk> with the design <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This picture was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are picture that <unk> a <unk> period of six seconds .
This is the <unk> we &apos;ve done a little bit ago .
They &apos;re more <unk> <unk> of code .
It &apos;s the largest <unk> of a <unk> structure ever <unk> from man .
It &apos;s got a <unk> weight <unk> .
If you <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , we <unk> <unk> pages , we &apos;re going to <unk> this <unk> code .
Now , how do we do it work ?
Of course , through a virus is a <unk> game .
It &apos;s a little bit more <unk> when they use the bacteria .
It &apos;s the <unk> simple when you &apos;re <unk> cells like our <unk> , you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is that that we &apos;re <unk> the process of <unk> .
In the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> is instead of <unk> in the cell , but we &apos;ve <unk> <unk> that we can do a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> cell .
We have a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> <unk> .
The two are different than the <unk> .
We &apos;ve been <unk> in the way we can decide what you want to decide what this <unk> .
He has <unk> <unk> with the <unk> in a way to <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put the cell in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> <unk> is going to go to the cell .
And we were <unk> <unk> that we don &apos;t go beyond , but we &apos;ve tried to <unk> more in there .
This is one of the <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> of a few , <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> that .
So who think about how a <unk> only <unk> at the time , you know , it &apos;s not <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the DNA .
The <unk> that was in the cell , they didn &apos;t <unk> .
<unk> <unk> we have <unk> the <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , and he <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> , and we <unk> with only the cell , and we <unk> with only the new cell .
It &apos;s become blue <unk> to the genes that we have <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species , and you &apos;re <unk> , and you have <unk> of all in the new software that we &apos;ve <unk> in the new software that we &apos;ve <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when we <unk> the code <unk> exactly what we &apos;ve <unk> .
Now , this may be <unk> <unk> , but we can change the software DNA software we can change things in a way .
Now , I &apos;ve been <unk> here , you know , you know , but of the <unk> of <unk> , and a half million years of the <unk> , and I &apos;ve already said that we &apos;re going to create a new version of the <unk> <unk> in which <unk> new <unk> .
Why do we do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion people to <unk> billion people in the next 40 years .
Right for a <unk> : I was born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> in <unk> , in <unk> , there are four .
We &apos;re going to be <unk> problems , water and <unk> and <unk> for six billion and a half billion people .
It &apos;s even more <unk> to nine billion .
<unk> than five billion <unk> , more than 30 billion <unk> .
That means percent of <unk> <unk> a day .
When we &apos;re trying to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process for <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
And in the <unk> that we have to <unk> the CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
At the day today , thank you for the <unk> <unk> in the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are <unk> <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry just <unk> just a <unk> about <unk> , and you think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> are <unk> data from the reality of the reality of the <unk> , and our imagination .
Now we have <unk> , thank you , thank you to <unk> <unk> , in able to create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think about these 20 million genes or <unk> , or try to <unk> <unk> <unk> to produce <unk> , or new <unk> , we can change , because we can change , and create more <unk> biology .
And it &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ,
This is a <unk> of a few software that we &apos;re working on for being able to <unk> and design species to make a computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how they &apos;re going to be .
We know exactly what the <unk> code .
Now we &apos;re <unk> on the <unk> generation .
You &apos;ve seen you know that <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> was a <unk> .
We &apos;ve got <unk> on the third and the third generation that we &apos;re going to get over to <unk> <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can make this <unk> , and we think about the cost of food and <unk> the cost of the <unk> and <unk> would be <unk> to the CO2 in matter before we can make this <unk> , and we think we can get the first <unk> of the first <unk> in about months .
<unk> light <unk> with the CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> we have <unk> in <unk> .
It &apos;s in the ocean , about <unk> feet of <unk> <unk> to the temperature of water .
<unk> <unk> from CO2 from the <unk> of the <unk> of energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can <unk> CO2 , which can be <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to <unk> this process .
So we think about a short <unk> that we can be able to <unk> what the question of the <unk> question , &quot; We have the <unk> <unk> goal of <unk> the whole industry .
<unk> . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can &apos;t it ?
It &apos;s a <unk> source of energy .
And we &apos;re working on the same <unk> to use <unk> <unk> .
You &apos;ve seen this year with the flu , we &apos;re always <unk> in a year and a dollar less when you &apos;re going to find the right <unk> .
I think that you can change the building <unk> in <unk> .
Here &apos;s how the future could start <unk> , and now , the tree of evolution , <unk> evolution with bacteria , <unk> , and finally <unk> .
We &apos;re going to be so on the <unk> people .
Our purpose is to do in a way to try to try and try to try to try and try to try to try and try to try to try and try to try and try to try and try to try and <unk> . Thank you very much . Thank you very much . Thank you very much . Thank you very much . Thank you very much . Thank you very much . Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
First of all of you do , the most <unk> possible , some fundamental work , in the new technology that we have <unk> to <unk> a year ago . This is <unk> . This is <unk> . This is <unk> . This is <unk> .
It &apos;s a environment that you can <unk> is <unk> at local level that <unk> with a huge amount of data .
So we &apos;re seeing here <unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , for a <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , to <unk> images , <unk> images like we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these <unk> data or the images .
Most of the <unk> are common <unk> , but this is a <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s not a difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen . It &apos;s also a very <unk> architecture . It &apos;s also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a whole book , for the data .
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> .
So , I &apos;m just going to <unk> that &apos;s just a <unk> , we can do something like this , to make a real <unk> of the <unk> , not a <unk> <unk> .
It could be a little bit <unk> to read a <unk> book .
I don &apos;t tell you <unk> .
This is a <unk> example . It &apos;s a number of <unk> .
Every image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it &apos;s really a lot of the <unk> experience of read the real version of a <unk> , or a <unk> <unk> , which is to nature a <unk> , which is to nature a <unk> of a half of a half .
We also did something with the corner of this number in particular number of the <unk> .
We &apos;ve created a <unk> <unk> <unk> much more than that you can use a normal <unk> and <unk> you have <unk> <unk> .
If you want the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see here .
Or other models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And that &apos;s really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
I thought that this <unk> <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> other <unk> , not <unk> to be <unk> .
Of course , the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this <unk> , I don &apos;t want to do you know , if we don &apos;t have <unk> to <unk> that we have <unk> to do it .
These are all the <unk> in the U.S. <unk> ,
So now we &apos;re going to do something else .
This is actually about the Web on the Web , you can see .
It &apos;s a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> research in a very interesting <unk> , <unk> , a student of <unk> , with the help of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s about the Web , <unk> <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , which we can go from another picture to another <unk> and have this kind of experience to <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here actually has a meaning .
So , the <unk> of the computer have <unk> these images together , in a way that <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> . Here are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if I have a few other environment .
There are a lot more <unk> .
I want to go to one of the <unk> data and this <unk> <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that we &apos;ve done for the first time , the summer <unk> for the first time , the <unk> <unk> that &apos;s really the key technology , I &apos;m not <unk> to show the <unk> that technology is really <unk> in the website .
We had to <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> images . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> and <unk> images of the <unk> and <unk> images of the <unk> and <unk> . <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So they &apos;re all <unk> images from <unk> and they &apos;re all <unk> to <unk> in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to <unk> it .
You know , I would never thought of work for <unk> .
It &apos;s very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think we &apos;re going to see that you &apos;re a lot of different kinds of different <unk> : from those cell phones to <unk> , a number , <unk> <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , we go to try and try and try and try and <unk> those <unk> .
Many are <unk> by <unk> , etc .
So , in the way , you know , you know .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from the <unk> to physics of this environment .
The <unk> point is we can do things with the social environment . This is now <unk> data from the whole <unk> of the whole <unk> of the whole <unk> of the <unk> , from the whole <unk> of view and <unk> data .
All those pictures are <unk> together , the largest <unk> of the parts .
You have a model of the Earth that <unk> .
Think about this as a <unk> of the work of <unk> <unk> on Earth .
It &apos;s something that we <unk> in complexity , and the people who <unk> it , and the <unk> that we <unk> to use it .
Their picture are <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you &apos;re the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> , the name , my picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I can use it to <unk> in space , in that <unk> , in that <unk> , and I can use the <unk> of the <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of all of that are extremely <unk> <unk> of every part of the land , <unk> not just by <unk> and images and images from <unk> <unk> and images , but from <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
CA : I &apos;ve been <unk> ? What &apos;s your software ? What &apos;s your software is to do is that to a certain point in the next years , all the <unk> were <unk> together to the entire world &apos;s <unk> together ?
<unk> : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is doing it . What &apos;s doing is .
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> , if you want , you to do it , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it &apos;s doing it in the <unk> of the <unk> .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> of information that many of these images .
As you do a research of images on the Web , you get a <unk> and the page on the page of the images of the picture .
Now , what &apos;s happening if that picture <unk> you <unk> to all your <unk> ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that &apos;s really big . It &apos;s really big . It &apos;s a <unk> effect . It &apos;s a <unk> effect . It &apos;s a <unk> effect . It &apos;s a <unk> effect . It &apos;s a lot of the <unk> .
CA : <unk> , it &apos;s really incredible . <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> .
One of the <unk> that when you <unk> and one of the <unk> of the <unk> research is that we can &apos;t <unk> <unk> <unk> , between <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> in the wind , the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> in the <unk> <unk> ,
I think that <unk> <unk> <unk> even over the <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> , or <unk> are still <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and that the world &apos;s <unk> <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , and that the world &apos;s in which we have no sense , but it &apos;s just a <unk> to be <unk> , and it &apos;s actually a <unk> , and it &apos;s actually ,
<unk> of a particular <unk> of choices that our <unk> <unk> , which our <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , many <unk> .
And of course , all <unk> <unk> <unk> .
All right . All <unk> . <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We have to <unk> the <unk> of death , so we can &apos;t <unk> it if you <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art .
What <unk> is the <unk> of the song , the <unk> of the song of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of <unk> .
He was my <unk> of my <unk> <unk> a month ago , or a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , on the <unk> , on the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , on the <unk> <unk> , on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
All these <unk> <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of <unk> to think , other ways of other ways of <unk> to move in the world .
And , if you &apos;re going to <unk> a second , it &apos;s a <unk> that can give you hope .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> of the world create a <unk> of life and <unk> that <unk> the planet and <unk> that <unk> the planet , so that it &apos;s important to the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk> , <unk> ideas , <unk> , <unk> in being from human imagination .
The <unk> is the <unk> <unk> of humanity .
It &apos;s the <unk> of what we &apos;re and what we can be in the species of what we can be in the species .
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> was success to <unk> and <unk> much more <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all the species was or is about <unk> <unk> , because it &apos;s <unk> , because it &apos;s <unk> , or -- you don &apos;t get <unk> , and you can &apos;t <unk> <unk> -- and you don &apos;t get <unk> -- that we can &apos;t <unk> -- that <unk> .
The <unk> of all that &apos;s , of course , <unk> <unk> .
When you &apos;re <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not <unk> from a <unk> or a series of <unk> ,
One language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle of the <unk> that <unk> of every culture is in the world material .
Every language is a <unk> forest , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , as we &apos;re <unk> here to <unk> , at least half a half of the <unk> .
They &apos;re not <unk> to the children , the <unk> that is , <unk> , <unk> , which is already death .
What &apos;s more <unk> <unk> of being <unk> from <unk> , of being the last to talk about a language , of course , not that way of the <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of someone in some part of the world every two weeks , every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> and <unk> with it in the <unk> <unk> .
And I know that somebody of you <unk> , &quot; is not better ?
The world would be not be a better place if you <unk> all the same language ? &quot; <unk> , then we &apos;re going to talk about <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m going to be <unk> , you can &apos;t speak to speak your own language .
Now , I &apos;d like to show you a <unk> ,
And a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we &apos;re <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say , &quot; different ways of <unk> , &quot; I mean different different ways of <unk> .
I &apos;m going to be <unk> for example , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which <unk> to <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s not able to <unk> the color of the color , because the <unk> <unk> is <unk> in the forest , from the <unk> , which is <unk> in the forest , from the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a rule , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; You have to <unk> a different person who &apos;s a different person .
All that has <unk> in the past <unk> , and <unk> is that in these <unk> <unk> that you &apos;re talking about six or seven <unk> , because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> nobody <unk> .
You &apos;re going to <unk> and then <unk> to speak .
I &apos;ve been <unk> one of the most interesting <unk> that I &apos;ve been <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , a incredible <unk> that has first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> five <unk> have <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;ve done <unk> from the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> that <unk> <unk> , <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They have <unk> the <unk> picture of the land , they have <unk> to <unk> a form or a <unk> , and they don &apos;t have <unk> <unk> , and they have <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> not only <unk> .
They <unk> in their own .
<unk> percent of the <unk> was <unk> by their own .
We &apos;re <unk> to eight <unk> and found two cases of death and when we <unk> for them , they <unk> it to know , they have <unk> that it &apos;s so that it &apos;s dead <unk> , and then they <unk> it . They <unk> all sorts of <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> species .
I was the first <unk> , I was <unk> a very interesting task when my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
For a sense of <unk> , I would have to understand the culture and that <unk> is <unk> .
It &apos;s pretty much of a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Very interesting .
If you &apos;re going to <unk> the big <unk> of the world , what do you do ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent is always <unk> out of <unk> , thinking that Africa &apos;s not <unk> . And instead of , it &apos;s not the other than these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
What makes interesting makes interesting interesting is the <unk> between life and death .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> can be <unk> by <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and you <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of live in a little bit of the <unk> .
So , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , you go to <unk> to <unk> <unk> to talk about God .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re <unk> , is the spirit that you &apos;re <unk> , as you can do it ?
So you &apos;re going to be incredible <unk> : <unk> in state of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather than the body of mind that when it &apos;s <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;ve been <unk> with the <unk> that I &apos;ve been <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> of the <unk> <unk> that once <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> in <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In a continent , <unk> , this <unk> <unk> has never been <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
In <unk> , I &apos;m <unk> from a <unk> , but their <unk> is extraordinary .
<unk> young <unk> are <unk> from <unk> to <unk> families or four years , and they live in a world <unk> <unk> and <unk> in a <unk> world of <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> of nine years of the <unk> for <unk> , nine months of <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> <unk> ,
So , to all this time , they &apos;re <unk> to the values of their society , values that <unk> their <unk> and just their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or for the <unk> <unk> .
So , the <unk> of this incredible <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> <unk> out and for the first time , they see an <unk> <unk> . And in that moment of <unk> , when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , when the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , all that they learned all the <unk> . <unk> <unk> all of the <unk> , and he &apos;s going to be <unk> .
&quot; <unk> <unk> you like I said .
It &apos;s <unk> . Now it &apos;s going to you <unk> . &quot;
They call the largest <unk> and they say that we have , <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re the <unk> of the <unk> of the world .
This level of <unk> is extremely important .
When we think about the <unk> and the environment of the <unk> <unk> and the history of the <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> idea in his <unk> or maybe these are more <unk> to the Earth &apos;s <unk> to us .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> , or <unk> <unk> .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> , but thank you very much about the <unk> , but thank you to the <unk> of the Earth , they created a <unk> of the Earth &apos;s idea that it can live in an <unk> .
What does it mean ?
I mean that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it will be a different human <unk> and will have a different relationship with the mountain or that <unk> to a <unk> of the mountain that <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
which is the <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What &apos;s interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that <unk> to be <unk> .
What I &apos;ve made a human being different from my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> world , which <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
If you look at <unk> that these <unk> can create different <unk> , we start to understand some of them <unk> . <unk> this <unk> .
I <unk> this picture of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard about the <unk> , the most powerful <unk> <unk> .
What makes it fascinating is the potential is not the potential of the <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> from two elements .
<unk> on the side , this <unk> <unk> that has a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little <unk> that <unk> a little bit of the <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> with the <unk> of a family <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to <unk> , very similar to <unk> , <unk> .
If you ever see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> that they do from a different <unk> of species , <unk> it has <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to <unk> that <unk> is a little bit like to be <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> on a sea of electricity . It &apos;s <unk> . It &apos;s actually <unk> <unk> .
I often <unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> , Richard <unk> , <unk> <unk> , with his <unk> <unk> , with his discovery of <unk> <unk> in <unk> years .
<unk> my <unk> can &apos;t tell you can &apos;t tell these <unk> , because if you &apos;re not going to tell you , you can &apos;t tell you about it . <unk> <unk> , but they can &apos;t be <unk> because they &apos;re <unk> from a <unk> that you have to be <unk> because they &apos;re <unk> from a <unk> that you can &apos;t tell you can &apos;t tell you about the <unk> , because they &apos;re <unk> <unk> , of course , you can &apos;t have to be <unk> , you can &apos;t tell you can &apos;t tell you can &apos;t <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
It &apos;s possible <unk> <unk> , if you <unk> with other <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
Now it &apos;s the good : <unk> that are <unk> in this <unk> are <unk> of <unk> , the same kind of <unk> , the <unk> question : in a <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , like these <unk> <unk> <unk> , like these <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> , and if you &apos;re going to make a <unk> <unk> ?
We use the big <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> .
But if you <unk> to <unk> , we have <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
What does it mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who <unk> <unk> <unk> , who <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that our eyes <unk> in the same species .
If you <unk> the <unk> of their <unk> <unk> , &quot; Do you know , you know , you don &apos;t know all of them ? &quot; I said , &quot; I said , &quot; I said , &quot;
The solution is : <unk> <unk> in a <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> with a different <unk> , <unk> with a different <unk> .
So , you know , you know , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> .
Now , <unk> the problem is that the problem is that we have to heart <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , but in some way , in some way we &apos;re going to <unk> the story of our real world , and it beyond our real world .
In fact , the <unk> century , between 300 years , not <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk> , but rather like the problem was that we &apos;re <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we have <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> of the planet . Now is not the problem .
All the <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new <unk> for new <unk> .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , they don &apos;t have <unk> to be <unk> when they put it from <unk> and <unk> like <unk> , they have <unk> to be <unk> , and <unk> .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that <unk> <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s the power of <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And if you look at the world , I &apos;m going to look at the world , you know ,
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> and <unk> out of the <unk> of the <unk> that they go beyond their ability to <unk> .
<unk> that you have <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> --
And now , <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that has <unk> in the forest to the <unk> , and now we &apos;re going to <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> , where <unk> <unk> , where <unk> <unk> , where <unk> <unk> , where <unk> <unk> , <unk> , where the <unk> ,
I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> .
Or , in the case of <unk> , are <unk> <unk> with the discovery of <unk> .
If we <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the <unk> of politics .
As the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of a <unk> , is <unk> to <unk> level , but the <unk> , the <unk> of life , not just <unk> , not just <unk> , but <unk> <unk> in some <unk> , because it &apos;s part of the development of development .
And you can &apos;t understand the <unk> of the <unk> until the beginning .
I &apos;ve got the <unk> miles from <unk> in China , <unk> through the <unk> , <unk> <unk> with a young <unk> , but only <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> <unk> .
The father &apos;s father <unk> at <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that means that it &apos;s been <unk> to <unk> in the Chinese days .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> at the age of two years , under his <unk> because he didn &apos;t have to live without him .
<unk> , which has done the same , it was <unk> in <unk> field .
One day he <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> , and for this <unk> , was <unk> to work for seven years .
The pain of <unk> can be <unk> , but the spirit of <unk> is from <unk> <unk> .
And finally , all of it <unk> to a choice .
What are we going to live in the world of <unk> or we want to <unk> the world ?
The great <unk> <unk> , before they were <unk> , before he <unk> the <unk> that his largest <unk> <unk> was that , in our <unk> <unk> , not just <unk> the whole <unk> of the <unk> of human imagination to a day of human imagination , but a day <unk> <unk> that were <unk> <unk> <unk> to the other day .
And it &apos;s <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
<unk> <unk> , which has given us the agriculture , which has done <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we talk about <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world <unk> has <unk> for 300 years .
That <unk> story I don &apos;t <unk> that we have the answers to <unk> all the challenges that we <unk> to come .
When we &apos;re going to <unk> of the world is asked what we want to say , we &apos;re <unk> with <unk> <unk> different <unk> .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all <unk> the chance of being what we are -- a kind of <unk> , which has to make sure that all the <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> . And they &apos;re great moments of <unk> .
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The government <unk> was not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and <unk> for <unk> , and in <unk> years , we &apos;ve <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> for his life , <unk> <unk> , and all its <unk> , and all his <unk> .
I &apos;m going to know that <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> , they were <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn &apos;t <unk> <unk> from the night or from <unk> <unk> ,
It &apos;s <unk> , you have <unk> the <unk> in <unk> and <unk> and <unk> in your hand . When I did the hand . When I did it , <unk> <unk> , has <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s got <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when you <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
It &apos;s got <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> created a <unk> , has <unk> another dog , and it &apos;s <unk> on <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to talk about <unk> with nothing ? <unk> . And this , in different ways , <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all of all the <unk> of the world .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , the government <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> area of the <unk> of California , and <unk> together .
It &apos;s the <unk> . It &apos;s called <unk> . It &apos;s called <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . <unk> all the <unk> resources .
One is a <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , to end , I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> at least at least at least in these places , <unk> , <unk> that they &apos;re not <unk> .
For someone &apos;s home .
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that we &apos;re going to be <unk> of the <unk> . And for us all of these kids , like dreams , as dreams , they become part of the <unk> of hope .
So , we &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> <unk> that <unk> never <unk> .
I <unk> that <unk> --
<unk> <unk> : <unk> are not <unk> , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and perhaps we &apos;re the best <unk> to tell stories about the world . Every month our website <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> from millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public places in places of <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> from which <unk> to <unk> that <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> for time , and we need to find a <unk> in the world , and we have to find a <unk> in a <unk> world and <unk> .
which <unk> <unk> to <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I &apos;ve been going to talk about some things that you &apos;ve heard and <unk> some <unk> , in case , you know , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in the case I &apos;ve heard of the <unk> .
I &apos;d like to start with what I call the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
<unk> <unk> <unk> ?
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot; If we want to <unk> <unk> , &quot; If we want to <unk> our citizens . &quot; If we want to <unk> our own <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
The reason is , from one side , in fact that freedom is in the same <unk> , is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> for human beings .
And the other is in fact that if we &apos;re <unk> , each of us can do it for all of the way to do that we do our <unk> , without no nobody who <unk> in our name .
The way to <unk> the freedom is <unk> the choice .
The <unk> people have , more <unk> , and more <unk> , and more <unk> , is their freedom , is their <unk> .
This , <unk> , it &apos;s so <unk> in society that nobody <unk> you have <unk> in <unk> .
And it &apos;s also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what the progress is .
This is my <unk> . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m going to <unk> a simple <unk> on the <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> and 12 <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that nobody <unk> <unk> .
Here &apos;s what the <unk> is the <unk> .
Then you go to the <unk> <unk> to buy a <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a big number of <unk> <unk> .
We can do six million and a half of different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> that there is choice .
<unk> <unk> : the world &apos;s world &apos;s <unk> .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the <unk> , <unk> that they were <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the phone , you don &apos;t <unk> .
A <unk> of that , between the other , was that the phone never <unk> .
These days they went .
Now we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> , especially between <unk> .
That &apos;s the cell phones .
My <unk> is what &apos;s in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> for <unk> <unk> .
If you have no <unk> you &apos;ve seen in the <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> in the <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> .
And what &apos;s going to the end is that people <unk> in <unk> and <unk> , and it &apos;s the answer ? The answer is ? &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do it .
So , in the other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , you <unk> the same <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : You don &apos;t have the United States in the United States , and the <unk> you have to do .
Instead , I &apos;m going to <unk> you , and the <unk> says , &quot; OK , we can do it , or <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> . What do you want to do you ? &quot;
You know , <unk> , what do you do ? &quot;
And the <unk> says , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , and they <unk> these <unk> and <unk> these <unk> and these <unk> . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you ask , &quot; What if you were , you know , what <unk> ? &quot;
And the <unk> , &quot; But I &apos;m not . &quot;
The result of the <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> that makes it seem a beautiful thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not that a <unk> the weight and the responsibility of the decisions , which is something that knows something , you know , you know , it &apos;s not -- and so it &apos;s not about <unk> -- and so not in <unk> to take the decisions .
There &apos;s a huge <unk> of <unk> products , <unk> to people like me and you , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s a sense of <unk> .
But if we can &apos;t <unk> , because we <unk> them ?
The answer is that they want to <unk> the <unk> for <unk> <unk> .
So , I &apos;m <unk> to <unk> that is a question of choice , as you can see in this <unk> , &quot; we don &apos;t want to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , &quot; We don &apos;t have to <unk> . We have to <unk> .
And we can <unk> them as many times we can <unk> .
The <unk> that means that every <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I was <unk> to <unk> , a time the common perspective , <unk> , almost <unk> for anyone , was that we <unk> the most possible , and you get to children to children the <unk> .
The only choice was with who , not when , and you can &apos;t do it .
<unk> , all is very much of play .
I &apos;m going to work very smart students and <unk> their 20 percent of the work in less work than a time .
And because they &apos;re not <unk> , not because they &apos;re less <unk> .
But why are they <unk> , <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , or not ? <unk> , <unk> , right ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> later ? I have to think about the kids or the <unk> ? &quot;
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
And they &apos;re trying to answer these questions , even if this <unk> <unk> , and you don &apos;t get a <unk> <unk> , and you don &apos;t get a great <unk> to my <unk> .
And they really have to do that . They &apos;re important .
Now , the work : we &apos;re <unk> , as <unk> , because technology <unk> us to work every day , from every day , from every day , from every day of the <unk> , <unk> that we can <unk> from <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> , and I &apos;m not going to tell you nobody , where it works .
I don &apos;t say , because I want to use it .
What does it mean , this incredible freedom of choice we have to <unk> , <unk> in every time , if we have to work or not .
We can go to our <unk> , with the <unk> in a <unk> , with the <unk> in the other , and the <unk> , <unk> , on <unk> .
And even though they &apos;re all <unk> , every minute we see our <unk> , we &apos;re also <unk> , we &apos;re also <unk> to answer this called &quot;
&quot; <unk> , I have to answer this letter ? I have to <unk> this letter ? &quot;
And it &apos;s also , when the answer is , &quot; all this makes the experience of your son of <unk> , very different than that would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the things , and big things , and <unk> of life , the life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : <unk> , there were some <unk> , but it was a question of choice .
The world of <unk> today , <unk> is , &quot; Is it , &quot; Is it a <unk> thing , or <unk> ? &quot;
The answer is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> them .
I &apos;m going to <unk> this choice <unk> to people .
The first , <unk> , it &apos;s that it <unk> instead of <unk> .
And so many <unk> in which you have to choose that , it &apos;s very difficult to do it .
I &apos;ll give you a <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of my <unk> has had access to the data , <unk> <unk> society , with about a million <unk> in different <unk> .
What she <unk> is that for every 10 solutions that they &apos;re <unk> in the <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s 10 percent less than <unk> than when they &apos;re <unk> to come to it . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> , which is hard to decide , and the choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And at <unk> , and again , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , you never have .
I mean , it &apos;s not just that these <unk> <unk> <unk> food for <unk> because they don &apos;t want to say that decision is so <unk> that decision is so <unk> that we can also <unk> the <unk> of work .
They &apos;re not <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> to five <unk> for year from <unk> <unk> for year from <unk> <unk> , which would be <unk> to <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices .
And I think we <unk> the world .
&quot; And to <unk> , for the <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> ? &quot;
You know , the right decision , if it &apos;s for <unk> ,
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and you <unk> the wrong .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can <unk> the <unk> and do a choice , at the end of the result of how we <unk> were <unk> with less <unk> in which .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many <unk> of the <unk> that you have to have a <unk> and it &apos;s perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that we could do a different choice that would be better . And that &apos;s what &apos;s going to <unk> us to <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of choice , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the decision , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> ,
even when it was an <unk> decision .
So , you have , more easy to <unk> any <unk> that is <unk> of the choice .
And , there &apos;s what the <unk> call <unk> .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very good as well as the value that we do things to <unk> things from what <unk> .
And you know , when there are many <unk> , it &apos;s easy to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s less <unk> .
That &apos;s a example . I &apos;m <unk> with all the ones that are not in New York .
But it &apos;s what it &apos;s probably <unk> .
There &apos;s this <unk> <unk> .
A place of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not <unk> . But what he think he &apos;s , &quot; Well , it &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
&quot; all my <unk> are <unk> . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And it <unk> two weeks <unk> from the idea that &apos;s <unk> -- every day -- the <unk> of <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for that we have , as the choice .
And the most <unk> we have <unk> from <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here &apos;s another example .
This <unk> says a lot of things .
It &apos;s about live the moment , and maybe of the time .
But the most important point is that any of you are <unk> , you know , you know , you know , other .
The things that are not <unk> that they can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> .
I tried to my skin <unk> a new <unk> .
It &apos;s almost always <unk> .
Once the <unk> were <unk> , just a lot of them , <unk> and <unk> , they were <unk> , only after <unk> , they were <unk> , just after <unk> a lot of times , they were <unk> to go .
So , I &apos;m going to <unk> a couple of when the <unk> were , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . &quot;
<unk> <unk> said , &quot; <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
<unk> them wants to <unk> or with <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> -- &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
I was <unk> , and after a little bit of , I want to say , &quot; I want the kind -- that was the only kind of <unk> , so that it was a <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then I had <unk> <unk> , with the best <unk> , with the <unk> , with the <unk> , <unk> , with the <unk> , <unk> , with the <unk> , I had never <unk> .
It was <unk> . With that choice I had <unk> the best .
But I &apos;m going to <unk> .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for <unk> .
The reason I was going to be <unk> with all that choice of my <unk> were <unk> , <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
I had <unk> <unk> . I didn &apos;t <unk> me . I don &apos;t <unk> when you &apos;re just going to do it , when we &apos;re going to be perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After I was <unk> <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in life of the people who don &apos;t do that <unk> the <unk> that these are <unk> <unk> .
And this <unk> <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of the <unk> of the <unk> .
Because if I &apos;m going to do it , I &apos;m talking about .
The truth <unk> <unk> .
&quot; He was better when you were going to be better when you were better when you were worse when you were going to be possible to <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world we live -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> citizens with the <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are <unk> to the <unk> .
You never have <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; Yeah , you want to do it . &quot;
I mean -- I mean -- I &apos;m really <unk> , and my wife is really <unk> .
I could not do better , I &apos;m not <unk> .
But I &apos;m not always <unk> is a <unk> .
<unk> , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> when there &apos;s only that kind of <unk> when you &apos;re not <unk> , and you &apos;re not <unk> , and you ask you , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who &apos;s <unk> ? &quot; What is <unk> .
So the world is the <unk> . What can I do it ?
When there are hundreds of <unk> , and you have a <unk> , and you <unk> , you know who &apos;s <unk> , is clear that <unk> you are .
You could do better .
With hundreds of <unk> <unk> , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people <unk> decisions , even though the result is <unk> , you get <unk> and <unk> to their own .
In the last years , the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only , but -- of this <unk> of <unk> , is that people have <unk> <unk> because they &apos;re too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation , they think that their <unk> is .
So the final result is that in general we &apos;re better , but we &apos;re going to <unk> , but we &apos;re going to <unk> .
I &apos;m going to tell you you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely <unk> . It &apos;s completely true . It &apos;s completely true .
There &apos;s no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk> , but by this is not going to be better than a little bit better choice .
There &apos;s a <unk> value , <unk> . I don &apos;t know what .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve <unk> from a piece of a piece of the <unk> that we <unk> our life .
Now , from the <unk> <unk> -- I &apos;ve almost <unk> -- I &apos;ve almost <unk> -- from the <unk> <unk> .
What it allows all this to choice in <unk> society is the <unk> material .
There are many places in the world , and you have <unk> , where the problem is not that they &apos;re going to <unk> .
The problem is that they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> that I &apos;m talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what it does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> you &apos;ve talked about yesterday about how those <unk> and <unk> for <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> of money .
I mean that these choices , <unk> and <unk> , it &apos;s not just <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
They do it .
If you have a little bit of what our society <unk> to <unk> choice in those where people have too much chance , it would be <unk> their life to <unk> , but our life .
This is what the <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of the income does good at all -- not just the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that <unk> us .
So , I &apos;m going to <unk> , you can become all you want to ...
<unk> , people who are <unk> , <unk> , &quot; What &apos;s what &apos;s ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s <unk> that you can &apos;t make a <unk> of glass . &quot;
&quot; A <unk> imagination , a <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And I <unk> it , I <unk> it so , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , instead of <unk> , I &apos;ve got to <unk> that fish knows .
Because the reality of the fact that if you <unk> in <unk> , the way that , &quot; You know , it &apos;s possible . You can &apos;t <unk> the freedom . It &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
If you look at the way that we can <unk> the <unk> .
I &apos;m going to <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> .
They all need a <unk> .
This is almost too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and it &apos;s certainly for us .
But the <unk> of a few <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
