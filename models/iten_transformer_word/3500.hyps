The last year I showed these <unk> for <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> , which almost three million years of the <unk> <unk> , is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> percent .
And so I think this <unk> <unk> of the problem because it doesn &apos;t <unk> the ice <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a sense , the heart <unk> of the global warming .
They <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in <unk> .
As you see , you can see blue <unk> .
And that &apos;s the ice in <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> in the summer .
You can see that the ice <unk> , of five or more , it &apos;s like the <unk> , which is <unk> from the body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been <unk> by so .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> around the <unk> around the ocean <unk> , where there are huge amount of <unk> that , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> by global warming , that might be <unk> , this point of <unk> , <unk> this point of <unk> .
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is already <unk> by water .
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> with a team <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : She &apos;s good . <unk> : She &apos;s good .
A reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> never <unk> it has ever <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how you <unk> <unk> the sea <unk> to <unk> the sea <unk> <unk> , here is where the sea <unk> .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
<unk> other side of the planet : <unk> , the biggest <unk> of ice .
The month <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> that the <unk> of ice is in <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> on some <unk> , is particularly <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> at six feet of <unk> , like <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the third <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , which is a few years ago .
<unk> percent of the world &apos;s population <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : this <unk> is the source of water <unk> of this city .
The <unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same happens to <unk> water .
In California <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are in crisis .
<unk> , as you read , you know , they &apos;re <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> in the world <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and <unk> .
So sometimes I mean , the last 30 years of <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> .
If you look at the context , you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years , we &apos;ve <unk> <unk> million <unk> every day -- 25 million <unk> in the ocean every day .
Look at the area of the <unk> area , by <unk> , and <unk> on both <unk> , and both the <unk> of the oxygen <unk> , where there is a <unk> <unk> <unk> oxygen .
The <unk> of global warming , and <unk> , and <unk> , that &apos;s 20 percent , is the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The oil is a problem , and <unk> is even more than it .
The United States is one of the two countries with the <unk> .
And you &apos;re going to build a lot of other <unk> .
But we &apos;re <unk> to a <unk> of direction .
These are the projects around the last few years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
In every way , there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> in our country .
The <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I <unk> image to me something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , and I live in a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen it on the <unk> .
This is the second <unk> of <unk> in America .
It &apos;s happened around <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> of <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> is a <unk> and happy .
It &apos;s <unk> here in America , and it &apos;s <unk> our economy .
<unk> the <unk> is more <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> price , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : So , I &apos;m <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
The biggest society <unk> <unk> on the <unk> is <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> -- <unk> -- <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- not know what they &apos;re talking about .
<unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> <unk> <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them , a part .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> we see the changes <unk> as a <unk> <unk> <unk> to our business .
For this <unk> , is <unk> a great amount of money in a <unk> <unk> for the public <unk> and <unk> the truth of the truth and <unk> the truth of <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it &apos;s <unk> -- it &apos;s also a good <unk> .
So , not <unk> of climate change .
We could do it .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you &apos;ve heard about a lot of .
So I &apos;m going to <unk> a <unk> <unk> to <unk> how much <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> cars are a little bit , but this is the sound of the sound of the <unk> of technology .
The <unk> of <unk> is <unk> between global warming , but the <unk> technology , but the <unk> technology of <unk> that you see that .
And I look at this is the <unk> technology of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> America &apos;s in the crisis , the economy , the <unk> crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all : our <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> , like <unk> <unk> <unk> and oil <unk> .
Now , so , there &apos;s a new , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> , in 10 years .
A <unk> <unk> America &apos;s work , <unk> <unk> , <unk> more <unk> , and help <unk> the global warming .
<unk> , a solution that we &apos;re going to solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : This is the last .
<unk> : <unk> : It &apos;s about energy in America .
One of the most <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , the sun , a new <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> two : <unk> <unk> for places for places .
<unk> : <unk> America . It &apos;s time to be <unk> .
<unk> : A old <unk> <unk> says , &quot; If you want to go to <unk> , you go to the <unk> , you go to go to the <unk> , you go to go to the <unk> , you want to go to the <unk> , you want to go to the <unk> , &quot; If
If you want to go back , you go back to the <unk> . &quot;
We have to go back , and quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to <unk> <unk> for <unk> on how it works .
So I &apos;m going to go . And for those who was not , the biggest experiment is the biggest experiment .
<unk> is <unk> the <unk> that they were <unk> in the universe -- and the beginning of a second <unk> of the universe -- to <unk> million times the second of the universe .
All that &apos;s just <unk> .
This is the car <unk> .
<unk> these <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> <unk> feet and a <unk> <unk> <unk> feet .
This is a <unk> image of <unk> in this building so you can see that you can see the <unk> .
The 10 <unk> <unk> year we &apos;ve <unk> the machine for the first time .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was because of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of control .
It &apos;s a image of the first <unk> of <unk> that he did all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , with a <unk> part of the first <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
In other words , when I <unk> that image the <unk> , the <unk> that the <unk> machine , the <unk> that &apos;s great <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if it was to us more or this , when someone <unk> on Google and <unk> that the page was this .
And that means we had a <unk> impact over the <unk> .
I was going to be a week , with the machine , to have a problem with this <unk> -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the machine works at the <unk> of <unk> .
Now , the <unk> between you <unk> and <unk> , &quot; <unk> &apos;t true . I &apos;m too much . &quot;
And instead of they can do it because they &apos;re very <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , at less <unk> degrees , at a <unk> <unk> <unk> to that <unk> of the space between the stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> between the <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is more <unk> if you think you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and that you have <unk> of about 30 <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We have them <unk> and <unk> .
Now , they &apos;re going to be <unk> all of them .
<unk> the end of the <unk> will be again again .
<unk> , and we <unk> to get <unk> of data to <unk> or <unk> , and so we can go to find what we &apos;re the <unk> that <unk> the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these <unk> <unk> <unk> the value of the value of the <unk> science and <unk> <unk> .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that , I think is this <unk> value of things like <unk> .
I want to end with the words of a <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> of his <unk> , his <unk> <unk> <unk> , he said , &quot; No , &quot; <unk> is <unk> for the human mind , &quot; <unk> is not <unk> for the human mind .
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> to <unk> when , <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
And as <unk> as <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , and we &apos;re going to think and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way you can <unk> the world around us .
So , by <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I <unk> together to my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I started <unk> , &quot; and we use a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
and <unk> to our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that I thought I was going to <unk> the answer .
In the <unk> words , a <unk> computer is a <unk> .
In the <unk> words , a <unk> computer is a <unk> .
You can <unk> them with your hand , they can <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> , the way they have a <unk> and a <unk> <unk> .
But <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> objects , like <unk> , they can just <unk> .
The <unk> are the example of a new <unk> <unk> to <unk> the digital information .
And then he <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of the movement , and <unk> hand , and <unk> that they become more <unk> , and <unk> that they become more <unk> , and we can <unk> new <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m going to be a simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show you of the video -- if you <unk> it in a direction , the video <unk> so if you <unk> from the other <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of other .
If you <unk> them , you know what &apos;s around .
If they &apos;re <unk> , they can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit .
If they &apos;re <unk> , they can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit .
<unk> also their movement and <unk> .
We then <unk> that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> was that one of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; a color like a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as <unk> of <unk> and I can <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and I can <unk> for <unk> <unk> , where you <unk> .
If you &apos;re too much , we can <unk> a little bit .
I &apos;m also <unk> you to <unk> , like <unk> , the <unk> , and <unk> of <unk> where people can try and <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
Now I &apos;m --
This is a <unk> of <unk> I do with a program of <unk> <unk> .
So , we have a game of words that is <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , to every <unk> <unk> a letter of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to every <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds you <unk> , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
So here &apos;s <unk> children in <unk> <unk> <unk> , I did it in a way that I <unk> them and I <unk> a video .
They &apos;re <unk> .
And one of the interesting things that this is that you don &apos;t have to <unk> people who have to <unk> people .
I just say , &quot; <unk> of words , &quot; and they know exactly what I do .
Here &apos;s other people who <unk> .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s more young , there &apos;s <unk> .
In fact , just wanted to <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
I <unk> to build a <unk> <unk> . He &apos;s <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the <unk> , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the <unk> , <unk> their <unk> .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now , he brought a <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> work !
So , <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can make the <unk> the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with <unk> , and it can tell him how you <unk> you .
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with <unk> , and it can tell him how you <unk> you .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I &apos;ve got the last example of the <unk> , I &apos;ve been a <unk> , for <unk> and music .
It &apos;s a <unk> , <unk> <unk> and music .
The <unk> here is <unk> by <unk> as the <unk> , and the <unk> .
<unk> of these four different <unk> , and you can choose to use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I just just <unk> a sound &quot; and a <unk> <unk> . &quot;
These are actually you can control from the <unk> , like the <unk> and <unk> .
I <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are the fact , they &apos;re <unk> like time and <unk> , you know , you know , you know , and then you <unk> to the whole <unk> .
<unk> like this .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> a <unk> in two <unk> &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> in a series , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , the other <unk> .
Now , I &apos;m going to <unk> a <unk> line .
<unk> : <unk> : Now , I &apos;m going to be <unk> <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> : And now I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> <unk> , so I can control the effect from live .
<unk> : I can <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> the whole time from a <unk> time or another .
<unk> : <unk> : And now I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> to give more <unk> .
<unk> : I can <unk> the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> , <unk> more or more <unk> .
And now , finally , I can <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> , and so that &apos;s how our brain work and body .
And today , I had time to show one of the results of this <unk> , and some chance that we &apos;re going to take out of the lab .
The concept I want to <unk> is that is <unk> this new generation of <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> with the media <unk> , which we want to <unk> .
Thank you very much .
I can &apos;t see the now of you .
I &apos;m a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> but it &apos;s more than this , of course .
It &apos;s also the love and the <unk> of my life .
And it doesn &apos;t look like that .
But , this one of the particular thing is happened in my life and in my career , and my career , and I was <unk> to <unk> the whole whole work .
The particular thing is I &apos;ve been <unk> this book , this <unk> called &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; which , <unk> the <unk> <unk> , &quot; which <unk> , <unk> <unk> , for some reason for some <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that everywhere , people like <unk> me , if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
I &apos;m going to be <unk> to me and say , &quot; You don &apos;t have to be able to do better ?
You have no <unk> to write to write to write for all life without more life .
What can you get somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> , you know .
But it might go to the worse , I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I was <unk> to say , I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk> .
I <unk> to the same <unk> from the <unk> .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t <unk> to be able to be <unk> ?
You don &apos;t <unk> you that the <unk> of the <unk> you ?
You have no <unk> to do this <unk> for all the life without any life that you &apos;re going to be out and <unk> on a <unk> of dreams , with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
so you know , you know .
The answer -- the <unk> answer to all these questions is , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
And I &apos;m going to be <unk> of all those things .
I &apos;ve always had <unk> .
And I also have to be <unk> of other things that people could not <unk> .
As <unk> <unk> and other things .
But , as I think about what I thought I thought and I thought I thought , and I thought ?
Is it <unk> ?
It &apos;s <unk> that anyone who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you could be <unk> to do .
But what &apos;s so particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> ?
How do my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and I don &apos;t remember one time in his <unk> , and I don &apos;t think if they were <unk> to be <unk> ?
So , it &apos;s never -- that <unk> of John <unk> , like ?
<unk> &apos;t so that , <unk> ?
<unk> , the engineers like <unk> group , not have <unk> , in <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve <unk> , we have enough to this <unk> , and not only <unk> <unk> , but we have this <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
And I don &apos;t want to look at the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that only in the <unk> century , <unk> <unk> , and often for them .
And even the ones that you don &apos;t know , they &apos;re really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before <unk> , in the last <unk> said , &quot; Every one of my life <unk> <unk> a little bit more than your work .
But I don &apos;t <unk> when you &apos;re going to say because we heard these things so long , we &apos;ve heard that <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are <unk> in some way , and <unk> it <unk> to <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> all here today is : <unk> you all the idea ?
I &apos;m going to do this , because even <unk> by a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk> , right to me not well .
I think it &apos;s <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s also <unk> and I don &apos;t want to <unk> <unk> in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better <unk> our great <unk> to live .
And I know that , in my case -- in my <unk> -- it would be very <unk> to start to <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in my career .
<unk> -- you look at , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;ve been <unk> .
I &apos;ve still <unk> four <unk> of work in me .
And it &apos;s very <unk> that any <unk> of the world as the <unk> <unk> from the world as the work that <unk> after the last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we &apos;re all more or less friends here -- it &apos;s <unk> that my biggest <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , who &apos;s <unk> !
You know , this is the kind of thought that <unk> a person to start <unk> <unk> to <unk> nine <unk> <unk> , and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would like to do this work I love .
So , the question is , how ?
And so it seems to me , after many <unk> , which the way to work is to write what I would make a <unk> <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to find a <unk> <unk> of <unk> between me , and my natural <unk> <unk> on what I &apos;m <unk> , and my natural <unk> on what he <unk> to get it . And as we &apos;re going to look at the time , to look at the time , to find the world , to find the best ideas , and I &apos;m going to find out of the <unk> ideas .
<unk> to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that <unk> me to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
because I &apos;m going to <unk> because they <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- people don &apos;t believe that the <unk> <unk> that creativity from men , OK ?
It &apos;s <unk> that creativity is this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> that they were <unk> to <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for reasons , and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity <unk> <unk> of creativity &quot; <unk> . &quot;
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
The <unk> were the same idea , but they <unk> that species of the <unk> of the same <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> , because the <unk> doesn &apos;t really <unk> that a <unk> was really <unk> someone .
I thought that a <unk> was this sort of <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of a <unk> artist , a little bit like <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> out of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , that &apos;s the <unk> of which I talk -- that <unk> you &apos;re going to <unk> you from your work .
And everybody &apos;s so that it was so that you would say , right ?
So the artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like to <unk> the <unk> too , no ?
If your work was not <unk> <unk> all the <unk> , all the <unk> , all <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it wasn &apos;t all your <unk> , right ?
All the <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> <unk> the creativity in <unk> creativity to be <unk> .
Then the <unk> <unk> and everything , and <unk> this big idea ; we put the human human <unk> , and we put the human <unk> and <unk> without <unk> to <unk> space and <unk> without <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
This was the <unk> of the <unk> and people who think that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And for the first time in history , you get to <unk> this <unk> or that <unk> as a <unk> <unk> that as a person who &apos;s rather than a person with <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think that was a big <unk> .
I think you &apos;re going to <unk> someone , a simple person to believe that you can believe in a <unk> like the source , and the <unk> of all the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s like to ask someone to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> all these <unk> <unk> on <unk> .
And I think it was this <unk> to <unk> artists in the <unk> artists in <unk> .
And if this is true , and I think that &apos;s the question , and I think it &apos;s , and now ?
We can do that ?
I could go back to a more <unk> of the relationship between human <unk> and <unk> .
Or maybe it doesn &apos;t .
Maybe we can &apos;t <unk> 500 years of thought in a <unk> talk .
And probably there is people in the audience that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you do people who <unk> people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to their projects .
You can &apos;t <unk> you all on this thing .
But the question I &apos;d like to <unk> is -- why don &apos;t ?
Why don &apos;t you know , why ?
Because it has more sense of every other thing that has heard about <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A process that you &apos;re ever going to be <unk> to do something -- so , all here -- knows , you know , you don &apos;t <unk> .
And , in fact , it can &apos;t seem to be completely <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> , but that has now been <unk> , but that was a <unk> for all the life and he said that during his <unk> <unk> in his <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> it <unk> <unk> .
I said that was like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> <unk> to her <unk> .
I <unk> it , because he did it <unk> the land on his feet .
I &apos;ve got to have one thing to do that point and was , &quot; <unk> as a <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And so I <unk> it to home and he was <unk> by this <unk> , and he didn &apos;t have to take a piece of paper and a <unk> <unk> , and a <unk> <unk> <unk> on the page .
And sometimes it doesn &apos;t <unk> to be <unk> , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without <unk> it to go into home and <unk> it would be able to <unk> to <unk> through the <unk> , and he would <unk> through the <unk> , and he would have <unk> to <unk> it . &quot;
Then there were those times -- this piece of piece -- there was some <unk> that the <unk> was almost <unk> , OK ?
So , he was <unk> at home and he was trying to <unk> and <unk> the <unk> through , and I <unk> a <unk> in the <unk> , and then he was like <unk> , and then he said , and he was like <unk> with the other hand and <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on his body and <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the page and <unk> , but the <unk> <unk> , from the last word .
So when I <unk> it -- it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s just <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not all my process is not a <unk> !
I &apos;m a <unk> , and my way of <unk> is ; I &apos;m going to <unk> the same <unk> every day and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on <unk> .
But even I have to my <unk> , I <unk> against that , sometimes .
And I thought that also <unk> many of you <unk> the <unk> .
You know , even if the work and the ideas and ideas would have to be <unk> .
And what &apos;s this ?
And how can we <unk> to do it in it way to do it , but rather , rather , rather , that we <unk> ?
So , how I &apos;m going to me , the best example I &apos;ve got to <unk> <unk> , which I &apos;ve <unk> different years ago for a <unk> .
I &apos;m talking about this , and you know , <unk> , <unk> for the <unk> of life was the <unk> <unk> <unk> , trying to control , trying to control , <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> .
But then I <unk> , you <unk> , and a day , and he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> everything .
<unk> <unk> , and everything I &apos;m going to be <unk> this little <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s <unk> in his head like <unk> , <unk> and it wants to the <unk> , and it &apos;s wonderful , and it &apos;s wonderful , and it &apos;s <unk> , but it doesn &apos;t <unk> .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , not a <unk> , it &apos;s not a <unk> .
So it starts to hear this sort of <unk> <unk> in <unk> , &quot; I &apos;m going to <unk> , and <unk> by this song .
I &apos;m not <unk> enough and I can &apos;t <unk> . &quot;
And instead of <unk> , you know , you know .
And I <unk> the whole process and he &apos;s something completely new .
<unk> just the sky and said , &quot; <unk> , you don &apos;t see that I &apos;m <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Do you know that you can write a song ?
If you want to <unk> , you want to <unk> , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you want to <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> to <unk> other today .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And his process <unk> <unk> after this .
It &apos;s not the work , the work was still <unk> .
But the process , and the <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when I <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> it back to the other things that was not going to be a <unk> thing and <unk> .
But I &apos;m going to <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and <unk> that I don &apos;t have <unk> .
So how I <unk> that story to change a little bit of the way I <unk> and I &apos;ve already <unk> a time .
This idea , I was <unk> when I was <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; and I <unk> in a <unk> of those <unk> <unk> in the <unk> that we &apos;re working on something that we &apos;re working on something and we &apos;re working on something that will be <unk> .
Not just <unk> , just the book <unk> .
And I think of <unk> this project .
But then I was going to <unk> <unk> that <unk> to the air and <unk> .
So I <unk> my face in the <unk> and I <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I said , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , what we know if this book is not going to be <unk> <unk> my <unk> , no ?
Because you see how I &apos;m going to <unk> all that I have , I don &apos;t have more than this .
So if you want to <unk> and you have to do and your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know what you do .
I had to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to say , I would like to <unk> my <unk> , &quot; Why -- I &apos;m going to be <unk> in the end of the <unk> in Africa of Africa the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> that <unk> and music to <unk> it <unk> and <unk> it to <unk> and <unk> it to <unk> hours .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every so , you know , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists in fact ,
And I know you know what I talk to you , because I know you &apos;ve all seen , a <unk> .
It was like the time you <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> through a species of <unk> and not doing anything different from the <unk> , like <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s all <unk> .
And it doesn &apos;t just <unk> like human human .
But you get up from <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people <unk> what was , I <unk> it with his name .
<unk> your hands and <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , God , God , God , &quot; God , God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> <unk> with their <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; which you can feel in <unk> or <unk> .
In <unk> , when a artist has done something impossible to impossible and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>
And it &apos;s <unk> because we need .
But the problem is the day , it &apos;s going to <unk> the same <unk> , when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 <unk> of God , and <unk> <unk> <unk> God , and they &apos;re not more .
It &apos;s just a <unk> with <unk> , and maybe you can &apos;t <unk> to <unk> that <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God , and what &apos;s going to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so <unk> if you could not believe , <unk> , which the <unk> <unk> of your <unk> .
But I just just <unk> you to get data in <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of your life you have to <unk> it .
And , you know , if you think in this way .
And so I started to <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> as I &apos;ve <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> , the book of the book that <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And what I have to go to <unk> when I feel like this is , not <unk> .
I don &apos;t have to <unk> .
<unk> to <unk> your part , you can be .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for a just <unk> moment through your <unk> , then you &apos;re going to be <unk> ! &quot;
<unk> , you do it , your <unk> .
And I said ! &quot; You &apos;re going to do it .
I think and I think I think you <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot; <unk> to you , just to only <unk> for the same human <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As you know , I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects on the human genome on the human genome on the <unk> of new <unk> .
Now we &apos;re going to <unk> a new <unk> , we started to <unk> biology and now we &apos;re going to <unk> the digital <unk> in a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We &apos;ve always been doing <unk> questions .
&quot; <unk> is the life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many <unk> I think they &apos;re going to understand <unk> .
We tried different <unk> , <unk> to <unk> terms .
We &apos;re going to be 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome is <unk> to <unk> by the world &apos;s <unk> <unk> of the computer <unk> .
Now , we can <unk> the life , or to create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small <unk> , which is the <unk> <unk> , which is the species from the <unk> <unk> .
And we tried to <unk> the genome to <unk> the genome for <unk> a more small <unk> .
We are able to <unk> a <unk> of genes that are here .
But when we give a look at the map , it &apos;s <unk> simple than our .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one time , it &apos;s very <unk> that can bring a <unk> .
So I thought the only <unk> that the only <unk> <unk> this <unk> <unk> in a way of <unk> <unk> <unk> some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of &quot; Can we <unk> a <unk> ? &quot;
So , the <unk> of <unk> that we never have to create before ?
And , in <unk> , we can make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of material <unk> .
The speed that we &apos;re able to <unk> the life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the code , instead of <unk> , rather <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> .
And our most <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on a <unk> <unk> .
We have <unk> more than 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> many <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before <unk> the first <unk> .
But we found that <unk> <unk> of DNA is very difficult .
There are <unk> of thousands of cars to the world that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> of DNA <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> process : the most <unk> <unk> is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> is .
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , to the first <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a little virus that <unk> bacteria .
We have <unk> the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part is when we put this piece of material <unk> <unk> and we have <unk> in bacteria , bacteria have <unk> to read this <unk> <unk> and <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> are <unk> back and <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> back and they have <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;ve talked about the <unk> <unk> that they have been <unk> that they have been <unk> this model .
They have <unk> more than you .
And I think that &apos;s a situation where software software can actually build his same <unk> in a <unk> system .
But I would <unk> to do the more <unk> .
I <unk> to build the whole <unk> .
I &apos;m more <unk> <unk> <unk> of code .
So we thought of <unk> in <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> is the <unk> of a <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> , and if you <unk> with information <unk> in a computer , these have to be very <unk> .
When I <unk> this genome for the first time in the <unk> <unk> <unk> was a <unk> <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We found that , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If you used that <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> never <unk> .
A part of the process is design <unk> <unk> <unk> that you <unk> with all other <unk> of the other <unk> <unk> for more small <unk> that <unk> together .
<unk> <unk> <unk> here .
You &apos;ve probably read that <unk> us <unk> .
So , we have a <unk> code on four <unk> : <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together , and there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and there &apos;s one <unk> <unk> .
So we can use the code for <unk> words , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did at the beginning was <unk> .
Some have been <unk> by the fact that it was not <unk> .
We &apos;ve <unk> these <unk> <unk> just just <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them .
And we started to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , at every step , we &apos;ve got these <unk> in <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re <unk> to create a very <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re trying to <unk> the process .
So , this seems to <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
When I <unk> these <unk> <unk> much , more than 100 <unk> <unk> , they don &apos;t <unk> it up in the <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> biology .
So we have <unk> other <unk> .
I &apos;m going to be another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> to <unk> DNA <unk> <unk> .
Here &apos;s a example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , it can <unk> three million <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> <unk> .
In 12 hours , it &apos;s <unk> exactly how it was before .
<unk> of thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can <unk> completely .
<unk> live in <unk> .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and you can find new <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In fact , the real , the NASA has showed this .
This is a image of <unk> that we &apos;ve built these <unk> , just using these <unk> , just using <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This image wasn &apos;t <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a time of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> that we &apos;ve done a little time ago .
I &apos;m more <unk> <unk> of code .
It &apos;s the biggest <unk> of a <unk> structure ever <unk> by the man .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , we <unk> <unk> <unk> pages only <unk> pages only to <unk> this code .
Now , how do we do it ?
<unk> , <unk> a virus is a <unk> game .
It &apos;s a little more <unk> when they use it .
It &apos;s more simple when it &apos;s been <unk> cells like our <unk> : you just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is that <unk> <unk> and <unk> another , which is that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In <unk> <unk> the <unk> is instead of <unk> in the cell , but we <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re able to do a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> from a <unk> cell phone <unk> .
We have a <unk> <unk> from a species .
The two are different than men as <unk> by <unk> .
We have <unk> some <unk> in the way to <unk> that you could choose to <unk> this <unk> .
And he &apos;s <unk> with <unk> <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> <unk> the new <unk> <unk> the new <unk> .
And they were <unk> that they didn &apos;t go over , but we tried to <unk> more <unk> in there .
This is one of the most <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have a second or a third <unk> <unk> from some <unk> , <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> <unk> <unk> in that species .
So who think about evolution as a only <unk> to the time you can &apos;t have much of the biology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> DNA .
The <unk> that was in the cell .
The <unk> <unk> that we have <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , and he <unk> the other <unk> material , and it &apos;s <unk> , and we <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk> .
It &apos;s become blue <unk> , because of genes we have <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species are <unk> . And it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> of all in the new software , <unk> on the new software that we have <unk> in the <unk> .
All the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the code exactly what we &apos;ve <unk> .
Now , this might be <unk> <unk> , but we can change the software , but we can change the things in a <unk> .
Now , I &apos;ve already <unk> that here is not about <unk> -- but it &apos;s not about three million years and a half million years of the <unk> , and we already said that maybe we &apos;re probably to create a new <unk> <unk> <unk> in this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Why do ?
I think it &apos;s enough to <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We &apos;re going to <unk> six billion and a half billion people to <unk> billion years .
Right to a example , I was born in <unk> .
Now , there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> , there &apos;s four .
We &apos;re going to find food now to find food , <unk> and <unk> for six billion and a half billion people .
<unk> again , it &apos;s more <unk> billion .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , more billion <unk> , more than 30 billion <unk> .
This means percent of <unk> a day .
When we &apos;re going to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process of process for <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
In the most <unk> we have to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the atmosphere .
So , I &apos;m going to <unk> <unk> in the world , we have a <unk> <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like thinking that are <unk> <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry just a <unk> about <unk> , and you think about how many different things are <unk> .
Our <unk> here are <unk> data from the <unk> , and our imagination .
We have <unk> <unk> , thank you , thank you to <unk> <unk> , in able to create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We are able to build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a million <unk> .
Think of these 20 million genes or <unk> , and to try to <unk> the <unk> to produce or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , because we can change , because of a little <unk> , and more <unk> biology .
And it &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> .
We can <unk> to <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we &apos;re working on that we &apos;re working on and design species to make a computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how to be .
We know exactly how their code is their code .
Now we &apos;re going to <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> .
You saw you also saw that <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment .
We have <unk> <unk> and third generation that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> or different <unk> of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> the <unk> of the first <unk> that we can <unk> to design cells that we can <unk> this <unk> , and we think we can think we have the first <unk> in the first <unk> of the first <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> with the CO2 is a <unk> <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we have <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> in the ocean , <unk> <unk> feet of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> by the <unk> <unk> as well as energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can <unk> the CO2 , which can be <unk> by <unk> , <unk> that <unk> CO2 in <unk> , to <unk> this process .
So , we think we might think we could be able to <unk> what the question is , &quot; what the <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> the whole <unk> of <unk> the whole <unk> industry .
<unk> . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can &apos;t it ?
<unk> a <unk> of energy .
And also , working working for using <unk> <unk> .
You saw this year with flu , we &apos;re always back to a year and a dollar dollar a dollar less when you &apos;re going to find the <unk> .
I think that you can change <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
So here &apos;s how future could start <unk> , now , the tree of the evolution , the tree , <unk> the evolution of the evolution , and then <unk> <unk> .
We are at so much <unk> people .
Our <unk> is to make it in a way of live long long long long long long long long . Thank you very much .
So , I &apos;m going to show you , the most <unk> <unk> , I think , the most fundamental technology that we have to <unk> in <unk> a year ago .
It &apos;s about a environment that you can <unk> is a local level that you can <unk> with a huge amount of data .
So , we &apos;re seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> with a species of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a <unk> <unk> , <unk> the images like we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much the amount of information that we see , how big these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Most of the <unk> are <unk> , but this for example is a <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t do any difference because the only thing that you <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> in your screen . It &apos;s also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data not images .
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> a <unk> .
So , I think it &apos;s just about the <unk> and not images , we can do something like that , to see that is a real <unk> of the <unk> , not a real <unk> of the <unk> , not a picture of the <unk> .
It might be a little bit of <unk> to read a book .
I don &apos;t <unk> it .
This is a <unk> example . It &apos;s about a number of the <unk> .
Every image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it &apos;s really the <unk> experience and the good experience of read the real version of a <unk> , which is for a <unk> , which is for a <unk> of a half .
We also have something that &apos;s <unk> with the <unk> .
We &apos;ve created a <unk> <unk> <unk> much more than that you use in a normal <unk> , and we &apos;ve <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see here .
Or other models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
And I thought that this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to <unk> and other <unk> like to be <unk> .
And of course , the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> to this kind of technology .
And on this one I don &apos;t want to <unk> time , if we don &apos;t know that we have <unk> to be able to <unk> in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. <unk> <unk> <unk> on a <unk> image of NASA .
So now I &apos;m going to do something else .
This is now actually <unk> from the Web ; you can see it .
It &apos;s about a project called <unk> , which I &apos;m going to be two different technologies .
A <unk> is <unk> and the other is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , a lot of interesting <unk> , one of the <unk> of the <unk> of Washington , with the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s about the Web , <unk> <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can <unk> from a picture of the other and have this kind of experience to <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> <unk> here has actually a meaning .
So , <unk> of the computer <unk> have been <unk> these images together , in way that <unk> all the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and these things are <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re all <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;ve got to show you some other environment .
There are some more <unk> .
I want to go to one of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> that we did for the first time the summer for the first time , the summer <unk> to show you what the key technology is really the key <unk> . And it &apos;s not just to <unk> the <unk> that we have to <unk> in the <unk> in the <unk> .
We had to <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> images of <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So I &apos;m all <unk> images and they &apos;re all <unk> to <unk> at this way .
And it &apos;s possible to <unk> in this way .
You know , I never thought to end up to work to work .
It &apos;s very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think you &apos;re going to see that is a lot of different kinds of <unk> : from those <unk> <unk> , a number of <unk> , a number , <unk> <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , you know , I could try to try to <unk> those <unk> .
<unk> are <unk> by <unk> , and so
So , in the <unk> here is a series of pictures -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can <unk> from the <unk> to <unk> physics .
The <unk> is that we can do things with the social environment . This is now <unk> data from the whole <unk> <unk> of the whole <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> all of the data together .
All of those pictures are <unk> together , more of the <unk> of the <unk> .
You have a <unk> of the entire land that you can <unk> .
Think about this as a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> on Earth .
It &apos;s something that you could <unk> it in complexity , and the <unk> that people who <unk> it to <unk> it .
Their <unk> are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people .
If you get the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> <unk> the name , my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of those data , and I can use how <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the space , using that <unk> <unk> , using the <unk> <unk> , using the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> .
And of course , a <unk> of this is extremely <unk> <unk> of the land , <unk> not just by <unk> <unk> and <unk> by <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , but by <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What do ? What do is that your software is that your software is that you &apos;re going to be <unk> ?
<unk> : Yes . What &apos;s doing is doing it .
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> , if you want to <unk> , between images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the <unk> of the images .
The <unk> thing is very interesting if you think about <unk> information that many of these images .
As you have a <unk> <unk> of images on the Web , you <unk> a <unk> and the page on the page of the Web has many information about the Web .
Now , what happens if that picture is going to <unk> all your <unk> ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really huge . It &apos;s really huge .
CA : <unk> , it &apos;s really incredible .
<unk> : I &apos;m going to be very .
One of the <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> is the <unk> to live in the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I think that <unk> <unk> <unk> still <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> <unk> , and the idea that the <unk> of the <unk> , and the idea that we have not just <unk> in sense , but it &apos;s not just a sense of the <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> ,
<unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> <unk> that our <unk> <unk> , well , many <unk> ago .
And , of course , all of course , all of the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> . <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We have to <unk> the death of the death of the death of <unk> , and <unk> --
We all have a art .
What I think is the <unk> of the song , the <unk> of the song of the song of the song ,
It doesn &apos;t matter that the <unk> of the <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> .
And he was my <unk> <unk> <unk> in a month ago , or a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> of the world .
All these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of <unk> other ways of <unk> other ways of other ways , other ways of the world .
And if you <unk> a moment , it &apos;s a <unk> that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of the world create a <unk> of life <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet and <unk> that &apos;s important for the <unk> of the planet so that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in the human imagination .
The <unk> is the <unk> of humanity .
It &apos;s the <unk> of what we are and what we can be in the species .
And I <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all the species is , or it &apos;s <unk> , because it &apos;s <unk> , or <unk> -- and <unk> , or <unk> <unk> -- and <unk> not even <unk> <unk> -- and not even <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and you don &apos;t even have to <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of all this is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not just <unk> by a <unk> or <unk> <unk> of rules .
A language is the <unk> of human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle of the <unk> that <unk> of every culture is in the world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a <unk> , a <unk> thought , a <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , while we &apos;re <unk> here to <unk> , at least half the <unk> of children .
They &apos;re not going to be more <unk> to the children , which means , you know , that they &apos;re already <unk> .
What &apos;s more <unk> of the <unk> of being <unk> by the last <unk> , the last <unk> <unk> , not have to talk about a <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
This <unk> <unk> is the <unk> of someone in some of the world , every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks , and <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I know someone of you <unk> , &quot; <unk> &apos;t better so much ?
The world would not be a better place if you all the same language ? &quot; <unk> , we &apos;re going to talk .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> a <unk> thing that means that you can &apos;t talk to your language .
I &apos;d like to give me a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we &apos;re <unk> .
And many of us that when I say , &quot; different ways to <unk> &quot; I really think of different ways .
<unk> for example , this <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s about a <unk> that is not in the <unk> , because the blue color <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> a different person .
And all of that has <unk> in the past , yet <unk> is that in these <unk> <unk> that you &apos;re talking about six or seven <unk> to the <unk> <unk> nobody <unk> <unk> .
They were <unk> to <unk> and then I &apos;ll talk to me .
I &apos;m going to <unk> one of the most interesting <unk> with the <unk> <unk> , a incredible <unk> that has the first <unk> <unk> in the first <unk> .
In <unk> five <unk> have a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They did <unk> by the top <unk> that I <unk> them in <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , he never seen anything .
They have <unk> the land from the ground , they <unk> to <unk> a form or a <unk> and <unk> , not <unk> anything , they have <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> not only <unk> .
They <unk> between them .
<unk> percent of the <unk> was <unk> by their own .
We &apos;re <unk> to eight and we found two cases of death and <unk> when we have <unk> to know , they have <unk> that one of them was so that it &apos;s <unk> it , and then they have <unk> it . And then they have <unk> it .
The <unk> were able to <unk> the animal <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> the species .
<unk> <unk> , I was <unk> <unk> a really interesting <unk> when my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> me to <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> to <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
For a sense of <unk> , I would have to understand the culture <unk> and that <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s pretty <unk> <unk> vision .
<unk> interesting .
If you &apos;re going to you to <unk> the great <unk> of the world , what would you do ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
A continent is always <unk> out , thinking about Africa &apos;s not <unk> <unk> . And instead of <unk> . And it &apos;s not going to be that the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> .
What makes interesting <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> is <unk> between life and death .
So the <unk> do <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by <unk> <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> .
For this <unk> <unk> <unk> to say , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> to talk about God .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . &quot;
And the moment you &apos;re <unk> , is the spirit that you can tell you about it ?
So you &apos;re going to <unk> these incredible <unk> : <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a lot of power of power in the <unk> of power of the power of the power of the power of <unk> .
And we all <unk> with the <unk> that I &apos;ve been <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of the <unk> <unk> that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In a continent <unk> , this <unk> <unk> never been <unk> by <unk> by <unk> .
In <unk> today , I &apos;m <unk> by a <unk> , but their <unk> is <unk> <unk> .
The young <unk> are <unk> by <unk> <unk> to three , and they live in a world &apos;s <unk> in a world &apos;s <unk> and <unk> in a world &apos;s <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> of nine months <unk> <unk> by the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> who <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
For all this time , they &apos;re <unk> to the values of their society , values and just their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or just the <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or for the <unk> <unk> .
So , the <unk> of this incredible <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> <unk> and the first time in their life , at the time , they see a <unk> <unk> . And in that moment of the first <unk> <unk> , when the sun <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , everything that they &apos;re going to <unk> the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
&quot; <unk> <unk> ? <unk> <unk> you like .
It &apos;s <unk> . Now , it &apos;s going to be <unk> . &quot;
They call <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
This is extremely important .
When we think about <unk> and the environment <unk> <unk> and the <unk> history of the <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> <unk> in his <unk> or maybe we say , and we say that these <unk> are more <unk> to the Earth .
<unk> <unk> <unk> are not <unk> <unk> .
There &apos;s no space for these things in <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , but thank you to the time and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> : the concept that it can only be <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> , because it &apos;s just <unk> by the human <unk> .
What does it mean ?
I mean , that one of the <unk> that the mountain <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . It will be different <unk> and it will be different <unk> and it will have a <unk> of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that &apos;s the <unk> of one spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What is interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the <unk> between the <unk> and the natural world .
I &apos;ve <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
And so that I &apos;ve been different from my friends who think the <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you could <unk> that these <unk> can create actually make some <unk> , we &apos;re going to understand some <unk> <unk> .
I <unk> this picture to <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard about the <unk> , the most powerful <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
What makes it fascinating is not the potential of the <unk> <unk> , but his <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> by two elements .
At the side , this <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only one <unk> <unk> that <unk> a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit of the <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> with a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> said .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to <unk> , very <unk> , <unk> .
If you &apos;ll see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like to be <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea <unk> . It doesn &apos;t make a <unk> of the world .
I often think with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , with his <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> &apos; <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> my <unk> is not going to be <unk> these <unk> <unk> because if you &apos;re not going to tell you about being <unk> .
It &apos;s possible <unk> if you could only <unk> if you could only <unk> with <unk> .
Now , it &apos;s the good thing : <unk> that you have this <unk> <unk> <unk> , the same kind of <unk> , the same kind of <unk> . The question is , in a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , they do these <unk> <unk> <unk> , but they do not like these <unk> <unk> , but if they do this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
We use the big <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you <unk> to <unk> , we &apos;re going to <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
What does it mean ?
This <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that our eyes in the <unk> , and that our <unk> <unk> in the same species .
If you <unk> how to <unk> their <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of plants , the rest of you don &apos;t know ? &quot;
The solution is : <unk> <unk> <unk> in a night of <unk> and <unk> with a different <unk> .
So , with this is not <unk> , but it &apos;s much more interesting that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Now , <unk> the problem is that also the problem is that even the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , but some way to the <unk> of our history of the history of our world &apos;s <unk> , and over the real world .
In fact , the <unk> century , <unk> , not <unk> <unk> for his <unk> or his <unk> <unk> <unk> , but rather like the <unk> <unk> , but rather like the <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
All the <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a new <unk> for new <unk> .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , they don &apos;t have <unk> to be <unk> when they put it out and so they like <unk> <unk> , they have <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And if you <unk> a <unk> <unk> , they &apos;re not <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> and <unk> out of the <unk> <unk> that they go over the <unk> of their <unk> <unk> .
And I thought you &apos;re going to <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> --
<unk> a <unk> of <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , and now , and now <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
I <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or , in the case of <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> .
If you <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I &apos;m doing many <unk> <unk> , you &apos;ll see the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
As <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , but the <unk> of a <unk> , but the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of a <unk> , the <unk> of a <unk> , not only <unk> , but <unk> <unk> <unk> in some <unk> , because it &apos;s <unk> <unk> , because it &apos;s part of the development .
And you can &apos;t understand the <unk> of the <unk> until the beginning .
I &apos;ve got the <unk> miles from <unk> in China through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> with a young <unk> , but only <unk> <unk> to <unk> that &apos;s the <unk> of that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
The father &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that means that was <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> that he <unk> the <unk> in <unk> .
And he was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk> .
It &apos;s been <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> at the age of two years <unk> <unk> <unk> his <unk> because he didn &apos;t have to live without him .
The <unk> , who did the same , was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
A day has <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to work for seven years .
The <unk> of <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> is <unk> by <unk> .
And then finally , it &apos;s all <unk> to a choice .
<unk> to live in the world &apos;s <unk> or we want to <unk> the world of <unk> <unk> the world ?
The big <unk> <unk> , before he was <unk> to <unk> the most <unk> <unk> <unk> was that , in our <unk> to go to this <unk> <unk> of the world , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of the human imagination , but a day <unk> of the human imagination , but a day <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , which has given <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we &apos;re going to talk about <unk> , and we &apos;re talking about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has <unk> to <unk> 300 years .
And so that I don &apos;t <unk> that we have the answers to all the challenges that we &apos;re going to come to the <unk> .
When these <unk> <unk> of the world &apos;s <unk> to say , we asked to say , human <unk> with <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all <unk> the chance to be what we &apos;re : a kind of <unk> , which has to make it in the way that all the <unk> and all the <unk> can be <unk> .
I <unk> this picture of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> <unk> , and this man , and this man , and this man , <unk> me , and he <unk> me <unk> the wonderful <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The government <unk> is not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> the <unk> <unk> of our <unk> , we have <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man is <unk> .
The family , <unk> for his life , and <unk> all the <unk> , and all his <unk> .
I know that <unk> <unk> doesn &apos;t <unk> the cold , <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn &apos;t have <unk> by the night or <unk> from <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , you know , it &apos;s <unk> the <unk> in your skin . When I did <unk> it . When I did <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> of <unk> and when they <unk> <unk> a dog .
He &apos;s <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> , he <unk> another dog and it &apos;s <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> of <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> to talk about <unk> ? <unk> ? <unk> . And this , in different ways , <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> of the world .
<unk> <unk> the government has <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s their new <unk> . It &apos;s called <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , to end , I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> at least at least at least <unk> , the <unk> that they were not <unk> .
For someone is home .
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that we &apos;re going to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of these children , like the dreams of these children , they have <unk> <unk> <unk> of hope .
So , we &apos;ve got to end , we &apos;re <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I thought the <unk> --
<unk> <unk> is not <unk> , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best <unk> to tell the world . Every month our website .
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by million people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our audience in places , and we have to <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> <unk> for the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> : the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in the world , and we have to find a <unk> life in <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
which <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I &apos;ve heard in this book I hope you &apos;ve heard about some <unk> , and they were going to <unk> some <unk> them .
I want to start with what I call &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> <unk> ?
The <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> : &quot; If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot;
The reason is , from one side , in fact , in fact , the <unk> is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> for the human beings .
And so that &apos;s going to be in the fact that if we &apos;re <unk> , every one of us can do that what we <unk> our <unk> in our own <unk> , without no one that <unk> in our name .
The way to <unk> the <unk> is <unk> the choice .
The <unk> people have , more <unk> , and more <unk> , and more <unk> , more <unk> , more <unk> .
This , <unk> , it &apos;s so <unk> <unk> in society that nobody <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And it &apos;s also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what the <unk> is that this is possible .
This is my <unk> . It &apos;s not really big .
I was just a simple <unk> on the <unk> for <unk> .
In my <unk> , I &apos;m <unk> <unk> , without <unk> 10 <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that you can buy a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that nobody will be <unk> <unk> .
So here is how <unk> <unk> .
Then you go to the <unk> <unk> to buy one <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single one of <unk> , there &apos;s a big number of <unk> .
We can make six million and a half of <unk> using the <unk> that there are in a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice .
<unk> <unk> : the world &apos;s <unk> .
And once , when I was a child , you could get all the <unk> <unk> , to <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> the phone , not <unk> it .
A <unk> of that , between the other , the phone never <unk> .
These days I went .
We now have a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , especially between the <unk> .
Here &apos;s the future of the future .
My <unk> is what I &apos;m in a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you don &apos;t have seen it in the <unk> home , you &apos;re really <unk> in the <unk> home .
And what the end is that people go in the <unk> and it does this question . And you know , is the answer ? &quot; No answer . &quot;
It &apos;s not going to buy a phone that doesn &apos;t do anything else .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , you know , you know , the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> , not happens in the United States you &apos;re going to be <unk> and <unk> you have to do .
And , <unk> from <unk> , and the <unk> says , &quot; OK , we could do it , or <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> these <unk> and <unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> . What you want ? &quot;
You know , <unk> , what do you do ? &quot;
And the <unk> says , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> these <unk> and <unk> <unk> these <unk> , and <unk> these <unk> . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; <unk> if she was me , what <unk> ? &quot;
And the <unk> , &quot; But I don &apos;t have to be . &quot;
The result we call &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> that &apos;s a good thing .
But in fact , it &apos;s not that one <unk> the weight and the <unk> of the decisions and the <unk> of the decisions , and the <unk> <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> , and it doesn &apos;t have -- and not <unk> in the <unk> <unk> to take the patient .
There &apos;s a huge <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> people like me and you , if you think you don &apos;t think about it .
But if we can &apos;t <unk> , why do we <unk> them ?
The answer is that they want to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , I think that &apos;s our <unk> is a question of choice , as you see in this <unk> <unk> , &quot; we don &apos;t want to <unk> the <unk> . &quot; We don &apos;t want to be more <unk> . &quot;
And we can <unk> how many times we can <unk> .
The <unk> that means every <unk> , you have to <unk> you to know that kind of person want to be .
<unk> to the family and <unk> , a time the common perspective , <unk> almost <unk> to anyone , was that there &apos;s more possible , and you get to children , and you could <unk> the <unk> it could be able to children .
The only choice was with who , not when you don &apos;t even know what you would do .
<unk> , all that &apos;s really to play .
I would have to <unk> students and <unk> their 20 percent in less than I work in a time .
And because they don &apos;t have <unk> , because they &apos;re not less <unk> .
But why are I <unk> , <unk> to <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> or not ? <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> ? I &apos;ve got to think before children or to the <unk> ? &quot;
I &apos;m <unk> <unk> .
And they &apos;re trying to answer these questions , even if this <unk> doesn &apos;t <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and not a good <unk> to my <unk> .
And they really have to do that .
Now , the work : we &apos;re <unk> , as <unk> <unk> , because technology <unk> us to work every minute , every day , every day of the planet , <unk> that <unk> from <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> , and I don &apos;t tell you one that &apos;s <unk> .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this incredible choice that we have to do this <unk> ? It &apos;s what we have to <unk> , <unk> in every time , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son to play , with the <unk> in a <unk> , the <unk> in a <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And even if I &apos;m all <unk> , every minute we see our <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re also <unk> , &quot; I have to answer this called &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this <unk> ? I have to <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
And also when the answer is , &quot; that &apos;s not , &quot; that &apos;s <unk> experience of your <unk> child , very different from what would be in other conditions .
So , by any part of the things we look , and big objects , and great materials , life is a question of choices .
And once the world was this : <unk> , there was some chance , but it wasn &apos;t all the problem .
The world &apos;s <unk> today to this : The <unk> is , &quot; <unk> , &quot; Is it a <unk> thing , or <unk> ? &quot;
The answer is <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> them all , so I &apos;m going to talk about those <unk> .
And I think this choice is two <unk> on people .
The first , <unk> , it &apos;s that it <unk> .
With many <unk> between which you have , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I &apos;m going to give you a <unk> example : a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> my <unk> has <unk> access to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , with about a million <unk> <unk> .
What she has discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> in the most of the <unk> <unk> of two percent .
With 50 percent <unk> , there &apos;s 10 percent of <unk> than <unk> <unk> than <unk> <unk> <unk> . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> between which you have , it &apos;s <unk> to <unk> , and the choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And at <unk> , and still <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , you never <unk> .
<unk> that doesn &apos;t only mean that these <unk> <unk> <unk> food for <unk> <unk> because they don &apos;t want to say that the decision is so <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of work .
<unk> &apos;t <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> to five <unk> <unk> for a year from <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of the <unk> to have <unk> choices .
And I think that &apos;s so .
&quot; And then , to end , for the <unk> <unk> , or <unk> ? &quot;
So , just <unk> the right , if it &apos;s to <unk> it , it &apos;s true ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the bottom , and you &apos;ll be wrong .
So this is the first one effect . The second is that even if we can <unk> the <unk> and make a choice , and we &apos;re going to do a end , and it &apos;s <unk> with less <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many <unk> between which you have to <unk> , if you <unk> a <unk> and it &apos;s not a perfect choice , it &apos;s just imagine that it would be better . And what happens is that happens to <unk> us to <unk> the <unk> of choice and the <unk> the <unk> of choice , and the <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
even when it was a <unk> decision .
The <unk> is more easy to <unk> of any <unk> that is <unk> <unk> <unk> that is <unk> of the choice .
And also , there &apos;s what they call <unk> <unk> .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well , very good as the value that we <unk> to <unk> things from what <unk> .
<unk> , when there are many <unk> , it &apos;s easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> to be less than the <unk> that is <unk> .
So here &apos;s a example . I &apos;m not going to be New York .
But that &apos;s what it probably <unk> .
There &apos;s this <unk> to <unk> .
A place of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It &apos;s all of them .
It doesn &apos;t <unk> . But what he think he think he &apos;s said , &quot; Well , <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
&quot; All my <unk> <unk> are <unk> . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And the two weeks <unk> from the idea that &apos;s <unk> -- every day -- the chance of <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for that we have , even when we have , also been <unk> .
And more they are the <unk> that we have from <unk> , more <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here &apos;s another example .
This <unk> <unk> tells us many things .
There &apos;s about live the moment , and maybe of the <unk> to be <unk> .
But the most important point is that any of you are , you can &apos;t do the other .
The things that don &apos;t have many <unk> that can make what we do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I tried to my skin <unk> a new <unk> .
<unk> almost always <unk> .
And once the <unk> were just a kind of <unk> , they were <unk> and <unk> by <unk> , just after <unk> a lot of times , and they were <unk> a lot of times , and they would go to good .
So , I &apos;m going to <unk> a couple of the new when I was <unk> , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> said , &quot; I want to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
<unk> them wants to <unk> or <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> them wants to <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> -- &quot; <unk> to <unk> . &quot;
I was <unk> , and after a little bit of , and I want to say , &quot; I want to say , &quot; he was the only kind of <unk> it all , so that was so <unk> me . And then I &apos;ve got all <unk> <unk> , and then I &apos;ve got to say , and then I &apos;ve never had .
It was <unk> . With that choice I had to <unk> the better .
But I would like to <unk> .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for <unk> .
The reason I was worse to be that with all the choice of my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
I had to <unk> . I didn &apos;t know anything <unk> when I just <unk> it . But when they &apos;re going to <unk> 100 , at least a kind of <unk> , at least a perfect way , at least a perfect kind of <unk> .
What I had to <unk> , but not perfect .
After <unk> what I was <unk> to <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in life of people don &apos;t do that <unk> the <unk> that they have to <unk> the same <unk> .
And this <unk> less <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of the <unk> if you get it .
Because if you <unk> , I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more to this .
&quot; He was better when he was going to be better when he was better when he was better when he was going to be <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world that we live -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are the <unk> of the <unk> .
You never <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> , my <unk> , you know .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; Yes , &quot; <unk> &quot; Yes , &quot; . &quot;
I mean , small <unk> moment -- that I &apos;m really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn &apos;t have better , I don &apos;t have to be <unk> .
But it &apos;s not always a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of <unk> to buy a couple of <unk> when there &apos;s only that kind of <unk> is that when you &apos;re not <unk> , and you say , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is <unk> ? &quot; <unk> , the answer is <unk> .
The world is the <unk> . What I could I do it ?
When I &apos;m hundreds of <unk> , and they <unk> a <unk> , and I &apos;m going to <unk> you who is <unk> , <unk> that the <unk> you &apos;re .
I could <unk> it better .
With hundreds of <unk> <unk> , there are not <unk> for <unk> .
So when people <unk> decisions , even if the result is <unk> , you know , you know , they <unk> and <unk> the <unk> to their own .
In the last few years the <unk> <unk> in the world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only one , but the most important -- that &apos;s not just that people have <unk> <unk> <unk> because the <unk> are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation that <unk> their <unk> .
So the end of the end is that in general , but we &apos;re going to be better , but we <unk> .
I thought you &apos;re going to <unk> you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what all we take to good and it &apos;s completely <unk> .
There &apos;s no <unk> that a little bit of choice , but by this is better than <unk> . But this is not better than a little bit .
There &apos;s a <unk> value , <unk> . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve <unk> from a piece of the <unk> that the choices that the choices we have to our life .
Now , from the point of view -- I &apos;ve got almost <unk> -- I &apos;ve got almost <unk> -- <unk> is the <unk> .
What <unk> is all this choice in society is the <unk> material .
There are many places in the world , and you have <unk> <unk> , where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice .
The problem is that they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> I &apos;m talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what it does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I mean that these choices , <unk> and <unk> , it &apos;s not just that they &apos;re just <unk> .
I &apos;m <unk> <unk> .
They do it to be worse .
If you have a little bit of what our society is <unk> to <unk> choice in those where people have too much <unk> , it would not just their life to <unk> but also our lives .
This is what the <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of the income ago , not only to the poor -- not just to the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> .
So , I &apos;m going to end , you can become all you want to --
<unk> , people , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> what <unk> is ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s <unk> that you can &apos;t make it in a <unk> of <unk> . &quot;
&quot; A <unk> imagination , a <unk> <unk> of the world --
and I <unk> it so , I <unk> so , in the beginning .
But then , <unk> , instead , I &apos;m <unk> that fish knows that fish knows .
Because the fact that the fact of the fact that if you <unk> in <unk> <unk> , &quot; that &apos;s possible . &quot; You don &apos;t <unk> the <unk> .
If you <unk> the <unk> <unk> that you can <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> , and they <unk> the <unk> .
They all need a <unk> .
This is almost too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , maybe for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
