<unk> year I showed these <unk> for <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for nearly three million years has been the United States of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , has <unk> <unk> of 40 percent .
I love this <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a way , the heart of the global climate system .
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
The next <unk> is going to be a <unk> on the <unk> of the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
You see , you can see , it <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That &apos;s the ice in <unk> , which is <unk> in summer .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , <unk> ice , <unk> , is like the blood , that &apos;s where you &apos;re <unk> from the body .
In 25 years it went on for this way .
This is a problem because the <unk> is <unk> <unk> around the ocean <unk> where there are enormous <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , that <unk> may <unk> , <unk> this <unk> point , we will not <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> the <unk> is already <unk> by water .
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , last <unk> team .
<unk> : <unk> ! Al <unk> : She &apos;s fine . The question is if we <unk> it .
One is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> from the north .
This is a river in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> never <unk> like that .
This is the <unk> river , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea <unk> on the <unk> on <unk> , here is where the sea is where the sea is .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
<unk> on the planet : <unk> , the biggest <unk> of the ice <unk> of the planet .
<unk> month , scientists have <unk> that the <unk> of ice is in <unk> , and that the Western <unk> , which is particularly <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> at six feet of the <unk> , like <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the <unk> third of ice , you see ice <unk> , which few years ago were <unk> .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population <unk> <unk> by the <unk> water from that <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : this <unk> is the source of <unk> water in this city .
The <unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same happens to the <unk> water .
In California , <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> of 40 percent .
<unk> <unk> are in crisis .
<unk> , as you read , they &apos;re <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the world door to a <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are starting to a <unk> out of the normal and without <unk> .
<unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years on the <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of the whole <unk> .
If you look at it in the <unk> context , you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years we &apos;ve <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 <unk> every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> in the ocean every day .
Look at <unk> the area of the <unk> <unk> , from <unk> , to <unk> , and on both the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , where there is a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean .
The biggest cause of global warming , together to the <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of two countries with more emissions , with China .
And you can <unk> it up with a lot of <unk> .
But we &apos;re starting to a <unk> of the direction .
These are the projects that are <unk> in the last few years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , there is a political <unk> in our country .
<unk> of <unk> and oil have <unk> <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I <unk> image , I <unk> something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen it on the <unk> .
This is the second largest flow in America .
It &apos;s happened around <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> ♫ ♫ <unk> the <unk> is a <unk> and happy .
It &apos;s here in America , and it &apos;s <unk> our economy .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Al <unk> : From here , we &apos;re a great <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
The biggest society on the <unk> is <unk> <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> . <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al <unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> has two <unk> .
This is one of them , one part .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> , we see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> in our business .
So , we &apos;re <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk> the truth about <unk> .
Actually , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it &apos;s <unk> -- it &apos;s also a good <unk> .
So we don &apos;t have to <unk> climate change .
We can do it .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you &apos;ve heard of them .
So you &apos;re going to take a <unk> structure as <unk> as it is <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> are a little <unk> , but this is the sound of the <unk> technology .
<unk> <unk> is between the <unk> of global warming , but the <unk> technology that <unk> you see is changing everything .
Let &apos;s look at this : the <unk> <unk> technology .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and the national security .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> America is in the crisis ; the economy , <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that all the <unk> : our <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , like <unk> and oil <unk> .
Now , though , there &apos;s a new solution , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A plan for <unk> America to work , <unk> more <unk> , and help <unk> the global <unk> .
<unk> , a solution that we can solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
<unk> : This is the last one .
<unk> : <unk> : It &apos;s about <unk> energy to America .
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> end by the <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , a new network .
<unk> <unk> 2 : <unk> <unk> for jobs <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> America . It &apos;s time to be <unk> .
<unk> : A <unk> <unk> says , &quot; If you want to go on , go alone .
If you want to go far , you go . &quot;
We have to go far away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED I made an <unk> on the <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to try to <unk> on how the machine works .
So I got it . And for those who else time the other time they didn &apos;t have , the <unk> is the biggest scientific experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk> .
<unk> is to <unk> the conditions that were present less than a <unk> of the second <unk> from the universe -- until <unk> million times a second .
All of that is simply <unk> .
This is the <unk> machine .
<unk> these <unk> <unk> into the <unk> .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> <unk> feet and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> feet .
This is a <unk> image <unk> , so you can see the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of last year we <unk> the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> in the <unk> room .
It &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> of particles that he had all the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles inside the <unk> .
In other words , when you <unk> that image , the 10 <unk> , you &apos;ll see that the camera , which is a great <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s that to make us <unk> , or this , when somebody <unk> on Google and they would say , the <unk> page was this .
That means that we have had a <unk> impact over to be .
And I &apos;d been a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had to be these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works when the car works at the <unk> of <unk> .
Now , the <unk> of you <unk> <unk> and <unk> , &quot; It &apos;s not true . I &apos;m <unk> too <unk> . &quot;
And they can do it because when they &apos;re very <unk> to become the <unk> <unk> .
So , at least <unk> degrees , at least <unk> degrees <unk> to that the <unk> of the space between stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think these <unk> <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk> , and <unk> <unk> about 30 <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , which we did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
Now they &apos;re <unk> now , everybody in their <unk> .
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> is going to be new <unk> .
We <unk> it , and we &apos;re going to get data to <unk> or <unk> , and on that way our <unk> to find out what are the <unk> that we <unk> the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the science and engineering of <unk> engineering . It &apos;s easy to <unk> .
I think that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s so hard , I think it &apos;s the value of things like <unk> .
I want to end with the words of a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of <unk> experiments of his <unk> was <unk> , who was Michael <unk> , said , &quot; No , it &apos;s a great <unk> for human mind as the <unk> that ideas are <unk> , that our <unk> are <unk> , that our <unk> are <unk> , and that our <unk> are <unk> , and not <unk> new <unk> . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start with <unk> to when , as a child , as a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , we actually <unk> and to think and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that <unk> most of the world around us .
So , as a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects , and my <unk> <unk> , and I started to <unk> it , I started to say , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of having the <unk> <unk> as a digital <unk> that &apos;s moving on a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> on a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they both have a <unk> and information with both hands ,
and we &apos;re going to <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that I decided I was going to explore the answer , building the <unk> .
<unk> , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as big as a <unk> .
<unk> , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as big as a <unk> .
You can <unk> them with your hand , they can <unk> each other , and feel their movement and they have a screen and they have a screen and they have a screen and they have a screen and they have a screen and they can <unk> them with their hand , and they have a screen and they have a screen and they have a screen .
But <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> <unk> .
<unk> are the example of a new <unk> <unk> to <unk> the digital information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the movement , the other people , and as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the movement , of the other , of how we <unk> them , we can explore new <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
Let &apos;s start with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show you some video . If you put it in one direction , the <unk> video so , if you <unk> on the other side .
These <unk> are <unk> of others .
If you <unk> them , you know , you &apos;re <unk> to what it &apos;s going around them .
If they come up , they <unk> it and they can <unk> it a little bit .
If they come up , they <unk> it and they can <unk> it a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We then realized that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> was the <unk> that we could use common on data , for example , <unk> , like , a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as <unk> of <unk> and I can <unk> it to <unk> the color in that central , where they &apos;re <unk> .
and I can <unk> you to <unk> the color in that central one , where you <unk> .
It &apos;s too much , we can <unk> a little bit of a place .
There are also <unk> possibilities for <unk> , like <unk> , <unk> and <unk> games where people can try things quickly , and they <unk> the results immediately .
Now I &apos;m --
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So here we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , a letter to <unk> on every <unk> , <unk> , at every <unk> , at every <unk> , and as you <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a letter to <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you <unk> , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities to try and .
Thank you .
Here are some of the kids who are <unk> in <unk> <unk> , I made so that I <unk> them and I <unk> a video .
They &apos;re very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things that is that you don &apos;t have to give people many <unk> .
I just say , &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , on the right .
In fact , he wanted to <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> <unk> .
You could build a tool for the <unk> of <unk> . He &apos;s <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So , it &apos;s <unk> the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now he brought a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> work ! Yeah !
So , we <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can make the characters .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide how to <unk> .
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide how to <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have the time to show you is a tool that &apos;s made , I recently , for <unk> and <unk> music .
It &apos;s a tool , that &apos;s a <unk> , for <unk> and <unk> music .
<unk> <unk> here as <unk> <unk> , low and <unk> .
<unk> of these has four different <unk> , and you can choose which to use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence from <unk> to your <unk> .
And you just <unk> by making a <unk> , &quot; sound &quot; and a <unk> . &quot;
These are effects that you can control live , like <unk> and <unk> .
We &apos;re going to <unk> it to a particular <unk> , and then you &apos;ll get it to <unk> .
And then there are <unk> effects as time and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to the whole sequence .
<unk> how it works .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> one base <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Now , I &apos;m going to take a <unk> line .
<unk> : <unk> : Now I &apos;m going to <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> : And now I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> , so I can control the <unk> . So I can control my <unk> effect .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the whole sequence of time on one side or the other .
<unk> : <unk> : And now we &apos;re the <unk> <unk> to give <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
So I don &apos;t have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> it , you &apos;ll get it a long way .
And now , finally , I can <unk> the whole sequence on the left the <unk> <unk> the <unk> &quot; <unk> . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new <unk> <unk> <unk> as they work our brain and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the results of this path , and some of the possibilities that we &apos;re trying to bring out of the lab .
And the concept I want to <unk> is that it &apos;s <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> with the <unk> media , which is <unk> information in our world in the way we want to do .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time to talk to you all .
I &apos;m a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the <unk> of my life .
And it &apos;s not what it &apos;s going to change .
But , this particular thing , something particular happened in my life and in my life , which led me to <unk> the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is I <unk> wrote this book , this <unk> called &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; which , &quot; <unk> , &quot; which , &quot; I <unk> , &quot; I <unk> &quot; -- I &apos;m going to <unk> a big <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that I &apos;m <unk> now , people <unk> me as if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> !
I &apos;m going to go to me now and say , &quot; Don &apos;t you &apos;re <unk> not going to be able to do better ?
<unk> &apos;t you &apos;re afraid to continue writing for the whole life without being able to create a book that can <unk> someone to be able to create a book that can you <unk> someone ? &quot;
what can you help to someone ? &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , except I remember that over 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was an <unk> -- which I wanted to be a <unk> .
I &apos;m going to go to the same <unk> <unk> .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you <unk> that you can &apos;t be successful ?
<unk> &apos;t you &apos;re afraid the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> you ?
<unk> &apos;t you &apos;re afraid to do you all of life without having anything that ever comes out and die on a <unk> of <unk> dreams with the mouth of <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> ?
<unk> like that , you know .
The short answer to all these questions is : &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I &apos;m afraid of all of that .
I always <unk> .
And I also fear of a lot of other things that people can &apos;t <unk> .
Like <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , as I &apos;m about writing what I thought and <unk> <unk> is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It &apos;s <unk> that anybody who <unk> to be <unk> by being <unk> by a work that you can feel <unk> to do .
But what is the particular <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> about health <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> do not ?
How do my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and I don &apos;t remember one time in his <unk> <unk> was asked if it was <unk> to be <unk> ?
It was never -- that <unk> of <unk> John , as it goes ?
Don &apos;t you like that , <unk> ?
<unk> , the engineers <unk> as a group has not certainly , in <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we have enough , we have enough <unk> , and not just <unk> , but <unk> like all , we have this <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s not going to be <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , young and often <unk> as they .
And the people who don &apos;t seem to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before I die , in the last <unk> said , &quot; Every my book I <unk> a little bit more &quot; <unk> . &quot; <unk> <unk> about the work of life .
But we don &apos;t know <unk> when we <unk> it to say that because we &apos;ve heard these things so long that we &apos;ve got completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are <unk> in some way . And that art , eventually , we always <unk> the <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> you to everyone here today is : <unk> <unk> with this idea ?
You &apos;re fine , you &apos;re going to go from a <unk> distance to me not that &apos;s good for anything .
I think it &apos;s <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s also <unk> and I don &apos;t want to <unk> you in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to <unk> our big <unk> to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- in my situation , it would be very <unk> to start to <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> in which I &apos;m in my career .
<unk> -- look -- I &apos;m quite young , I &apos;m quite young , I &apos;m quite young , I &apos;ve got about 40 years .
I still have about four <unk> of work in me .
And it &apos;s very <unk> that whatever you &apos;re going to <unk> from the world as the work that <unk> after my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we &apos;re all about friends here -- it &apos;s <unk> that my biggest success is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> thinking .
You know , the kind of thought that leads a person to start <unk> <unk> at nine <unk> <unk> <unk> at nine <unk> <unk> . And I don &apos;t want to do it .
I continue to do this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so , it looks , after many <unk> , that the way to work to keep on writing is that you can do a <unk> <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to get a distance from between me , which I &apos;m <unk> , and my natural <unk> that <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> . And as I was <unk> for all last year , models on how to do it . <unk> look across time , looking through the other societies to see if you have the best ideas and the most <unk> ideas .
about how to people <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research led me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
because they <unk> in <unk> and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> -- people don &apos;t believe that <unk> creativity from men , OK ?
It turns out that creativity was this <unk> spirit and <unk> from some <unk> to men and <unk> from some <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for reasons .
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> from far away .
The <unk> were the same idea , but they were <unk> that sort of spirit of without a <unk> .
which is <unk> , because the <unk> don &apos;t really understand that a <unk> was particularly smart .
And I thought that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> literally <unk> in the <unk> of a artist &apos;s study , a little artist like the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> of that work .
<unk> <unk> , that &apos;s the distance I &apos;m talking about -- that <unk> <unk> you <unk> from your <unk> .
And everybody thought that was so you <unk> , right ?
So , the <unk> artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like too <unk> , right ?
If your work was <unk> not to <unk> the whole <unk> , you all <unk> that you would have been <unk> from this <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it was not all <unk> , right ?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time .
And then the <unk> <unk> and everything , and we <unk> this great idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe on the <unk> and <unk> and no longer leave space on the <unk> that we &apos;re <unk> from the <unk> .
This was the <unk> <unk> principle and people started to think that creativity was completely from the <unk> .
And for the first time in history , you start to <unk> this or that artist as a <unk> <unk> , a person with <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think you &apos;re going to be a simple person , and I think that &apos;s as a source of the source , the <unk> and the <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> responsibility to give <unk> human <unk> .
It &apos;s like to ask someone to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> the <unk> and creates all of these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it was this pressure to have <unk> artists in the <unk> 500 years .
And if that &apos;s true , and I think it &apos;s true , the question becomes , and I think it &apos;s now ?
Can we do it ?
<unk> to go back to a more <unk> understanding of the relationship between humans and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t <unk> 500 years of thinking in a <unk> talk .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of , <unk> , you do that <unk> people <unk> to <unk> on their projects .
You probably don &apos;t <unk> you all about this .
But the question I want to tell you is -- why not ?
Why not we do this way ?
Because more sense of everything that has ever heard of to explain the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process .
A process that , as anyone who has ever <unk> to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- you don &apos;t know , you &apos;re not <unk> <unk> .
And , in fact , it can sometimes seem completely <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> , who has now 90 years , but has been a <unk> for his whole life and he said that during his <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> , <unk> it out in the <unk> , and <unk> it , inside the <unk> , and <unk> it , <unk> it out in the <unk> , and <unk> it , inside the <unk> , and <unk> it , in the <unk> ,
He said , he was like a <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> to her from the <unk> .
You <unk> it , because it was <unk> the earth under his feet .
I decided to have one thing to do at that point and it was , words , &quot; <unk> as a <unk> . &quot;
And so he went back to home and he came from this <unk> , and he couldn &apos;t have anything else that take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> , and <unk> on the page .
It &apos;s <unk> times , you don &apos;t get enough , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> them without getting to home and she would <unk> them through the <unk> , looking , looking , like she said , &quot; another <unk> , looking , as she said , &quot; another <unk> . &quot;
And then there were those times -- this piece of <unk> never -- there were times when the <unk> was almost <unk> , right ?
So , he was <unk> at home and he was looking for paper and he was looking through his <unk> through , and he <unk> a <unk> just in the while he was <unk> , and he said , that he was like , if you <unk> with the other hand and the <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and the <unk> in his body and <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the page <unk> and <unk> , but <unk> on the <unk> , the <unk> word to the first word .
So when I <unk> him -- it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not all my <unk> process -- I &apos;m not a <unk> .
I &apos;m a <unk> , and my way of <unk> is ; I &apos;m going to go and work and <unk> and work and <unk> and <unk> and work and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> on top of it .
But even I , in my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I &apos;m also <unk> that many of you who are .
You know , even though the work and ideas I would <unk> myself from a certain source , I can &apos;t <unk> <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it in a way to do not <unk> our head , but rather , that it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> to us ?
As far as I , the best example , which I have is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I <unk> several years ago for a <unk> .
I &apos;m talking about this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the artist <unk> <unk> <unk> , trying to control <unk> , these sort of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But then he <unk> , he <unk> , and he was <unk> on a day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> , <unk> it .
<unk> it up fast and everything about a <unk> <unk> , this little <unk> of <unk> , who comes in his head like , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the <unk> , but not know how to <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
So it starts to feel this kind of old <unk> <unk> on him , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose it , and I &apos;m going to go from this <unk> song .
I &apos;m not <unk> enough and I can &apos;t <unk> it . &quot;
And instead of going to the <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> .
We <unk> the whole process of <unk> and made something completely new .
He just <unk> the sky and he said , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t see that I &apos;m <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Do you think it &apos;s <unk> to write a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , you know , you &apos;re going to take care of you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> more .
<unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And his process <unk> <unk> after this .
Not work , it was still <unk> as always <unk> .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> had been <unk> when he was <unk> , he <unk> the <unk> that he <unk> out of him , he <unk> that he would come from where he was , he was , he was <unk> that he was <unk> .
but I was <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> <unk> and this thing <unk> thing , but it was not <unk> .
And as the <unk> that story to change a little bit , even the way I &apos;m going to talk about and I already <unk> once .
This idea , I &apos;m <unk> when I was <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; and I <unk> , &quot; and I <unk> it into one of those <unk> in which we &apos;re all working when we &apos;re working on something and we &apos;re not going to have the book , which will be the book will be the <unk> .
Not just <unk> , just the <unk> book .
And I started thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I decided to <unk> that <unk> air and <unk> us .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my face to a <unk> corner of the room .
And I said , &quot; <unk> , what , we know , we know that if this book is not going to be <unk> , my ?
Because you see I &apos;m <unk> all I have , I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to <unk> and do your part .
Okay . But if you don &apos;t , you know what , you don &apos;t do it .
I &apos;ll start writing the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I would like to say , you know , I &apos;m <unk> to do my own <unk> . &quot; Because at the end is so , OK , let &apos;s do it in the <unk> of Africa , the people <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the moon , <unk> music that they <unk> on for the <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every while , you &apos;re going to <unk> something , and one of these <unk> are actually <unk> .
And I know you know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know you &apos;ve all seen , at some point , a <unk> .
It was like time , it was <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it was not doing anything different from the usually , like the <unk> <unk> <unk> before , but it was all <unk> .
And suddenly it doesn &apos;t <unk> as a human <unk> .
But it <unk> up from <unk> and <unk> in the fire of the <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people <unk> what was , they <unk> what was , they <unk> the name .
<unk> hands and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
<unk> <unk> note -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , they <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; to &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; which , you still can feel in the <unk> or in the <unk> .
In <unk> , when an artist did something impossible and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it &apos;s <unk> because we need it .
But , the problem comes the day after , for the <unk> , when you <unk> and <unk> that are the 11 of the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of God doesn &apos;t have more .
It &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> with a big <unk> <unk> , and maybe it will never be <unk> to the <unk> .
And maybe nobody &apos;s <unk> the name of God again as I <unk> , and what &apos;s so it must do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so <unk> if you can &apos;t believe , <unk> , that the most <unk> <unk> of your being come from you .
But you just want to <unk> you that data from a <unk> of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to another time .
And , you know , if you think it &apos;s in this way .
And so I started to <unk> , and it &apos;s certainly like I <unk> it for several months in the book <unk> that I &apos;ll soon be <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ,
And what I have to keep <unk> when I feel like this is , I &apos;m not afraid to go .
Don &apos;t worry . You just have your work .
<unk> to your <unk> , whatever it is , any one can be .
If your work is <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> .
If the <unk> , you &apos;ll be <unk> to you <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for one moment through your <unk> , then <unk> ! &quot;
<unk> , you do the same <unk> .
And &quot; <unk> ! &quot; to you the same .
I think it &apos;s <unk> and I think it &apos;s <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot; to you do it , even for <unk> human love and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As you know I &apos;ve already talked about some of these projects about the human genome , what &apos;s going to happen and discovery of new genes .
Now we &apos;re now <unk> a new path . We &apos;re starting to <unk> biology and now starting from that digital code , we &apos;re <unk> in a new <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve always been trying to ask them big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many <unk> I think have <unk> to <unk> different levels . &quot;
We tried different <unk> , <unk> to <unk> terms .
We &apos;re <unk> for about 20 years now .
When we <unk> the human genome , we <unk> from the <unk> world of the computer biology <unk> .
Now we &apos;re <unk> : we can <unk> life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the species from the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> a <unk> even smaller .
We can <unk> a <unk> <unk> of about 500 genes that are here .
But when we take a look at his <unk> map , it &apos;s <unk> simple than our own .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at a time , it &apos;s very <unk> that this can bring to a <unk> cell .
So , we thought the only way the only way to <unk> this <unk> <unk> in order to <unk> the <unk> of these <unk> questions .
And so we started the <unk> of &quot; Can we <unk> a <unk> ? &quot;
Can the chemistry <unk> of making these big molecules that we &apos;ve never done before we &apos;ve ever done before ?
And in case , what can we make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> material .
The speed with which we &apos;re able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> <unk> the genetic code , instead , <unk> rather slowly , but it &apos;s <unk> .
And our <unk> results in the <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve been <unk> over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before we <unk> the first experiments .
But we found that DNA <unk> is very difficult .
There are <unk> of thousands of the world that <unk> small <unk> of DNA , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> process : the more <unk> is , the longer <unk> is there .
So we had to develop a new way of <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , starting from information digital information digital <unk> genome .
It &apos;s a little virus that <unk> bacteria .
We designed the <unk> , we <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA <unk> about <unk> <unk> .
But what &apos;s interesting is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we <unk> it in bacteria , the bacteria <unk> , they <unk> to read this <unk> , and they <unk> the <unk> particles .
<unk> particles have been there by the cells , they &apos;re <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;ve talked about <unk> members of the <unk> industry that they &apos;ve been doing this model .
They have <unk> more than you .
I think this is a situation where the software can really build its own <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we could do the bigger things .
You had to build the entire <unk> of the <unk> .
They &apos;re more than <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So we thought we were <unk> in the size of the virus , so that we can change the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
<unk> is <unk> , and if you <unk> information in a computer , these have to be very <unk> .
When you <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> , the <unk> <unk> was of a <unk> for every 10 <unk> .
We found out , we were <unk> , 30 <unk> . If you were used that original sequence never <unk> states to do it .
A part of the process is designing <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with all the other <unk> of the 50 <unk> to build smaller <unk> that <unk> together .
<unk> elements here .
You probably read that you have read that you have read that you .
So , we have a <unk> code for four <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together , about 20 <unk> , and there &apos;s a <unk> order of <unk> for every <unk> .
So we can use the genetic code for writing , <unk> , <unk> .
So what we did at the beginning was <unk> .
Some of them were <unk> by the fact that it was not <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> just <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them .
And we started <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , we made these <unk> <unk> in <unk> so that we &apos;re <unk> to create an extremely <unk> <unk> as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to <unk> the process .
So , this looks like the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
When we &apos;re going to <unk> these <unk> <unk> , more than 100 <unk> <unk> , you don &apos;t get <unk> directly into the <unk> <unk> .
It comes to the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> biology .
So we have <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> <unk> to <unk> DNA .
Here &apos;s an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> -- 24 hours , it &apos;s <unk> exactly like it was before .
<unk> of thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can <unk> completely .
<unk> to live under <unk> .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and you &apos;re <unk> to find new <unk> of water .
Actually , NASA , showed that this happens .
This is a picture of the <unk> we built these <unk> , just using the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a picture of not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s such a big <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a time of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> we &apos;ve done a little bit of time ago .
They &apos;re more than <unk> <unk> of <unk> code .
It &apos;s the biggest <unk> of a <unk> structure that has ever <unk> from man .
It has a <unk> weight <unk> to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a <unk> <unk> , you &apos;ll just put it on a <unk> <unk> , just to <unk> this code .
Now , how do we make it work ?
<unk> , <unk> is a <unk> game .
It &apos;s a little bit more <unk> when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In <unk> , the <unk> is <unk> instead of <unk> in the cell , but we have <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re able to do a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> from one cell to the cell , and <unk> .
We have a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> species .
The two are different than men are <unk> .
We &apos;ve <unk> some <unk> <unk> in a way that you can decide what you &apos;ve got to choose what to do to choose what you would like to choose for this <unk> .
He then <unk> it with <unk> <unk> <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> <unk> <unk> went into the cell .
And we thought that we didn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to <unk> it .
This is one of the biggest <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere , and we <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species .
So who think of evolution as a <unk> <unk> , it doesn &apos;t get a lot of biology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> DNA .
The <unk> that was in the cell didn &apos;t <unk> one .
The <unk> <unk> we have <unk> it .
It &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> material , it <unk> , and we <unk> it , and we <unk> with only the cell that cell <unk> .
has become blue because of the genes we &apos;ve <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species , and it &apos;s <unk> of the whole <unk> in a new species , <unk> on the new software that we <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the code that <unk> will be exactly what we &apos;ve <unk> .
Now , this may seem <unk> <unk> , but we can <unk> the software DNA <unk> , we can change things in a pretty <unk> way .
Now , I &apos;ve already <unk> that you &apos;re not talking about <unk> -- but <unk> progress from three million years and a half million years of evolution , and I &apos;ve already said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the <unk> that digital species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We &apos;re going to go for six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Just to give you an example : I was born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to get <unk> in <unk> ; in the <unk> ; in 40 years , there &apos;s going to be four .
We &apos;re <unk> problems now <unk> , <unk> water and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , six and a half billion people .
We &apos;re going to be even <unk> to do it for nine billion .
We &apos;re over five billion <unk> , over 30 billion <unk> of <unk> .
That means percent of <unk> a day .
When we &apos;re trying to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process of <unk> process , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
And we have to <unk> that all of the <unk> of CO2 from these materials that are in the atmosphere .
<unk> on today day , because of the <unk> <unk> in all over the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that they &apos;re the <unk> <unk> for the future .
The <unk> <unk> industry only <unk> about <unk> , and think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here is <unk> data from reality and our imagination .
Now we have <unk> , because of these <unk> <unk> <unk> , able to create what we call the <unk> <unk> .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think of <unk> these 20 million <unk> <unk> or <unk> to <unk> the <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology that in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard <unk> .
We can choose for <unk> , chemistry or chemistry or chemistry , or chemistry <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software that we &apos;re working on to be able to <unk> and design species on the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how to be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
Now we &apos;re <unk> on the <unk> <unk> generation .
You saw you that <unk> <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment .
We <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> generation that &apos;s pretty soon going to be from the <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> as the <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way biology can have a very large impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> and <unk> the <unk> would <unk> the <unk> of food and <unk> the <unk> would <unk> the CO2 before , which we &apos;re working on to design , and we think we &apos;re going to have the first generation of <unk> in about 18 months .
<unk> solar <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> in the deep ocean , about <unk> feet deep to the temperature <unk> of water .
<unk> <unk> by the CO2 using hydrogen as energy .
We &apos;re trying to figure out if we can <unk> CO2 , that can easily be <unk> by <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So , we &apos;re going to be able to <unk> what we might be able to <unk> what the basic question is what life is . We have the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole <unk> industry .
<unk> . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can &apos;t ?
We &apos;re going to have a major source of energy .
<unk> , we &apos;re working on the same <unk> to use the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk> .
You saw this year with the flu , we &apos;re always back a year and with a dollar less when it comes to find the right .
I think that you can change building <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
Here &apos;s how the future may start to look <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> the tree with <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and finally <unk> cells .
We &apos;re so <unk> to <unk> people .
Our purpose is to do in a way of living enough to try to <unk> <unk> . Thank you very much .
First of all , I &apos;m going to show you , the <unk> possible , some fundamental work , of the new technology we brought to the <unk> <unk> to a <unk> <unk> , almost a year ago . This is <unk> .
It &apos;s a environment in which you can <unk> both <unk> and local <unk> that <unk> with a huge amount of data .
So we &apos;re seeing here are <unk> <unk> of <unk> with a kind of <unk> and <unk> , for a fast <unk> , <unk> images as we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big it is the amount of information that we see , how big these <unk> of data or <unk> .
Most of them are common <unk> , but this is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen in any time . It &apos;s also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a whole book , which is not of images .
This is the <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> .
To <unk> that it &apos;s just <unk> and not <unk> , we can do something like that , to really see that it &apos;s about a real <unk> <unk> , not a picture .
It could be a little <unk> way to read a <unk> book .
I don &apos;t <unk> it .
This is a more <unk> example . This is a <unk> number of <unk> .
Every image big is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the <unk> and the beautiful experience of reading the real <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> type of a half .
We also made something with the corner of the <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve created a <unk> <unk> <unk> much <unk> than the one that you use in a normal <unk> , and we <unk> the <unk> content .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even the <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
We think this is going to put the <unk> and other <unk> like that , you don &apos;t have to be <unk> .
Of course , <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for these kinds of technology .
And I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say that we have <unk> <unk> to give in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. <unk> over a NASA <unk> .
So now we &apos;re going to go to something else .
This is actually live on the web ; you can see it .
It &apos;s a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a very interesting <unk> research by <unk> , a very interesting student of Washington <unk> , with the help of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s live on the web , <unk> <unk> .
You can see when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from one image to another and have this kind of experience to <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of images here actually has a meaning .
The <unk> <unk> of the computer <unk> have <unk> these images together , so that we <unk> the <unk> places that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk> . So here &apos;s what you see here of the elements of a <unk> <unk> or <unk> , and these things were all <unk> at the <unk> <unk> , and these things were all <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if I have a time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more <unk> .
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> data and this is a <unk> <unk> <unk> that we &apos;ve done for the first time . I &apos;m going to go directly to one of the <unk> of the key to this technology , the <unk> technology . And it &apos;s not <unk> as <unk> by looking at the <unk> that we put in the website .
We had to <unk> <unk> and so on .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> images of <unk> and <unk> <unk> images of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> . <unk> of these <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s an image that you have an image that is found out in this model .
So , they &apos;re all <unk> images and have been all <unk> at the <unk> level this way .
And it &apos;s possible to <unk> this <unk> way .
You know , I would never thought I &apos;d be working for <unk> .
It &apos;s very <unk> to <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different kinds of <unk> : that &apos;s cell phones at those cell phones <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , I can , I can , I can <unk> them .
A lot of them are <unk> by <unk> , etc .
<unk> here is a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from <unk> to the physical to the physical to the physical <unk> .
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now <unk> data from the whole <unk> memory of how the earth the <unk> , from the whole <unk> of how the earth the earth the <unk> , and <unk> all that data .
All those pictures become <unk> together , greater of the <unk> of the parts .
You have a model of the earth that <unk> .
Think of this as the <unk> of <unk> &apos;s work on Earth <unk> .
It &apos;s something that we &apos;re <unk> in complexity , as people <unk> it , and the <unk> that we &apos;re going to <unk> for those who <unk> it with <unk> .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people .
If anybody is the idea of <unk> , all these <unk> <unk> the name , my picture of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , they <unk> all those data , and I can use it as a <unk> <unk> to <unk> in that space , in that <unk> , using the pictures , and have an experience of social <unk> and <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of all of this is extremely <unk> <unk> of every part of the earth , <unk> , <unk> not only by <unk> <unk> and <unk> images and <unk> and <unk> .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What &apos;s the software that your software will allow us to do is that at some point , in the next few years , all the photographs that in the world , they &apos;re going to be <unk> <unk> together ?
<unk> : Yes . What &apos;s doing is it in practice is that it &apos;s <unk> .
It &apos;s creating <unk> , if you want , in images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the <unk> of the images .
And it becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> information <unk> that many of these <unk> images .
As you make a research <unk> , you get a <unk> and the text on the web page , it &apos;s a lot of information about images .
Now , what happens if that picture you go to all your pictures ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really enormous . It &apos;s a <unk> effect of the network .
CA : <unk> , it &apos;s really incredible . <unk> .
<unk> : I &apos;m going to you very much .
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is the <unk> that you can live between who has no <unk> <unk> <unk> , between who <unk> the wind <unk> , <unk> it into the <unk> <unk> , <unk> it into the <unk> <unk> of plants .
You think that the <unk> will be <unk> even beyond the <unk> <unk> , or that the <unk> <unk> are still <unk> of <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> are still <unk> of <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , and that the idea that we live in not in a <unk> sense , but it &apos;s just a model ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done , well , <unk> , a lot of <unk> .
And of course , everybody <unk> <unk> .
Everybody <unk> . Everybody <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
So we have to deal with the death <unk> , so we don &apos;t like <unk> and <unk> --
We all have an art .
What <unk> is the particular <unk> of the song , the <unk> of the <unk> of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that it &apos;s the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
He was my <unk> <unk> in the <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , on the <unk> , the mother <unk> &apos;s mother &apos;s <unk> .
All of these <unk> are <unk> that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving around the world .
And if you <unk> a second , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of the world as a <unk> <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet and it &apos;s important for the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> note .
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the total <unk> of all the <unk> , dreams , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> in being from the human imagination .
<unk> is the great <unk> of humanity .
It &apos;s the <unk> of what we can be and what we can be as a kind of <unk> species .
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the <unk> of the <unk> simply because it &apos;s <unk> , or -- in the field of diversity <unk> -- and you don &apos;t even even even get to the <unk> <unk> -- the diversity of the <unk> diversity .
The <unk> of this is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not <unk> by a <unk> or by a series of rules .
One language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle with the <unk> that the <unk> of every culture comes in the world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a <unk> , a thought , a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , as we &apos;re sitting here at <unk> , at least half not <unk> in the <unk> of children .
They &apos;re not <unk> to kids , which means that they &apos;re not going to be <unk> something , which are already <unk> .
What &apos;s more <unk> about being <unk> by the <unk> , of the last being the last few decades , of not having a <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of someone in the world every two weeks . <unk> every two weeks : every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> and <unk> with it in the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> language .
And I know anybody who said , &quot; Don &apos;t that better ?
The world would not be a better place if we all the same language ? &quot; <unk> , we all talk . We &apos;re all going to be <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> of a <unk> thing that means that you can &apos;t talk to your language .
I &apos;d like to take you to a journey through the <unk> --
and a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we &apos;re <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say , &quot; different ways of <unk> &quot; I really want to <unk> . &quot; I really think about different ways of <unk> .
So for example , this <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , which <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s not able to <unk> the blue color from green because the <unk> time is <unk> in the forest because the <unk> <unk> is <unk> in the forest , which we <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; : you have to <unk> a different person who talks about a different language .
All of that has <unk> in the past <unk> , though the <unk> is that in these <unk> where they talk about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> nobody practice .
You can start listening and then you &apos;ll start talking about it .
I would give one of the most interesting <unk> that I lived with , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> five <unk> have <unk> contact with a <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;ve been <unk> by the <unk> photographs that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> forest <unk> had never seen anything .
They <unk> the <unk> pictures , they <unk> the research <unk> of a form or a <unk> and , and they didn &apos;t know anything , they <unk> that they <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with the <unk> .
But the <unk> don &apos;t just <unk> the <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> to each other .
<unk> percent of <unk> was <unk> by themselves .
We went to eight <unk> and we found two <unk> <unk> <unk> and we found two cases of natural death . And then they <unk> that one of them was so <unk> that it &apos;s dead , and then they <unk> it . <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> .
<unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and to <unk> the species .
In the early &apos; <unk> , it was <unk> a really interesting task when my <unk> <unk> <unk> , if I wanted to go to <unk> between <unk> society and <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
To make sense of <unk> , I should have to understand the <unk> culture , and the <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s quite a <unk> view of the world .
Very interesting .
If you ask the <unk> of the <unk> of the world , what would you like ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent is always left , thinking , that <unk> Africa has no <unk> <unk> . And instead , they don &apos;t have <unk> <unk> . And instead of <unk> is <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
What makes interesting is that <unk> is the <unk> of life and death .
So <unk> do <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> to the <unk> of alive in such a way that for a short time , the <unk> becomes the <unk> .
So , the <unk> <unk> say , &quot; <unk> <unk> go to <unk> to the <unk> of God .
We <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> God . &quot;
And what you &apos;re <unk> , is the spirit that you &apos;re driving you , how do you get you wrong ,
So you start to these incredible events : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re going to <unk> all the <unk> that I &apos;ve lived with the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> civilization <unk> , which once <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> has never been <unk> by the <unk> .
In fact , they &apos;re <unk> by a <unk> , but their <unk> is extraordinary .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years , and they live in a world that &apos;s made of <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> years of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
For this time , they &apos;re <unk> to the values of their society , values that they &apos;re <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> -- or <unk> to say <unk> <unk> .
And at the end of this incredible <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> out and for the first time , at the age of 18 , they see a <unk> . And in that moment of <unk> <unk> , when the sun <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , everything that they learned in the theory of <unk> . The <unk> is <unk> . The <unk> is <unk> <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> back and says ,
&quot; <unk> ? <unk> as I said .
It &apos;s <unk> . Now it &apos;s like you to think . &quot;
They call the <unk> <unk> and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the world .
This <unk> level of <unk> is extremely important .
When we think about the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> environment and the old <unk> history of <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> concept in his <unk> , or maybe <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are closer to Earth than we are .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> by <unk> .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or in the <unk> <unk> , but because of time and <unk> , have created a <unk> of the Earth &apos;s <unk> not about the concept of <unk> <unk> <unk> but on a <unk> <unk> . But on a <unk> <unk> <unk> : concept that the Earth can only be because it &apos;s <unk> from human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
<unk> to say that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> the mountain is a <unk> spirit that <unk> its <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that <unk> its <unk> is going to be <unk> different <unk> with the mountain or that would be <unk> .
<unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What &apos;s interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
That made me a human being different from my friends who believe that <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> .
If you start to <unk> that these <unk> can create different , we could actually create different , we could start to understand some of their <unk> <unk> .
I took this picture at <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard about <unk> , the most powerful <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is not the potential of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , but his <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> from two elements .
On one hand , this <unk> <unk> that <unk> a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> you have a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit , but it &apos;s <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> of the family <unk> said <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you &apos;ll see the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> that make from a different kind of <unk> , <unk> it <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . <unk> &apos;t creates a <unk> of the electricity . It doesn &apos;t make a <unk> of reality .
I often <unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of the <unk> <unk> in the &apos; <unk> in the &apos; <unk> .
In my <unk> , you can &apos;t <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you &apos;re not able to tell anybody to be <unk> . <unk> <unk> , but they can &apos;t be <unk> because they &apos;re <unk> by a <unk> that you find out in the <unk> , you can &apos;t be <unk> because they &apos;re <unk> by a <unk> that you can &apos;t tell anybody to be <unk> because they &apos;re <unk> by a <unk> that you can &apos;t tell anybody to be <unk> .
It &apos;s possible to <unk> <unk> if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
Now it &apos;s the good : the <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk> of the <unk> , the same kind of necessary to <unk> the <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> of <unk> species , like these <unk> <unk> <unk> , two <unk> don &apos;t similar , but that if you <unk> this way , they create a <unk> that &apos;s <unk> .
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you <unk> to the <unk> , we &apos;re going to be , &quot; <unk> us talk . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , who <unk> <unk> in the forest , and our eyes <unk> in the same species .
If you <unk> it as you <unk> their <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> of plants , you don &apos;t know everything ? &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
The solution is : you take the <unk> <unk> in a full of the full and <unk> <unk> with a different <unk> .
And with this one you can &apos;t get to <unk> , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
Now , &#91; <unk> &#93; the problem is that even those of us who have to heart <unk> <unk> <unk> them , but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of history than our real world , and it <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , not <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk> , but rather like the was where we were <unk> and we <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> diversity and <unk> and <unk> the planet &apos;s <unk> . Now the problem is not the change .
All the <unk> were <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> <unk> and <unk> like <unk> don &apos;t have <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that <unk> <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s the power .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And if you look at the world , you &apos;ll see that these are not <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of the existence of the <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> .
<unk> you <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , and now we &apos;re going to go to the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , where you can see the river from the <unk> , which seems to be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> to <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or , in the case of <unk> , are the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> .
If we &apos;re <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I &apos;m doing many research , you &apos;ll see the <unk> <unk> of the political <unk> .
As the <unk> , the <unk> of a <unk> , is <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , but the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> &apos;s <unk> , not only is <unk> , but <unk> <unk> in some <unk> , because of the development is part of development .
And you can &apos;t understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you go to the <unk> .
I <unk> <unk> miles from <unk> in the West China , through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only <unk> <unk> I realized what the behind .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> at the <unk> <unk> .
which means that it has been <unk> to the Chinese time .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that led the <unk> in <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> in <unk> at the age of two <unk> under his <unk> because he could not have been <unk> .
The <unk> , which has been <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
One day he <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to work for seven years .
<unk> pain can be <unk> , but the spirit of <unk> is <unk> by <unk> .
<unk> , all <unk> to a choice .
Do you want to live in the <unk> world or we want to <unk> the world <unk> of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he died said that his biggest <unk> was that , in our <unk> <unk> , in our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of human imagination to <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of thinking , but one day we <unk> it from a <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities .
And it &apos;s <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , which has given us <unk> <unk> , which we <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , creating the <unk> of the <unk> , and we &apos;re talking about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has to <unk> 300 years .
That <unk> history doesn &apos;t <unk> me to tell you that we have the answers to all the challenges that we can <unk> in the <unk> to come .
When these <unk> <unk> of the world , it &apos;s asked what it means to be human , you know , you know , you know , you know , <unk> with <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all <unk> the possibilities of being what we are : sort of <unk> , which has to <unk> that all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are big <unk> moments of <unk> moments .
I took this picture on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> me , he <unk> the wonderful story of his <unk> .
The government was not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> <unk> to <unk> our <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> for his life , <unk> <unk> all the <unk> away , and all his <unk> .
You have to know that <unk> don &apos;t <unk> the cold , you &apos;ll see it .
The <unk> <unk> were made of <unk> fish <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn &apos;t <unk> at night or from the <unk> that <unk> .
It <unk> away , it <unk> the <unk> <unk> in skin of <unk> and <unk> in your hand . When I did the <unk> , she <unk> them by them creating a <unk> .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when he <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> you &apos;re going to talk to you ? <unk> . And this , in different ways , &#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> the government <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> the total control of an area of <unk> bigger than California and <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s their new <unk> . It &apos;s called <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s all the <unk> resources .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , finally , I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> at least to the people who are in these <unk> areas of the planet , I realize that they &apos;re not <unk> at all .
It &apos;s home .
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that we <unk> at the time . And for us all , the dreams of these kids , become part of the <unk> <unk> of hope .
<unk> , we &apos;re <unk> <unk> we &apos;re <unk> that <unk> <unk> never to anything .
<unk> that <unk> --
<unk> are not <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month we have <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in the <unk> to bring our public in places to <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from where <unk> <unk> <unk> from how much you saw and , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the world <unk> of <unk> diversity , and we have to find a <unk> <unk> world .
where the <unk> of all <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I &apos;m going to <unk> you already have heard other and you &apos;ve heard about and you &apos;re already <unk> some <unk> , in case you don &apos;t know .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
<unk> <unk> of what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all <unk> societies . The <unk> <unk> <unk> : &quot; If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens , &quot; The way to do it is to <unk> freedom to <unk> . &quot;
The reason is , on the one side , in fact that freedom is itself a value , is useful , useful , useful , <unk> , for humans .
<unk> else is is that if we &apos;re <unk> , every one of us can do everything we can do with our <unk> , without nobody <unk> that we &apos;re in the name of our <unk> .
The way to <unk> freedom is <unk> choice .
More choices and more people have <unk> , and more <unk> than the <unk> , the greater their <unk> , is their <unk> .
This is , <unk> , <unk> so <unk> in society that nobody <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And it &apos;s also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
And I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made it possible .
This is my <unk> . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m going to have a simple note on the <unk> for <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the 12 <unk> you can buy for a huge <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that nobody is in the <unk> <unk> that nobody is already to <unk> .
That &apos;s what the <unk> is .
And then you go to the <unk> store for buy a <unk> : <unk> , radio , <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there &apos;s a large number of <unk> .
We can make six million <unk> and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one just store .
<unk> <unk> there is <unk> choice .
<unk> fields : the world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a kid , you could get all the <unk> services , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the phone , you don &apos;t <unk> it .
A <unk> of that , by the way , was that the phone never <unk> .
These days they went .
Now we have a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , especially between cell phones .
Here &apos;s cell phones of the future .
My <unk> is the one in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for the <unk> <unk> .
If you don &apos;t have seen it in the house , you &apos;re very well <unk> that will soon be <unk> .
And what happens is that people <unk> in the <unk> and ask the question , and they ask this question , and you know what the answer is ? The answer is &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do <unk> things .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , they <unk> the same <unk> as choices .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> , no longer happens in the United States you <unk> from the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> you have to do .
Instead , <unk> from <unk> , and the <unk> says , &quot; OK , we could do A , or <unk> , &quot; A <unk> , &quot; <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> . &quot; &quot; <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You were like , &quot; <unk> , what would you do ? &quot;
And the <unk> says , &quot; He has these <unk> and these <unk> , and <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; You know , if you were me , what would you say ? &quot;
And the <unk> , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
And the result we call it &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; which makes it look beautiful .
But it actually doesn &apos;t <unk> the weight and the responsibility for making decisions by someone who knows something , <unk> the <unk> , to <unk> , and certainly not that <unk> is <unk> -- and it &apos;s not in the <unk> <unk> , and then not in the <unk> <unk> to make decisions , the patient decisions .
There &apos;s a huge <unk> of <unk> products , you &apos;ll be able to people like me and you , that if you think about it , it doesn &apos;t make any sense , because we can &apos;t <unk> it .
But if we can &apos;t <unk> it , why are we going to <unk> them ?
The answer is , they want to <unk> we call the <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of this <unk> as it is our <unk> now is a question of choice , as you see in this <unk> . &quot; We want to <unk> kids . We want to <unk> the kids . We want to get the kids to the right now . &quot; We have to <unk> it .
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> .
That means that every <unk> , at the <unk> , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
We went to the family and <unk> , a time perspective , common <unk> for anybody , was that you would have <unk> as soon as possible .
The only real choice was to who , not when , and not , and what to do after that .
<unk> , it &apos;s really to play .
<unk> to students very smart , and they <unk> their 20 percent <unk> on less than a time .
And not because they &apos;re not <unk> , because they &apos;re not <unk> , because they &apos;re <unk> .
But why I &apos;m <unk> , you know , &quot; <unk> <unk> or not ? Do you want to do it now ? &quot;
&quot; Do you want to think before the kids or the career ? <unk> ? &quot;
They are <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this <unk> doesn &apos;t <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and do not <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And they really have to do it . They &apos;re important questions .
Now , the work : we &apos;re <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> , because the technology allows us to work every minute , from every corner on the planet , <unk> that we &apos;re going to <unk> that from the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> , and I &apos;m not going to say no one , where the <unk> works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use it .
What does it mean , this incredible freedom that we have about to work ? It &apos;s that we have to decide , we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son to play <unk> , with the mobile phone , the other , the <unk> in the other , and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , on the <unk> .
And even though they &apos;re all <unk> , every minute that we see our <unk> son , we &apos;re also <unk> , we &apos;re also <unk> , &quot; Do I have to answer this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this <unk> ? I have to take this letter ? I &apos;m going to take this letter ? I &apos;m going to take this letter ? I &apos;m going to take you to <unk> this letter ? I have to take you to <unk> this letter ? I &apos;m going to take you to <unk> this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , that makes the experience of your child &apos;s very different than what it would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the <unk> , small things and big , objects and <unk> and life , life is a question of choices .
And once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibilities , but not everything was about choice .
The world of today is <unk> to this : <unk> is , &quot; Is it a <unk> thing <unk> , or <unk> ? &quot;
The answer is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> we all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the <unk> .
<unk> this choice two people who are <unk> on people .
The first one , <unk> , is that it <unk> instead of <unk> .
With a lot of <unk> between , you get , it &apos;s very difficult to do it .
I &apos;ll give you an example of <unk> : a <unk> study on <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> has had access to <unk> data , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , with about a million <unk> <unk> in <unk> different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> are <unk> in more , the <unk> <unk> <unk> of two percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s 10 percent <unk> in less than when they &apos;re only <unk> . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> between them , and you have to decide , and the choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And in <unk> , and still in <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , <unk> , and of course <unk> never comes never .
<unk> that it doesn &apos;t mean just that these <unk> <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don &apos;t have enough money , it also wants to say that the decision is so <unk> that the decision is so <unk> that the decision <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re not <unk> , until five <unk> <unk> <unk> per year from the work <unk> , which would be well <unk> to <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices .
And I think it &apos;s going to change the world like this .
&quot; And finally , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? &quot;
You &apos;re going to make the right decision , if it &apos;s for <unk> , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and you &apos;re going to have to choose the wrong .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even though we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice , at the end is less <unk> by the result of how we <unk> <unk> with less <unk> than you &apos;ve had to <unk> <unk> between .
And that &apos;s for several reasons .
One of them is that with so many <unk> between you and you put it on one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine you could have a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> the decision <unk> the decision <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> the decision , <unk> the decision <unk> ,
even when it was a decision .
More choices you have , it &apos;s easier to <unk> than <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , there &apos;s what <unk> call <unk> .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well known as the value that we give things <unk> from what we &apos;re <unk> .
<unk> else , when you have a lot of <unk> , it &apos;s easy to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;ll <unk> with all those who are not in New York .
But that &apos;s what it &apos;s probably going to happen .
There &apos;s this <unk> to the <unk> .
A place of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s nothing . But what he thinks , &quot; Well , <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
&quot; All my <unk> are away . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> right in front of your home . &quot;
And it <unk> two weeks <unk> from the idea that &apos;s <unk> -- every day -- the <unk> of <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> the <unk> for what we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And the more the <unk> we have from <unk> , the more the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> us as <unk> .
Here &apos;s another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It &apos;s about living the moment , and maybe even live the slowly of the way .
But the most important point is that anything you <unk> , you will <unk> not do other .
The things that don &apos;t know much <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s almost always <unk> .
And once the <unk> were , they were just one guy , and <unk> <unk> , and they were <unk> , and they were <unk> , only after they had a <unk> and they <unk> a lot of <unk> , and they were <unk> to go well .
So , I went to <unk> a couple of new when the <unk> were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> said to me , &quot; Do you want to <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
Do you want them with <unk> or with <unk> ? &quot; <unk> &quot; or &quot; <unk> &quot; ? &quot; <unk> &quot;
&quot; Do you want to <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> wants to <unk> or <unk> ? &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> to <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a while I could say , &quot; I want the guy , who was the only guy , &quot; he had no idea what it was , so for a time , I <unk> all the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then <unk> out of the <unk> , and then <unk> out of the <unk> , I &apos;ve ever had .
It was the <unk> . With that I had <unk> the best .
But I &apos;m worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for <unk> .
And the reason I was worse is that with all that choice my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
I was <unk> <unk> . I didn &apos;t know anything about <unk> when I just <unk> one guy , but when I was just <unk> 100 different , <unk> , at least one guy had to be perfect .
What I &apos;d <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After I had <unk> that I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in life of people &apos;s lives not <unk> the <unk> that these have <unk> <unk> that have <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> .
And this is less <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of the <unk> <unk> .
Because if I <unk> it , I &apos;m not going to talk about what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth will <unk> truth .
&quot; He was better when he was worse , &quot; The reason he was better when he was worse was when he was worse was even possible to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world that we live in -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are at the <unk> of <unk> .
You never have <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- that &apos;s , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; Yes , you want it . &quot;
I mean -- little <unk> moment -- that I &apos;m really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t have <unk> .
But it &apos;s not always a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> , you know , you know , there &apos;s only that kind of <unk> is that when you &apos;re not <unk> , and you &apos;re like , &quot; Why ? &quot;
Who is <unk> ? &quot; The answer is <unk> .
The world is the <unk> . What could I do ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of <unk> , and you get a <unk> , and you &apos;ll notice who &apos;s the <unk> , it &apos;s clear that the <unk> you are .
You could have to do it better .
With hundreds of <unk> , there are no <unk> <unk> , there are no <unk> for the <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even if the result is <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> and they &apos;re <unk> and they &apos;re <unk> to them .
In the last years , the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only one , but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is just that people have experiences because the <unk> are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation think that <unk> is they think that <unk> is .
So the final result is that in general we &apos;re better , <unk> , but we &apos;re worse .
Let me tell you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all get to good and is completely <unk> . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than that , but it &apos;s not going to be <unk> by this <unk> .
There &apos;s a <unk> value , <unk> . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m quite sure we &apos;ve <unk> from a piece of the level that the choices <unk> our lives .
Now , from a <unk> point of view -- I almost finished -- from a point of view , the <unk> is the <unk> .
What it allows all this choice in <unk> society is <unk> .
There are many places in the world , and you have <unk> <unk> , where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice .
The problem is they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> that I &apos;m talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does is : <unk> <unk> <unk> has talked about yesterday about how <unk> those <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> are <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> of money .
I mean these choices , <unk> and <unk> , not that &apos;s just <unk> .
They are <unk> <unk> .
They make us worse .
If you have what in our society <unk> choice was <unk> in those where people have too much chance , they don &apos;t just have their lives to <unk> , but also our lives .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income is <unk> <unk> <unk> . Not just to the poor -- not just to the poor people -- because of this choice in <unk> that we <unk> .
And to <unk> , &quot; <unk> , you can become everything you want , &quot;
<unk> , people of culture , they said , &quot; What are the fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s <unk> that you can &apos;t do anything in a glass of glass . &quot;
&quot; A <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> vision --
and I <unk> it like this , at the beginning .
But then , I realized , instead , I realized that fish knows that fish knows long .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you <unk> it , you can &apos;t <unk> the freedom . You get the <unk> .
If you <unk> the <unk> so that you can <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They all need a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
