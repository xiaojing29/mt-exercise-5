<unk> year I showed these <unk> for <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years , had the <unk> of the United States <unk> <unk> , <unk> , is <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> percent .
We &apos;re going to <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it &apos;s not <unk> the ice <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a way , the heart <unk> <unk> <unk> system .
They <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the summer .
The next <unk> is going to be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
You see , you <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That &apos;s the ice in <unk> , which was <unk> in summer .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , five years or more , it &apos;s like the blood , which here from the body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been like this .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> <unk> around the ocean <unk> <unk> , where there are enormous amount of <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , that <unk> could <unk> , that <unk> <unk> , <unk> this point of not <unk> .
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is already <unk> from water .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : She &apos;s good . The question is , if we &apos;re also <unk> .
One reason is this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> river <unk> .
The <unk> had never <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> river , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how the <unk> level of the sea level , here is where the sea .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
<unk> other hand , the biggest <unk> of the planet , the biggest <unk> of the planet .
<unk> month , scientists have <unk> that the <unk> of the ice is in <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> feet of <unk> , like <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the third big <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , which few years ago , a few years ago , they were <unk> .
<unk> percent of the world &apos;s population <unk> <unk> by the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : this <unk> is the source of <unk> water <unk> of this city .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when we <unk> it , the same happens to <unk> water .
In California <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> of 40 percent .
<unk> <unk> are in crisis .
<unk> , as you read , they &apos;re <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the world <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of normal and without <unk> .
Sometimes <unk> <unk> in the last 30 years than <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of <unk> .
If you look at the <unk> context , you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years we &apos;ve <unk> millions of <unk> <unk> every day .
Look at the <unk> area , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and on both parts of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> oxygen in the ocean .
The biggest <unk> of global <unk> , together , <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of the <unk> of the <unk> , together to China .
And they <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> <unk> .
But we &apos;re <unk> to a <unk> of direction .
These are the <unk> projects over the last years and some <unk> <unk> .
In every way , there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> in our country .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> oil <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year for <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I <unk> image to <unk> me something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> <unk> .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen it on the <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> in America .
It &apos;s happened around <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> is a <unk> and happy .
It &apos;s <unk> here in America , and it &apos;s <unk> our economy .
<unk> the <unk> is always <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> price , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : A <unk> is <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The biggest society <unk> on the <unk> is <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
<unk> : So the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> two <unk> .
This is a <unk> , one of them .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> we see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> <unk> in our business .
So , our <unk> is <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make <unk> and <unk> the truth to <unk> .
In fact , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it &apos;s <unk> -- it &apos;s also a good <unk> .
So , we don &apos;t <unk> change .
We can do it .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> -- you &apos;ve heard a lot of them .
So , we &apos;ll take a <unk> structure to <unk> how it is about <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> are a little bit <unk> , but this is the sound of <unk> technology .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> , but <unk> technology , but <unk> technology that you see in the <unk> technology that you see .
We look at a look at this is the <unk> technology of <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> question and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : America &apos;s in crisis ; the economy , <unk> <unk> , <unk> crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all : our <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> , like <unk> <unk> and <unk> oil .
Now , there &apos;s a new <unk> , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A plan for <unk> America at work , <unk> more <unk> , and help <unk> global <unk> .
<unk> , a solution that we <unk> to solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
<unk> : This is the last .
<unk> : <unk> : It &apos;s <unk> energy to America .
One of the more <unk> ways to <unk> <unk> the <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , the <unk> , a new <unk> network .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> for places <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> America . It &apos;s time to be <unk> .
<unk> : A old <unk> says , &quot; If you want to go to , you go to the <unk> , you &apos;re going to go to , you know , you know , you &apos;re <unk> .
If you want to go to go , you go to go to the <unk> . &quot;
We have to go far , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED I did a <unk> on the <unk> .
And I was <unk> to <unk> about how the car works .
So here . And for the ones that the other time , there were no , the <unk> is the biggest <unk> experiment that ever <unk> -- <unk> miles .
<unk> his task is <unk> that they were <unk> less than a <unk> <unk> of a second <unk> from the beginning of the universe -- until <unk> million times per second .
All this is just <unk> .
This is the <unk> machine .
They <unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk> .
This is what work . It &apos;s called <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> <unk> feet , and it &apos;s <unk> feet .
This is a <unk> image of <unk> in the building so you can see the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> last year , we <unk> the car for the first time .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> particles that had done everything around <unk> , <unk> , with a <unk> of <unk> , with a <unk> of <unk> , with a <unk> , with a <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> particles in the <unk> .
In other words , when we <unk> that image the <unk> 10 <unk> , <unk> that the car <unk> , the <unk> machine , the <unk> <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if this is <unk> us more or this , when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that the <unk> page was this .
That means we had a <unk> impact <unk> .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the car , to be right here -- these <unk> <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works when the car works in the <unk> of <unk> .
Now , <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> , &quot; is not true . I &apos;m <unk> too <unk> . &quot;
And instead they can do it because when they &apos;re very <unk> <unk> .
So , at less <unk> degrees , at a temperature <unk> <unk> to that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk> , and that you &apos;re <unk> of about 30 <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
They &apos;re going to be now all about their <unk> .
<unk> the end of <unk> <unk> will be again .
<unk> , and we <unk> it , and we <unk> it , and continue so our <unk> to find out what the <unk> that <unk> the universe <unk> that <unk> the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these <unk> <unk> <unk> the value of science and engineering engineering <unk> . It &apos;s easy to be <unk> .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that the <unk> , I think it &apos;s the value of things like <unk> .
I &apos;d like to end with the words of a <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> , which , <unk> , in <unk> of <unk> experiments of his <unk> , <unk> <unk> , he said , &quot; <unk> is <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> is not <unk> in nature , which our <unk> ideas of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> to <unk> when , from children , <unk> with <unk> .
As we <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that <unk> most of the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects , with my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I started <unk> , I started <unk> , and I started <unk> , &quot; and , when we use a computer , instead of having the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
and we &apos;re going to <unk> our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that I was going to explore the answer , building the <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a big <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a big <unk> .
You can <unk> them with their hand , they can <unk> it , and they <unk> it and they have a screen and they have a <unk> screen and a radio <unk> .
But <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> .
<unk> is the example of a new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the movement , <unk> of the movement , of others , and as they become more <unk> , <unk> of their movement , of others , as we can explore and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m going to start with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show you of the video , if we <unk> it in a direction , the <unk> video so , if we <unk> from the other <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of others .
If you <unk> them , they <unk> them , they <unk> them ,
If they &apos;re <unk> , they <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit .
If they &apos;re <unk> , they <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We have a <unk> interesting <unk> that one of the interesting <unk> was to use common <unk> on data , for example , &quot; <unk> a color , if it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> <unk> and I can <unk> it for <unk> color in the central color , where you &apos;re <unk> .
and I can <unk> it to <unk> color in the central color , where you &apos;re <unk> .
If we can <unk> too , we can <unk> a little bit .
I &apos;m also <unk> <unk> , like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> games where people can try and do things , and they <unk> the results .
Now I &apos;m --
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> program I do with a <unk> program .
So here we have a game of words that &apos;s <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at every <unk> <unk> a letter in every <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , at every <unk> <unk> a letter in case , and as they <unk> <unk> <unk> words on a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you &apos;ve got a new <unk> of <unk> and new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities of <unk> .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s <unk> children in <unk> <unk> <unk> , I did it in a way that I <unk> them and <unk> a video .
They &apos;re very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things that &apos;s not going to give people a lot of <unk> .
I just say , &quot; <unk> of words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , there right .
In fact , it &apos;s not just <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> <unk> .
We had to build a tool for the <unk> of <unk> . He &apos;s <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So , it &apos;s going to get out the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now he took a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> .
<unk> work !
So , <unk> <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It &apos;s a <unk> with open , and it can decide decide how you <unk> .
<unk> : It &apos;s a <unk> with open , and it can decide decide how you <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have time to show you is a <unk> , I made of recently , to <unk> and <unk> music .
It &apos;s a <unk> , <unk> recently , to <unk> and <unk> music .
<unk> here from <unk> <unk> as <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of these has four different <unk> , and you can choose .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence of <unk> <unk> .
And they just <unk> a <unk> of sound , &quot; and a <unk> . &quot;
These are actually the fact that you can control from live , like <unk> and <unk> .
We <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are actually <unk> , as time and <unk> , which <unk> into the whole sequence .
<unk> like this works .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> in a series , <unk> , <unk> , other <unk> .
Now , I &apos;m going to take a <unk> line .
<unk> : <unk> : Now , <unk> <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> : And now I <unk> the <unk> to the <unk> , so I can control the <unk> effect from live .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the whole sequence of time , or another .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the sequence .
So I don &apos;t have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> , <unk> more or more <unk> .
And now , I finally , I can <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> on the left <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of this <unk> , and also some possibility that we &apos;re trying to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to <unk> is that <unk> generation of <unk> objects to <unk> with the media <unk> , which <unk> information in our world , which we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time to talk to all of you .
I &apos;m a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it &apos;s more than this , of course .
It &apos;s also love and my <unk> of my life .
And I don &apos;t look like that can change .
But , he said , something particular happened in my life , and in my life , who <unk> me to <unk> the whole relationship with this job .
The particular thing is I wrote this book , this <unk> called &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; which I was <unk> , &quot; which I was <unk> , for some reason , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that everywhere , people <unk> me as if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
I &apos;m going to be now , and they say , &quot; Don &apos;t fear of me , do better than you ?
You don &apos;t fear of <unk> to write all the life without being able to create a book that can <unk> somebody to do ? &quot;
What could you <unk> somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , to part of the <unk> <unk> , I remember people -- I was a <unk> -- I was a <unk> -- I was <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk> .
They <unk> to the same <unk> from fear .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t <unk> to have success ?
Are you not fear that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> you ?
You don &apos;t fear to do this <unk> for all life without any life without any life , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
So , you know .
The short answer to all these questions is , is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yeah , I &apos;m afraid of all of those things .
I always fear .
And I really fear of many other things that people can &apos;t <unk> .
As <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , for how do it , and I thought , and I thought <unk> <unk> is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It &apos;s <unk> that anybody who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel to do .
But what &apos;s so particular <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> about <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> do not ?
As my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and I don &apos;t remember one time in his 40 years of activity in which he was asked if she had fear <unk> ?
We didn &apos;t have -- that <unk> of John <unk> , like <unk> ?
Don &apos;t we <unk> it , <unk> ?
<unk> , the engineers like group didn &apos;t have , in <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
We have <unk> , we have enough this <unk> , and not only <unk> , but <unk> of all , we have this <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
And we &apos;re not going to look at the <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often to their hand .
And the ones that don &apos;t seem to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before he died , in the last <unk> said , &quot; Every book , &quot; <unk> my book was <unk> about work of their life .
But we don &apos;t know , when we say , because we &apos;ve heard these things so long , we have <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> , at the end , at the end , always <unk> to <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> to all here today is : Are you right ?
I &apos;m going to be well . because I &apos;m going to <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of me not going to be good for anything .
I think it &apos;s <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s also <unk> and I don &apos;t want to <unk> <unk> in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better <unk> our great <unk> to live .
And I &apos;m sure , in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I &apos;m in my own <unk> career .
<unk> -- <unk> look , I &apos;m rather young , I &apos;m about 40 years .
I have a lot of work in me .
And it &apos;s very <unk> that any <unk> of the world as <unk> as the work that <unk> after the work that <unk> after the work that <unk> after the <unk> of my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we &apos;re all more or less friends -- it &apos;s <unk> that my biggest <unk> is my biggest <unk> is my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> , who thought !
You know , this is the kind of thought that <unk> a person to start <unk> <unk> to nine <unk> <unk> <unk> in the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I &apos;m going to continue to do this work that .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so I think , after a lot of <unk> , which the way to work to write is what to continue to do is a <unk> <unk> , right ?
I have to have a <unk> distance between me , which I &apos;m <unk> , and my natural <unk> <unk> on which I was <unk> , and my natural <unk> <unk> on which was going to be looking through the time , to look through the time , trying to find other society to see whether we &apos;re going to have more <unk> ideas and more <unk> .
as to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research <unk> me to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> because they <unk> and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> -- people don &apos;t believe that <unk> creativity from men , OK ?
It <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men from a few <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for reasons <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity <unk> <unk> of creativity .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> <unk> <unk> from far away .
<unk> were the same idea , but they <unk> the kind of <unk> spirit without a <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> , because the <unk> doesn &apos;t really <unk> that a <unk> was particularly <unk> .
I thought that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> literally <unk> in the <unk> of the study of a <unk> , a little <unk> , and <unk> out to <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of that work .
<unk> <unk> here , that &apos;s the distance of the <unk> -- that <unk> you &apos;re going to <unk> you from your work .
And everybody <unk> that was so <unk> , right ?
So , artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like for example , why don &apos;t it ?
If your work was <unk> not <unk> all the <unk> , you all <unk> that <unk> state of this <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , you didn &apos;t know your work , right ?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> creativity <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time .
Then the <unk> <unk> and everything , and we &apos;ll <unk> this big idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe and the <unk> and <unk> and without <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the <unk> <unk> and people <unk> to think that <unk> creativity is completely <unk> .
And for the first time , you <unk> in history , you &apos;re <unk> to <unk> this artist or a rather <unk> that person with a <unk> person with <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think that I &apos;ll <unk> to somebody , a simple person to believe being a <unk> like the source , the <unk> and the <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s like to say somebody &apos;s <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> the <unk> and makes all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it was this pressure to have <unk> artists in <unk> 500 years .
And , if that &apos;s true , and I think it &apos;s , the question becomes , and now ?
We can do that <unk> ?
We go back to a more <unk> understanding of <unk> between humans and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can &apos;t <unk> 500 years of thinking about a 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s a lot of people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of , <unk> , you &apos;re going to <unk> people <unk> on their projects .
I &apos;m probably not going to tell you all about this thing .
But the question I &apos;d like to <unk> is -- why not ?
Why not we &apos;re going to be able to <unk> this way ?
Because it has more sense of every other thing that has ever heard about the <unk> <unk> <unk> process .
A process , like anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- knows , you know , you don &apos;t know <unk> .
And in fact , it can be completely <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> , who has now 90 years , but it was a <unk> for all life and he said that during his <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> , and <unk> , within the <unk> <unk> .
He said he was like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And he <unk> to her <unk> to her <unk> .
They <unk> it , because he <unk> the land under his feet .
We had to have one thing to do that point and was , words , &quot; <unk> like a <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And so we went to home and he was <unk> by this <unk> , and it didn &apos;t have to take a piece of paper and a <unk> <unk> <unk> on , as the <unk> , as <unk> and <unk> on the page .
Sometimes I don &apos;t <unk> to be quite fast , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> through her house and she would <unk> <unk> through the <unk> , and he would <unk> through the <unk> , trying to <unk> , trying to <unk> , and he would <unk> through the <unk> , trying to <unk> , and she would <unk> through the <unk> , trying to <unk> , and she would <unk> up
And then there were those times -- this piece of never -- there were moments -- there were no moments , right ?
So , he was <unk> at home and he was trying to <unk> <unk> , and <unk> a <unk> <unk> right in , and he said , he was like <unk> , and he said , he was like <unk> with the other hand and <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> <unk> in his body and <unk> in his body and <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the page , and <unk> , but on the <unk> , from the last word .
So when I <unk> it -- it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not all my <unk> process -- I &apos;m not a <unk> .
I &apos;m a <unk> , and my way of <unk> is ; it <unk> every day and <unk> and work on it .
But even I , in my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I think that a lot of you the <unk> .
You know , even if the work and the ideas <unk> me <unk> from a certain source , I couldn &apos;t <unk> <unk> .
And what &apos;s this thing ?
And how do we <unk> it in a way to do not <unk> us to lose the head , but rather , that we <unk> face ?
So , I &apos;m going to talk about , the best example I &apos;ve <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I &apos;ve <unk> different years ago for a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , trying to control , <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But then <unk> , he was <unk> , and a day , as he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> everything for him .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk> , which is <unk> in his head like <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and <unk> , but it doesn &apos;t know how to <unk> .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , it &apos;s not a <unk> , it &apos;s not a <unk> .
So , starts to feel this kind of old old <unk> <unk> in him like , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and <unk> <unk> from this <unk> song .
I &apos;m not <unk> enough and I can &apos;t <unk> . &quot;
And instead of going to go to <unk> , they <unk> .
<unk> the whole process and he did something completely new .
I just <unk> the sky and said , &quot; <unk> , I don &apos;t see that I &apos;m <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Do you think that it &apos;s going to write a song ?
If you really want to <unk> , you &apos;re going to take care of you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> <unk> another today .
They &apos;re going to be <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And his <unk> process after this .
It wasn &apos;t the work , the work was still <unk> .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when they <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> back to where he was <unk> , that it wasn &apos;t going to be a <unk> , and <unk> .
But I was <unk> this , wonderful <unk> <unk> a conversation with <unk> and this thing <unk> and <unk> that but it was not <unk> .
So , how we <unk> that story to change a little bit of a little bit about <unk> , and I &apos;m going to <unk> once .
This idea , I was <unk> when I was <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; and <unk> in one of those <unk> <unk> <unk> that we all when we &apos;re working on something and we &apos;re working on something and not , and we start thinking that will be <unk> , and we start thinking that will be <unk> .
Not just <unk> , just the <unk> book .
And we started thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I &apos;m going to <unk> me to <unk> air and <unk> .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> <unk> in the room .
And I said , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , what , we know , what if this book is not going to be <unk> my , no ?
Because as you see I &apos;m <unk> all I have , I don &apos;t have more than this .
So if you want it to be better , you have to <unk> and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t , you know what , I don &apos;t know .
I started to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to say , I &apos;m <unk> today to do my own part , &quot; because , at the end of Africa &apos;s <unk> <unk> in <unk> Africa , <unk> <unk> in <unk> Africa , people <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> music that <unk> <unk> for hours and <unk> <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every one , <unk> , something , and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk> .
And I know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know you &apos;ve got all seen , at some point , a <unk> like this .
It was like the time , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> , and it wasn &apos;t doing anything different from , as the <unk> <unk> <unk> before , but everything was <unk> .
And a sudden not <unk> just like a human .
But it <unk> from <unk> and <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people <unk> what was , he <unk> him with his name .
<unk> your hands and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , <unk> , God , God , &quot; God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
<unk> <unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> with their <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> from &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
In <unk> , when a artist has done something impossible and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it &apos;s <unk> because we need .
But the problem is the day after , for the <unk> , when you <unk> and <unk> and <unk> that are <unk> / 11 <unk> and <unk> God <unk> <unk> and <unk> God is there .
It &apos;s just a <unk> with <unk> <unk> , and maybe it &apos;s not going to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And maybe no one <unk> the name of God , as <unk> , and what has to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so <unk> if you can &apos;t believe , <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of your being <unk> from you .
But let &apos;s just <unk> you data from a <unk> <unk> <unk> , you have to <unk> the source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to <unk> .
And , you know , if we think it &apos;s all changes .
And so I started <unk> , and it &apos;s certainly like I <unk> it for different months in the <unk> of the book that was <unk> soon , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of my <unk> success .
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is , I don &apos;t fear .
Don &apos;t <unk> . I &apos;m going to <unk> your work .
<unk> to <unk> your <unk> , any of it can be .
If your work is <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> .
If the <unk> , you &apos;ll <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> some <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for a <unk> , for a <unk> moment through your <unk> , then , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
<unk> , you do the same <unk> .
And I said , &quot; <unk> ! &quot; You &apos;re going to be .
I think and I think , <unk> <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot; <unk> , &quot; I just had a human love and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
You know , I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects on the human genome , on what can <unk> and discovery of new <unk> of genes .
Now we &apos;re going to take a new path : we started <unk> biology and now to start from that digital code we &apos;re <unk> in a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We &apos;ve always tried to <unk> big questions .
&quot; <unk> is the life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many <unk> I think they have <unk> to understand various levels .
We tried different <unk> , <unk> to <unk> terms .
We &apos;re <unk> by almost 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome is <unk> <unk> <unk> the world of <unk> biology in the computer world &apos;s <unk> .
Now , what can we <unk> life , or to create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which is the most small <unk> genome from the <unk> genome that they can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to <unk> the genome for <unk> a little more little bit more little bit more little bit more little .
We &apos;re able to <unk> a <unk> of genes about 500 are here .
But when we take a look at his map , it &apos;s <unk> simple than our .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at the time , it &apos;s very <unk> that this can bring a <unk> cell .
So I thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> <unk> in a way to <unk> <unk> some of these <unk> .
So we started the <unk> of the <unk> , &quot; can we <unk> a <unk> ? &quot;
Can the chemistry <unk> of making these big molecules that we never have done before ?
And , in case , we can make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The speed that we &apos;re able to <unk> the life is <unk> to <unk> .
Our ability to write the <unk> code , instead , <unk> , rather slowly , but it &apos;s <unk> .
And our <unk> <unk> on a <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve got <unk> more than 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before the first <unk> .
But we found out that <unk> of DNA is very difficult .
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> small <unk> of DNA <unk> , of <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> is a <unk> process : the <unk> is <unk> , <unk> there are .
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , <unk> <unk> information <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a little virus that <unk> bacteria .
We designed <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> , and we <unk> it in the bacteria , the bacteria have <unk> to read this <unk> code and <unk> particles .
<unk> particles have been <unk> by cells , they &apos;re <unk> back and they <unk> their <unk> .
I talked about recently with <unk> <unk> <unk> that they have been <unk> this model .
They have more than you .
<unk> that this is a situation where software can actually build its own <unk> system .
But we &apos;ll <unk> things to do things in big .
We had to build the whole <unk> of <unk> .
They &apos;re more than <unk> <unk> <unk> code .
So we thought of <unk> in <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , so that we can change the <unk> of a <unk> cell to be <unk> .
<unk> is <unk> , and if we <unk> with <unk> information in a computer , these have to be very <unk> .
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We found out , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If we used that sequence the <unk> sequence never been able to do it .
One of the process is design <unk> <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of 50 <unk> to build more small <unk> that <unk> together .
<unk> <unk> <unk> here .
You probably have read that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , we have a <unk> code that <unk> on four <unk> <unk> : <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together , about 20 <unk> , and there &apos;s a <unk> order to <unk> every <unk> .
So we can use the <unk> code for words , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did at the beginning was <unk> .
Some of them have been <unk> by the fact that it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> just <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> and <unk> them .
And we started <unk> parts , <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In every step , we <unk> these <unk> <unk> so that we &apos;re <unk> that we &apos;re <unk> to create a very <unk> <unk> as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to <unk> the process .
So , this looks like the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
When we started these <unk> <unk> , more than 100 <unk> <unk> , they didn &apos;t <unk> directly in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So we have <unk> other <unk> .
We &apos;re going to talk about another <unk> <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> <unk> to <unk> DNA <unk> .
Here &apos;s a example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , it can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In 12 hours -- 24 hours , it &apos;s exactly like before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can <unk> completely <unk> .
We live under <unk> .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and you &apos;re <unk> to find new <unk> of water .
In fact , NASA has shown this .
This is a <unk> image that we built using these <unk> , just using the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This image wasn &apos;t <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are <unk> <unk> a time <unk> a time .
This is the <unk> we did a little time ago .
They &apos;re more than <unk> <unk> code .
It &apos;s the biggest <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s got a <unk> weight at 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a 10 <unk> without spaces , we <unk> <unk> pages to <unk> this <unk> code .
Now , how do we work ? How can we <unk> ?
Of course , through a virus is a <unk> game .
It &apos;s a little bit more <unk> when they use bacteria .
It &apos;s <unk> cells , even when it &apos;s a <unk> cells like our : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the <unk> process .
In <unk> , the <unk> is instead of <unk> in the cell , but we <unk> that we &apos;re able to do a <unk> <unk> from a cell to a cell <unk> from a cell to the other and <unk> .
We have a <unk> <unk> <unk> from a <unk> species .
<unk> are different than men from <unk> .
We have <unk> some <unk> <unk> in a way we can decide what to choose to choose what to choose to choose to be .
He <unk> it with the <unk> <unk> in a way to <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the cell .
And we &apos;re going to <unk> that we didn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried it <unk> <unk> in there .
This is one of the <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> of some of the <unk> , <unk> in a second thousands of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So who think about evolution as a <unk> <unk> to the time you <unk> doesn &apos;t really understand much of biology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the DNA .
The <unk> that was in the cell <unk> .
<unk> <unk> we <unk> the <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , and it <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> , and we <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk> .
It &apos;s become blue <unk> because of genes we have <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a <unk> , and you &apos;re <unk> of all in a new species , <unk> on the software that we have <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when we <unk> the code <unk> exactly what we &apos;ve <unk> .
Now , this may be <unk> <unk> , but we can change the software , we can change the things in a <unk> way .
Now , I &apos;ve already <unk> that there is not about <unk> -- but progress from three million years , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to have a new version of <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new <unk> <unk> species on this process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s <unk> enough when we think about our <unk> .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion people to <unk> billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to give a example : I was born in <unk> .
Now , there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> ; in 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re going to take a <unk> , water and <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> for six billion people .
We &apos;re still going to be more <unk> to do it for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion <unk> , more than 30 billion <unk> .
That means percent of <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process of <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
In more <unk> we have to realize the <unk> of the CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
At the day of today , <unk> <unk> <unk> in the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are <unk> <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry just <unk> only a <unk> about <unk> , and think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here is <unk> data from the <unk> reality and our imagination .
Now , we have <unk> , <unk> these <unk> <unk> , can we create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think of these <unk> 20 million genes , we can change , to try to <unk> <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , with a little <unk> , we can change , because of a little <unk> , and create more <unk> biology <unk> .
And it &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> .
We can choose to choose <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , chemistry or <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software that we &apos;re working on for being able to <unk> and design species to design species at computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how to be .
We know exactly what their <unk> code .
Now we &apos;re <unk> on the <unk> generation .
You saw <unk> <unk> <unk> was a <unk> experiment was <unk> .
We have <unk> <unk> and third generation that will be <unk> enough to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way biology can have a big impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> the CO2 in matter before , for which we &apos;re working on , and we think we can have the first <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> generation .
<unk> <unk> <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> of the world , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> in the ocean , about <unk> feet <unk> to the <unk> temperature of water .
We &apos;re going to <unk> from the CO2 <unk> as energy as energy source .
We &apos;re trying to understand whether we can <unk> CO2 , which can easily be <unk> by <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So , we think we can be able to <unk> what we might <unk> what the question of the <unk> question . &quot; What is life is , we <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> the whole industry .
<unk> . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can &apos;t it ?
We &apos;re going to take a main source of energy .
<unk> , we &apos;re working on the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk> .
You saw this year with flu , we &apos;re always <unk> back to a year and with a dollar less <unk> when it &apos;s <unk> .
I think that what you can change <unk> in <unk> .
So the future might start looking at <unk> , the tree of evolution , <unk> evolution with bacteria , <unk> evolution , <unk> , <unk> , and finally <unk> cells .
We &apos;re at so on the <unk> people .
Our purpose is to do a way to live long enough to try to try to <unk> . Thank you very much .
First of all , I &apos;m going to show you , the <unk> , some <unk> , of the new technology that we took to <unk> a <unk> almost year ago . This is <unk> .
It &apos;s a environment that you can <unk> it is <unk> <unk> with a huge amount of data <unk> .
We &apos;re seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> of <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , to <unk> images like we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big <unk> data or the images .
Most of the <unk> of the <unk> photographs , but this is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> in <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It &apos;s not any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen in the screen , in any time . It &apos;s also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data not images .
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , we can <unk> that &apos;s not <unk> and images , we can do something like this , to make a really <unk> of the <unk> , not a picture of the <unk> , not a picture .
It could be a little bit <unk> to read a book .
I don &apos;t <unk> it .
This is a <unk> example . It &apos;s a <unk> number of <unk> .
Every image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it gives you a really <unk> experience the <unk> version of read a <unk> version of a <unk> , which is a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> , which is a kind of a <unk> .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the <unk> .
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> much more than the <unk> <unk> that you use in a normal <unk> , and we <unk> the content of the <unk> <unk> .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see here .
Or other models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
We think that this <unk> <unk> , and other <unk> <unk> , not <unk> , <unk> , not <unk> to be <unk> .
Of course , <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this not want to lose time , if we don &apos;t say that we have <unk> <unk> to even though we &apos;re going to be able to lose it in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. <unk> <unk> on a <unk> image of NASA <unk> .
So let &apos;s start to do something else .
This is actually a live on the web ; you can see it .
It &apos;s a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s live on the web , <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from another picture and have this kind of experience <unk> experience .
But the <unk> <unk> of images here has actually a meaning .
<unk> <unk> of <unk> computer <unk> these images together , in a way that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk> . Here you see <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , and these things are all <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more <unk> .
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> data <unk> and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> that we &apos;ve done for the first summer , for the summer <unk> , for the summer , the <unk> technology , the <unk> technology , the <unk> technology , the <unk> technology , and it &apos;s not <unk> to looking at the website . And it &apos;s not <unk> to look at the website .
We had to <unk> <unk> and so on .
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> images of kinds of <unk> , and so on . <unk> of these <unk> and <unk> . <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> a image that &apos;s <unk> .
So they &apos;re all <unk> images from <unk> and they &apos;re all <unk> <unk> in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to <unk> it in this way .
You know , I never thought about <unk> to work for <unk> .
It &apos;s very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think we &apos;re going to see that it &apos;s a lot of different kinds of <unk> : from those cell phones <unk> , a <unk> number , a <unk> number , <unk> <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , I can <unk> them , <unk> ,
Many are <unk> by <unk> , etc .
<unk> here is a series of photographs -- <unk> -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from <unk> to the <unk> of this environment .
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now <unk> data from the whole <unk> of the whole <unk> of how <unk> the land , from the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> all of those data together .
All those pictures become <unk> , more than the <unk> of parts .
You have a model of the Earth <unk> .
Think of this as a <unk> <unk> <unk> on Earth <unk> <unk> on Earth <unk> .
It &apos;s something that <unk> in complexity , as people <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> .
Their picture are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people .
If somebody &apos;s the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> , my <unk> <unk> , my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of those data <unk> , and I can use it as a <unk> <unk> , using the <unk> of all of these <unk> , using the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> experience .
Of course , a <unk> of all of that are extremely <unk> <unk> of every part of the land , <unk> not only from <unk> <unk> and <unk> images and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What &apos;s your software that your software <unk> us to do is that at a certain point , in the next years , all the <unk> <unk> of anybody in the world &apos;s <unk> <unk> together ?
<unk> : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is <unk> is to discover .
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> , if you want , in the images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the <unk> of images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> of the <unk> of these <unk> images .
As a <unk> <unk> on the web , you <unk> a <unk> and the <unk> page on the web of the <unk> of the images of the images of the images of the picture of the images .
Now , what &apos;s happening if that picture <unk> all your <unk> ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> <unk> that <unk> is really enormous . It &apos;s a <unk> effect of the network .
CA : <unk> , it &apos;s really incredible .
<unk> : <unk> you very much .
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> <unk> research is the <unk> that they didn &apos;t <unk> the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> plants .
We think that <unk> <unk> <unk> even more than the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> still <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> , to remember the <unk> <unk> , to remember the <unk> of <unk> , and that the idea that we have no <unk> in <unk> , but it &apos;s a model of <unk> , it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done , well , or <unk> , a lot of <unk> .
And , of course , all of the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> . <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We have to <unk> the death of death , so we don &apos;t <unk> if you <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art .
What <unk> is the <unk> of the song , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of <unk> , or a <unk> <unk> heart of <unk> .
He was my <unk> <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , on the <unk> , on the <unk> , the <unk> mother of the world .
All of these <unk> us that are <unk> ways of other <unk> ways of <unk> other ways of thinking , other ways of <unk> , other ways of <unk> ,
And , if you <unk> a moment , it &apos;s a <unk> that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> that <unk> the planet and it &apos;s important for the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> , dreams , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> in being from the human <unk> .
<unk> is the <unk> of humanity .
It &apos;s the <unk> of what we &apos;re is and what we can be in the <unk> species .
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all the species was <unk> , or is on the <unk> of <unk> <unk> -- in the <unk> <unk> -- in the <unk> <unk> -- in the <unk> of diversity -- and not even <unk> <unk> -- and you don &apos;t even know , <unk> <unk> -- that diversity .
<unk> of all that is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not just <unk> from a <unk> or a series of <unk> rules .
A language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle with the <unk> of every culture comes in the world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , as we &apos;re sitting here at least <unk> , at least half of the children .
They &apos;re not <unk> to children , the <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> , not <unk> something that they &apos;re already <unk> .
What &apos;s more <unk> of the <unk> of being <unk> by the <unk> , of being the last to talk about a language , not to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of somebody in the world every two weeks : every two weeks , every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> and <unk> with it in the <unk> <unk> <unk> of a <unk> language .
And I know that somebody of you say , &quot; Don &apos;t do it ?
The world would not be a better place if you all the same language ? &quot; <unk> , then we all talk about <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re going to be a <unk> thing to talk about their language .
I &apos;m going to take you journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we &apos;re <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say , &quot; different ways of <unk> <unk> . &quot; I &apos;m going to <unk> different ways of <unk> .
So , for example , this <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s not able to <unk> the blue color from the green <unk> because the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; you have a different person talking about language .
And all of that has <unk> in the past <unk> , the <unk> is that in these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> no one language .
They <unk> up to listen and then <unk> to talk .
I &apos;m going to take some interesting <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> , a <unk> <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They did <unk> from the <unk> photographs that <unk> them in <unk> that <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> <unk> forest <unk> had never seen anything .
They <unk> the <unk> of the land , they <unk> to <unk> a form or a <unk> and , not <unk> anything , they <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> <unk> with the <unk> .
But <unk> <unk> not only <unk> <unk> .
They <unk> <unk> between them .
<unk> percent of the death <unk> was <unk> by their own .
We &apos;re <unk> eight <unk> and we found two cases of death and when we <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was so <unk> that he died , and then they <unk> it . And then they <unk> it . <unk> <unk> <unk> every way , they had a <unk> <unk> forest .
<unk> were able to recognize the <unk> animal <unk> <unk> and 40 <unk> .
<unk> years , I was <unk> a really interesting task when my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> , if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk>
To give a sense of <unk> , I should have to understand the <unk> culture and <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s pretty <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , very interesting .
If you &apos;re going to <unk> the great <unk> of the world , what do ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking about Africa , <unk> <unk> doesn &apos;t have <unk> . And instead of <unk> <unk> is not the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> during the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes interesting is <unk> is the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of live in a little <unk> of live in a short time , the <unk> becomes the <unk> .
So , the <unk> <unk> say , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> to talk about God .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God .
And from the moment you &apos;re <unk> , is the spirit that <unk> you , how do you do some <unk> ?
So , you <unk> these incredible <unk> <unk> : <unk> in the state of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather <unk> of power on the body when it &apos;s <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> all the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that once once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> never been <unk> by <unk> .
In <unk> , I &apos;m <unk> from a <unk> , but their <unk> is <unk> extraordinary .
<unk> young <unk> <unk> for 18 , or four years , and they live in a world <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> of the nine years of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , in this time , they &apos;re <unk> , values that <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or for the <unk> <unk> .
At the term , this incredible <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> out and for the first time in life , at the age of 18 , <unk> . And in that moment of <unk> <unk> , when the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , everything that they learned in <unk> <unk> , everything that they learned in all of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> :
&quot; <unk> ? <unk> like I said .
It &apos;s <unk> . Now it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
They call the <unk> bigger and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re the <unk> of the world .
This level of <unk> is extremely important .
When we think about <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> history of <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are more <unk> to the Earth &apos;s <unk> to the Earth of us .
<unk> <unk> <unk> are not <unk> <unk> .
There &apos;s no <unk> space for these things in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or <unk> , but <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , but <unk> , <unk> , they created a <unk> of the Earth <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , because it &apos;s <unk> by the human <unk> .
What does that mean ?
<unk> to say that a <unk> of <unk> that <unk> the mountain is a <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> his <unk> will be a different <unk> and will have a <unk> <unk> <unk> , or that &apos;s a very different <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> that <unk> a mountain <unk> <unk> that <unk> a mountain <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
which is the <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What &apos;s interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
That <unk> me a human being different from my friends who believe that <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If we started <unk> that these <unk> can create actually create different <unk> , we &apos;ll start to understand some of their <unk> <unk> .
I <unk> this picture of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard about the <unk> , the most powerful <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes it fascinating is not the potential <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , but his <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> by two things .
At the one side , this <unk> <unk> that <unk> a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> a little <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> family <unk> said .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you &apos;ll see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> that they do from a different <unk> of species , <unk> it <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea . <unk> doesn &apos;t make a <unk> <unk> .
I often <unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> was <unk> , with his <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> my <unk> can &apos;t be <unk> these <unk> , because if you &apos;re not going to tell no one of being <unk> . <unk> <unk> , but they can &apos;t be <unk> because they &apos;re <unk> by a <unk> that you can &apos;t be <unk> because they &apos;re <unk> by a <unk> that you can &apos;t tell you to tell them because they &apos;re <unk> .
It &apos;s possible to <unk> <unk> if we <unk> with other <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Now , <unk> is the <unk> that you &apos;re in this <unk> are <unk> of <unk> , the same kind of <unk> , the <unk> question : <unk> <unk> . The question <unk> : in a <unk> of <unk> species , like <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , but if they <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , they do a <unk> <unk> <unk> , they create a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you go to the <unk> , we &apos;ll <unk> the plants .
What does that mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , who <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that we <unk> in the forest , and our eyes <unk> in the same species .
If you <unk> the <unk> of their <unk> <unk> <unk> , you &apos;re going to <unk> plants , you don &apos;t know everything ? &quot; I said , &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : they take the <unk> <unk> in a night of <unk> and <unk> with a different <unk> .
With this doesn &apos;t <unk> , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> .
Now , <unk> the problem is that even the ones that have <unk> heart <unk> <unk> <unk> them <unk> , but in some way <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , but in some way <unk> <unk> <unk> of our real world , and <unk> over .
In fact , the <unk> century , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk> , but rather like the <unk> <unk> of <unk> diversity , but rather like the <unk> <unk> of <unk> diversity and we <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . Now , the problem is not the change .
All the <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new <unk> for life .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> didn &apos;t have <unk> when they put it on the <unk> and <unk> like <unk> <unk> <unk> , they didn &apos;t have <unk> to be <unk> when they put it out of <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It &apos;s the power of <unk> . It &apos;s the power of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
And if you take a look at the world , you &apos;ll see these are not <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> and <unk> out of the existence of <unk> <unk> that go beyond their <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> --
<unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and now <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
We started <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or , in the case of <unk> , are <unk> <unk> with the <unk> discovery of <unk> .
If we <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the <unk> of <unk> politics .
As <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of a <unk> , is <unk> <unk> , but the <unk> of <unk> life , but the <unk> of <unk> life , not only is <unk> , but not only <unk> , because it &apos;s <unk> <unk> , because it &apos;s <unk> <unk> , because it &apos;s <unk> part of development .
And you can &apos;t understand the <unk> of <unk> until they <unk> it .
I have the <unk> miles from <unk> in the <unk> China , <unk> <unk> with a young <unk> , but only they got to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only they got to <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father &apos;s father &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> is that it &apos;s been <unk> to the Chinese time .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> in <unk> at age of two <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> because he couldn &apos;t live without him .
<unk> , who has done the same , was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
One day he <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to work for seven years .
<unk> <unk> <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> <unk> of <unk> is <unk> .
And then , all <unk> up to a choice .
<unk> in the world of <unk> , or we want to <unk> the world of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he said that his biggest <unk> was <unk> , in our <unk> to go to this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that they were <unk> , but a day <unk> <unk> that they were <unk> to <unk> that other people had .
And it &apos;s <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
<unk> <unk> , who has given us <unk> <unk> , which has <unk> us to <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> world has <unk> <unk> 300 years .
That <unk> story , I didn &apos;t know , we have the answers to all the challenges that we &apos;re going to <unk> .
When these <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human , we &apos;ll <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all <unk> the possibility of being what we are : a <unk> , which has to make it in a way that all the <unk> and all the <unk> moments . And there are great moments of <unk> .
I <unk> this picture on the north <unk> of <unk> <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> , and this man , <unk> me , and this man , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> history .
The government <unk> was not <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , and in the <unk> of our <unk> , we <unk> them .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> for his life , <unk> , and all his <unk> .
We want to know that <unk> doesn &apos;t <unk> the cold , <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> were <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn &apos;t <unk> from night or <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> the <unk> in skin skin skin <unk> and <unk> in their hand . When I did I <unk> , he <unk> it , it &apos;s <unk> and <unk> it and <unk> it <unk> .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
It &apos;s <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , he <unk> another dog , and it &apos;s <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> with nothing ? <unk> <unk> ? <unk> <unk> . And this , in different ways , <unk> is the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world .
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in California .
It &apos;s their new <unk> . It &apos;s called <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . We <unk> all the <unk> resources .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , to end , I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> at least at least , who &apos;s been in these <unk> <unk> , that they didn &apos;t know any <unk> .
For somebody &apos;s house .
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that <unk> to <unk> <unk> . And for us all , the dreams of these children , like dreams , our children , become part of the <unk> <unk> of hope .
So , we &apos;re <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> never to anything .
<unk> that <unk> --
&#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; <unk> &#93; <unk> to tell the stories of the world . &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; . &#93;
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public <unk> in places , <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk> , from <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and we have to find a <unk> <unk> world , and we have to find a <unk> world , and we need to find a <unk> world .
where the <unk> of all <unk> can <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I hope you &apos;ve heard about this book that I hope to <unk> some <unk> , in fact , you know , in fact , they don &apos;t <unk> them .
I &apos;d like to start with what I call &quot; the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
<unk> <unk> of what ?
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
The reason is , in fact , that the <unk> <unk> is <unk> , <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> is <unk> , <unk> for human beings .
And so , it &apos;s what we &apos;re <unk> , every one of us can do everything that we &apos;re <unk> , to do everything that we <unk> our <unk> , without no no one that <unk> in our name .
The way to <unk> the <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> people have , more <unk> , and more <unk> is their <unk> , more <unk> is their <unk> .
This , <unk> , it &apos;s so <unk> <unk> in society that no one <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And it &apos;s also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made it possible .
This is my <unk> . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m going to take a simple note about <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> <unk> <unk> that no one of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
That &apos;s what the <unk> .
And then you go to the <unk> store to buy a <unk> : <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a big number of <unk> .
We can do six million and a half of different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> that is <unk> choice .
<unk> <unk> : the world &apos;s <unk> .
One time , when I was a child , they could get all the <unk> services , <unk> <unk> that they were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
They <unk> the phone , they didn &apos;t <unk> .
A <unk> of that , <unk> , was that the phone <unk> never .
These days they went .
We now have a <unk> <unk> almost <unk> , especially between the cell phones .
That &apos;s the cell phones .
My <unk> is the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you don &apos;t even see it in the <unk> store , you &apos;re very <unk> .
And what the end is happening is that people will <unk> in <unk> and does this question . And it &apos;s the answer ? The answer is the answer ? The answer is &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do things .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , you <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> is not going to the United States in the United States that you &apos;re <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> you <unk> what you have to do .
Instead , <unk> from <unk> , and the <unk> says , &quot; OK , we can do , or <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> and these <unk> . What do you want to do you ? &quot;
You know , the <unk> , what do you do ? &quot;
And the <unk> says , &quot; <unk> these <unk> and these <unk> , and <unk> it has these <unk> and <unk> these <unk> and <unk> these <unk> and <unk> . &quot;
What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; <unk> if she was me , what ? &quot;
And the <unk> , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result we call &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not a <unk> the weight and the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , to <unk> , to <unk> , to <unk> , to <unk> , to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and so it doesn &apos;t know -- and so not in <unk> <unk> to make decisions that the patient .
There &apos;s a huge <unk> of <unk> products , <unk> people like me and you , who if you think about it , you know , if you think it doesn &apos;t have any sense , because we can &apos;t <unk> .
But if we can &apos;t <unk> , why do we <unk> them ?
The answer is that they want to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of how <unk> is a <unk> question , is a question of choice , like you see in this <unk> , &quot; We don &apos;t want to <unk> the <unk> . We don &apos;t want to <unk> the <unk> . We don &apos;t want to <unk> .
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> .
The <unk> means that every <unk> , <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
<unk> to family and <unk> , a time <unk> <unk> , <unk> almost for anyone , was that you <unk> the <unk> <unk> , and you <unk> to <unk> children , and you <unk> to <unk> their <unk> .
The only one of choice was with who , not when , and even what to do after .
<unk> , it &apos;s really to play .
They &apos;re going to be very smart , and they <unk> their <unk> percent <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And because they &apos;re not <unk> , because they &apos;re not <unk> .
But why are <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , or not ? <unk> , right ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> ? I have to think before children or <unk> ? &quot;
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this <unk> doesn &apos;t <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and not to get a <unk> <unk> to my <unk> .
And they really need to do that . They &apos;re important .
Now , the work : we &apos;re <unk> , as <unk> <unk> , because technology <unk> us to work every day , every day , <unk> that <unk> from <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> , and I don &apos;t say no one , where the <unk> works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , this incredible choice of choice we have about work ? It &apos;s that we need to decide , <unk> in every moment , if we have to work or no .
We can go to see our son , <unk> , with the <unk> in a <unk> , the <unk> in a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , on <unk> .
And even if they &apos;re all <unk> , every minute that we see our son <unk> , we &apos;re also <unk> , &quot; I have to answer this called &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this <unk> ? I have to <unk> this letter ? &quot;
And as the answer is , &quot; no , &quot; all this makes the experience your son of your son , very different from what would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the things , and big , big objects , <unk> and <unk> of life , life is a question of choices .
One time the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibility , but not all was a question of choice .
The world today is <unk> to this : The <unk> is , &quot; Is it a <unk> thing , or <unk> ? &quot;
The answer is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> them all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the <unk> of the <unk> .
We wanted this choice <unk> two effects of people .
The first , <unk> , is that it <unk> instead of <unk> .
With a lot of <unk> , and we &apos;re going to do it .
I &apos;m going to give you a <unk> example : a <unk> study of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> my <unk> has had access to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , with about a million <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> different <unk> companies .
What she has discovered is that for every 10 10 solutions are <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s 10 percent <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , because they &apos;re available only five . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> <unk> between which choose , is <unk> difficult to decide , and the choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And in <unk> , and still <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , never <unk> .
We think it &apos;s not just the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> , because they don &apos;t want to have enough money , it &apos;s so <unk> that <unk> the <unk> <unk> of work .
They &apos;re not going to be <unk> until five <unk> <unk> for a year from <unk> <unk> <unk> , who would be <unk> to <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices .
And I think that <unk> the world .
&quot; And then , to end up , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? &quot;
<unk> really to take the right decision , if it &apos;s the right decision , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the <unk> , and <unk> the wrong <unk> .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can <unk> the <unk> and make a choice , at the end of the result of how we were <unk> <unk> with less <unk> <unk> between which we choose to choose .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of <unk> <unk> , which is not a perfect <unk> , and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that it would be better . And what &apos;s happening . And what &apos;s happening is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> decision , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
even when it was a <unk> decision .
<unk> there are , more choices to <unk> any <unk> that is <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , there &apos;s what the <unk> call <unk> .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well <unk> like the value that we give things to <unk> things from what <unk> .
<unk> , you know , when there are lots of <unk> , it &apos;s easy to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here &apos;s a example . I &apos;m going to <unk> with all the ones that are not in New York .
But that &apos;s what it &apos;s probably <unk> .
There &apos;s this <unk> to the <unk> .
A place of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . It &apos;s all about their <unk> .
It &apos;s not going to be <unk> . But what he thinks he &apos;s , &quot; Well , <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
&quot; All my <unk> are <unk> . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And it <unk> two weeks from the idea that &apos;s <unk> -- every day -- the possibility of <unk> where it wants .
<unk> <unk> the <unk> for what we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And more are the <unk> that we have <unk> , more <unk> <unk> <unk> us <unk> <unk> .
Here &apos;s another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It &apos;s about living the moment , and maybe it &apos;s perhaps <unk> .
But the most important point is that any thing you &apos;re <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> , you &apos;re not going to do the other .
The things that don &apos;t <unk> have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk> .
They &apos;re going to be <unk> .
One time the <unk> were just a kind , <unk> them and <unk> them and <unk> <unk> , they were <unk> , just after <unk> a lot of times , <unk> , <unk> , and they were going to go well .
So , I started <unk> a couple of when they were <unk> , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> said , &quot; Do you want to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> ? &quot;
<unk> you want to <unk> or <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> wants to <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> -- &quot; <unk> <unk> -- &quot; <unk> <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a little bit of , I was able to say , &quot; I want the only kind of , &quot; he didn &apos;t know what it was , so for a <unk> , I &apos;m <unk> all <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then <unk> from the <unk> , <unk> , with the best couple of <unk> I had ever .
It was <unk> . With all that choice I had <unk> the best .
But I &apos;ll <unk> worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for <unk> .
The reason I was I was worse with all that choice , my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
I had <unk> <unk> . I didn &apos;t know anything about <unk> when I was just <unk> a guy , but when we <unk> 100 , at least a kind of had to be perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but I didn &apos;t perfect .
After I was <unk> to the <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in life of people don &apos;t do <unk> the <unk> that these have <unk> <unk> <unk> that these have <unk> <unk> .
And this <unk> less <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of <unk> , it makes it .
Because if I <unk> it , I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The <unk> truth <unk> to this .
&quot; He was better when he was <unk> , &quot; The reason he was better when you were <unk> , you were still <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world that we live -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that the things that are <unk> to the <unk> .
You &apos;ve never <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; Yes , you want it . &quot;
I mean -- small <unk> moment -- that I &apos;m really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn &apos;t have better , I &apos;m not <unk> .
But <unk> doesn &apos;t always <unk> it &apos;s a <unk> .
<unk> , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> , when there &apos;s only that kind of <unk> <unk> , when you &apos;re not <unk> , and you &apos;re <unk> , and you &apos;re <unk> , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who &apos;s <unk> ? &quot; The answer is <unk> .
The world is <unk> . What can I do you do ?
When there are hundreds of <unk> , and they <unk> a <unk> , and you <unk> a <unk> , and you &apos;ll <unk> you who &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> <unk> you are .
We could have better .
With hundreds of <unk> <unk> available , there are not <unk> for <unk> .
So when people take decisions , even if the result is <unk> , they <unk> and give them <unk> and they <unk> their own .
In the last years , the <unk> is <unk> in the world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only , but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is just that people have experiences because they &apos;re too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation think that <unk> is their <unk> .
So the final result is that we &apos;re better , <unk> , but we &apos;ll <unk> it .
We &apos;ll say that <unk> you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what all take for good and is completely <unk> . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no <unk> that a little bit better , it &apos;s better than not <unk> , but by this doesn &apos;t <unk> that much better than a little bit better .
There &apos;s a <unk> value , <unk> . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve <unk> from a piece of a piece of the level that the choices <unk> our life .
Now , from <unk> <unk> -- I &apos;ve been <unk> -- from the point of view , the <unk> is <unk> .
What it allows all this choice in the <unk> society is the <unk> material .
There are a lot of places in the world , and you &apos;re going to be <unk> , where the problem is not <unk> .
The problem is that they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> I &apos;m talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what it does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> of money .
I mean , these choices , <unk> and <unk> , is not just <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
They do that be worse .
If a little bit of what our <unk> society <unk> <unk> <unk> was in those where people have too long , it &apos;s not only their lives , but also , our lives <unk> , but also our <unk> .
This is what the <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income does well , not only to poor -- not only to poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that <unk> us .
So , I said , &quot; <unk> , you can become everything you want , &quot; --
<unk> , people of culture , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; What &apos;s the fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s <unk> that you can &apos;t do anything in a <unk> <unk> . &quot;
&quot; A <unk> imagination , a <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and I <unk> it , I <unk> it so , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , instead , I realized that fish knows that fish knows .
Because the reality of the <unk> is that if you <unk> the <unk> , in a way , &quot; <unk> the <unk> <unk> . &quot; It <unk> the <unk> . &quot;
If you <unk> the <unk> in a way that everything you can <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> .
They all need a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and certainly <unk> for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
