<unk> year I showed these <unk> for <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years , has had the dimensions of the United States <unk> <unk> <unk> United States , <unk> , is <unk> 40 percent .
And I <unk> this <unk> of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a way , the heart <unk> of climate system .
They <unk> <unk> and <unk> of summer .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the last 25 years .
The <unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
You see , you see , you <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That &apos;s the ice in <unk> , which <unk> of summer .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , of five years or more , it &apos;s like the blood , that &apos;s where it &apos;s <unk> from the body .
In 25 years , it was <unk> by this way .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> around the ocean <unk> where there are huge <unk> of <unk> <unk> that , <unk> , are <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> , that amount of <unk> , that amount of <unk> , that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> last <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> Al <unk> : She &apos;s good . The question is if we <unk> it .
A reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a river in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> has never <unk> <unk> like that .
This is the <unk> river , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how to <unk> <unk> the sea <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> on <unk> , here is where the sea .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
<unk> other part of the planet : <unk> , the greatest <unk> of ice <unk> of the planet .
<unk> month scientists have <unk> that the ice <unk> <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , which <unk> on some <unk> <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , like in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the third largest <unk> of ice , <unk> , <unk> new <unk> , which few few years ago , they have <unk> .
40 percent of the world population <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : this <unk> is the source of <unk> water of this city .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same happens to <unk> water .
In California , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of 40 percent .
The <unk> <unk> are in the crisis .
<unk> , as you have read , they &apos;re <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the world leads to a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of normal and without <unk> .
<unk> times over the last 30 years of <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> .
If you look at the <unk> context .
In the last five years we &apos;ve <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every day .
Look at the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , from <unk> , to <unk> , and on both of the <unk> <unk> , where there is a <unk> <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean .
The <unk> of global warming , together to the <unk> , that &apos;s 20 percent , is the <unk> use of <unk> <unk> .
The oil is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of the <unk> of the <unk> of China , together to China .
And you &apos;re going to build a lot of other <unk> <unk> .
But we &apos;re <unk> to a <unk> of direction .
These are the <unk> projects over the last few years and some <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> politics in our country .
The <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year for <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I <unk> picture something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen it on the <unk> .
This is the greatest flow of <unk> in America .
It &apos;s successful around <unk> .
The <unk> of one of the <unk> of <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk> and happy and happy .
It &apos;s <unk> here in America , and we can grow our economy .
<unk> <unk> is more <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
The greatest <unk> society <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- not know what they &apos;re talking about .
<unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> has two <unk> .
This is one of them , one part of them .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> , we see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> <unk> in our business .
So , for this <unk> , we have a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> for public <unk> and <unk> the truth .
In fact , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it &apos;s <unk> -- it &apos;s also a good <unk> .
So , we don &apos;t <unk> to climate change .
We &apos;re going to do it .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you &apos;ve heard about it very much .
So , I &apos;m going to <unk> a <unk> structure for how <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! The machines are a little bit <unk> , but this is the sound of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is between the <unk> of global <unk> , but the <unk> of <unk> <unk> that you see everything .
And let &apos;s look at this : this is the <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> to economic <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> America is in crisis ; the economy , the national security , <unk> .
The <unk> that <unk> all of them : our <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> , like <unk> <unk> and oil .
Now , there &apos;s a new <unk> , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A plan for <unk> America to work , <unk> more <unk> , and help <unk> <unk> , and help <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , a solution that we can solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
<unk> : This is the last .
<unk> : It &apos;s about <unk> energy to America .
One of the <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> new <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> 2 : <unk> <unk> for jobs well <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> America . It &apos;s time to be <unk> .
<unk> : A old <unk> <unk> says , &quot; If you want to go to , go to alone .
If you want to go back , you go together , go together . &quot;
We have to go back , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED I did a <unk> on <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to try to <unk> it on how the machine works .
So , I &apos;m going to go . And for those that the other time , there was the greatest scientific <unk> ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk> .
His task is <unk> the conditions that were less than a <unk> <unk> of a second <unk> from the beginning of the universe -- until <unk> million times per second .
That &apos;s just <unk> .
This is the car under <unk> .
<unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk> .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> <unk> feet and it &apos;s got a <unk> of <unk> feet .
This is a <unk> picture of <unk> in building so you can see the <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> last year , we <unk> the car for the first time .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> of particles that had all the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles in the <unk> .
In other words , when I <unk> that image the 10 <unk> , <unk> that the car <unk> , the <unk> , which is a great <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if that was this to make more or this , when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that the <unk> page was this .
That means we had a <unk> impact <unk> to the scientific <unk> .
And I was a week after , there was a problem with the machine , to just these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> of <unk> .
Now , the <unk> between you <unk> <unk> and <unk> , &quot; It &apos;s not true . &quot; It &apos;s too <unk> . &quot;
And they can do it because when they &apos;re very <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , <unk> less <unk> degrees , at a temperature temperature <unk> to that of the space between stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> between the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk> , and that are <unk> about 30 <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re about 50 <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
Now they &apos;re <unk> all at their place .
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> will be new <unk> .
<unk> it , and we <unk> to get data to <unk> or <unk> , and continue our <unk> to find out what are the <unk> that <unk> the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these <unk> <unk> <unk> the value of science and engineering and engineering of <unk> . It &apos;s easy to <unk> .
I think that &apos;s so hard , the fact of getting <unk> , I think that &apos;s the value of things like <unk> .
I want to end with the words of a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> , in <unk> <unk> of <unk> experiments of his <unk> , his <unk> was Michael <unk> , said , &quot; No is <unk> for the progress of human mind how <unk> the <unk> that ideas of human mind how to be <unk> , and that our <unk> are <unk> , and that are not <unk> in nature , and that are not <unk> . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> <unk> when , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> as <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , actually <unk> to think and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that we <unk> most of the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> from our <unk> <unk> with objects , <unk> <unk> , with my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , I started to <unk> , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of having the <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and we &apos;re going to our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that I thought I was going to explore the answer , building <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> <unk> computer <unk> like a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> <unk> computer <unk> like a <unk> .
You can <unk> it with your hand , they can <unk> them , and hear their own movement and they have a screen and a radio <unk> .
But <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> the digital information .
And as <unk> as <unk> as <unk> , <unk> of <unk> , other , and as they become more <unk> , <unk> of their movement , of the other , as <unk> <unk> <unk> , we can explore them new and <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m going to start with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show you of the video of the video , if you <unk> it in one direction , the <unk> <unk> , if you <unk> on the other side <unk> back .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of others .
If you <unk> them , they <unk> it to what they &apos;re doing around them .
If they &apos;re <unk> , they can <unk> it and they can <unk> it a little bit .
If they &apos;re <unk> , they can <unk> it and they can <unk> it a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We then realized that one of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> was the <unk> to use common on data , for example , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> color like if it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and I can <unk> it for <unk> of color in that central color , where they <unk> .
and I can <unk> it to <unk> of color in that central to the <unk> , where you <unk> .
And we can <unk> it a little bit of it , we can <unk> it a little bit .
I &apos;m also <unk> possibilities of <unk> , like <unk> , <unk> , and mathematics and <unk> , where people can try things very quickly , and <unk> the results immediately .
I &apos;m ...
This is a <unk> sequence of <unk> that I do with a <unk> program .
Here we have a game of words that is half between <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at every <unk> <unk> a letter <unk> on every <unk> , <unk> , <unk> every <unk> <unk> , at every <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , <unk> <unk> , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities of <unk> .
Thank you .
Here are the children in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , I did it in a way that I <unk> them and <unk> them and <unk> .
They &apos;re very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things like this <unk> is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of <unk> .
I just want to say , &quot; <unk> of words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here is other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , right there .
In fact , it was just <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I could build a tool for <unk> <unk> . He &apos;s <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now he took a <unk> <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> work ! Yeah !
So , <unk> <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It &apos;s a <unk> story with open , and he can decide how to <unk> .
<unk> : It &apos;s a <unk> story with open , and he can decide how to <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have time to show you is a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , to <unk> and <unk> music .
It &apos;s a <unk> , <unk> recently , to <unk> and <unk> music .
The <unk> <unk> here from <unk> like base , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of these four different <unk> <unk> , and you can choose to be .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence of <unk> <unk> to your <unk> .
And I just <unk> them to <unk> a <unk> <unk> , &quot; and a sequence of the sequence . &quot;
These are actually <unk> that you can control from live , like <unk> and <unk> .
I <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> for <unk> .
And then there are <unk> effects as time and <unk> , that <unk> up the entire sequence .
<unk> like it works .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , other base .
Now I &apos;m going to <unk> a <unk> line .
<unk> : <unk> : Now , <unk> <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> : And now I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> , so I can control the effect of live .
<unk> : I can <unk> the entire sequence of time on one side or the other .
<unk> : <unk> : And now , I &apos;m going to <unk> the bottom to give more <unk> .
<unk> : I &apos;m going to <unk> the sequence &quot; <unk> flight . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> it , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And now , I can finally <unk> the entire sequence on the left the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain work and body .
And today , I &apos;ve been <unk> to show one of the results of this <unk> , and also some possibilities that we &apos;re trying to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to <unk> is that it &apos;s <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> , that we want to <unk> to our <unk> in the way we want to do .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;m not seeing the time of all of you .
I &apos;m a <unk> .
<unk> books is the most of this , of course .
It &apos;s also love and love of my life .
And I &apos;m not <unk> to me .
But , I said this , something particular happened in my life and in my career , who has taken me to <unk> the entire <unk> with this job .
The particular thing is I <unk> wrote this book , this <unk> called &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And the result of that everywhere I &apos;m <unk> now , people like me <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
<unk> me to me all <unk> and say , &quot; You don &apos;t have fear of <unk> , and they say , &quot; Do you have to be able to do better ?
Do you want to continue to write all life without able to make a book that can make a book that can <unk> somebody ? &quot;
How do you get to somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , and part of that I remember more than 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk> .
I &apos;m going to <unk> to the same <unk> <unk> .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t <unk> to be able to have success ?
Do you have no fear of the <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
Do you fear that <unk> for all life without <unk> that nothing will come out and die on a <unk> of <unk> dreams with the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
You know , you know .
The short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I &apos;m afraid of all of those things .
I always <unk> .
And I also <unk> of many other things that people could not <unk> .
As <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , as I think about it , and I thought , and I was <unk> <unk> , why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It &apos;s <unk> that anyone who <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel to do .
But what is there about this particular <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> about <unk> health <unk> in a way that other <unk> do not ?
How did my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and I remember one time in his 40 years of activity in the <unk> of <unk> , and he was asked me to be <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> there was never -- that <unk> of the <unk> John , like <unk> ?
Do you know it ?
<unk> , the engineers like <unk> didn &apos;t have , in <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We have <unk> , we have enough this <unk> , and not just <unk> but <unk> of all of that , we have this <unk> of being <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And we &apos;re not going to look at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often for them .
And the ones that don &apos;t seem to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before he died , in the last <unk> <unk> said , &quot; Every my book has <unk> me a little bit more &quot; <unk> <unk> about the work of their life .
But we didn &apos;t know , when you say , because we &apos;ve heard these things so long , we have all these things so long , and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are somehow <unk> and <unk> the <unk> , at the end , <unk> always <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> to everybody here today is : you know with this idea ?
I &apos;m going to be good for a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> distance to me not good for this <unk> .
I think it &apos;s <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s also <unk> and I don &apos;t want to <unk> <unk> in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better <unk> our <unk> <unk> to live .
And I &apos;m sure that , in my case -- in my situation -- would be very <unk> to start <unk> to that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> where I &apos;m in my career .
<unk> -- <unk> look at it &apos;s pretty young , I &apos;m about 40 years old .
I &apos;ve got about four <unk> of work in me .
And it &apos;s very <unk> that whatever <unk> <unk> <unk> in the world , as the work that <unk> after the world &apos;s work that <unk> after the <unk> of my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we &apos;re all <unk> friends here -- is <unk> that my greatest success is on my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> , that thought !
You know , this is the kind of thought that leads to person to start <unk> <unk> at nine of the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I &apos;m going to continue to do this work that I love .
So , the question is , how ?
And so I think , after many <unk> , that the way to work to continue to continue to make it , and so that we can do a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to <unk> a few ways to <unk> to see if you &apos;re <unk> , and my natural <unk> on which <unk> to get <unk> . And as I was going to go through the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> for all last year , trying to find other society to see if we could have the best ideas .
as to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research led me to <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m going to be <unk> and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don &apos;t believe that <unk> creativity <unk> <unk> from men , OK ?
And it <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> spirit and <unk> and that <unk> to men from a few <unk> and <unk> for reasons and <unk> and <unk> for reasons and <unk> and <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity <unk> of creativity .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from far away .
The <unk> were of the same idea , but <unk> that species of spirit without a <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> , because the <unk> didn &apos;t really know that a <unk> was particularly <unk> somebody who was <unk> .
I thought a <unk> <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally <unk> in the <unk> of a study artist , a little artist like <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> out of <unk> <unk> <unk> the work of the artist and <unk> the <unk> of that work .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , that &apos;s the distance of the <unk> I talk -- that <unk> <unk> you from your <unk> of your work .
And everybody <unk> that was so <unk> , right ?
So artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like for example , the too <unk> , right ?
If your work was <unk> <unk> , you didn &apos;t want to <unk> all the <unk> , everybody <unk> that <unk> was <unk> by this <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it was not all <unk> , right ?
<unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time .
Then the <unk> <unk> and everything <unk> , and we <unk> this great idea ; we put this great idea of the universe over all over the universe and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and no longer to leave space that <unk> from <unk> .
This was the principle of <unk> <unk> and people think about that creativity is <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And for the first time in history , <unk> <unk> to <unk> this or that artist as a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think I &apos;m going to give somebody , a simple person to believe to be as a <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s like to ask somebody to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> and <unk> all of these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it was this pressure to have <unk> artists in the <unk> 500 years .
And if that &apos;s true , and I think that &apos;s the question is , the question is , what is , and now ?
Can we <unk> it ?
I could go back to a more <unk> understanding of the relationship between humans and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe no .
<unk> we can &apos;t <unk> 500 years of thinking about <unk> in a <unk> talk of 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of , <unk> , you know , you know , people <unk> <unk> <unk> on their projects .
<unk> not everybody <unk> you all about this .
But the question I &apos;d like to <unk> is -- why not ?
Why not we &apos;re going to <unk> this ?
Because more sense of everything that has ever heard to explain the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process .
A process that , as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so , so , everybody here -- so , you know , you don &apos;t <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And , in fact , it can <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> <unk> , who has now 90 years , but that was a <unk> for all of life and said that during his <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , and I <unk> it in the <unk> <unk> , and I <unk> it , in the <unk> <unk> .
He said that it was like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And she <unk> up to her <unk> .
And he <unk> it , because he was <unk> the land under his feet .
I decided to have one thing to do that point and it was of , words , &quot; <unk> as a <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And so we went back to the house and <unk> and he was <unk> by this <unk> , and he didn &apos;t have to take a piece of paper and a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on the page .
I &apos;m <unk> sometimes not <unk> , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and she would <unk> them through the <unk> and she would <unk> through the <unk> , looking , how she said , &quot; another <unk> . &quot;
Then there were those times -- this piece of the <unk> never -- there were any moments of the moments , right ?
So , he was <unk> home and he was looking for the paper and the <unk> <unk> through , and he was <unk> a <unk> <unk> right in the while he was <unk> with the other hand and the <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the page and <unk> , but in the <unk> , from the last word to the first word .
So when I <unk> it -- it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not all my <unk> process -- I &apos;m not a <unk> !
I &apos;m a <unk> , and my way of <unk> is ; I &apos;m <unk> at the same <unk> every day and <unk> and work and <unk> over <unk> .
But even I , in my <unk> , I <unk> against that , sometimes .
And I &apos;m going to be a lot of you have to do it .
You know , even though the work and the ideas me <unk> me from a certain source , I could not <unk> <unk> .
And what is this ?
And how can we <unk> it to do it in a way to <unk> it , but rather , what do you do <unk> <unk> ?
And for how it is about , the best example I &apos;ve <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I &apos;ve <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I &apos;ve <unk> several years ago for a <unk> .
<unk> of this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> , trying to control , <unk> , <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But then <unk> , he was <unk> , and one day , and one day , and he was <unk> <unk> , <unk> everything for him .
<unk> <unk> , and all of a <unk> <unk> <unk> , that &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> , who comes in his head like <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , you want , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the <unk> , but not as <unk> .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , it &apos;s not a <unk> , it &apos;s got a <unk> .
So , it starts to hear this kind of old <unk> <unk> in him , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose it from this <unk> <unk> song .
I &apos;m not <unk> , and I can &apos;t <unk> . &quot;
And instead of going to go into the <unk> , they <unk> .
We <unk> the whole process of <unk> and made something completely new .
You just want to just the sky and said , &quot; <unk> , you see that I &apos;m <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Do you think that &apos;s a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> in a <unk> moment , I can take care of you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> <unk> another today .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And his process <unk> <unk> after this .
Not the work , the work was still <unk> as always as always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when the <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> out of him <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> of him <unk> , and <unk> back to where it was , <unk> that she didn &apos;t have to be a <unk> and <unk> .
but <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> <unk> a conversation with <unk> and this thing , and <unk> <unk> that , but it was not <unk> .
So , how much of that story is going to change a little bit of the way I <unk> and I &apos;m going to <unk> it .
This idea , when I was <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; and <unk> , &quot; and I was in one of those <unk> <unk> <unk> where we all are working on something and we &apos;re working on something and we &apos;re going to think that it will be a <unk> , which will be the book written book .
Not just <unk> , just the <unk> book written .
And I started thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I &apos;m going to <unk> me to <unk> up and <unk> us .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I said to high <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; What , both of this book , and we know that if this book is not going to be <unk> <unk> my , right ?
Because as you see , I &apos;m <unk> all I have , no longer than this .
So if you want to be better , you have to <unk> and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , I don &apos;t know .
I started to write the same because it &apos;s my job .
And I &apos;d like to please be <unk> that I &apos;ve been <unk> to do my part . &quot; Because -- at the end is , OK , <unk> -- <unk> it in the <unk> of Africa , the people <unk> to <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the moon , <unk> and <unk> music that I <unk> for <unk> to <unk> and <unk> hours to <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and <unk> .
But every <unk> , <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk> .
And I know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know you have all , at a certain point , a <unk> like this .
It was like time , <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> through a species of <unk> and it was doing nothing different from , like <unk> <unk> <unk> before , but all <unk> .
And suddenly , not just as a human .
But it <unk> up from <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people <unk> what was , the <unk> with his name .
<unk> your hands and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , &quot; God , &quot; God , &quot; God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
<unk> <unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; which is still <unk> , <unk> , which is still <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> , when an artist did something impossible and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it &apos;s <unk> because we need .
But , the problem comes the day , for the same , when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> that God is no longer .
It &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> , and perhaps not <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God again as <unk> , and so what has to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But perhaps not to force them to be so <unk> if you can &apos;t believe , <unk> , <unk> , the most <unk> <unk> of your being from you .
But let me just show you that data from a <unk> of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to <unk> when you &apos;re <unk> to <unk> , when you &apos;re finished .
And , you know , if we think , we think in this way , it changes .
And so I started <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> like I <unk> it for several months in the <unk> of the book that was <unk> soon , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> of my
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is , not being <unk> .
Don &apos;t <unk> . You just <unk> your work .
<unk> to <unk> for your <unk> , whatever it can be .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If the <unk> , you &apos;re going to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for one moment through your <unk> , then <unk> <unk> , then <unk> <unk> . &quot;
<unk> , you do the same <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to say , &quot; You know , &quot; <unk> it .
I think I think it &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As you know , I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects about the human genome , on what it can <unk> and about discovery of <unk> genes .
Now we &apos;re <unk> a new <unk> we started to <unk> biology and now <unk> from that <unk> code in a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We &apos;ve always been trying to <unk> big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many <unk> I think have <unk> to understand a lot of <unk> .
We tried different <unk> , <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> from almost 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome is <unk> to go from the world of the computer <unk> in the digital world of computers .
Now , we <unk> : Can we <unk> life , or to create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the most small genome from the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to <unk> the genome for <unk> a little bit more little .
We can <unk> a <unk> <unk> of genes of about 500 that are here .
But when we take a look at his <unk> map , it &apos;s just <unk> than our own .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at a time , it &apos;s very <unk> that this can bring to a <unk> cell .
So , I thought the only way to <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of the &quot; Can we <unk> a <unk> ? &quot;
Can the chemistry <unk> to produce these molecules that we &apos;ve never <unk> to create before ?
And in case , <unk> , can we make a <unk> <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The speed that we &apos;re able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the <unk> code , instead , <unk> rather slowly , but it &apos;s <unk> .
And our <unk> <unk> <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve been <unk> over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before the experiments .
But we found that <unk> of DNA is very difficult .
There are <unk> of thousands of machines in the world that <unk> little <unk> of DNA <unk> , of 30 to 50 <unk> and a <unk> process : the <unk> is <unk> <unk> . <unk> , <unk> is <unk> .
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a little virus that <unk> bacteria .
We designed <unk> , we <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA <unk> about <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part of it is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> and we <unk> it in the bacteria , the bacteria have <unk> to read this <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> particles .
The <unk> particles have been <unk> by cells , they <unk> back and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I talked about <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that they have <unk> this model .
They have more than you .
I think this is a situation where software can really build his own <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we could do things in big <unk> .
I could build the entire <unk> of <unk> .
They &apos;re more <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So we thought of <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , so that we can change the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
<unk> is <unk> , and if we <unk> with information <unk> in a computer , these have to be very <unk> .
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We found , <unk> , 30 <unk> <unk> . If we could use that original sequence never <unk> states to do it .
One of the process of the process of <unk> <unk> <unk> , with all the other <unk> of 50 <unk> to build more than <unk> <unk> <unk> together .
<unk> <unk> <unk> here .
You probably have read that <unk> us in <unk> .
So , we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> on four <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together , and there &apos;s about 20 <unk> <unk> , and there &apos;s a <unk> order to <unk> every <unk> .
So we can use the <unk> code for <unk> words , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did at the beginning , it was <unk> .
Some of them have been <unk> by the fact that it was not <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> just <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them .
And we started <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to them to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , we have these <unk> <unk> in <unk> so that we &apos;re <unk> to create a very <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to <unk> the process .
So , this seems like a <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
When I started these <unk> <unk> <unk> , more than 100 <unk> <unk> <unk> , no longer <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
It comes to the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> biology .
So we have <unk> other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> the DNA that we can <unk> the <unk> .
Here &apos;s an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> <unk> .
In 12 hours , it &apos;s <unk> <unk> as it was before .
<unk> of thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can <unk> completely .
I could live under <unk> .
I &apos;m sure that life <unk> in space , and they &apos;re <unk> to find new <unk> of water .
<unk> , NASA showed that this happens .
This is a picture of the <unk> that we &apos;ve built on these <unk> , just using the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> them .
This picture wasn &apos;t <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that I &apos;m going to be a period of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> we &apos;ve done a little bit about it .
They &apos;re more <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s the greatest <unk> of a <unk> structure ever <unk> from man .
It has a <unk> <unk> <unk> over 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a 10 <unk> <unk> , we &apos;ll just <unk> pages to <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Now , how do we do it work ?
Of course , through a virus is a <unk> game .
It &apos;s a little bit more <unk> when they &apos;re using <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> like our : you just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the process of <unk> .
In <unk> , the <unk> is <unk> in the cell , but we &apos;ve <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re able to do a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> cell to a <unk> <unk> of a cell <unk> from a cell to another and <unk> .
We have a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> species .
The two different <unk> how men from <unk> .
We have <unk> some <unk> more <unk> in a way to <unk> this <unk> .
He <unk> it <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the cell .
And we were <unk> that we didn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried still <unk> <unk> in there .
This is one of the major <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> from some of the <unk> , <unk> in a second of these <unk> <unk> to that species .
So , who think about evolution as a <unk> <unk> at the time , it <unk> doesn &apos;t really understand a lot of biology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that was in the cell , they didn &apos;t get one .
The <unk> we <unk> it .
It &apos;s <unk> , and it <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> material , and it <unk> it , and we <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk> .
It became blue to the genes that we have <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> of all of a new species , <unk> on the new software that we &apos;ve <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> exactly what we &apos;ve <unk> .
Now , this could be <unk> <unk> , but <unk> the software of DNA , we can change things in a <unk> <unk> enough .
Now , I &apos;ve already <unk> that here is not about <unk> -- but about <unk> <unk> from three million years and a half million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new <unk> version of <unk> <unk> <unk> in this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion people to <unk> billion in the next 40 years .
Just to give an example : I was born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> in <unk> ; in the <unk> , 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re <unk> problems now to find food , water and <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> for six billion people .
We &apos;re going to have more <unk> to do it for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion <unk> of <unk> , more than 30 billion <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
That means percent of <unk> a day .
When we &apos;re trying to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process of <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
In more <unk> we have to <unk> that all of the CO2 <unk> from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
At the day of today , because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> all over the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think of are the <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry just <unk> just a <unk> about <unk> , and think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here are <unk> data from <unk> reality and our imagination .
Now we have <unk> , <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> , able to create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We can actually build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think of these 20 million genes or <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to make <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology <unk> for the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard <unk> <unk> .
We can choose to choose <unk> , chemistry or chemistry or chemistry , production of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> on which we &apos;re working on to be able to <unk> and design species to the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how they &apos;re going to be .
We know exactly how they &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
Now we &apos;re <unk> about <unk> <unk> generation .
You see that you can <unk> <unk> from <unk> was an experiment .
We have <unk> <unk> <unk> and third generation that we will <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But the only way biology can have a big impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> to <unk> cells that we can achieve first of <unk> cells that can achieve first of <unk> , and we think we can get the first of <unk> in about 18 months .
<unk> solar <unk> with CO2 CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we &apos;ve <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> in the ocean , about <unk> feet deep into the <unk> of water .
<unk> <unk> from CO2 <unk> as <unk> .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can <unk> CO2 , that can easily be <unk> by <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So , we think we might be able to <unk> what we might be able to <unk> what the basic question , &quot; We have the <unk> <unk> of <unk> the whole <unk> industry .
<unk> . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can &apos;t it ?
It <unk> a major source of energy .
<unk> , we &apos;re working on to use the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk> .
You saw this year with the flu , we always <unk> back of a year and a dollar <unk> <unk> when it comes to find the right <unk> .
I think that you can change <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
That &apos;s how the future could start to look at <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and finally <unk> cells .
We are at so much from <unk> people .
Our purpose is to do in a way of living on a long way to try to <unk> it . Thank you very much .
First of all , I &apos;m going to show you , the <unk> possible , some <unk> , of the new technology that we have taken to a <unk> almost a year ago . This is <unk> .
It &apos;s a environment that you can <unk> it is at local level that <unk> with a huge amount of data <unk> .
Here we &apos;re seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a <unk> fast <unk> , <unk> images like we want .
And no matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big big <unk> of data or images .
Most of them are common <unk> , but this is a <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It &apos;s not any difference because the only thing that <unk> <unk> <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen in <unk> moment . It &apos;s also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a whole book , of data , not images .
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> .
And so , to <unk> that it &apos;s <unk> and not images , we can do something like that , to see that it &apos;s really a real <unk> <unk> of the text .
It could be a little bit <unk> to read a <unk> book .
I &apos;m not going to tell you .
This is an example more <unk> . It &apos;s a number of <unk> .
Every big picture is the beginning of a <unk> .
And I really really <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of reading the real <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature of a <unk> or a <unk> <unk> , which is for nature of a <unk> <unk> .
We also made something with the <unk> of this particular number of <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of what you can use in a normal <unk> and we <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see here .
Or other models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
I think this <unk> will be <unk> to put up and other <unk> <unk> , not <unk> <unk> .
Of course , <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this not to lose time , if not to say that we have <unk> <unk> to give it a <unk> to give us a <unk> .
These are all the streets in the U.S. <unk> <unk> over an image of NASA .
So now I &apos;m going to try to do something else .
This is actually from live on the web ; you can see it .
It &apos;s a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other one of the <unk> <unk> computer <unk> on the computer <unk> , a <unk> student of Washington , with the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> . A <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s <unk> live on the web , <unk> .
You can see when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from one picture to the other one of the experience of <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of images here actually a meaning .
So , the <unk> of the computer have these images together , so that we can <unk> the <unk> places where the <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk> <unk> . So here you see <unk> of <unk> <unk> or <unk> , and these things are all <unk> to <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> to <unk> level .
I don &apos;t know if I have to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more <unk> .
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> data of <unk> and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that we &apos;ve done for the first time the summer of <unk> to show that the <unk> of the key <unk> , and that &apos;s really <unk> to show the key to you that <unk> in the website .
We had to <unk> <unk> and <unk> and said .
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> and <unk> of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> . And he <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> an image that <unk> <unk> to this model .
So , they &apos;re all <unk> <unk> and have all <unk> <unk> to <unk> in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to <unk> this way .
You know , I would never thought to end to work for <unk> .
It &apos;s very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think we &apos;ll see that it &apos;s a lot of different kinds of different <unk> : from those <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> <unk> , <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , I <unk> it to look at those <unk> <unk> .
A lot of <unk> , <unk> , etc .
<unk> <unk> here is a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from <unk> to the physics of this environment .
The <unk> point is that we can do things with the social environment . This is now <unk> data from the entire <unk> of how the earth <unk> <unk> from the entire <unk> of how the earth <unk> , from <unk> <unk> and <unk> all of those data together .
All of those pictures become <unk> together , of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
You have a model of the land that <unk> .
Think of this as the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> on Earth <unk> .
It &apos;s something that we &apos;re going to be <unk> as people , and the <unk> for the people who are <unk> it with the use of .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> from other people .
If somebody comes the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> the name , my <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of all of those data , and I can use it as a <unk> <unk> to <unk> in that space , in that <unk> , using the picture of everybody else , and to have an experience of <unk> and <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of all of that are extremely <unk> <unk> of every part of the land , <unk> not just from <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , but from <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
Chris Anderson : What do is that ? What &apos;s your software is going to be <unk> to do is that at some point in the next few years , all the photographs of the world are basically <unk> together ?
<unk> : Yes . What &apos;s doing is that it &apos;s basically about it .
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> , if you want to , in the images .
And it &apos;s doing it on the content of the images .
And the thing becomes very interesting if you think about <unk> information that many of these pictures .
As you do a research <unk> on the web , you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the web has a lot of information about pictures .
Now , what happens if that picture <unk> <unk> all your picture ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really huge . It &apos;s a <unk> effect of the network .
CA : <unk> , it &apos;s really incredible . <unk> .
<unk> : I &apos;m going to tell you very much .
One of the major <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , between who has <unk> <unk> <unk> , between who <unk> the <unk> in the wind <unk> , the <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> of the plants .
<unk> to think that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> are still <unk> of <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , and that the idea that we live in there , <unk> <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s just a model , but it &apos;s just a model , but it &apos;s just a <unk> of reality ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> did , good or <unk> , many <unk> <unk> .
And , of course , everybody <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> . <unk> : <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We have to <unk> the <unk> of death , so we don &apos;t know if we <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art .
What <unk> is the <unk> of the song , the <unk> of every culture .
It &apos;s not the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of <unk> .
He was my <unk> <unk> in the <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> of <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> , on the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of the world .
All of these <unk> <unk> , there are other ways of thinking about other ways of thinking about <unk> , other ways of moving around the world .
And if you <unk> a minute , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet and <unk> the planet and it &apos;s important for the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk> , dreams , <unk> , <unk> , ideas , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> in being from human imagination .
<unk> is the <unk> <unk> of humanity .
It &apos;s the <unk> of what we &apos;re and what we can be in the <unk> species .
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all the species has been or on the <unk> of <unk> , because it &apos;s <unk> , or -- in the <unk> <unk> of diversity -- and not even <unk> <unk> -- that &apos;s not <unk> <unk> <unk> -- that <unk> of <unk> diversity .
The <unk> of that is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not just <unk> from a <unk> or a series of <unk> rules .
One language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the <unk> of every culture of every culture comes in the world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , as we &apos;re in here in <unk> , at least half the <unk> of the children .
They &apos;re not <unk> to children , the <unk> , the less than that , less than something , which is already death .
What &apos;s more <unk> of the <unk> of being <unk> by <unk> , of the last to talk about a language , of not <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> or <unk> <unk> ?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of somebody in the world every two weeks : every two weeks of a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> with themselves in the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> language .
And I know that somebody of you will say , &quot; <unk> &apos;t it better ?
The world would be a better place if we all the same language ? &quot; <unk> , &quot; So , we all talk about <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> of a <unk> thing that means that we can &apos;t talk about your language .
Today I &apos;d like to make a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we &apos;re <unk> .
Most of us <unk> that when I say &quot; different ways of <unk> <unk> , &quot; I really want to <unk> different ways of <unk> .
So , for example , this <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> that it &apos;s not able to <unk> the blue color from green because the green time <unk> is <unk> in the forest , where the <unk> <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; : you have a <unk> person talking about a language of different .
And that has <unk> in the past <unk> <unk> , though , <unk> is that in these families <unk> where you &apos;re talking about six or seven <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> nobody <unk> .
You can start to hear and then <unk> to talk .
I &apos;m going to have one of the most interesting <unk> with , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that has had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> , five <unk> have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;ve made from the top of pictures that they <unk> them in <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> had never seen anything about <unk> .
They have <unk> the <unk> of the ground , they <unk> to <unk> a form or a <unk> and , not <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
But <unk> not just <unk> <unk> .
They <unk> between them .
<unk> percent of the death of their own .
We went back to eight <unk> and we found two cases of death and when we <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was <unk> so that he &apos;s dead <unk> , and then they <unk> it . And then they <unk> it .
The <unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species .
<unk> years old , I was <unk> a really interesting task when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> between <unk> society <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> to make <unk> .
To give a sense of <unk> , I should have to understand culture , and that <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s rather than a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> .
If I <unk> you to <unk> the big <unk> of the world , what do you know ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that Africa <unk> didn &apos;t have <unk> <unk> . And instead of <unk> , and the <unk> is not the <unk> of these <unk> very <unk> <unk> during the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes it interesting is the <unk> of the <unk> of life and death .
So <unk> do <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by <unk> <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of live in a short time , the <unk> becomes <unk> .
And for this <unk> <unk> to say , &quot; <unk> <unk> go to <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . &quot;
And the moment you &apos;re <unk> , is the spirit that <unk> you can see , how much you can do it ?
So , you &apos;re going to these incredible events : <unk> <unk> in the state of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> all the <unk> with which I lived the most <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> civilization that once <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> has never been <unk> by <unk> .
<unk> today are <unk> by a <unk> <unk> , but their <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The young <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years , and they live in a world <unk> <unk> and <unk> in a world <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> to the base of the <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> of nine years of the <unk> of the nine months of <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of the mother , now are <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
For all of this time , they &apos;re <unk> to the values of their <unk> , values that <unk> their <unk> and just their <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And the <unk> of this incredible <unk> , they come out and for the first time in their life , at the age of 18 , and <unk> <unk> <unk> . And in that moment of <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , everything that have learned in theory , <unk> <unk> <unk> , everything that have learned in theory , and it says . The <unk> is <unk> <unk> . The <unk> is <unk> <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ? <unk> as I said . &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> . Now it &apos;s going to be <unk> . &quot;
They call <unk> <unk> major and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the world .
This level of <unk> is very important .
When we think about <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and the old <unk> history of <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> in his <unk> or maybe <unk> and say that these <unk> are more <unk> to the Earth of us .
The <unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> <unk> by <unk> .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> , but because of time and <unk> , they &apos;ve created a <unk> of the Earth &apos;s <unk> not about the concept of <unk> <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> : the concept that can only live because it &apos;s <unk> by human <unk> .
What do that mean ?
<unk> to say that a <unk> of the <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> spirit that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> is a human <unk> <unk> , and it will be a very different <unk> of <unk> <unk> that <unk> that <unk> <unk> that a mountain is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
That &apos;s the <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What &apos;s interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
And that made me a human being different from my <unk> friends who believe that <unk> are <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> that live in the north of the world , <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If we were <unk> that these <unk> can create different <unk> , <unk> <unk> to start to understand some of their <unk> <unk> .
I <unk> this picture to <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> some of you have heard about <unk> , the most <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes it fascinating is not the potential <unk> of the <unk> , but his <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> by two things .
<unk> one side , this <unk> <unk> that has a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> a little bit of the <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> of the family <unk> said <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you &apos;re going to see the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> that make from a different <unk> of species , <unk> it has <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on for <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . <unk> &apos;t creates a <unk> of reality .
<unk> <unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to my <unk> , you can &apos;t <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you &apos;re done not to anybody . <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> . But they can &apos;t be <unk> because they &apos;re <unk> by a <unk> that <unk> <unk> in <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s possible to <unk> <unk> if we <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
Now , it &apos;s the <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in a <unk> of <unk> species of plants , like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , like these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , they make two <unk> <unk> <unk> , they create <unk> , and they create <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you look at the <unk> , we &apos;re going to be <unk> , &quot; The plants talk about it . &quot;
What do that mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who <unk> <unk> in the forest , and our eyes <unk> in the same species .
If you <unk> it as <unk> their <unk> <unk> us , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , you know , you don &apos;t know everything ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you get the <unk> <unk> in a <unk> of the moon and <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
With this <unk> , you can &apos;t get <unk> , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> .
Now , <unk> the problem is that the problem of us who have to <unk> <unk> <unk> them , but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of the history of our real world , and <unk> over .
In fact , the <unk> century , <unk> , not <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk> , but rather like the <unk> <unk> , but rather like the <unk> where we <unk> and <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> of the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All the <unk> through the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> for life .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> didn &apos;t have <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> <unk> and <unk> like <unk> didn &apos;t have <unk> to be <unk> when they put them in <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s not the change or the technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It &apos;s the power .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And if you look at the world , I &apos;m going to be <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> and <unk> out of the existence of <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that lived in the forest until a generation ago , and now <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> , where you can see the <unk> river <unk> , where you can see the <unk> river <unk> , where you can see the <unk> river <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> .
Or , in the case of <unk> , are the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> .
If you <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the <unk> <unk> of politics .
As <unk> <unk> , the physics of a <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> to <unk> , but the <unk> of <unk> , but the <unk> of life , the <unk> of a <unk> , not just <unk> , but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , because it &apos;s <unk> part of <unk> development .
And you can &apos;t understand the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> until the beginning .
I <unk> the <unk> miles from <unk> in China through the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> with a young <unk> , but only <unk> <unk> I realized what there is behind the <unk> that I realized .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from <unk> during the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
The one is <unk> at the time of <unk> Chinese <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk> .
It was taken of <unk> in <unk> <unk> at the age of two <unk> under his <unk> , because he would not live without him .
The <unk> , who did the same , was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
One day he <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to work for seven years .
The pain of <unk> can be <unk> , but the spirit of <unk> <unk> is <unk> by <unk> .
<unk> , all of that , <unk> <unk> to a choice .
Do you have to live in the world <unk> or we want to <unk> the world of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he died said that his greatest fear was that , in our <unk> <unk> to this <unk> <unk> of the world , not just <unk> the entire <unk> of human imagination at a <unk> <unk> of human imagination to <unk> <unk> to a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities .
And it &apos;s <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , who has given us the agriculture , which <unk> us to the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has to <unk> 300 years old .
That <unk> story not about me that we have the answers to all the challenges that I <unk> to come in .
When <unk> these <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that &apos;s in these answers that we all <unk> the chance of being what we are : a <unk> species , which has to be <unk> , and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are big moments of <unk> moments . And there are big <unk> moments of <unk> .
I <unk> this picture on the North <unk> of <unk> island , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> , and this man , <unk> me , he <unk> the wonderful story of his <unk> .
The <unk> government didn &apos;t have been <unk> with <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> <unk> for our <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> for his life , <unk> <unk> all the <unk> , and all his <unk> .
You know , you know , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn &apos;t <unk> from night or <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> away , it &apos;s <unk> the <unk> in skin of <unk> and <unk> in your hand . When I did <unk> , he <unk> it <unk> , he <unk> it by creating a <unk> .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> <unk> created a <unk> , has <unk> another dog and it &apos;s <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> of <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> I &apos;m going to talk about <unk> ? &#91; <unk> &#93; And this , in different ways , &#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; <unk> is the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world .
<unk> <unk> <unk> government <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of a larger area of a larger area of <unk> in California and <unk> <unk> together .
It &apos;s their new <unk> . It &apos;s called <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . <unk> all the resources .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , finally , I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> at least <unk> <unk> , <unk> that we &apos;ve been in these <unk> <unk> <unk> of the planet , <unk> that doesn &apos;t be <unk> at all .
For somebody &apos;s home .
<unk> <unk> of human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of these children , like the dreams of these children , become part of the <unk> <unk> of hope .
<unk> , we have <unk> <unk> that <unk> have never <unk> to <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> --
&#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; , but we think that stories can change the world , and perhaps we are the best <unk> to tell stories of the world . Every month our <unk> site . Every month our <unk> site .
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our audience to <unk> our audience in places of <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , the world <unk> of <unk> in a world , and we have to find a <unk> of life in a world and <unk> .
where we <unk> of all <unk> can <unk> our <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I &apos;ve written in this book that I hope you &apos;ve heard about <unk> and <unk> some <unk> , in case , you don &apos;t <unk> them .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> <unk> of what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> : &quot; If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens , &quot; The way to do it is to <unk> the freedom <unk> . &quot;
The reason is , on one side in the fact that the <unk> is <unk> , is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> for human beings .
<unk> is going to be <unk> in the fact that if we &apos;re <unk> , each of us can do what we do with our <unk> , without no one that <unk> in our <unk> , without no one that <unk> in our <unk> .
The way to <unk> the freedom is <unk> choice .
More choices , more <unk> , and more <unk> is their <unk> , and more of the freedom , the <unk> is their <unk> .
This , <unk> , it &apos;s so <unk> <unk> in society that nobody <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And it &apos;s also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made it possible .
This is my <unk> . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m just a simple <unk> on the <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the 12 <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that nobody has already <unk> <unk> in your <unk> .
That &apos;s what the <unk> is .
Then you go to the <unk> store for a <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there &apos;s a big number of <unk> <unk> .
We can make six million and a half million different <unk> of different <unk> <unk> that there are in one store .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice .
<unk> <unk> : the world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the services <unk> <unk> , to <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the phone , not <unk> it .
A <unk> of that , between the other , was that the phone never <unk> .
These days have gone .
We have a <unk> <unk> <unk> , especially between <unk> <unk> .
Here is cell phones of the future .
My <unk> is in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for <unk> <unk> .
If you don &apos;t have seen it in the store , you &apos;re very <unk> <unk> .
And what happens is that people get into the <unk> and they do this question . And you know , what &apos;s the answer ? The answer is &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do things .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> , no longer <unk> in the United States that you have from <unk> and <unk> you to do .
Instead , <unk> from <unk> , and the <unk> says , &quot; Well , we could do it , or <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> these <unk> and these <unk> <unk> . &quot; <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You know , &quot; What do you do you do ? &quot;
And the <unk> says , &quot; At this <unk> and these <unk> , and <unk> has these <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> it has these <unk> and these <unk> . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; <unk> if she was me , what would you say ? &quot;
And the <unk> , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result we call &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> that makes it look like something .
But , actually , it &apos;s not a <unk> <unk> the responsibility and the responsibility to make from somebody who knows something , <unk> the <unk> , to <unk> , to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and so that doesn &apos;t know -- and so in the <unk> <unk> to make decisions .
There &apos;s a huge <unk> of <unk> products , <unk> to people like me and you , that if you think about it , if you think about it , and that we can &apos;t <unk> .
But if we can &apos;t <unk> it , why do we <unk> them ?
The answer is that they want to <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of how fundamental our <unk> is our <unk> <unk> , is a question of choice , as you see in this <unk> , &quot; We don &apos;t want to <unk> kids . We want to <unk> the kids to be right now .
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> .
The one that means that every <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person , you have to decide that kind of person .
<unk> to the family and <unk> , a <unk> time , <unk> almost for anybody , was that you <unk> the <unk> <unk> possible , and they were <unk> to children the <unk> soon possible .
The only real choice was with who , not , and not , and not what to do after .
<unk> , it &apos;s really to play .
<unk> students to very smart , and they <unk> their 20 percent <unk> to work on a time .
And it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less <unk> , not because they &apos;re less <unk> .
But why are I <unk> , I &apos;m <unk> to say , &quot; <unk> <unk> or not ? &quot;
&quot; Do you want to think about the <unk> ? &quot;
I &apos;m <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this <unk> doesn &apos;t <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and not to get a <unk> <unk> at my <unk> .
And they have to really do that . They &apos;re important .
Now , the job : we &apos;re <unk> , as <unk> <unk> , because technology allows us to work every day , from every corner of every day , <unk> from <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> , and I &apos;m not going to tell anybody what the <unk> works .
I &apos;m not saying that , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , this incredible <unk> of choice ? Is it we have to decide , <unk> it in every moment , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son to play <unk> , with the cell phone in a <unk> , the other <unk> , and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , on the <unk> .
And even though they &apos;re all <unk> , every minute that we see our <unk> <unk> , we also <unk> , &quot; Do I have to answer this to called &quot;
&quot; Do I have to answer this <unk> ? &quot;
And when the answer is , &quot; no , this makes the experience of your <unk> &apos;s <unk> of your child in very different conditions .
So , from any <unk> , we look at little , things and large and large and <unk> of life , life is a question of choices .
And once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibilities , but not everything was a <unk> of choice .
The world today of <unk> to this : The <unk> is , &quot; Is it a <unk> thing , or <unk> ? &quot;
The answer is <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> them all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the <unk> .
<unk> this choice two effects of <unk> people on people .
The first one , <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> instead of <unk> .
With a lot of <unk> between which choose , it becomes very difficult to do .
I &apos;ll give you an example of <unk> : a <unk> study on <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of my <unk> has had access to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> society , with about a million <unk> <unk> in different <unk> companies .
What she found out of the <unk> of every 10 solutions that are <unk> in more , the <unk> <unk> <unk> two percent .
With 50 percent <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s 10 percent <unk> <unk> than when they &apos;re just <unk> <unk> . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> between which choose , is <unk> difficult to decide , and choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , and of course <unk> , and of course , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , <unk>
<unk> that doesn &apos;t mean just that these <unk> <unk> <unk> food for <unk> because they don &apos;t want to say that the decision is so <unk> that the decision is so <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of work .
They &apos;re not <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> until five <unk> <unk> <unk> for year from <unk> <unk> of work , that would be <unk> to <unk> .
So <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> choices .
And I think that <unk> the world like this .
&quot; And finally , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? &quot;
You know , it &apos;s going to be the right decision , if it &apos;s for the <unk> , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong <unk> , and you <unk> the wrong wrong wrong .
So this is the first effect . The second effect is that even though we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice , at the end of how we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from how <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And this for several reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of <unk> between the <unk> , if you <unk> one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that we could make a different choice that would be better . And that &apos;s what happens . And that &apos;s what happens is that <unk> <unk> us to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
even when it was a <unk> decision .
More choices there are more easy to <unk> than any <unk> that is <unk> of choice .
<unk> , there &apos;s what <unk> call them <unk> .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well <unk> as the value that we give things to <unk> from what we &apos;re going to do .
You know , when there are many <unk> possible , it &apos;s easy to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m <unk> with all of the ones that are not in New York .
But that &apos;s probably <unk> .
There &apos;s this <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> place of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not <unk> . But what he thinks he &apos;s like , &quot; Well , <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk> . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in front of home . &quot;
And it <unk> two weeks <unk> from the idea that &apos;s <unk> -- every day -- the chance of <unk> where you want .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for that we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And the <unk> are the <unk> that we have <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> us against <unk> .
Here &apos;s another example .
This <unk> us a lot of things .
It &apos;s about living the moment , and perhaps of the <unk> of the <unk> .
But the most important point is that anything you &apos;re <unk> , you &apos;re going to be <unk> to do other .
The things that don &apos;t have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> point : <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a couple of <unk> .
It &apos;s almost always <unk> .
Once the <unk> were of one kind of <unk> them and <unk> them and <unk> <unk> , were <unk> , only after <unk> <unk> a life and <unk> a lot of times , <unk> to go .
So , I started <unk> a couple of when the <unk> were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> said , &quot; Do you want to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
Do you want them to <unk> or with <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Do you want to <unk> them ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> them want to <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- &quot; <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a little bit of a <unk> I was able to say , &quot; I want the guy that was the only kind of , &quot; he had no idea what it was , like , for a <unk> . And I &apos;m <unk> <unk> , and then I <unk> it out of the best couple of <unk> I &apos;ve ever had .
It was <unk> . With all that choice I had to <unk> the best .
But I &apos;m going to <unk> me .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for <unk> .
The reason I was the <unk> that I was <unk> with all that choice , my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I was <unk> <unk> . I didn &apos;t know anything about <unk> when I <unk> it just one like , but when I got a hundred different <unk> , <unk> , at least one kind of had to be perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After I <unk> that I was <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in life of people who don &apos;t do that <unk> the <unk> that these have <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> .
And this is less <unk> , when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of <unk> if it makes it realize .
Because if I <unk> it , I &apos;m not going to try to do it .
The truth <unk> more to this .
&quot; You were better when you were worse , &quot; The reason he was the <unk> when you were worse , when you were <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world we live in -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things to the <unk> of <unk> .
You &apos;ve never <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; Yes , you want to do it . &quot;
I mean -- small <unk> moment -- that I &apos;m really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn &apos;t do it better , I &apos;m not <unk> .
But <unk> it &apos;s not always a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> , when there &apos;s only that kind of <unk> <unk> is that when you &apos;re not <unk> , and I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; Why ? &quot;
Who &apos;s <unk> ? &quot; <unk> , the answer is <unk> .
The world is <unk> . What do I could do it do ?
When there are hundreds of <unk> <unk> , and you <unk> a <unk> , and you &apos;ll be <unk> , and you &apos;ll find who is the <unk> , it &apos;s clear that the <unk> you are .
I could do better .
With hundreds of <unk> <unk> , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people are taking decisions , even if the result is <unk> , they <unk> and they <unk> it to them .
In the last few years , the <unk> <unk> in the world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only one , but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> <unk> is just that people have experiences because the standard are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation think that <unk> is their own .
So the final result is that in general , we &apos;re better , <unk> , but we &apos;ll get worse .
Let me tell you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely <unk> . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than not <unk> , but from this <unk> not that much choice .
There &apos;s a <unk> value , <unk> . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve <unk> from a piece of the level that the choices that the choices <unk> our life .
Now , from <unk> <unk> -- I &apos;m almost finished -- from the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> is the <unk> .
What it allows all of this choice in <unk> society is the <unk> material .
There are many places in the world , and you have <unk> <unk> , where the problem is not that have <unk> choice .
The problem is that they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> I &apos;m talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what it does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> has talked about yesterday about how those <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> of money .
I mean that these choices , <unk> and <unk> , is not just <unk> .
I &apos;m <unk> <unk> .
You have to be worse .
If a little bit of what we have in our <unk> society , <unk> choice , it would be <unk> in those where people have too much chance , it would be <unk> , but our life .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income is good at all -- not just to the poor -- not just the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that we have .
To <unk> , &quot; <unk> , you can become everything you want to --
<unk> , people of culture , <unk> , I said , &quot; What do that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s <unk> that you can &apos;t get into a <unk> of glass . &quot;
&quot; A <unk> imagination , a <unk> <unk> of the world --
and I <unk> it , I <unk> it , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , instead , I realized that the fish know the fish know , the <unk> knows .
Because the reality of <unk> is that if you <unk> in <unk> the <unk> , so that , &quot; everything is possible , &quot; <unk> the <unk> . &quot;
If you <unk> the <unk> in a way that it would be <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
They all need a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , perhaps even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
